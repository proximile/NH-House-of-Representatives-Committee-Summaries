I am opening our executive session on

sv14 and I'm also recessing it one of
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
our members had a uh had an urgent uh
 
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
issue she'll be right back

I'm reopening executive session on House
 
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
Bill excuse me on Senate bill 14.
 
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
and I am making a motion to reconsider
 
00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.189 align:start position:0%
and I am making a motion to reconsider
second

00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:15.899 align:start position:0%
I will speak to my motion
 
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this reconsideration is
 
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
only solely to amend the bill by adding
 
00:16:26.689 --> 00:16:26.699 align:start position:0%
house bills 473
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 473 passed this committee
 
00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:30.779 align:start position:0%
unanimously it would change first time
 
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
possession of a controlled substance to
 
00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:35.459 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor instead of a felony
 
00:16:38.269 --> 00:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
they passed the house floor I believe on
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
a Voice vote it's the position of the
 
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.050 align:start position:0%
a Voice vote it's the position of the
house

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:16:44.329 --> 00:16:44.339 align:start position:0%
the reason I'm advocating for this bill
 
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:46.740 align:start position:0%
is because we have entirely too many
 
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
people at a very young age being turned
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
into felons because of their a mistake
 
00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:55.740 align:start position:0%
at 19 or 20 years old you have a college
 
00:16:58.610 --> 00:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
kid who may have picked up some
 
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
mushrooms at a party
 
00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
and in the middle of his college career
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
is now a felon
 
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
he cannot join the military he cannot
 
00:17:08.929 --> 00:17:08.939 align:start position:0%
vote for a period of time he can never
 
00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:11.579 align:start position:0%
possess a firearm he could never become
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
a fish and game officer
 
00:17:16.429 --> 00:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
he could never become a number of things
 
00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
he'd never qualified for um Federal
 
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:21.900 align:start position:0%
housing I could spend an hour on the
 
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
list of things that we just disqualified
 
00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
that person from because our first
 
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
offense is a felony
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
I believe that in the house believes
 
00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:33.780 align:start position:0%
that uh Second Chance for someone making
 
00:17:36.049 --> 00:17:36.059 align:start position:0%
a mistake like this is an order it gives
 
00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:37.980 align:start position:0%
them a chance to get court ordered help
 
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
and keeps them from being a felon and
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
having the rest of their life ruined
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
that is the reason that I am advocating
 
00:17:48.409 --> 00:17:48.419 align:start position:0%
adding this bill
 
00:17:51.289 --> 00:17:51.299 align:start position:0%
it is my hope that this adding this bill
 
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
the Senate will request a committee of
 
00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:54.780 align:start position:0%
conference where we can at least discuss
 
00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:55.980 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
having said that I believe the
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
importance of sb14 and if it is at the
 
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
end of the day the position that we
 
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
cannot come to a good agreement with the
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
Senate I will a seed to drop in this at
 
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
that time but I do intend to at least
 
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
have the conversation we convinced 400
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
people who represent 1.6 million people
 
00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
that this is the policy the state wants
 
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:20.220 align:start position:0%
and I believe it's worth a conversation
 
00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
with the 25 people in the other body
 
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to a second
 
00:18:27.529 --> 00:18:27.539 align:start position:0%
no thank you Mr chairman you covered it
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:36.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
I think that the uh the merits of HB 473
 
00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:44.820 align:start position:0%
are are unquestioned by uh most of the
 
00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
members on this committee uh and and by
 
00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.310 align:start position:0%
members on this committee uh and and by
myself

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:53.150 align:start position:0%
myself
um

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
the first time we saw this bill
 
00:18:58.970 --> 00:18:58.980 align:start position:0%
um this committee passed at 18-2 and
 
00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
sent it on to the Full House with an
 
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic recommendation
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
the issue isn't our like or or dislike
 
00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:10.860 align:start position:0%
for HB 473 here the issue is whether or
 
00:19:15.409 --> 00:19:15.419 align:start position:0%
not attaching this bill to sb14 uh will
 
00:19:18.409 --> 00:19:18.419 align:start position:0%
hurt the chances of Passage uh for for
 
00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:21.900 align:start position:0%
SB 14 which is a very good bill which
 
00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:24.660 align:start position:0%
many of us have received a lot of emails
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
on over the last few weeks
 
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:28.850 align:start position:0%
on over the last few weeks
um

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:28.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:30.799 align:start position:0%
I looked at the docket
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
for uh for HB 473 and one of the things
 
00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
that I saw was that this was not a 13 to
 
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:41.220 align:start position:0%
11 vote in the Senate it was an 11-6
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
we're not in a situation where we need
 
00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
to convince one or two senators
 
00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
we're in a situation where in order for
 
00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:57.740 align:start position:0%
what would be both bills to pass
 
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
we would need to flip seven votes in the
 
00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.870 align:start position:0%
we would need to flip seven votes in the
Senate

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
um that just seems like an
 
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily uh difficult thing to do
 
00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
at this stage
 
00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
we also have the option of bringing 473
 
00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
back in the next session and I would be
 
00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:18.660 align:start position:0%
the first to say I would be proud to be
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor of this bill in the next
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
session but I I will not support the
 
00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:27.980 align:start position:0%
reconsideration motion
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
because frankly
 
00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
we've already seen one good bill go down
 
00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:36.980 align:start position:0%
in the Senate
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
473. the idea that we could actually see
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
two good bills go down in the Senate as
 
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
part of this process would be a little
 
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
bit too much to take
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
um so uh I'll be voting against the
 
00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
motion for reconsideration and I hope my
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
colleagues will do the same thank you
 
00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
I would um respond to to my colleague by
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
saying I do not believe that the will of
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
the 400 should be somehow thwarted or
 
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
scared by what may happen in the other
 
00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.610 align:start position:0%
scared by what may happen in the other
body

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
body
 
00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
I believe that we should press our our
 
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
position I believe that a committee of
 
00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:25.799 align:start position:0%
conference they are quite capable of
 
00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
saying no again and if we can't get the
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
votes then we see then but to give up at
 
00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:32.700 align:start position:0%
this point on what I think is a very
 
00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
important piece of legislation
 
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
I dare say more important than SB 14
 
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
making felons out of our young people to
 
00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
me seems
 
00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:43.909 align:start position:0%
me seems
um

00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
seems very important frankly I I've
 
00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
I feel odd being the one in argue in
 
00:21:54.169 --> 00:21:54.179 align:start position:0%
this position but so be it I am
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
um with regard to the emails I recall
 
00:21:59.090 --> 00:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
getting literally probably a thousand
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
emails about bail and I stood firm for
 
00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:08.039 align:start position:0%
and it took a lot of heat for it
 
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
um not passing bills from the Senate
 
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
so I would I would expect that a similar
 
00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
courtesy would be paid
 
00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
having said that we will see what
 
00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
happens anyone else wish to discuss Mr
 
00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
uh I will not be supporting this of the
 
00:22:33.409 --> 00:22:33.419 align:start position:0%
reconsideration also
 
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
and the reason is is I think that uh
 
00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
this the the bill that we are the bill
 
00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
that we're going to attach to it
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
it reduced the penalty sum but with the
 
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
conditions of what happened the way it
 
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
had it lost in the Senate
 
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
adding that bill to this good bill that
 
00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:55.740 align:start position:0%
gives the people that have give them
 
00:22:58.850 --> 00:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
rights over their own personal property
 
00:22:58.860 --> 00:22:59.750 align:start position:0%
rights over their own personal property
um

00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
for not to have surveillance cameras put
 
00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:04.380 align:start position:0%
there by anybody at any time
 
00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:06.780 align:start position:0%
is a good bill and I I'm just not going

00:32:33.769 --> 00:32:33.779 align:start position:0%
uh 11 years nine days
 
00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:35.820 align:start position:0%
motion carries
 
00:32:39.529 --> 00:32:39.539 align:start position:0%
bill is amended by about 11-9
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:54.049 --> 00:32:54.059 align:start position:0%
okay so at this point I make a motion
 
00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
to amend
 
00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:05.389 align:start position:0%
 
second

00:33:05.389 --> 00:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
um I don't think we need any further
 
00:33:21.289 --> 00:33:21.299 align:start position:0%
discussion I think we've we all unless
 
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
anybody wishes to make a further comment
 
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
represent scitec this is all repetitive
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
but I want to say it perhaps anyway
 
00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.070 align:start position:0%
but I want to say it perhaps anyway
quickly

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
the chairman is Will undoubtedly be on a
 
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:35.940 align:start position:0%
committee of conference and is prepared
 
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
to jettison got to get close to the
 
00:33:39.889 --> 00:33:39.899 align:start position:0%
microphone it is prepared to jettison
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
this but so that there's no real risk
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
it's under virtually impossible
 
00:33:48.529 --> 00:33:48.539 align:start position:0%
anything's possible that the Senate
 
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
would just get rid of the bill entirely
 
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't I would not go with that
 
00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
I'm going with the idea that uh if they
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
don't exceed to say a misdemeanor a that
 
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
he is willing as uh to to get rid of
 
00:34:07.789 --> 00:34:07.799 align:start position:0%
this part of it and keep sb14 and I
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
that's I know we've we differ but that's
 
00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:12.839 align:start position:0%
I don't know why I'm talking to you but
 
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:15.300 align:start position:0%
anyway all right
 
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:19.980 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
I did want to say that there there has
 
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
been a little bit uh more than the usual
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
degree of animosity over the last few
 
00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
weeks uh between between the house and
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
the Senate so I I think that
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
passing an amendment like this uh is a
 
00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:38.700 align:start position:0%
calculated risk and it does uh put SB 14
 
00:34:40.089 --> 00:34:40.099 align:start position:0%
at risk
 
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
and uh and I think that's a shame
 
00:34:45.369 --> 00:34:45.379 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to really quickly thank
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
you for letting me speak I just wanted
 
00:34:52.609 --> 00:34:52.619 align:start position:0%
to quickly explain my vote of someone
 
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
who is I think voted for more drug
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
legalization bills than anyone in this
 
00:34:59.390 --> 00:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
committee I didn't support this one
 
00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:01.140 align:start position:0%
today not because I don't support the
 
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:03.180 align:start position:0%
bill but because I like representative
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
Muse just said I'm worried about the
 
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
risk that this takes to the game cameras
 
00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
bill I had I think over 15 constituents
 
00:35:11.089 --> 00:35:11.099 align:start position:0%
reach out in Peterborough that was more
 
00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:13.140 align:start position:0%
than any uh had reached out for any
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
other Bill around this bill because they
 
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
had had people putting cameras on their
 
00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
properties they've had problems with
 
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
them being filmed and so I at the risk
 
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
of losing that even if it is a small one
 
00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
I think it might be a little bit bigger
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
than small I I cannot uh in good
 
00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
conscience vote for for the amendment
 
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
which would put this on to the the game
 
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
cameras bill when the game cameras bill
 
00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:35.220 align:start position:0%
is so important to the people in
 
00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.950 align:start position:0%
is so important to the people in
Peterborough

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
Peterborough
 
00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:40.380 align:start position:0%
and and I would um encourage any member
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
obviously to listen to their
 
00:35:44.329 --> 00:35:44.339 align:start position:0%
constituents I would however say that
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
the risk of the Senate killing this with
 
00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:49.740 align:start position:0%
me saying in advance if we cannot come
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
to an agreement I am happy to jettison
 
00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
this bill from 14 the only reason the
 
00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
Senate would kill it and not accede to a
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
five-minute Committee of conference
 
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
would be Spite and I cannot believe in
 
00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
good conscience that our our colleagues
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
on the other side would even contemplate
 
00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:06.900 align:start position:0%
such thing
 
00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
um so that's my response to that I do
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
not in any Universe see them killing it
 
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
especially in advance I
 
00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:17.220 align:start position:0%
um I've heard from Members say that they
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
would take it if we made it misdemeanor
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
a we can do that in a community
 
00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:23.820 align:start position:0%
conference in five minutes and be done
 
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
um I I think that we will all come
 
00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
together as a team I can't imagine them
 
00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
doing such a thing representative scitec
 
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
of course there's what risk is there
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:42.109 --> 00:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
agreed it is indeed their bill and they
 
00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:44.220 align:start position:0%
do want it and
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
having said that see no further oh Mr
 
00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:48.660 align:start position:0%
representative Muse again
 
00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
one last thing I want to make very very
 
00:36:54.349 --> 00:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
clear is what we have here is in a
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
disagreement in policy uh for the most
 
00:36:59.930 --> 00:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
part I think we're on board with sp14 as
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
well as uh HP
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
497. what we have here is a disagreement
 
00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
and strategy
 
00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
um and uh and and hopefully we will come
 
00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:12.599 align:start position:0%
to the correct strategy that will
 
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
actually ensure that sb14 passes thank
 
00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.430 align:start position:0%
actually ensure that sb14 passes thank
you

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
agreed uh I think at the end of the day
 
00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:23.220 align:start position:0%
the main goal is for SB 14 to pass and I
 
00:37:26.089 --> 00:37:26.099 align:start position:0%
will not in any way jeopardize that at a
 
00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
committee of conference but I do at the
 
00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:30.200 align:start position:0%
same time
 
00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
recognize the will of the 400 that sent
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
this bill to the Senate
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the 1.6 million who said we
 
00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:42.180 align:start position:0%
are tired of making our young people in
 
00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
in particularly according to the latest
 
00:37:46.569 --> 00:37:46.579 align:start position:0%
reports I've seen people of color
 
00:37:50.329 --> 00:37:50.339 align:start position:0%
become felons more than anyone else and
 
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
have their lives ruined before they've
 
00:37:53.329 --> 00:37:53.339 align:start position:0%
even started
 
00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
um with that I will ask the clerk to
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
call the roll
 
00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.890 align:start position:0%
call the roll
chairman

00:37:57.890 --> 00:37:57.900 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
I think I agree with the representative
 
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
Muse that there's a
 
00:38:11.569 --> 00:38:11.579 align:start position:0%
the this I don't think it's spite that
 
00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
anybody on this side voted against
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
reconsideration I think that was
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
probably a poor choice of words I wasn't
 
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
talking about us talking about the
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
Senate I said if the Senate were to kill
 
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
it knowing that I already agreed to
 
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
throw this out if they don't like it
 
00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
then I I sincerely apologize for my
 
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
obvious need for a hearing aid
 
00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:36.900 align:start position:0%
no worries
 
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
at the end of this any anyway I agree
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
with him that this is we don't know for
 
00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
sure and I don't I believe this is how
 
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
the system works we don't know for sure
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
that there will be a committee of
 
00:38:50.089 --> 00:38:50.099 align:start position:0%
conference on this bill we don't know
 
00:38:50.099 --> 00:38:51.230 align:start position:0%
conference on this bill we don't know
that

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
so so right now what we have is we have
 
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
a bill that we know is a good bill that
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
passed here and is on consent I believe
 
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
and that we should not be using this
 
00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:05.950 align:start position:0%
and that we should not be using this
bill

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
to attach the other Bill too because I
 
00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:12.300 align:start position:0%
think there is a good probability only
 
00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:16.380 align:start position:0%
if you do the math it lost 18 to six
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
and I doubt that you're going to swa
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
you're gonna get six people devote it so
 
00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
it may go to a committee of conference
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
in a committee of conference and again I
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
am not completely sure how it works I
 
00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
think if you could take this bill off
 
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
and the amended bill that we're sticking
 
00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:37.079 align:start position:0%
on here if we if we can take it off
 
00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
I believe in a committee of conference
 
00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:41.220 align:start position:0%
You could argue for the fact that you
 
00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:44.220 align:start position:0%
ought to put it on that bill and then
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
you'd have something to work with so
 
00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:49.740 align:start position:0%
anyway even with that case
 
00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
um that that's actually impossible
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
because there would be no Committee of
 
00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
conference because we would have just
 
00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
agree to the bill the only time there's
 
00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
a committee is if there's a disagreement
 
00:40:02.569 --> 00:40:02.579 align:start position:0%
in in between the two bills
 
00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
um anyway having said that I think I've
 
00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
made my point clear
 
00:40:10.609 --> 00:40:10.619 align:start position:0%
um and I said oh representative wheeler
 
00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:12.300 align:start position:0%
so I've been mulling this for the last
 
00:40:14.569 --> 00:40:14.579 align:start position:0%
two minutes after I just spoke
 
00:40:14.579 --> 00:40:16.010 align:start position:0%
two minutes after I just spoke
um

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
I voted against reconsideration I stand
 
00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
by that vote because I don't think we
 
00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
should have reconsidered it
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
however now that we're here at the
 
00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.410 align:start position:0%
however now that we're here at the
amendment

00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:26.420 align:start position:0%
piece I feel
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
maybe I should vote for the amendment
 
00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
and I think I think I might I just
 
00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that so it wasn't a
 
00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:35.450 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that so it wasn't a
surprise

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
surprise
 
00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
made Linda laugh that's a good day
 
00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
that's all I care about um so I'm going
 
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
to vote for the amendment because like I
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
agree I agree with you Mr chairman that
 
00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
we do need to address this I think the
 
00:40:46.609 --> 00:40:46.619 align:start position:0%
other legalization bills have gotten to
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
a a point where they won't go any
 
00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
further and we could seriously address
 
00:40:53.089 --> 00:40:53.099 align:start position:0%
this problem by actually passing this
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
this bill and you know if it's going to
 
00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.609 align:start position:0%
this bill and you know if it's going to
be

00:40:57.609 --> 00:40:57.619 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
what if we do what representative Newman
 
00:41:01.849 --> 00:41:01.859 align:start position:0%
just suggested it's essentially amending
 
00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
the bill on a committee of conference so
 
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
why not just do that right now
 
00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to vote for the
 
00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:08.700 align:start position:0%
amendment and to be clear we can't do
 
00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
that in the committee of conference at
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
it because there would be no committee
 
00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
conference there's only a Community
 
00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
Conference if we differ between the
 
00:41:17.569 --> 00:41:17.579 align:start position:0%
bills that gets sent back and forth so
 
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
if this is not amended it just goes
 
00:41:21.609 --> 00:41:21.619 align:start position:0%
forth and the Senate takes and it's done
 
00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes thank you Mr
 
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
chairman I I was going to say this
 
00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
before representative Willer spoke and
 
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
then I I've been going back and forth so
 
00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:32.220 align:start position:0%
what I would really like to say is this
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of bills that that we
 
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
have compromised and and came up with
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
verbiage in this committee that for for
 
00:41:42.589 --> 00:41:42.599 align:start position:0%
one reason another a lot of us really
 
00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:44.700 align:start position:0%
didn't like but we listened to what
 
00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
people were saying and we took a chance
 
00:41:50.569 --> 00:41:50.579 align:start position:0%
to get it out of this committee
 
00:41:50.579 --> 00:41:51.829 align:start position:0%
to get it out of this committee
and

00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:54.109 --> 00:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
this is a perfect example of that 18
 
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
people in this committee voted for this
 
00:41:59.930 --> 00:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
bill because you prefer for 473 my
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
recommendation is take a chance take a
 
00:42:03.119 --> 00:42:04.490 align:start position:0%
recommendation is take a chance take a
chance

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
chance
 
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:05.940 align:start position:0%
and if those are the committee of
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
conference the chairman will do what he
 
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
said he's never ever went back on his
 
00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
word anybody in this committee
 
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
take a chance
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
trust the process
 
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
let's give it a try
 
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:25.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman let's vote
 
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
representative Newman one more time I've
 
00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
okay I just I just had one
 
00:42:36.109 --> 00:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding one thing I'm not clear
 
00:42:36.119 --> 00:42:37.069 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding one thing I'm not clear
about

00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
when we talked about this bill we
 
00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
meaning our conference
 
00:42:44.329 --> 00:42:44.339 align:start position:0%
and that was that my understanding is
 
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
that two bills were held we held the
 
00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:48.660 align:start position:0%
camera game camera bill and the tree
 
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
stand bill
 
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
I don't know why we this isn't attached
 
00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
to the tree stand bill I think if it was
 
00:42:55.609 --> 00:42:55.619 align:start position:0%
attached to the tree stand bill which
 
00:42:58.490 --> 00:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
does not have the significance of this
 
00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:02.220 align:start position:0%
game camera bill it um I would vote for
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
that I would but I think that this the
 
00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
game camera build is so important and I
 
00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:08.940 align:start position:0%
think the outcome would be the same when
 
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
it made to the Senate
 
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
it would kill that bill but it wouldn't
 
00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
be as bad thank you oh wait though um
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
maybe representative Newman is on to
 
00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
something I need to check
 
00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:28.430 align:start position:0%
something I need to check
um

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it was only um it was only
 
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
noted as 14 in the calendar
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
representative Newman have had both been
 
00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
listed for public I could have done that
 
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:39.660 align:start position:0%
but only 14 was in the calendar so I
 
00:43:43.069 --> 00:43:43.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
seeing nothing representative well it's
 
00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:48.900 align:start position:0%
my big chance representative Muse has
 
00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
talked about our disagreeing and
 
00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
strategy and I he's right and I hope
 
00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:56.460 align:start position:0%
that I don't know whether what side will
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
prevail but if if it I hope that we're
 
00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:02.030 align:start position:0%
prevail but if if it I hope that we're
the

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:04.500 align:start position:0%
that the Senate goes along with it I
 
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
hope that this our strategy is correct
 
00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
because here's my point I as you know I
 
00:44:14.329 --> 00:44:14.339 align:start position:0%
say this maybe too often I bail people
 
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
who they're they're caught with some
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
drugs and the police have to charge a
 
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
felony and I'm looking at somebody and
 
00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
it's a sad sack it's not a criminal I
 
00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:25.750 align:start position:0%
it's a sad sack it's not a criminal I
mean

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
yeah of Court breaking the law criminal
 
00:44:30.829 --> 00:44:30.839 align:start position:0%
but it's just not some my heart's not in
 
00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
it but I gotta do it and the sooner we
 
00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
get this to say a Class A uh the the
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
better and
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
I also wanted to add one more Point um
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
the pushback we got from law enforcement
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
or that I heard in the Senate was
 
00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
this is a tool we use we need this tool
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
because we get people to plead to the
 
00:44:56.329 --> 00:44:56.339 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor if they don't have the
 
00:44:58.609 --> 00:44:58.619 align:start position:0%
felony hanging over and frankly I find
 
00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
that reprehensible that's what happens
 
00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:02.700 align:start position:0%
in Washington we charge people in the
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
state with what they have committed not
 
00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:07.140 align:start position:0%
with what something higher so they'll
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
plead guilty to what they committed
 
00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
because it's too risky to fight for
 
00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:13.980 align:start position:0%
their own innocence that I find that
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
whole concept and argument um contrary
 
00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
to to our very system of justice that
 
00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
was founded on the principle that 10
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
guilty men should walk free rather than
 
00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:26.700 align:start position:0%
one innocent man go to jail so that
 
00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
argument I won't even entertain
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler really quickly Mr
 
00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
chairman I want you to get your lawn I
 
00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
just wanted to mention for some of my
 
00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
friends on the other side that the ACLU
 
00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
has mentioned that they do support this
 
00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:38.579 align:start position:0%
amendment so when I was first confronted
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
with the reconsideration vote I was
 
00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
confronted with a I was going to have to
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
vote against the ACLU my first time so I
 
00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:46.140 align:start position:0%
just I the organizations that support
 
00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:48.780 align:start position:0%
the the the bill do say that this is a
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
risk that's worth taking and I think
 
00:45:52.569 --> 00:45:52.579 align:start position:0%
that's uh important to mention
 
00:45:54.829 --> 00:45:54.839 align:start position:0%
I think the point that I'm working with
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
the Asia you should frighten everyone
 
00:45:59.210 --> 00:45:59.220 align:start position:0%
more than that having said that now
 
00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
please call the vote
 
00:46:06.170 --> 00:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor is to adopt
 
00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
um I'll spill 473 and amend it onto
