so that program's been around for well a
 

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.550 align:start position:0%
so that program's been around for well a

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:38.220 align:start position:0%
and in particular that program is
 

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.410 align:start position:0%
and in particular that program is

and<00:11:44.640><c> so</c><00:11:44.880><c> the</c><00:11:45.600><c> they're</c><00:11:46.500><c> expanding</c><00:11:47.279><c> this</c><00:11:47.459><c> and</c>

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:47.940 align:start position:0%
and so the they're expanding this and
 

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.970 align:start position:0%
and so the they're expanding this and
the<00:11:48.240><c> idea</c><00:11:48.540><c> is</c><00:11:48.899><c> to</c>

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
the idea is to
 

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.930 align:start position:0%
the idea is to

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
after five years I think is kind of too
 

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.949 align:start position:0%
after five years I think is kind of too

00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
little too late I think the focus really
 

00:16:48.959 --> 00:16:51.290 align:start position:0%
little too late I think the focus really
should<00:16:49.259><c> be</c><00:16:49.380><c> in</c><00:16:49.800><c> what</c><00:16:49.980><c> we</c><00:16:50.160><c> have</c><00:16:50.279><c> here</c><00:16:50.579><c> is</c><00:16:50.759><c> is</c><00:16:51.060><c> my</c>

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
should be in what we have here is is my

should be in what we have here is is my

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.750 align:start position:0%
so
I<00:17:03.779><c> think</c><00:17:03.899><c> I</c><00:17:04.319><c> probably</c><00:17:04.559><c> in</c><00:17:05.100><c> the</c><00:17:05.220><c> long</c><00:17:05.339><c> run</c><00:17:05.459><c> would</c>

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
I think I probably in the long run would
 

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.750 align:start position:0%
I think I probably in the long run would

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
agree with both of you that this is
 

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.870 align:start position:0%
agree with both of you that this is
there<00:17:09.120><c> these</c><00:17:09.540><c> are</c><00:17:09.600><c> overlapping</c><00:17:10.380><c> efforts</c><00:17:11.160><c> and</c>

00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
there these are overlapping efforts and
 

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.210 align:start position:0%
there these are overlapping efforts and
the<00:17:12.240><c> actual</c><00:17:12.540><c> bill</c><00:17:12.839><c> was</c><00:17:13.319><c> a</c><00:17:13.620><c> rather</c><00:17:13.980><c> small</c>

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:14.220 align:start position:0%
the actual bill was a rather small
 

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.390 align:start position:0%
the actual bill was a rather small

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
about so I don't think so I I know he
 

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.669 align:start position:0%
about so I don't think so I I know he
doesn't<00:23:06.240><c> have</c><00:23:06.539><c> any</c><00:23:06.659><c> expectation</c><00:23:07.200><c> of</c><00:23:07.500><c> this</c>

00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any expectation of this
 

00:23:07.679 --> 00:23:10.610 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any expectation of this
moving<00:23:08.100><c> forward</c><00:23:08.360><c> and</c><00:23:09.360><c> I</c><00:23:09.840><c> guess</c><00:23:09.960><c> I</c><00:23:10.260><c> just</c><00:23:10.380><c> wonder</c>

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
moving forward and I guess I just wonder
 

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.770 align:start position:0%
moving forward and I guess I just wonder
if<00:23:11.340><c> we</c>

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
if we
 

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:15.289 align:start position:0%
if we
we<00:23:13.320><c> have</c><00:23:13.500><c> to</c><00:23:13.620><c> take</c><00:23:13.799><c> a</c><00:23:14.039><c> vote</c><00:23:14.280><c> on</c><00:23:14.460><c> this</c><00:23:14.640><c> I</c><00:23:14.880><c> assume</c>

00:23:15.289 --> 00:23:15.299 align:start position:0%
we have to take a vote on this I assume
 

00:23:15.299 --> 00:23:19.310 align:start position:0%
we have to take a vote on this I assume
so<00:23:15.659><c> if</c><00:23:16.260><c> we</c><00:23:16.500><c> were</c><00:23:16.740><c> to</c><00:23:16.919><c> itl</c><00:23:17.760><c> it</c><00:23:18.059><c> is</c><00:23:18.840><c> there</c><00:23:19.020><c> some</c>

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
so if we were to itl it is there some
 

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.649 align:start position:0%
so if we were to itl it is there some
mechanism

00:23:20.649 --> 00:23:20.659 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 

00:23:20.659 --> 00:23:23.750 align:start position:0%
mechanism
by<00:23:21.659><c> which</c><00:23:22.200><c> we</c><00:23:22.559><c> could</c>

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
by which we could
