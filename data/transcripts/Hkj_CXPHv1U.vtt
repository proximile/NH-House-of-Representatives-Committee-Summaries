foreign

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
that bill couldn't make it in but um we
 
00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 align:start position:0%
can proceed
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
that you know we have enough people to
 
00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
I mean this is uh this is a incredible
 
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
amount of research and very greatly
 
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
appreciated I'm wondering Mr chair
 
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 align:start position:0%
um if by the representative Madam chair
 
00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.610 align:start position:0%
um if by the representative Madam chair
ah

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:58.620 align:start position:0%
ah
 
00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:02.819 align:start position:0%
bad habits um I'm wondering if um you
 
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
know either representative Shapiro or Ms
 
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
Dyer could maybe go through some of the
 
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
details of it
 
00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
um and how it applies and how it applies
 
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:14.220 align:start position:0%
to retention which was the concern of
 
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
well we retained it okay
 
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:23.220 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to figure out no sorry
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
Workforce retention oh
 
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
I was just gonna mention you know just
 
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
reading through I mean
 
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
um on page three and Christina can walk
 
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:42.830 align:start position:0%
us through probably
 
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:51.350 align:start position:0%
us through probably
[Music]

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
looks like retention begins kind of on
 
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
page three
 
00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
um of the plan
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
um just page three of the whole
 
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
oh I see so of the um right after
 
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
um it just talks about
 
00:08:19.869 --> 00:08:19.879 align:start position:0%
providers report high levels of stress
 
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:21.780 align:start position:0%
adverse effects on Mental Health
 
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
insufficient educational opportunities
 
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
threatening the quality of care and lots
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
of staff to higher paying jobs that do
 
00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
not require post-secondary degree
 
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
certifications or further education
 
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.670 align:start position:0%
certifications or further education
um

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
and that and and just walking back a
 
00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:37.979 align:start position:0%
little bit it just talks about how
 
00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
that's also limiting the number of you
 
00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:41.099 align:start position:0%
know children that they can take on of
 
00:08:41.099 --> 00:08:42.529 align:start position:0%
know children that they can take on of
course

00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:42.539 align:start position:0%
course
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
um but that's so that's the only point
 
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
on that that I've seen so far but I'm
 
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
that particular area that you're
 
00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:57.300 align:start position:0%
referring to came out of Senate Bill 446
 
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
uh so this was in 2022 and then they
 
00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
created the
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
um the strengthening plan
 
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:07.860 align:start position:0%
and they've received different types of
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
funding to move forward with initiating
 
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:17.220 align:start position:0%
in specifically the retention piece
 
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:20.700 align:start position:0%
if you look at the chart that is on page
 
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.370 align:start position:0%
if you look at the chart that is on page
three

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.389 align:start position:0%
three
um

00:09:23.389 --> 00:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
the program initiative is the second one
 
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.449 align:start position:0%
the program initiative is the second one
down

00:09:26.449 --> 00:09:26.459 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
and they've contracted with public
 
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
Consulting Group
 
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
and the purpose is right there a pilot
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
program to study and assess effective
 
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
strategies for staff Recruitment and
 
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.230 align:start position:0%
strategies for staff Recruitment and
Retention

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
Retention
 
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.190 align:start position:0%
Retention
um

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
and it just gives a high level overview
 
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:44.940 align:start position:0%
if if you're interested I can also
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
forward you the RFP so you get a greater
 
00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:50.519 align:start position:0%
idea of what the contract looks like
 
00:09:51.889 --> 00:09:51.899 align:start position:0%
um but they're really in the beginning
 
00:09:51.899 --> 00:09:53.810 align:start position:0%
um but they're really in the beginning
stages

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:53.820 align:start position:0%
stages
 
00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:56.339 align:start position:0%
I would also say the other thing that
 
00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
makes this sort of complicated
 
00:09:59.040 --> 00:09:59.630 align:start position:0%
makes this sort of complicated
um

00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:02.700 align:start position:0%
is if you go to the very bottom of the
 
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
program initiative where it says Granite
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
steps for Quality that was the separate
 
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
memo that I sent you which I provided to
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
the special committee on Child Care
 
00:10:13.009 --> 00:10:13.019 align:start position:0%
where's that again that's the granite
 
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
steps for Quality yeah in the packet
 
00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:19.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
yeah the program initiative at the very
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
last option which would be page four
 
00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:29.339 align:start position:0%
is the granite steps for quality and
 
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
that is something that's been in the
 
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
works for some time I don't know if
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with the
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh it was licensed plus and licensed and
 
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
those are their credentialing to allow
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
providers to get assistance federal
 
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.910 align:start position:0%
providers to get assistance federal
dollars

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
it's on the the very last it's on page
 
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
four at the bottom of the program
 
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
initiative page four of the uh chart the
 
00:10:58.850 --> 00:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
chart well it is technically page four
 
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
of the packet
 
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
where it says SB 170fn no that's before
 
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
that oh so I put a chart in here to put
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
down some of the more
 
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
um the program initiatives and that
 
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
one's own it's a front and back we don't
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
see that you see it oh here it is it's
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
at the beginning so go to the beginning
 
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
it's just the back of
 
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
the second page see it at the bottom
 
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
okay oh Granite special quality okay
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
so that program's been around for well a
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
long time it just has a different name
 
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:38.220 align:start position:0%
and in particular that program is
 
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
addressing using funds to improve
 
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.970 align:start position:0%
addressing using funds to improve
quality

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
quality
 
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:47.940 align:start position:0%
and so the they're expanding this and
 
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
the idea is to
 
00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
provide incentive to Providers to access
 
00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
quality which is a different bucket so
 
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
to speak so yeah go ahead so I I was
 
00:12:03.769 --> 00:12:03.779 align:start position:0%
talking to representative Barry uh Barry
 
00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:07.140 align:start position:0%
about the committee on child care and he
 
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
was saying that I'm wondering if this is
 
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:11.700 align:start position:0%
what he was talking about so there are
 
00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
continuing education scholarships is
 
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
that what this would be for like for
 
00:12:18.769 --> 00:12:18.779 align:start position:0%
staff that they have
 
00:12:18.779 --> 00:12:19.550 align:start position:0%
staff that they have
um

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
you know for the professionals to go and
 
00:12:25.009 --> 00:12:25.019 align:start position:0%
just you know keep yes that is enrolled
 
00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
but the thing with this particular
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
program is that you have to be enrolled
 
00:12:31.009 --> 00:12:31.019 align:start position:0%
in in graded steps for equality and it's
 
00:12:31.019 --> 00:12:32.210 align:start position:0%
in in graded steps for equality and it's
not

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:32.220 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:12:35.449 --> 00:12:35.459 align:start position:0%
um it's not required it is optional but
 
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
it is provided but on the other hand
 
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
I believe that the child care Bureau
 
00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
also has to make this accessible in
 
00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:48.779 align:start position:0%
other ways so I don't think I think it's
 
00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
concurrent okay uh so the availability
 
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
is required
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether they're enrolled
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
in this program or not so the intention
 
00:13:01.009 --> 00:13:01.019 align:start position:0%
of this program
 
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
is it to improve the overall quality or
 
00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
does it because it says capacity
 
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
building project so so does it have uh
 
00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
you know a building and a Workforce
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
retention component to it or is it just
 
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
basically focusing on quality control
 
00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:20.700 align:start position:0%
within the system
 
00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
so I would say just because I'm not
 
00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
really able to testify or give any sort
 
00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
of analysis just based on my position as
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
a non-partisan researcher but I do have
 
00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:31.019 align:start position:0%
people who could come in and speak with
 
00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
you if you wanted to because I I know
 
00:13:35.329 --> 00:13:35.339 align:start position:0%
several people that have been working
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
with special committee on Child Care
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
could answer those questions I'm just in
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
my current role I'm not able to do that
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
um could I ask you to clarify something
 
00:13:52.129 --> 00:13:52.139 align:start position:0%
else if you can do that without
 
00:13:52.139 --> 00:13:54.050 align:start position:0%
else if you can do that without
um

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
being four or against
 
00:13:59.810 --> 00:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
the next page which is labeled number
 
00:14:07.009 --> 00:14:07.019 align:start position:0%
two but it's the third page of charts on
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
the bottom it says it I guess it refers
 
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
to a statute 79 534
 
00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
and that says it talks about a 15
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
million dollar appropriation
 
00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
for child care programs I think it does
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
maybe you can tell me if I'm right or
 
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.030 align:start position:0%
maybe you can tell me if I'm right or
wrong

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.350 align:start position:0%
wrong
um

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of financing Recruitment
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
and Retention bonus and benefit grants
 
00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire Child Care employers
 
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.009 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire Child Care employers
is

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:37.019 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:40.019 align:start position:0%
is that what is what it what it says is
 
00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
that actually what a ship is and is that
 
00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:44.699 align:start position:0%
have an overlap with the bill that we're
 
00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
considering because the bill that we're
 
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:49.740 align:start position:0%
considering was specifically about
 
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
um retention and recruitment
 
00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.009 align:start position:0%
um retention and recruitment
um

00:14:54.009 --> 00:14:54.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
subsidies so I can't answer that
 
00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
question I can tell you that this was in
 
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:01.740 align:start position:0%
hb2 and I might direct you to
 
00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:02.930 align:start position:0%
hb2 and I might direct you to
um

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:02.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
that was my question the DHHS status
 
00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.410 align:start position:0%
that was my question the DHHS status
report

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
which may be helpful but otherwise I
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
that that's not I can't comment on that
 
00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.750 align:start position:0%
that that's not I can't comment on that
okay

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.610 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
we've budgeted money for this exact
 
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
thing that this bill is for
 
00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:27.980 align:start position:0%
um it went through in the budget
 
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
and there's substantial millions of
 
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:34.980 align:start position:0%
dollars of federal relief that's gone to
 
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
Providers 87 percent was to the
 
00:15:40.129 --> 00:15:40.139 align:start position:0%
providers it's we've received 142
 
00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:41.930 align:start position:0%
providers it's we've received 142
million

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:15:44.689 --> 00:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
43 000.
 
00:15:44.699 --> 00:15:46.189 align:start position:0%
43 000.
um

00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
since the since 2020 it seems so
 
00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:50.810 align:start position:0%
since the since 2020 it seems so
um

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
I think if we
 
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:54.839 align:start position:0%
I don't think I don't see this bill as
 
00:15:56.329 --> 00:15:56.339 align:start position:0%
necessary with all the other things
 
00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
going on and all these other
 
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:05.639 --> 00:16:07.129 align:start position:0%
 
personally

00:16:07.129 --> 00:16:07.139 align:start position:0%
personally
 
00:16:07.139 --> 00:16:08.990 align:start position:0%
personally
bye

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
bye
 
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
I I tend to con concur um
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
the this this is a staggering amount of
 
00:16:19.129 --> 00:16:19.139 align:start position:0%
research and it's very eye-opening and I
 
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
think you know speaks to the the
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
seriousness with which the issue was
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
already being taken and there's
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
substantial legislation and big chunks
 
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
of hb2 and lots of federal dollars being
 
00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:35.579 align:start position:0%
committed so I think you know the the
 
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
legislation that we had in 566 which is
 
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
looking at I thought there was a one
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar sign-on bonus and a
 
00:16:44.449 --> 00:16:44.459 align:start position:0%
three thousand dollar retention bonus
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
after five years I think is kind of too
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
little too late I think the focus really
 
00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
should be in what we have here is is my
 
00:16:51.300 --> 00:17:00.110 align:start position:0%
should be in what we have here is is my
thought

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
I think I probably in the long run would
 
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
agree with both of you that this is
 
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
there these are overlapping efforts and
 
00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:14.220 align:start position:0%
the actual bill was a rather small
 
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
effort compared to the amounts of money
 
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:19.799 align:start position:0%
and all the different things that are
 
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
being proposed
 
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
I guess it's hard for me to know that
 
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
for sure because
 
00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:28.549 align:start position:0%
for sure because
um

00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
this is kind of outside of my wheelhouse
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
and so like looking at all this stuff
 
00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
and trying to absorb it is new for me
 
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:44.220 align:start position:0%
um is the bill that we were cons we're
 
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
here to consider today an ongoing you
 
00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
know would would provide ongoing relief
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
and are all these efforts Federal monies
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
that will go away after the after the
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
um expect you know expenditure of covid
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
funds so that's one question
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
and the other question is
 
00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:12.299 align:start position:0%
um how much of these funds are going to
 
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
pay Consultants to develop a plan versus
 
00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:17.700 align:start position:0%
actually going to the daycare providers
 
00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
to provide bonuses for retention and
 
00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.430 align:start position:0%
to provide bonuses for retention and
recruitment

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
recruitment
 
00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.110 align:start position:0%
recruitment
um

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:26.039 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying I'm not saying that that
 
00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:28.860 align:start position:0%
means that we should pass this bill I'm
 
00:18:30.289 --> 00:18:30.299 align:start position:0%
just saying I don't really fully
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
understand those issues
 
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.250 align:start position:0%
understand those issues
um

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:38.039 align:start position:0%
so for example just give you one example
 
00:18:38.039 --> 00:18:41.930 align:start position:0%
so for example just give you one example
um

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.169 --> 00:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
you know the the thing that um Miss Dyer
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
talked about initially Child Care
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
Workforce Recruitment and Retention on
 
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
the first page
 
00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.470 align:start position:0%
the first page
um

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
the contract there is public Consulting
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
Group whoever they are and they're going
 
00:18:57.289 --> 00:18:57.299 align:start position:0%
to get
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
one and a half million dollars over two
 
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
you know kind of to develop a pilot
 
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
project so that's different than money
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
actually go into the daycare providers
 
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
to provide bonuses and um for
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention right now
 
00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
so I'm not really disagreeing with you
 
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
I'm saying I can't understand all the
 
00:19:24.529 --> 00:19:24.539 align:start position:0%
complexity of it enough to know that
 
00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:27.900 align:start position:0%
that there's something else in here that
 
00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
says concrete as the bill we're
 
00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.650 align:start position:0%
says concrete as the bill we're
considering

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
considering
 
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
does that make an
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if I'm being artificial
 
00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
no I understand your concerns perfectly
 
00:19:39.049 --> 00:19:39.059 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I I understand that channel
 
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
and and I agree with you on that point
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
there's a study going on but the very
 
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.650 align:start position:0%
there's a study going on but the very
next

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:44.660 align:start position:0%
next
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
part of this chart is actually talking
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
about uh 1.5 million dollars
 
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
um being
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
allocate over two years to support our
 
00:20:00.049 --> 00:20:00.059 align:start position:0%
providers and partners
 
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
through the granite United Way
 
00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.570 align:start position:0%
through the granite United Way
um

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:09.500 align:start position:0%
I so there is money beings
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
given to Providers to help them in the
 
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
in the process of
 
00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:18.020 align:start position:0%
having been working for a Community
 
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
Partners organization that provided
 
00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
daycare as well as
 
00:20:27.169 --> 00:20:27.179 align:start position:0%
Head Start services and knowing they had
 
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
challenges trying to find Qualified
 
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
people like all education
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
having having money available through
 
00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
some source to start off with I think is
 
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
a good thing and it's it's not
 
00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:43.559 align:start position:0%
necessarily coming from the taxpayers
 
00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:46.100 align:start position:0%
it's coming from another source
 
00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
and I think the study work that needs to
 
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
be done is it will help us long term
 
00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
determine what money needs to come from
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
the state to help support those
 
00:20:59.210 --> 00:20:59.220 align:start position:0%
organizations to make sure they can
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
continue their work because that's the
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
challenge is is really um and
 
00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:06.380 align:start position:0%
part of it is is
 
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
I know those organizations were
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
decimated with the covet activities and
 
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
trying to rebuild has been a long slow
 
00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:17.460 align:start position:0%
road so having these and having an
 
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
incentive it's now with money that is
 
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
available uh and then what can we do for
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
the future uh is is important
 
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
um yeah and I'm sorry but I would just
 
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799 align:start position:0%
say having shared a couple of
 
00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:33.900 align:start position:0%
subcommittees when I came into this
 
00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I expected to see
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
stakeholders here because every time
 
00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
I've chaired a subcommittee and thank
 
00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
you madam chair for recognizing me but
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
every time I've chaired a subcommittee
 
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
it's been full of stakeholders whether
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
it was on pfas or the Human Rights
 
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
Commission the fact that nobody is here
 
00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
um from and it was it was just full of
 
00:21:59.210 --> 00:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
stakeholders tells me that that it
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
implies to me that those concerns have
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
been addressed before I would want to go
 
00:22:06.169 --> 00:22:06.179 align:start position:0%
forward with this I would at the very
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
least want to hear from them to say
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
where they see those remaining gaps
 
00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
quite honestly the fact that this is an
 
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
empty room tells me that a lot has been
 
00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
done to to address their concerns thank
 
00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:22.460 align:start position:0%
you madam chair Joe
 
00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.330 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
I would tend to agree with you and um
 
00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
and even more so I spoke to those Prime
 
00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:35.820 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill who pretty much
 
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
said what you said he said well you know
 
00:22:40.669 --> 00:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
also without understanding all the
 
00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
details of all the stuff he just said
 
00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.430 align:start position:0%
details of all the stuff he just said
um

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:48.529 --> 00:22:48.539 align:start position:0%
representative germano said that well I
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
just assumed that that's not going to go
 
00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
any further because
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
um there's been so much done that's so
 
00:22:58.250 --> 00:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
much bigger and so much more significant
 
00:23:00.529 --> 00:23:00.539 align:start position:0%
in the amounts of money
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
um than what my bill initially talked
 
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
about so I don't think so I I know he
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any expectation of this
 
00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
moving forward and I guess I just wonder
 
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
if we
 
00:23:15.289 --> 00:23:15.299 align:start position:0%
we have to take a vote on this I assume
 
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
so if we were to itl it is there some
 
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.649 align:start position:0%
so if we were to itl it is there some
mechanism

00:23:20.649 --> 00:23:20.659 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
by which we could
 
00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:26.039 align:start position:0%
um formal or informal that we could pass
 
00:23:26.039 --> 00:23:27.770 align:start position:0%
um formal or informal that we could pass
along

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
along
 
00:23:30.649 --> 00:23:30.659 align:start position:0%
um our thoughts to the
 
00:23:30.659 --> 00:23:32.029 align:start position:0%
um our thoughts to the
um

00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:32.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
to the special committee on daycare that
 
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
um all the efforts currently being
 
00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:40.860 align:start position:0%
brought forth are difficult to
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
understand and it is important for us
 
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
well it's important for me that
 
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.029 align:start position:0%
well it's important for me that
um

00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:50.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
that among all the money going for
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
planning and one-time monies that there
 
00:24:00.169 --> 00:24:00.179 align:start position:0%
is um that we support an ongoing effort
 
00:24:00.179 --> 00:24:01.250 align:start position:0%
is um that we support an ongoing effort
to

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:01.789 align:start position:0%
to
um

00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
create a program to support retention
 
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
and recruitment
 
00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
um you know a concrete program not one
 
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
that's paying Consultants to um come up
 
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
with a plan so you know I I would be
 
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:14.940 align:start position:0%
okay with
 
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
um whatever we would do itl I guess this
 
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
recommend ideal as long as we were able
 
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:23.940 align:start position:0%
to pass that along to that special
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
committee that this is an important
 
00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:30.260 align:start position:0%
issue to us and it's it's hard to know
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
to what degree it's concretely being
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.310 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:43.559 align:start position:0%
I think at this moment I could look for
 
00:24:43.559 --> 00:24:47.230 align:start position:0%
I think at this moment I could look for
emotion

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:50.820 align:start position:0%
Madam chair just it's been a while so do
 
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
we do we take a vote here or do we take
 
00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:00.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
okay so and that would just be a
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
subcommittee recommendation and then
 
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
yeah the way I understand it is we we
 
00:25:09.289 --> 00:25:09.299 align:start position:0%
would vote on based on what the
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
knowledge that we have read and and
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
considered we can take emotion and then
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
and whatever we decide to do that
 
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:20.460 align:start position:0%
information will be passed on to the
 
00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.990 align:start position:0%
information will be passed on to the
committee

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:29.279 --> 00:25:31.190 align:start position:0%
 
second

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll second that okay all in favor
 
00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.610 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll second that okay all in favor
aye

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
aye
 
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
thank you long um before we close
 
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
um just like on the I just want to speak
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
a little bit to this there is yeah
 
00:25:48.049 --> 00:25:48.059 align:start position:0%
um there are some concrete initiatives
 
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:51.900 align:start position:0%
in here and your concern was longevity
 
00:25:54.049 --> 00:25:54.059 align:start position:0%
um and it looks I just wanted to point
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
out that it looks like there is
 
00:25:58.850 --> 00:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
um they're looking at this long term and
 
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
there's three phases to this
 
00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
um the arpa plan
 
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
um and they're just starting phase three
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
and that's all about long-term long-term
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
stabilization so
 
00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
we can feel a little better about our
 
00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:15.049 align:start position:0%
we can feel a little better about our
vote

00:26:15.049 --> 00:26:15.059 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
that there are significant Investments
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
going into this
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
I would agree
 
00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:25.740 align:start position:0%
um I'm just going to pass along I'm
 
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
going to put a comment on this that we
 
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that the
 
00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:32.820 align:start position:0%
Child Care committee that's monitoring
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
this stuff needs to continue to Monitor
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
and if we need to enact legislation at a
 
00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:40.100 align:start position:0%
future Point
 
00:26:42.669 --> 00:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
that's something that we can bring back
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
with that I think we're closed and we'll
 
00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
have resolved to this I would just like
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
to thank
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
um Miss dyer for doing all this work and
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
um while we might not fully understand
 
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
it um at least we had it to to try to
 
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
understand it and to understand it in
 
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
the future
 
00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
and it's something that we can bring
 
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
back to the full committee as well yes
 
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate your work
 
00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:17.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate all of you for
 
00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:23.220 align:start position:0%
providing your your input as well on it
 
00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
I think it's it's a good thing we've
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
done here and we can pass this along and
 
00:27:30.169 --> 00:27:30.179 align:start position:0%
know that we've addressed the concerns
 
00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:32.700 align:start position:0%
that the committee had raised thank you
 
00:27:42.169 --> 00:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:45.500 align:start position:0%
that's one little things
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
that gives me shortest
 
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
retaining build subcommittee I you know
 
00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
questions give them the given that this
 
00:27:57.409 --> 00:27:57.419 align:start position:0%
was for the most part a foregone
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
conclusion was there is there is there
 
00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:01.140 align:start position:0%
any way that we could have done this
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
without actually I mean that if we had
 
00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:09.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
so we have a need to do this even though
 
00:28:15.049 --> 00:28:15.059 align:start position:0%
even if we all felt the same way before
 
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
we got here yeah but we don't have to
 
00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:19.799 align:start position:0%
meet again and again no that's right and
 
00:28:21.529 --> 00:28:21.539 align:start position:0%
you know even if you didn't agree you
 
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
could have met
 
00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
still good to bring the conversation and
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
the rationale into why we feel
 
00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:37.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
on a previous committee
 
00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
there's only two of us so we couldn't do
 
00:28:59.690 --> 00:28:59.700 align:start position:0%
much of anything but um
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
Christina was was with us and she made
 
00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
Christina was was with us and she made
made
