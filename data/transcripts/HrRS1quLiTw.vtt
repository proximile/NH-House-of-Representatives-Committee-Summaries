abortions
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
defies medical standards which the
 
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
legislature is not qualified to do
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
they are unnecessary and they will
 
00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.270 align:start position:0%
they are unnecessary and they will
contribute

00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
contribute
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
to higher medical spending and likely
 
00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%

gynecologists
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
have stated that routine ultrasounds are
 
00:45:18.069 --> 00:45:18.079 align:start position:0%
not considered medically necessary
 
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
as a component of first trimester
 
00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.069 align:start position:0%
as a component of first trimester

examination
 
00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
is not necessary before medication
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
abortion and madam chair i believe that
 
00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:51.829 align:start position:0%
abortion and madam chair i believe that
forcing

00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
forcing
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
patients to have an ultrasound before
 
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
even a first trimester abortion is
 
00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.309 align:start position:0%
even a first trimester abortion is
shaming

00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
shaming
 
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
and it's an unnecessary barrier to care
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
it will most impact our low-income
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
residents who already face
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
burdens this will require them to travel
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
and to pay for the additional cost of
 
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
the procedure
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
and ultrasound can be quite expensive
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
and i believe we should be giving
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
doctors the flexibility to use their
 
00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:23.430 align:start position:0%
doctors the flexibility to use their
expertise

00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
expertise
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
and their judgment that qualifies them
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
for a license to practice
 
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
medicine in new hampshire rather than
 
00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:31.910 align:start position:0%
medicine in new hampshire rather than
substituting

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
substituting
 
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
our own unqualified medical judgment
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
resulting in unnecessary expensive
 
00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.550 align:start position:0%
resulting in unnecessary expensive
services

00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
i see this as an insurance mandate as
 
00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:44.230 align:start position:0%
i see this as an insurance mandate as
well

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
and i think it will likely contribute to
 
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
increasing cost of private health
 
00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.349 align:start position:0%
increasing cost of private health
insurance

00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
construction equipment working outside
 
00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
we've asked them to try to either not
 
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
work or
 
00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:15.200 align:start position:0%

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:15.990 align:start position:0%
take a break long lunch something but in
case

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%

close as you can so everybody
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
in the back of the room can hear because
 
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
i think it's more back there and it
 
00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
impacts their ability
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%

amendment before us 2012 s
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
is the elimination of most of the
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
language in the
 
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
in the paragraph that we're looking at
 
00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
on page 24.

the first
 
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
sentence and strikes the rest of that
 
00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:52.470 align:start position:0%
sentence and strikes the rest of that
paragraph

00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
in i thank you i just wanted to make
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%

thank you if i am correct senator could
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
i ask
 
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
this was a senate added section
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
that the house did not have is that
 
00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:07.510 align:start position:0%
that the house did not have is that
correct

00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
correct okay representative edwards do
 
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you madam chair i do
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh as as i understand the history
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
of uh requiring ultrasounds
 
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
before an abortion it's been primarily
 
00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:26.549 align:start position:0%
before an abortion it's been primarily
about

00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
providing the mother an opportunity to
 
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
really provide informed consent that the
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
ultrasound images
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh can be useful but for that
 
00:48:41.589 --> 00:48:41.599 align:start position:0%
mother to uh connect to the baby that's
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
inside of her
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
so that she's better able to make a
 
00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
decision about whether or not she wants
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
to go forward with the procedure
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
that that's my understanding of the
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
history could you could you speak to
 
00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:52.069 align:start position:0%
history could you could you speak to
that

00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
well it's not the medical standard
 
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
non-medical people
 
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
but i think the result of
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
that is to imply that women are not
 
00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:16.230 align:start position:0%
that is to imply that women are not
capable

00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
capable
 
00:49:19.829 --> 00:49:19.839 align:start position:0%
of making decisions about their own
 
00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:24.079 align:start position:0%
families bodies economic security and
 
00:49:24.079 --> 00:49:25.109 align:start position:0%
families bodies economic security and
future

00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
without intervention that's not
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
considered medically
 
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.470 align:start position:0%
considered medically
necessary

00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up uh yes i just want to point
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
out that i've not
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
implied that women are not capable of
 
00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:41.839 align:start position:0%
making these medical decisions i ask you
 
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
a question about the history and i just
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
want to be
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
clear that i i think women are fully
 
00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.630 align:start position:0%
clear that i i think women are fully
capable

00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
capable
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:59.790 --> 00:49:59.800 align:start position:0%

comes this is like many of my
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
suggestions for the budget they just
 
00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:32.079 align:start position:0%
don't go anywhere
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
especially the one that gets me a new
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
car or something
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
we had a fairly exhaustive but not
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
totally exhaustive
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's a new new center discussion
 
00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
we had a couple of ideas
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
for an amendment we may have had two
 
00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:56.630 align:start position:0%
for an amendment we may have had two
amendments

00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
00:50:58.950 --> 00:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh one of them incorporated something
 
00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
that represented walner
 
00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
thought she wanted to go ahead with
 
00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
which i said i would put in my name
 
00:51:05.589 --> 00:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
which was fine
 
00:51:07.589 --> 00:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
she has decided not to go ahead with
 
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
that amendment
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
so do we have an amendment on the sununu
 
00:51:13.109 --> 00:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
center that we can bring forward at this
 
00:51:13.119 --> 00:51:16.390 align:start position:0%
center that we can bring forward at this
time

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not yet okay
 
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
so not yet do we have an amendment
 
00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:26.720 align:start position:0%
on that wonderful dedicated fund that we
 
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
were allowed to put a dollar in
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
and it could grow no more than a maximum
 
00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
of a dollar
 
00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:35.839 align:start position:0%
yes 1995 h has is an amendment we'll
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
hand out now
 
00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
and that has to do with the cobin 19
 
00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:40.309 align:start position:0%
and that has to do with the cobin 19
micro

00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
micro
 
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:43.200 align:start position:0%

00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
at this time senator gary daniels is
 
00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
join us at the table senator gary
 
00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:58.390 align:start position:0%

is the chairman of senate finance
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
he's done a wonderful job getting us
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
where we are today
 
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
he's been with us every day he has been
 
00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
an alternate
 
00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
and he is now joining us at the table
 
00:52:14.309 --> 00:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
and gary we thank you for all the work
 
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
you and your team did and
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
i think mr hoffman because there are a
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
couple of changes in here
 
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
can walk us through this section after
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
he's passed out the amendments
 
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
so if you're at home we are looking at
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
and this replaces section 452
 
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
can you hear me okay yes it's on page
 
00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
349 if you're looking at the big
 
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
books yes mr hoffman we can
 
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
no yes so for the micro enterprise
 
00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
relief fund
 
00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
um 348. on the top of 348 there's no
 
00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
change to section 451.
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
is changed by removing the one dollar
 
00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:21.510 align:start position:0%
is changed by removing the one dollar
amount

00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
amount
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
then on the next row you'll read public
 
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
health emergency
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
shall be deposited into the fund that's
 
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
been changed to maybe
 
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
deposited into the fund
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
and then the row below it that says
 
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
provided that
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
at no time shall the balance of the fund
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
exceed a dollar that is removed
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
and in roman numeral two you'll see up
 
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:53.349 --> 00:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
then if we go all the way to roman
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
numeral four
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
you'll see a reference up to a dollar
 
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
that is removed
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
there's no change to 453
 
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
on the bottom of 350 there's no change
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
to 454
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
or 455 or 456.
 
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
section 457 which starts on the bottom
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
of 352
 
00:54:23.829 --> 00:54:23.839 align:start position:0%
toward the bottom third row up that one
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
dollar amount is removed
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm popping back and forth
 
00:54:30.069 --> 00:54:30.079 align:start position:0%
between the side by side and the
 
00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
amendment here
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
and then there's another shell that's
 
00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
changed to
 
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
may be deposited in the fund the reason
 
00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:38.559 align:start position:0%
for that is
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
the way that's worded uh notwithstanding
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
any other provision of law
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
if it were shell that could be taken
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
that all of the money would go into that
 
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.109 align:start position:0%
that all of the money would go into that
font

00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
font
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
so this uh makes
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
there's another action required there's
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
no money in the budget so there would
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
have to be a fiscal and gnc
 
00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
accept and expend so may works
 
00:55:04.309 --> 00:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
um better in this case than just the one
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
dollar limitation
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
thank you questions comments sandra
 
00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:10.710 align:start position:0%
thank you questions comments sandra
bradley

00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
bradley
 
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
i would love a motion i move uh
 
00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
amendment 1995
 
00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
ought to pass second represent
 
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
umber seconds represent bradley moves
 
00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
out to pass
 
00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
on two zero two one one nine nine five h
 
00:55:30.309 --> 00:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
on section 457 and the amendment i still
 
00:55:38.549 --> 00:55:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
what play what line number are you um
 
00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
i'm on
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
1985 yeah i think those shells
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
consistent so the first one on line 15
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
is just the standard language shall be
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
appropriated for 22. so what that does
 
00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:14.309 align:start position:0%
appropriated for 22. so what that does
is

00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
there's no money in here that's
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
appropriated but it just makes sure that
 
00:56:19.829 --> 00:56:19.839 align:start position:0%
it's specifically related to 22 and that
 
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
gives direction on what that fund will
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
be used for
 
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
the second shell on 19 is the standard
 
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
shelby non-lapsing
 
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
just to give the treasurer a in
 
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
department administrative services clear

00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
that will bring you on the uh shaded out
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
side-by-side data
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
dated 615 on page 13 at the top
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
senate pass section uh 387 to 388
 
00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
actually i'm sorry is that the wrong one
 
00:58:42.309 --> 00:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
mickey it's the wrong one
 
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
mickey will tell you the actual place to
 
00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:45.829 align:start position:0%
mickey will tell you the actual place to
go

00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:45.839 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
if you go to page 14 on the uh index
 
00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:54.799 align:start position:0%
it'd be the second to the last row at
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
the bottom it's a new section
 
00:58:59.190 --> 00:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh relative to the gun line um
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
reductions made
 
00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
in a reference to senate bill 141 so
 
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
this would be
 
00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
amendment 1944 h that's been previously
 
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
adopted by this committee
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
i think we are all looking at that so
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
just so you know representative umberger
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%

00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
all the details worked out
 
00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
the house had passed the bill and
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
representative umberger was not in favor
 
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
of passage of the bill but she still
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
rolled up her sleeves said hey we wanted
 
00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
it we passed it i'm going to do the work
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
dug in got all the positions figured out
 
00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
how much money should have been budgeted
 
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
for the counties because it downshifted
 
00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:35.589 align:start position:0%
for the counties because it downshifted
money

00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
to the county downshift to work to the
 
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
counties without giving them the money
 
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
went through everything we passed it
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
senator guyda called this morning and
 
00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
said he had a community of conference
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
that was on the gun line
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%

committee for
 
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
approval thank you mr kane
 
01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
discussion representative weiler
 
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
i think it's a mistake on a committee
 
01:26:54.149 --> 01:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
that's going to talk about
 
01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
a building and
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
and funding to just have people from
 
01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over juvenile justice
 
01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
why not have public works and finance
 
01:27:06.149 --> 01:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
people on this as well
 
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
because the decisions that will be
 
01:27:10.149 --> 01:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
affecting this have much to do with the
 
01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
areas of expertise
 
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
on those committees not just juvenile
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
justice thank you
 
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
and i guess that's a provision in the
 
01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
senate side does the senate want to
 
01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:23.430 align:start position:0%
senate side does the senate want to
share

01:27:23.430 --> 01:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
share
 
01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
their thoughts
 
01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
well they have they're mulling that over
 
01:27:40.629 --> 01:27:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
i have i have a thought i thought that
 
01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh roman numeral 2
 
01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
where it says in addition the
 
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
legislative members of the committee
 
01:27:55.110 --> 01:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
shall seek input and expert advice
 
01:27:58.229 --> 01:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
from but not limited to
 
01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
and so to me you don't need someone from
 
01:28:03.189 --> 01:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
public works there
 
01:28:06.629 --> 01:28:06.639 align:start position:0%
until you decide to build a new building
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
for example so i think that
 
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
to me anyhow that would cover the
 
01:28:19.510 --> 01:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative weiler made but that's
 
01:28:25.590 --> 01:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
i guess it does say any other group or
 
01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
organization the committee deems
 
01:28:30.790 --> 01:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
necessary so
 
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
it opens the door for them to
 
01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
contact anybody represent weiler
 
01:28:46.149 --> 01:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
representative edwards uh to uh
 
01:28:51.669 --> 01:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
to representative weiler's point i i i
 
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
agree with him
 
01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
and and given that yesterday we talked
 
01:28:56.709 --> 01:28:56.719 align:start position:0%
about how it would be great to give this
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
community flexibility
 
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
i i would i would recommend starting on
 
01:29:01.830 --> 01:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
line six
 
01:29:03.669 --> 01:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
right after the comma where the word
 
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
each starts each of whom
 
01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
delete through the next all the way to
 
01:29:09.669 --> 01:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
the next comma
 
01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
so it would read three members of the
 
01:29:13.110 --> 01:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
house of represented
 
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
appointed by the speaker of the house
 
01:29:16.629 --> 01:29:16.639 align:start position:0%
and the speaker and his
 
01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
judgment can pick which three
 
01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
representatives would be best on this
 
01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:26.470 align:start position:0%
representatives would be best on this
committee

01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
i think one of the concerns which
 
01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
represent walnut
 
01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned to me before we sat back down
 
01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
was that this committee will have a lot
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
to do with money as well but nobody is
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
specifically invited to sit on this
 
01:29:41.679 --> 01:29:43.270 align:start position:0%
specifically invited to sit on this
committee

01:29:43.270 --> 01:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
from finance and i think we've seen
 
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
a couple of other bills this year that
 
01:29:52.709 --> 01:29:52.719 align:start position:0%
criminal justice bill that we just
 
01:29:54.149 --> 01:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
rescinded the amendment that
 
01:29:56.229 --> 01:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
representation berger had to work on to
 
01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
resolve all the issues after it passed
 
01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
that did have financial implications
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
i think we'd be good with you
 
01:30:18.550 --> 01:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
representative edward's suggestion if
 
01:30:21.189 --> 01:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
that's the will of the house that's
 
01:30:29.110 --> 01:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
okay let's hold that thought while we
 
01:30:32.830 --> 01:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
continue to work on this what else do we
 
01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:35.910 align:start position:0%
continue to work on this what else do we
have

01:30:35.910 --> 01:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:37.590 --> 01:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen i know we've just
 
01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
seen this for the first time but it does
 
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
use much of the language
 
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
that has been in our compare bill
 
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
includes what we talked about yesterday
 
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
so it's not
 
01:30:46.950 --> 01:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
brand new we've just seen it for the
 
01:30:49.030 --> 01:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
first time representative edwards
 
01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair and this is
 
01:30:52.629 --> 01:30:52.639 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that we're all clear
 
01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
on the legislative intent
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh on the second page line
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
one it says it shall have space for up
 
01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
to 18
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
beds including space for flexibility
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
i i think when we went from 5 to 18
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
that implied that we want to have
 
01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:12.470 align:start position:0%
that implied that we want to have
flexibility

01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
and so i would hate the committee to
 
01:31:15.669 --> 01:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
they need 18 beds plus more space for
 
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
more flexibility i i just say that
 
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
within the 18 they're building
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
the flexibility and i'm not proposing we
 
01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
change anything
 
01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to make sure that our
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
legislative intent is clear
 
01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:35.270 align:start position:0%
legislative intent is clear
okay

01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
represent weiler uh we have velax that's
 
01:31:47.189 --> 01:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
providing an excellent job and remote
 
01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh learning and i hope we take that into
 
01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
account so we don't think we have to
 
01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:52.390 align:start position:0%
account so we don't think we have to
have

01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:31:55.110 --> 01:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh a dozen teachers for each grade and
 
01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:55.669 align:start position:0%
uh a dozen teachers for each grade and
subject

01:31:55.669 --> 01:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
subject
 
01:31:57.910 --> 01:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
that they can just sign up for a vlax
 
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
course if there's one person taking
 
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
sixth grade english we don't need to
 
01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
have a teacher specifically for that we
 
01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:06.719 align:start position:0%
can have an online course
 
01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
i think i'm glad that we have that
 
01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:09.830 align:start position:0%
i think i'm glad that we have that
capability

01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
capability
 
01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
i believe you heard um represent
 
01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:21.910 align:start position:0%
i believe you heard um represent
edward's

01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
edward's
 
01:32:25.830 --> 01:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
point on page one line six and line
 
01:32:27.669 --> 01:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
that we would have three members of the
 
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
house of representatives
 
01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
each of whom shall be from a standing
 
01:32:33.990 --> 01:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
committee appointed by the speaker of
 
01:32:35.669 --> 01:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
the house
 
01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
we all sit on standing committee so i
 
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
think that will be okay
 
01:32:43.669 --> 01:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
do we have to wait for more paperwork
 
01:32:46.149 --> 01:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
don't worry is that something you could
 
01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
magically make happen for us
 
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
we will magically make it happen
 
01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:53.030 align:start position:0%
we will magically make it happen
excellent

01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:54.480 align:start position:0%

01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
from each of whom shall be from a
 
01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
standing committee having jurisdiction
 
01:33:14.870 --> 01:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
over juvenile justice and what i thought
 
01:33:16.229 --> 01:33:16.239 align:start position:0%

standing committee
 
01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
which would include finance yep okay
 
01:33:24.629 --> 01:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
i just want because we are a standing
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
committee we're
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
we're the policy committee that deals
 
01:33:29.669 --> 01:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
with money but we are a standing policy
 
01:33:29.679 --> 01:33:30.229 align:start position:0%
with money but we are a standing policy
committee

01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
okay and the the other question i have
 
01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
is it is the way this r
 
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
is written they don't have to have 18
 
01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:46.070 align:start position:0%
is written they don't have to have 18
beds

01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
beds
 
01:33:48.550 --> 01:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
no that's why it says up to they're
 
01:33:50.790 --> 01:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
gonna have some other numbers what
 
01:33:53.669 --> 01:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
is that am i interpreting that correctly
 
01:33:53.679 --> 01:33:54.149 align:start position:0%
is that am i interpreting that correctly
line

01:33:54.149 --> 01:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:33:57.990 --> 01:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
24 on page 1 begins this it says
 
01:34:00.790 --> 01:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
it shall be designed to meet the unique
 
01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:01.590 align:start position:0%
it shall be designed to meet the unique
needs

01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:34:04.709 --> 01:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
of up to 18 youth
 
01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
and then it goes through and says
 
01:34:11.550 --> 01:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
has the same three residential pods that
 
01:34:14.070 --> 01:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
representative edwards spoke about
 
01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:15.350 align:start position:0%
representative edwards spoke about
yesterday

01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
and obviously when we have three
 
01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
residential pods
 
01:34:21.669 --> 01:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
and we have five beds you're going to
 
01:34:24.629 --> 01:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
have 1.6 beds in each of the three pods
 
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
if you split it evenly
 
01:34:28.149 --> 01:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
so if you have three pods you really
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
want to have it
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
a multiple of three so shall include
 
01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
three separate residential pods
 
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
each including capacity for up to
 
01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
six youth so now you could actually have
 
01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
one bed in one pod and four beds and
 
01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
another one if you had more of this kind
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
of child the way that's
 
01:34:49.199 --> 01:34:57.750 align:start position:0%
of child the way that's
written

01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:59.270 --> 01:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
maybe we're ready for a motion now
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
senator bradley uh i'll move
 
01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
that we approve the amendment with your
 
01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
changes that you referred to as
 
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
lba magic
 
01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
is there a second to that represent
 
01:35:16.470 --> 01:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
wyler's seconds
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
if the house is in favor will you please
 
01:35:20.950 --> 01:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
raise your hand
 
01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:23.990 align:start position:0%
raise your hand
senate

01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
okay mr kane we do
 
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
have a great deal of open
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
space related to the sununu center
 
01:35:41.669 --> 01:35:41.679 align:start position:0%
starting on page 11. have we now
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
dealt with every one of those
 
01:35:48.149 --> 01:35:48.159 align:start position:0%
sections we would just need
 
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
the intent of the committee to be stated
 
01:35:51.669 --> 01:35:51.679 align:start position:0%
if the house will accede to the senate's
 
01:35:51.679 --> 01:35:52.229 align:start position:0%
if the house will accede to the senate's
position

01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
after that amendment that was just
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
adopted okay then the house does succeed
 
01:35:59.109 --> 01:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
to the senate position
 
01:36:03.149 --> 01:36:03.159 align:start position:0%
with the adoption of amendment
 
01:36:03.159 --> 01:36:07.990 align:start position:0%

has changed with lba magic yes
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
is amended with lba magic
 
01:36:18.310 --> 01:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
and the top of page 12 that includes all
 
01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
of those as well correct mr kane
 
01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
that's correct straight through on the
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
i think senator morse would like to
 
01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:41.990 align:start position:0%
i think senator morse would like to
address

01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:47.189 --> 01:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
senate pass sections 427
 
01:36:53.830 --> 01:36:53.840 align:start position:0%

01:36:58.950 --> 01:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
about those sections yesterday
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
and i recognize the senate senator moore
 
01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
senator bradley
 
01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:12.629 --> 01:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
let me just start out by saying that um
 
01:37:12.639 --> 01:37:13.510 align:start position:0%
let me just start out by saying that um
having

01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
you know worked for a long time on
 
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
medicaid expansion i
 
01:37:18.790 --> 01:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
i see the dental benefit in much the
 
01:37:20.310 --> 01:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
same way as something that would
 
01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
improve not only oral health but
 
01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
physical health
 
01:37:27.030 --> 01:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
the senate and it was in my committee
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
the health and human services committee
 
01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:29.830 align:start position:0%
the health and human services committee
took

01:37:29.830 --> 01:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
took
 
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
um a lot of testimony
 
01:37:37.109 --> 01:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
physicians dentists etc that talked of
 
01:37:37.119 --> 01:37:37.590 align:start position:0%
physicians dentists etc that talked of
the

01:37:37.590 --> 01:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
correlation between good oral health and
 
01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
good overall
 
01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
physical health it's unfortunate that
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
the cost savings that we would enjoy
 
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
from better physical health of never to
 
01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
the best of my knowledge ever been
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
delineated in a cost-benefit analysis
 
01:37:58.149 --> 01:37:58.159 align:start position:0%
but every medical professional
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
has testified to that effect so
 
01:38:04.870 --> 01:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
the senate um has supported the dental
 
01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:06.950 align:start position:0%
the senate um has supported the dental
benefit

01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:38:10.229 --> 01:38:10.239 align:start position:0%
in the previous session in this session
 
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
the costs uh general fund costs are
 
01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:13.750 align:start position:0%
the costs uh general fund costs are
about

01:38:13.750 --> 01:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
six to seven million dollars it's
 
01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:17.430 align:start position:0%
six to seven million dollars it's
estimated

01:38:17.430 --> 01:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
estimated
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
over the course of a of a year the way
 
01:38:22.149 --> 01:38:22.159 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:28.149 --> 01:38:28.159 align:start position:0%
the fact that it goes into
 
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
implementation in the last quarter of
 
01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:31.590 align:start position:0%
implementation in the last quarter of
the

01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
second year of the budget
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
limits the cost to the 1.6 ish million
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
dollars that's
 
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
so i guess at this point i'd be happy to
 
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
answer any questions i think we would
 
01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
hope that the
 
01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
um house conferees would see their way
 
01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:56.310 align:start position:0%
um house conferees would see their way
to

01:38:56.310 --> 01:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:39:00.070 --> 01:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
supporting this i think it makes
 
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense from a public health
 
01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:04.790 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense from a public health
perspective

01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:39:07.510 --> 01:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
it certainly the testimony that we
 
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
received would help
 
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
get people that needed dental care
 
01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
back into the workforce if they had
 
01:39:17.189 --> 01:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
dental care which would be
 
01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
helpful obviously to our economy if the
 
01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:22.229 align:start position:0%
helpful obviously to our economy if the
house

01:39:22.229 --> 01:39:22.239 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to have us adopt a provision
 
01:39:31.109 --> 01:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
that was similar to medicaid expansion
 
01:39:31.119 --> 01:39:32.390 align:start position:0%
that was similar to medicaid expansion
where

01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:39:36.149 --> 01:39:36.159 align:start position:0%
we tied continued funding to the
 
01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
federal funding that would be available
 
01:39:39.669 --> 01:39:39.679 align:start position:0%
in the matches
 
01:39:42.070 --> 01:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
i think part of the match and people
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
from hhs can answer this would be at a
 
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
50 50 rate and part of it would be at a
 
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
medicaid expansion rate is that correct
 
01:39:50.470 --> 01:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
a 90 10 match
 
01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
so it would bring a significant amount
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
of money
 
01:39:56.870 --> 01:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
federal resources into the state of new
 
01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:59.350 align:start position:0%
federal resources into the state of new
hampshire

01:39:59.350 --> 01:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
so i i think it's a very worthy program
 
01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
the senate has
 
01:40:06.390 --> 01:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
so happy to answer any questions madam
 
01:40:08.639 --> 01:40:09.990 align:start position:0%
so happy to answer any questions madam
chair

01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:40:11.590 --> 01:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you senator bradley i think this
 
01:40:13.030 --> 01:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
is kind of like house bill
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
254 which we have retained in house
 
01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:17.109 align:start position:0%
254 which we have retained in house
finance

01:40:17.109 --> 01:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
finance
 
01:40:21.030 --> 01:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
and division three on some of the
 
01:40:25.590 --> 01:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
situation with sununu center the senate
 
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
did pass their bill but they immediately
 
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
put it on the table
 
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
it has not come to the house for public
 
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
hearing we do
 
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
have some figures that say it could cost
 
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
up to 11 million dollars a year
 
01:40:39.990 --> 01:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
in general funds we haven't looked at
 
01:40:41.669 --> 01:40:41.679 align:start position:0%
that and so
 
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
we're hoping that the senate will send
 
01:40:45.109 --> 01:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
their bill
 
01:40:48.550 --> 01:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
over when they get them so that we can
 
01:40:49.270 --> 01:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
have those
 
01:40:52.470 --> 01:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
public hearings but right now we do not
 
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
have 11 million dollars extra to commit
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
on the budget so we appreciate the work
 
01:40:59.669 --> 01:40:59.679 align:start position:0%

01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%

01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:04.560 align:start position:0%

that the governor shall provide a list
 
01:45:59.590 --> 01:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
of all expenditures pursuant to the
 
01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:00.390 align:start position:0%
of all expenditures pursuant to the
subdivision

01:46:00.390 --> 01:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
subdivision
 
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
under state of emergency to the
 
01:46:03.750 --> 01:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
executive council for
 
01:46:06.070 --> 01:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
informational purposes only within 30
 
01:46:07.910 --> 01:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
days of the expenditure
 
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
in order to ensure transparency in
 
01:46:12.629 --> 01:46:12.639 align:start position:0%
sections one through three will take
 
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
senator bradley thank you very much i
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
think one of the
 
01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
key sticking points in all of the
 
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
discussion about this
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
is whether the legislature
 
01:46:39.510 --> 01:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
has the authority to override or stop an
 
01:46:41.109 --> 01:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
emergency order or
 
01:46:44.709 --> 01:46:44.719 align:start position:0%
parts of an emergency order or whether
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature has to affirmatively
 
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
renew an emergency order that
 
01:46:54.070 --> 01:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
has been the key sticking point if it's
 
01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
the legislature overriding
 
01:46:58.870 --> 01:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
the governor that's an affirmative
 
01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:00.149 align:start position:0%
the governor that's an affirmative
action

01:47:00.149 --> 01:47:00.159 align:start position:0%
action
 
01:47:03.590 --> 01:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
in much the same way constitutionally
 
01:47:07.270 --> 01:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
that we would pass a law by majority
 
01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:09.109 align:start position:0%
that we would pass a law by majority
vote

01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
to put a piece of legislation on the
 
01:47:13.590 --> 01:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
governor's desk that's an affirmative
 
01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:14.390 align:start position:0%
governor's desk that's an affirmative
action

01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
action
 
01:47:18.229 --> 01:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
by both bodies the house and the senate
 
01:47:21.189 --> 01:47:21.199 align:start position:0%
obviously if the governor disagrees he
 
01:47:23.590 --> 01:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
or she vetoes it and by a two-thirds
 
01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:24.709 align:start position:0%
or she vetoes it and by a two-thirds
majority

01:47:24.709 --> 01:47:24.719 align:start position:0%
majority
 
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
we as the house and senate have the
 
01:47:28.950 --> 01:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
ability to override
 
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
so flipping
 
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
the script so to speak to say
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
that the legislature has to
 
01:47:37.199 --> 01:47:39.590 align:start position:0%
that the legislature has to
affirmatively

01:47:39.590 --> 01:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
affirmatively
 
01:47:43.109 --> 01:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
agree to continue
 
01:47:46.470 --> 01:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
an emergency order is
 
01:47:48.950 --> 01:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
way outside the traditional and i think
 
01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:49.990 align:start position:0%
way outside the traditional and i think
constitutional

01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
checks and balances that
 
01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:55.679 align:start position:0%
we have in new hampshire upon a
 
01:47:57.510 --> 01:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
governor's authority would allow either
 
01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
or the house to decline to
 
01:48:05.109 --> 01:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
move forward with an emergency order or
 
01:48:07.109 --> 01:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
potentially at the discretion of the
 
01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
senate president or the speaker
 
01:48:11.590 --> 01:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
declined to even meet and consider it
 
01:48:12.550 --> 01:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
the emergency order would then cease to
 
01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:16.070 align:start position:0%
the emergency order would then cease to
exist

01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
exist
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
by that action that i think is
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
somewhat unprecedented in how
 
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
we traditionally do business the one
 
01:48:26.950 --> 01:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
thing that i would add
 
01:48:30.709 --> 01:48:30.719 align:start position:0%
that if you look at the amendment
 
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh 2021 constitutionally
 
01:48:39.669 --> 01:48:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:42.149 --> 01:48:42.159 align:start position:0%
you know an action of the governor in
 
01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
terms of legislation it takes two-thirds
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
this is a majority vote of both the
 
01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:48.950 align:start position:0%
this is a majority vote of both the
senate

01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
and the house so a simple majority in
 
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
this case
 
01:48:57.270 --> 01:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
would override either the entire
 
01:49:01.270 --> 01:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
emergency order or
 
01:49:03.750 --> 01:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
specific emergency orders that was one
 
01:49:05.669 --> 01:49:05.679 align:start position:0%
of the key distinctions that the senate
 
01:49:05.679 --> 01:49:07.350 align:start position:0%
of the key distinctions that the senate
made

01:49:07.350 --> 01:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
when we passed 417 is that
 
01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
current law allows override provision of
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
an entire order but not specific orders
 
01:49:15.119 --> 01:49:15.910 align:start position:0%
an entire order but not specific orders
so

01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:18.790 --> 01:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
by doing that i think it's by doing this
 
01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
if we do this
 
01:49:23.030 --> 01:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
um and my understanding is the governor
 
01:49:25.270 --> 01:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
is supportive of this
 
01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
and it's been scrutinized extensively by
 
01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
the governor's office this
 
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
provides i think a further check and
 
01:49:37.030 --> 01:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
balance on emergency orders by being
 
01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:37.990 align:start position:0%
balance on emergency orders by being
able

01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
able
 
01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
to block an emergency order by a simple
 
01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
majority vote where
 
01:49:46.950 --> 01:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
any other action to block a governor's
 
01:49:49.350 --> 01:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
veto or to override a governor's veto is
 
01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:50.070 align:start position:0%
veto or to override a governor's veto is
two-thirds

01:49:50.070 --> 01:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
two-thirds
 
01:49:53.270 --> 01:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
so that's why i think this is a good
 
01:49:54.950 --> 01:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
amendment a good
 
01:49:57.750 --> 01:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
way forward and i would hope that we can
 
01:49:59.189 --> 01:49:59.199 align:start position:0%
support it
 
01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you senator bradley i would like
 
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:08.070 --> 01:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:11.990 --> 01:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
then speaker shertliff arbitrarily
 
01:50:14.709 --> 01:50:14.719 align:start position:0%
sent the legislature home and locked us
 
01:50:14.719 --> 01:50:15.589 align:start position:0%
sent the legislature home and locked us
out

01:50:15.589 --> 01:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:50:18.149 --> 01:50:18.159 align:start position:0%
whether we wanted to come work or not we
 
01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
were totally
 
01:50:21.750 --> 01:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
all of us locked out of the state house
 
01:50:23.990 --> 01:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
blocked out the lobby
 
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
the governor was here by himself we were
 
01:50:30.149 --> 01:50:30.159 align:start position:0%
not allowed to even come up here
 
01:50:31.589 --> 01:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
people have said to me well he wasn't
 
01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
talking the legislature
 
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
they forget that the speaker at that
 
01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:36.870 align:start position:0%
they forget that the speaker at that
time

01:50:36.870 --> 01:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:50:40.709 --> 01:50:40.719 align:start position:0%
blocked us out i don't think we'd ever
 
01:50:42.870 --> 01:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
faced something exactly like this
 
01:50:44.310 --> 01:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
although certainly
 
01:50:46.950 --> 01:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
president eisenhower had a sort of
 
01:50:49.109 --> 01:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
pandemic on his side which had the same
 
01:50:51.189 --> 01:50:51.199 align:start position:0%
amount of death as we had with
 
01:50:53.910 --> 01:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
the coronavirus this allows the
 
01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:54.870 align:start position:0%
the coronavirus this allows the
legislature

01:50:54.870 --> 01:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:50:57.430 --> 01:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
no matter who is speaker to continue to
 
01:50:59.510 --> 01:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
work and to continue to be part of the
 
01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:00.390 align:start position:0%
work and to continue to be part of the
process

01:51:00.390 --> 01:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
which is something i think is was needed
 
01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:04.229 align:start position:0%
which is something i think is was needed
then

01:51:04.229 --> 01:51:04.239 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:51:07.270 --> 01:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
and is needed now and i'm glad to see
 
01:51:09.109 --> 01:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
that the legislature and the governor
 
01:51:09.119 --> 01:51:09.510 align:start position:0%
that the legislature and the governor
will

01:51:09.510 --> 01:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
go forward as both bodies
 
01:51:15.510 --> 01:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
executive and legislative need to be
 
01:51:16.709 --> 01:51:16.719 align:start position:0%
working for the people
 
01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
at all times representative omburger you
 
01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
did have your hand up
 
01:51:24.229 --> 01:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chairman
 
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh looking at lines um
 
01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
17 or 27 28 and 29.
 
01:51:35.830 --> 01:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
h1 yes um
 
01:51:46.830 --> 01:51:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:50.870 align:start position:0%
 
quorum

01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:52.390 --> 01:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not qualified to answer that
 
01:51:54.629 --> 01:51:54.639 align:start position:0%
question so i'm kind of hoping that
 
01:51:58.870 --> 01:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
i have i have no problem with it i just
 
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:09.589 --> 01:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
but i guess mr speaker i would ask you
 
01:52:09.599 --> 01:52:10.310 align:start position:0%
but i guess mr speaker i would ask you
that

01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:12.870 --> 01:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
we have house rules that if a quorum of
 
01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
house members
 
01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
aren't present that we have to pass
 
01:52:24.310 --> 01:52:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:27.350 --> 01:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
no just press the red button it'll be
 
01:52:31.109 --> 01:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
okay yeah there's there's two phases to
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
that i mean if
 
01:52:34.709 --> 01:52:34.719 align:start position:0%
if we drop below well whatever the
 
01:52:37.510 --> 01:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
number is 260 264 or whatever you know
 
01:52:39.030 --> 01:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
depending on how many members we have at
 
01:52:39.910 --> 01:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
that time
 
01:52:42.149 --> 01:52:42.159 align:start position:0%
then you have to pass by two-thirds vote
 
01:52:45.510 --> 01:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
if we drop below let's say 200
 
01:52:48.229 --> 01:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
uh in one then we don't have a quorum
 
01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
where we have to stop
 
01:52:52.390 --> 01:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
and i guess the question that
 
01:52:54.390 --> 01:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
representative umberger is bringing
 
01:52:57.750 --> 01:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
forward to us is does this override that
 
01:52:59.430 --> 01:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not qualified to answer that
 
01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:01.510 align:start position:0%
i'm not qualified to answer that
question

01:53:01.510 --> 01:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:53:07.270 --> 01:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:10.470 --> 01:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:13.589 --> 01:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
yeah hold on mentally i
 
01:53:16.629 --> 01:53:16.639 align:start position:0%
i certainly don't want to uh make a
 
01:53:19.109 --> 01:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
determination uh unless you know
 
01:53:19.119 --> 01:53:20.950 align:start position:0%
determination uh unless you know
somebody

01:53:20.950 --> 01:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
01:53:22.870 --> 01:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
gives us a legal explanation but i would
 
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
assume that our rules would still
 
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
be in play even with this that's what i
 
01:53:28.149 --> 01:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
would drop
 
01:53:31.589 --> 01:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
you know that we need at least well 201
 
01:53:34.709 --> 01:53:34.719 align:start position:0%
if we had you know all 400 members that
 
01:53:34.719 --> 01:53:34.950 align:start position:0%
if we had you know all 400 members that
we

01:53:34.950 --> 01:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:53:36.550 --> 01:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
would have to have at least a minimum of
 
01:53:37.990 --> 01:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
201 there
 
01:53:41.109 --> 01:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill suspends house
 
01:53:41.119 --> 01:53:43.109 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill suspends house
rules

01:53:43.109 --> 01:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:53:45.750 --> 01:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
so karen i think the answer may be house
 
01:53:47.990 --> 01:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
rules are not suspended
 
01:53:49.990 --> 01:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
and as the speaker said we do have a
 
01:53:52.390 --> 01:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
house rule on that
 
01:53:56.709 --> 01:53:56.719 align:start position:0%
except this says a majority vote
 
01:53:58.709 --> 01:53:58.719 align:start position:0%
shall consist of a majority of the
 
01:54:01.510 --> 01:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
members present and voting
 
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
and so you know and as we just said if
 
01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:05.270 align:start position:0%
and so you know and as we just said if
you

01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:54:07.350 --> 01:54:07.360 align:start position:0%
fall below a certain number you need two
 
01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:08.310 align:start position:0%
fall below a certain number you need two
thirds

01:54:08.310 --> 01:54:08.320 align:start position:0%
thirds
 
01:54:11.350 --> 01:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
and so this in fact overrides that
 
01:54:14.629 --> 01:54:14.639 align:start position:0%
this overrides defined below two-thirds
 
01:54:14.639 --> 01:54:18.070 align:start position:0%
this overrides defined below two-thirds
yes

01:54:18.070 --> 01:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
wait a minute miss represent turcotte
 
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
where i think they've stepped out to see
 
01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:23.510 align:start position:0%
where i think they've stepped out to see
if

01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:54:27.109 --> 01:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
the attorney is available is that true
 
01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
can we ask for the governor's office to
 
01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh mr elms the senator asked very
 
01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:44.470 align:start position:0%
uh mr elms the senator asked very
politely

01:54:44.470 --> 01:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
politely
 
01:54:46.390 --> 01:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
if the governor's office would like to
 
01:54:49.030 --> 01:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
comment on this
 
01:54:52.149 --> 01:54:52.159 align:start position:0%
and you're not obliged to say yes and
 
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at your face
 
01:54:56.229 --> 01:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
but if you wanted to we would be happy
 
01:54:57.669 --> 01:54:57.679 align:start position:0%
to have you comment do we have a
 
01:55:05.430 --> 01:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
microphone back there now
 
01:55:07.109 --> 01:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
if we could wait for james scully
 
01:55:08.950 --> 01:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
governor's legal counsel to arrive we'd
 
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
on is on his way matt then i have a
 
01:55:15.910 --> 01:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
couple of other members who have
 
01:55:17.669 --> 01:55:17.679 align:start position:0%
comments i'm gonna let them go ahead
 
01:55:18.310 --> 01:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
while we
 
01:55:20.470 --> 01:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
hold this representative turcotte your
 
01:55:22.310 --> 01:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
hand was up first followed by represent
 
01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:23.189 align:start position:0%
hand was up first followed by represent
wyler

01:55:23.189 --> 01:55:23.199 align:start position:0%
wyler
 
01:55:26.310 --> 01:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i
 
01:55:28.070 --> 01:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
i have to believe the intent of this
 
01:55:30.950 --> 01:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
would be that it contemplates a state of
 
01:55:32.229 --> 01:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
emergency where
 
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
maybe every single member might not be
 
01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
able to get there whether that number be
 
01:55:39.589 --> 01:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
ten percent down twenty percent fifty
 
01:55:40.870 --> 01:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
percent down
 
01:55:44.149 --> 01:55:44.159 align:start position:0%
and i think the wording to me says
 
01:55:45.189 --> 01:55:45.199 align:start position:0%
exactly that
 
01:55:47.669 --> 01:55:47.679 align:start position:0%
whoever is there it's a majority of
 
01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
those present
 
01:55:52.070 --> 01:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
not so much uh requiring a quorum that
 
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
personally that's how i would read it
 
01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
represent weiler
 
01:56:03.430 --> 01:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
i can envision dire emergencies that
 
01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:06.719 align:start position:0%
would affect the majority of the state
 
01:56:11.189 --> 01:56:11.199 align:start position:0%
either disabling our vehicles so we
 
01:56:13.350 --> 01:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't travel or our roads or our
 
01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:14.709 align:start position:0%
couldn't travel or our roads or our
electricity

01:56:14.709 --> 01:56:14.719 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
or even an attack like say a meteorite
 
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
hit that wiped out
 
01:56:21.990 --> 01:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
a fraction of the state there are dire
 
01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
things that could happen and those that
 
01:56:25.510 --> 01:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
must have remained and survive
 
01:56:28.709 --> 01:56:28.719 align:start position:0%
would be expected to do something so
 
01:56:31.430 --> 01:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
depending on how dire the emergency was
 
01:56:33.350 --> 01:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
we should be able to do something
 
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you senator morris
 
01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
yeah our attorney is on his way over but
 
01:56:44.550 --> 01:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
he said that the constitution requires a
 
01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:46.229 align:start position:0%
he said that the constitution requires a
quorum

01:56:46.229 --> 01:56:46.239 align:start position:0%
quorum
 
01:56:48.629 --> 01:56:48.639 align:start position:0%
so it would not be just the people that
 
01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
show up
 
01:56:54.390 --> 01:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
okay the constitution requires a quorum
 
01:56:59.270 --> 01:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
a bill may not overturn the constitution
 
01:57:01.830 --> 01:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
i think representative berger we may
 
01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:02.310 align:start position:0%
i think representative berger we may
have

01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:57:04.709 --> 01:57:04.719 align:start position:0%
reached an answer however we have a
 
01:57:05.830 --> 01:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
couple of attorneys
 
01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:07.730 align:start position:0%
on their way over
 
01:57:07.730 --> 01:57:09.750 align:start position:0%
on their way over
[Music]

01:57:09.750 --> 01:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
so that's going to probably lead us to a
 
01:57:12.719 --> 01:57:14.550 align:start position:0%
so that's going to probably lead us to a
five-minute

01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
five-minute
 
01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
break if they're on their way i hesitate
 
01:57:19.270 --> 01:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
to take a longer break so that they
 
01:57:20.470 --> 01:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
don't sit around
 
01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
so ladies and gentlemen we're going to
 
01:57:23.990 --> 01:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
take a wee tiny
 
01:57:26.350 --> 01:57:26.360 align:start position:0%
five minute break and make sure we're
 
01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
constitutionally correct
 
02:04:37.270 --> 02:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:41.910 --> 02:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:43.830 --> 02:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
all right we had a question on the floor
 
02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
that is probably going to be a
 
02:04:47.270 --> 02:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional question however
 
02:04:48.870 --> 02:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
we asked the governor's office if they
 
02:04:51.430 --> 02:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
would like to speak and we were
 
02:04:53.350 --> 02:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
kindly provided with the governor's
 
02:04:54.470 --> 02:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
attorney and
 
02:04:56.790 --> 02:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming i think you have a
 
02:04:58.629 --> 02:04:58.639 align:start position:0%
microphone back there
 
02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
we're questioning the language and the
 
02:05:02.149 --> 02:05:02.159 align:start position:0%
question was
 
02:05:06.229 --> 02:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
do we have to have a quorum and we
 
02:05:08.470 --> 02:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
believe that the constitution does say
 
02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:09.679 align:start position:0%
that the house
 
02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
and senate must have a quorum in order
 
02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
to do business and welcome and thank you
 
02:05:15.990 --> 02:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
for coming over to help us
 
02:05:19.350 --> 02:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
senate attorney sorry
 
02:05:22.629 --> 02:05:22.639 align:start position:0%
it's been a long three days
 
02:05:24.069 --> 02:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like it doesn't sound like
 
02:05:31.030 --> 02:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:34.149 --> 02:05:34.159 align:start position:0%
how's that well perfect um yes the
 
02:05:35.350 --> 02:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
quorum is required
 
02:05:36.790 --> 02:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
either the senator or the house to
 
02:05:38.709 --> 02:05:38.719 align:start position:0%
conduct any business so
 
02:05:41.189 --> 02:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
um in the constitution correct in the
 
02:05:41.199 --> 02:05:42.870 align:start position:0%
um in the constitution correct in the
constitution

02:05:42.870 --> 02:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
02:05:45.189 --> 02:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
and it can't be changed by statute
 
02:05:45.199 --> 02:05:46.069 align:start position:0%
and it can't be changed by statute
obviously

02:05:46.069 --> 02:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
02:05:48.629 --> 02:05:48.639 align:start position:0%
thank you and i think the speaker our
 
02:05:49.669 --> 02:05:49.679 align:start position:0%
speaker has
 
02:05:51.990 --> 02:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
the language from the constitution he
 
02:05:53.910 --> 02:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
can read for us so we all know what
 
02:05:55.270 --> 02:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with here
 
02:05:57.990 --> 02:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh article 20
 
02:06:00.069 --> 02:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
quorum what constitutes
 
02:06:01.990 --> 02:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
and i'll just read it a majority of the
 
02:06:03.750 --> 02:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
members of the house of representatives
 
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
shall be a quorum for doing business
 
02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
but less than two-thirds of the
 
02:06:09.910 --> 02:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
representatives elected shall be present
 
02:06:11.350 --> 02:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
the absence of two-thirds of those
 
02:06:12.870 --> 02:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
numbers shall be necessary to render
 
02:06:14.550 --> 02:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
their acts and proceeding
 
02:06:18.790 --> 02:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh valid um so it's what we anticipated
 
02:06:18.800 --> 02:06:19.430 align:start position:0%
uh valid um so it's what we anticipated
that

02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
if we have all 400 members then once we
 
02:06:25.589 --> 02:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
drop below 201
 
02:06:28.629 --> 02:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
we'd have to cease business so this this
 
02:06:31.510 --> 02:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
language here does not change or trump
 
02:06:32.629 --> 02:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
the constitution
 
02:06:35.189 --> 02:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
and we thank representative umberger for
 
02:06:36.310 --> 02:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
helping us get
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
a little better in tune with the
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
constitution of new hampshire
 
02:06:42.790 --> 02:06:42.800 align:start position:0%

again we're looking at amendment
2021-2017-s

02:06:49.990 --> 02:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:52.709 --> 02:06:52.719 align:start position:0%
cnn are we ready for a motion i'll move
 
02:06:54.790 --> 02:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
02:06:56.709 --> 02:06:56.719 align:start position:0%
senator bradley moves the amendment
 
02:06:58.870 --> 02:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative packard's seconds
 
02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:00.480 align:start position:0%

02:07:02.950 --> 02:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
please raise your hand
 
02:07:07.510 --> 02:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
the senate we have adopted this
 
02:07:09.589 --> 02:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
senator bradley and i have been working
 
02:07:12.629 --> 02:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
on this broadband project and it doesn't
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
matter how much we work
 
02:07:18.149 --> 02:07:18.159 align:start position:0%
we always have one more little wiggle
 
02:07:20.790 --> 02:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
senator bradley i think we have now a
 
02:07:21.990 --> 02:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
committee of conference
 
02:07:25.669 --> 02:07:25.679 align:start position:0%
that has agreed to something that needs
 
02:07:26.229 --> 02:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
to go
 
02:07:29.030 --> 02:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
into the amendment on the broadband that
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
this committee adopted am i correct
 
02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh yes madam chair you are and i
 
02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
apologize for having forgotten
 
02:07:39.189 --> 02:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
um the senate amended house bill 77
 
02:07:41.350 --> 02:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
which you concurred with to back
 
02:07:44.870 --> 02:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
date the broadband eligibility criteria
 
02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:45.189 align:start position:0%
date the broadband eligibility criteria
to

02:07:45.189 --> 02:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:07:48.870 --> 02:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
january 1st of this year
 
02:07:51.990 --> 02:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
you concurred with that i apologize i
 
02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:52.950 align:start position:0%
you concurred with that i apologize i
forgot

02:07:52.950 --> 02:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
forgot
 
02:07:55.109 --> 02:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
about that provision i was reminded of
 
02:07:57.189 --> 02:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
it by a colleague in the senate
 
02:08:01.109 --> 02:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
and so if you go to um
 
02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
house bill 77 it is
 
02:08:08.709 --> 02:08:08.719 align:start position:0%
section two broadband matching grand
 
02:08:08.719 --> 02:08:09.510 align:start position:0%
section two broadband matching grand
initiative

02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
initiative
 
02:08:11.669 --> 02:08:11.679 align:start position:0%
it does do the back dating it's
 
02:08:13.830 --> 02:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
contingency language i think that
 
02:08:18.470 --> 02:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
um the legislative budget assistance
 
02:08:21.589 --> 02:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
and ols can as we're
 
02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
saying with some frequency now work
 
02:08:25.669 --> 02:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
their magic to make sure that that
 
02:08:25.679 --> 02:08:26.709 align:start position:0%
their magic to make sure that that
provision

02:08:26.709 --> 02:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
provision
 
02:08:29.750 --> 02:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
is included in the broadband
 
02:08:32.790 --> 02:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
language and so i would move that
 
02:08:34.950 --> 02:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
both the senate and house have already
 
02:08:36.870 --> 02:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
voted for this provision
 
02:08:39.830 --> 02:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
again i apologize for having dropped it
 
02:08:41.109 --> 02:08:41.119 align:start position:0%
okay i would
 
02:08:43.589 --> 02:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
second the motion by senator bradley to
 
02:08:45.589 --> 02:08:45.599 align:start position:0%
move this into the amendment we adopted
 
02:08:46.629 --> 02:08:46.639 align:start position:0%
on broadband we
 
02:08:48.709 --> 02:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
intended it to be encompassing of what
 
02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
we're doing most of this money is coming
 
02:08:53.430 --> 02:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
in fact i think all of it is coming
 
02:08:56.229 --> 02:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
from the arpa funds that we're getting
 
02:08:57.830 --> 02:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
from the federal government
 
02:09:00.870 --> 02:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
to help our rural towns and counties
 
02:09:03.030 --> 02:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
have better broadband access which we
 
02:09:04.229 --> 02:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
found out was
 
02:09:06.709 --> 02:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
woefully inadequate in many cases as
 
02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
students tried to do remote learning
 
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
so in the house if you're in favor of
 
02:09:13.030 --> 02:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
adding that language please show
 
02:09:18.229 --> 02:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
your hands we're unanimous the senate
 
02:09:20.790 --> 02:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
cain once again that little magical wand
 
02:09:22.069 --> 02:09:22.079 align:start position:0%
will fix this
 
02:09:23.990 --> 02:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
yes we'll work with all let's fix this
 
02:09:25.669 --> 02:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
02:09:29.350 --> 02:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
no it was an amendment we added um
 
02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
the house is going to take a break and
 
02:09:33.350 --> 02:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
take a caucus and we're going to be
 
02:09:37.910 --> 02:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
in room 212. i would anticipate
 
02:09:40.629 --> 02:09:40.639 align:start position:0%
half an hour mr speaker we're going to
 
02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
take a break for 30 minutes we will be
 
02:09:45.270 --> 02:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
back in 30 minutes the time is
 
02:09:48.709 --> 02:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
2 43 so that will put us a little bit
 
02:09:50.870 --> 02:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
after three o'clock
 
02:43:41.110 --> 02:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:48.230 --> 02:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:51.750 --> 02:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
mr kane normally
 
02:43:54.389 --> 02:43:54.399 align:start position:0%
the i believe the house although we call
 
02:43:55.190 --> 02:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
it magical
 
02:43:58.150 --> 02:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
lba fixes normally the house and the
 
02:43:58.160 --> 02:43:59.349 align:start position:0%
lba fixes normally the house and the
senate

02:43:59.349 --> 02:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
senate
 
02:44:04.790 --> 02:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh affirm that lba may make technical
 
02:44:07.910 --> 02:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
and maintenance changes as
 
02:44:11.349 --> 02:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
needed so we've done quite a bit of work
 
02:44:12.950 --> 02:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
and a couple of times including this
 
02:44:15.269 --> 02:44:15.279 align:start position:0%
recent broadband we've asked you to do
 
02:44:15.279 --> 02:44:15.830 align:start position:0%
recent broadband we've asked you to do
that

02:44:15.830 --> 02:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:44:18.630 --> 02:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
so is that is the house in agreement
 
02:44:19.590 --> 02:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
with that that we're
 
02:44:21.750 --> 02:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
going to have lba make technical and
 
02:44:22.870 --> 02:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance changes
 
02:44:25.190 --> 02:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
would you like a motion no i think we
 
02:44:26.070 --> 02:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
can do
 
02:44:29.670 --> 02:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
consensus to send it in okay so
 
02:44:31.670 --> 02:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
we know we're coming down to the end of
 
02:44:34.469 --> 02:44:34.479 align:start position:0%
the wire we know time is getting short
 
02:44:36.950 --> 02:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
we are going to recess now until 10
 
02:44:39.110 --> 02:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
o'clock tomorrow morning
 
02:44:42.230 --> 02:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to be sure you could do
 
02:44:45.590 --> 02:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
what you needed to do without us around
 
02:44:47.990 --> 02:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
we are in recess until 10 a.m tomorrow
