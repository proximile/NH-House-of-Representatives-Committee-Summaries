postponed a starting off with explosives
 
00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
how nice yes uh yes so this is proposal
 
00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 align:start position:0%
2023 184 uh the department of safety's
 
00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:30.199 align:start position:0%
rules on explosives
 
00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:32.199 align:start position:0%
the only comments I had on this
 
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
particular proposal were two notes to
 
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
the committee the first has to do with
 
00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 align:start position:0%
the dates effective dates on the forms
 
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440 align:start position:0%
most of them say April or May of 20 2013
 
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
excuse me and because forms are rules
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
they do have a 10-year expiration date
 
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 align:start position:0%
just like uh rule text does however
 
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240 align:start position:0%
after speaking with the department and
 
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
looking at our old files it does seem
 
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
like all of these forms were part of the
 
00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
2013 rul making process and those rules
 
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
did not go into effect until August um
 
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:09.560 align:start position:0%
and this proposal was filed before the
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
expiration date which stays the
 
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
expiration date for all of the rules um
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to bring that to the
 
00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:16.919 align:start position:0%
committee as attention we are working on
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
the manual and that's something that
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
we'll try to clarify in the manual that
 
00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:24.199 align:start position:0%
effective date of forms needs to be um
 
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:26.360 align:start position:0%
or when exactly the agency should be
 
00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:29.319 align:start position:0%
putting the effective dates of forms the
 
00:07:31.469 --> 00:07:31.479 align:start position:0%
other another note that I had has to do
 
00:07:34.589 --> 00:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
with uh four of the forms the first is
 
00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
on page seven which is dssp 84 and the
 
00:07:42.869 --> 00:07:42.879 align:start position:0%
other three are on page nine all uh four
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
of these forms originally had asked or
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
not asked had required a social security
 
00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
number and after looking at the statutes
 
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
I did not see any statutory Authority
 
00:07:54.869 --> 00:07:54.879 align:start position:0%
for that which would be in violation of
 
00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:57.550 align:start position:0%
for that which would be in violation of
RSA

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
54122 after the agency submitted their
 
00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
conditional approval they made that
 
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
requirement a voluntary
 
00:08:07.149 --> 00:08:07.159 align:start position:0%
request and so even though they're not
 
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
requiring on the form it is still
 
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
something that they're asking um the
 
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:13.240 align:start position:0%
applicant to provide even though it's
 
00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:14.879 align:start position:0%
voluntary so I just wanted to bring that
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
attention we yes could we have a uh
 
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:30.749 --> 00:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
that good morning my name is Mart moani
 
00:08:32.269 --> 00:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
I'm the representative for the
 
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and I have Trooper
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
Flynn from the um explosives unit
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
division of State Police as well um and
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
when I inquired um of the the the
 
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
permits and Licensing unit who processes
 
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
these applications it's more of a
 
00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
customer service in the sense that when
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
an applicant comes in and they provide
 
00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:55.160 align:start position:0%
their name and address and some of them
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
from are from out of state they do a
 
00:08:59.630 --> 00:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
background check and they also check the
 
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
state from where they're coming from and
 
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
it's a means if somebody has a very
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
common name of being able to ensure that
 
00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:09.519 align:start position:0%
it is the same person rather than just
 
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
simply denying them based on something
 
00:09:13.389 --> 00:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
that the record displays and it's not
 
00:09:13.399 --> 00:09:17.670 align:start position:0%
that the record displays and it's not
that

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
concerns all
 
00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
right anything else that is all I had
 
00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:31.519 align:start position:0%
for this proposal um as I stated it is a
 
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
conditional approval um so the committee
 
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
can either approve the conditional
 
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
approval or um enter an objection at
 
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
this time if they feel it's
 
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.069 align:start position:0%
this time if they feel it's
necessary

00:09:45.069 --> 00:09:45.079 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
represent so I am concerned with the
 
00:09:52.069 --> 00:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
voluntary divulsion of social security
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
numbers and I'm wondering if there's
 
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:54.950 align:start position:0%
numbers and I'm wondering if there's
some

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.110 align:start position:0%
some
[Music]

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
other um information that could be given
 
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
in addition to someone's name and
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
address from an out of town I I just I'm
 
00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:09.959 align:start position:0%
not comfortable with that understood um
 
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
I I don't know how to respond to that
 
00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
other than um absent that there's no way
 
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
to ensuring that the record belongs to
 
00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
that individual and they would just be
 
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
denied until they were able to prove
 
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
that they were that individual with that
 
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.829 align:start position:0%
that they were that individual with that
record

00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839 align:start position:0%
record
 
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
question does if does do a form ask for
 
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
date of birth I mean wouldn't that be a
 
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
basis to you know even if it's John
 
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
Smith from New Jersey uh presumably it
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
would be if the date of birth would seem
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
to be a big way to narrow it down that's
 
00:10:46.269 --> 00:10:46.279 align:start position:0%
a very good question um so I'm told that
 
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
they look for three um indicators to
 
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
match and date of birth is one of them
 
00:10:53.200 --> 00:11:00.190 align:start position:0%
match and date of birth is one of them
okay

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.430 align:start position:0%
 
other

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
questions director moral uh thank you I
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
do know that there are at least a few
 
00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:12.200 align:start position:0%
agencies in certain rules who ask for
 
00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
well request but do not require social I
 
00:11:19.629 --> 00:11:19.639 align:start position:0%
also have seen a few instances where
 
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
they request just the last four of the
 
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
social whether those conform with the
 
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
okay Senator
 
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
Greg I'll
 
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
second all right moved by Senator gray
 
00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:59.790 --> 00:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none those in favor
 
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.550 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none those in favor
I

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:12:09.069 --> 00:12:09.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
no all right Prime
 
00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:14.959 align:start position:0%
Wetlands so there's only one comment on
 
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
this conditional approval and um it's an
 
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
interesting issue uh the statute gives
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
the commissioner the discretion to
 
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
authorize a 40-day extension for good
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
cause shown that would allow Municipal
 
00:12:32.509 --> 00:12:32.519 align:start position:0%
conservation local River advisory
 
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
committee or the New Hampshire Rivers
 
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
Council more time on their
 
00:12:38.829 --> 00:12:38.839 align:start position:0%
application um the issue is there
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
there's just no rules regarding what
 
00:12:46.189 --> 00:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
good CA shown would be um and so either
 
00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
it needs rules or it needs a legislative
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
fix um we just thought it was a little
 
00:12:53.069 --> 00:12:53.079 align:start position:0%
unclear as to when this this extension
 
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.110 align:start position:0%
would be
given

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:59.790 --> 00:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
okay good morning I'm according Lockwood
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
I'm one of the staff Attorneys at
 
00:13:05.189 --> 00:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
Dees um so we actually removed from this
 
00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
chapter the reference to that statutory
 
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
provision in in the hopes that that
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
would fix the situation um it's not
 
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily that we're saying good cause
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be defined or explained
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
in some way it's just that this is not
 
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
the chapter to do it so Wetlands has 10
 
00:13:25.189 --> 00:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
chapters of laws um of roles in order to
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
um for someone to get a permit when they
 
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
need a permit that sort of thing um this
 
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:31.160 align:start position:0%
chapter is only for Prime Wetlands which
 
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
is only certain permit applications and
 
00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
so if we were going to Define it we
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
would put it into chapter 300 which
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
applies to all permit applications so at
 
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
this point for this chapter that's
 
00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:45.519 align:start position:0%
before you we don't reference that
 
00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
statutory provision and it just also
 
00:13:49.949 --> 00:13:49.959 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be the appropriate place to
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
explain what good causes okay so does
 
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
concern Madam chair mhm uh because our
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
court reporter is not here today I would
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
ask that anybody that comes to the table
 
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether they testified
 
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
please fill out a pink card oh
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
sorry and yes that that does answer the
 
00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
concern okay all right Senator gray
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
question do you want that approval to
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
Beal based on them adding the item
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
to and so I'll make that motion that we
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
approve on the condition the uh
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
Department seek to
 
00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
change chap
 
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
300 to include
 
00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
theary I'll second
 
00:14:41.399 --> 00:14:46.590 align:start position:0%
theary I'll second
that

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
okay any further comments questions
 
00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
discussion those in
 
00:14:52.399 --> 00:14:54.030 align:start position:0%
discussion those in
favor

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
favor
 
00:14:57.749 --> 00:14:57.759 align:start position:0%
opposed all right thank you very
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
oplc okay so
 
00:15:06.749 --> 00:15:06.759 align:start position:0%
um uh this item was postponed from the
 
00:15:09.069 --> 00:15:09.079 align:start position:0%
last meeting it's the lure and
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
discipline of regulated profession the
 
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
PLC 300 rules um there's been a
 
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request and an
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
amended conditional approval request
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
filed and most of the issues have been
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
resolved um there are a few that remain
 
00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
and those are on the um the final
 
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
proposal packet
 
00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
so and if you go to that packet you'll
 
00:15:36.189 --> 00:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
see um about three pages in there is a
 
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
um a memo to the committee kind of
 
00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
are so um I won't spent a whole lot of
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
time on them two of the issues are
 
00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
basically informational notes to the
 
00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
committee um which you've you've heard
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
about before and that's around the um
 
00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
and that should be addressed this
 
00:15:59.069 --> 00:15:59.079 align:start position:0%
legislative session and that's around
 
00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:02.959 align:start position:0%
the um the the term of the licenses when
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
they expire and then the other issue is
 
00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
around the administrative fines in that
 
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh some boards still have administrative
 
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
fines within their um their practice
 
00:16:16.829 --> 00:16:16.839 align:start position:0%
acts there is um one legislative comment
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
that you'll find in a couple of
 
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
different places and um it's on pages 11
 
00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
of the of final proposal or um page 17
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
of the final proposal packet page page
 
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
26 of the final proposal or 32 of the
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
packet so it's the same legislative
 
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
comment the rules would allow the oplc
 
00:16:42.749 --> 00:16:42.759 align:start position:0%
Licensing Bureau to make a determination
 
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
on whether to approve or deny a license
 
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
application without input from the
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
applicable board if that board doesn't
 
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
respond to the oplc request for feedback
 
00:16:57.629 --> 00:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
on that application within 50 days as
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
you may know some boards don't meet
 
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
regularly some meet quarterly for
 
00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
example um RSA 541a 29 requires agencies
 
00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
to approve or deny applications within
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
60 days so the oplc is within that you
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
know that time frame um but what we were
 
00:17:18.429 --> 00:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
concerned with is that the rules may not
 
00:17:21.309 --> 00:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
adhere to legislative intent and that's
 
00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
because um the statute for oplc is
 
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
describes that the oplc is supposed to
 
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:31.240 align:start position:0%
consult with the boards and so it's
 
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
unclear whether sending a request to the
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
board like this qualifies as Consulting
 
00:17:39.549 --> 00:17:39.559 align:start position:0%
with and so um we're not sure what the
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
legislature had in mind around you know
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
Consulting what that's supposed to look
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
like and so um that's you know we
 
00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:49.160 align:start position:0%
weren't really sure of sending the
 
00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
notification in this way it qualifies as
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
Consulting with the board so we thought
 
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
that you might have some questions about
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
that before I close I'll say that um the
 
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
issue also somewhat impacts the next
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
proposal on the agenda uh the PLC 313
 
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
which are receiving some cards on that
 
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
um we didn't have any comments on that
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
proposal but the reason why it's not on
 
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
consent is because we did get some
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
testimony expressing concern that the
 
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
oplc is not actively Consulting with the
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
boards and so um but we knowe that um in
 
00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
you know conversation with the oplc what
 
00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:28.919 align:start position:0%
we learned was that in preparation for
 
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
those PLC 313 rules the oplc did solicit
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
for feedback from all of the impacted
 
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
boards and uh gave them a timeline to do
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
that so anyway we're just not sure what
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
Consulting with is supposed to mean what
 
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature had in mind and so
 
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's the issue that remains with this
 
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
representa the um Edna committee spent
 
00:18:59.149 --> 00:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time in the last
 
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
two years with
 
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
amending the um statutes for
 
00:19:09.789 --> 00:19:09.799 align:start position:0%
oplc and it was very clear to the
 
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
committee that oplc is not to operate
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
independently from the boards on some
 
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
matters and so the in consultation with
 
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
the board means that they are to
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
include comments from the boards on any
 
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
actions that they take where that's
 
00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
written if that needs to be further
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
defined we can do that but it there is
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
no um there was no
 
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
timeline there was no method for that
 
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
process one would think that oplc would
 
00:19:53.789 --> 00:19:53.799 align:start position:0%
discuss these things at board meetings
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
for example as opposed to just doing
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
this electronically through emails
 
00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
effort director courtley thank you madam
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee Lindsay
 
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
courney executive director oplc um so I
 
00:20:12.669 --> 00:20:12.679 align:start position:0%
think our legislative Authority is
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
pretty clear and actually our
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to um issue licenses
 
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
in accordance with objective standards
 
00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:20.039 align:start position:0%
established by the boards that's the
 
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
criteria that was established in both
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
hb2 655 and 409 of last year so we are
 
00:20:27.789 --> 00:20:27.799 align:start position:0%
doing that I think what we're finding is
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
that there are some rules that are not
 
00:20:32.909 --> 00:20:32.919 align:start position:0%
necessarily objective and then typically
 
00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
what we find is that with respect to
 
00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
criminal history records checks um we
 
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:40.360 align:start position:0%
don't have clear uh delegations of
 
00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
Authority or standing orders from the
 
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
boards stating you know these particular
 
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
um crimes could be something that's
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
substantially related to the practice
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
and so therefore we want to have a
 
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
showca hearing so that's where we're
 
00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:55.720 align:start position:0%
finding the issue what's also clear
 
00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
under 54a 29a is that the agencies
 
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
whether it be the board or the oplc have
 
00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:05.919 align:start position:0%
to act within 60 days and so our
 
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
position has always been that the boards
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
in addition to oplc have an obligation
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
to do their job which means convening a
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
quum of the board if there is an
 
00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
application that needs to be reviewed I
 
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:19.240 align:start position:0%
don't think it's appropriate for a board
 
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
to essentially hold hostage the
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
application process by not meeting um
 
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
and I actually think that the statutory
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
language is quite clear that if if they
 
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799 align:start position:0%
don't meet then then there are some um
 
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
decisions that are made by operation of
 
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
law so that's we don't find ourselves in
 
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:41.480 align:start position:0%
that position uh very frequently because
 
00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
most boards are committed to doing the
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
business that they're um they have been
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
entrusted to do by the legislature um
 
00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039 align:start position:0%
but our position is that under the rare
 
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:53.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances where boards can not meet
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
in a timely fashion um in order to
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
adjudicate an application then the
 
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
agency is obligated to act pursuant to
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
comments Senator um I I think this
 
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
discuss turn your your microne please I
 
00:22:19.149 --> 00:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
think the discussion here is wonderful
 
00:22:21.149 --> 00:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
uh but I think the the real solution is
 
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
to approve with the condition that they
 
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:23.710 align:start position:0%
to approve with the condition that they
seek

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:23.720 align:start position:0%
seek
 
00:22:26.669 --> 00:22:26.679 align:start position:0%
legislative uh solution to this because
 
00:22:29.269 --> 00:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
the wording as it is right now
 
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
um you know is is at least confusing our
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
people you know that are reviewing this
 
00:22:36.269 --> 00:22:36.279 align:start position:0%
so I move
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
that okay before I'll second all right
 
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799 align:start position:0%
move by Senator gray second by
 
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
representative um groa I do have a
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
public comment on PLC 300 oh that's
 
00:22:54.029 --> 00:22:54.039 align:start position:0%
that's from from director cartney we've
 
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
already heard from her the others are on
 
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:56.990 align:start position:0%
already heard from her the others are on
the

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
313 okay
 
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
any further comments yeah the only thing
 
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm I'm certainly prepared to
 
00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:04.919 align:start position:0%
support Senator Gray's motion but the
 
00:23:06.269 --> 00:23:06.279 align:start position:0%
only other thing I'd say is it seems to
 
00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:08.559 align:start position:0%
me that that U the explanation given is
 
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
a good one I there's not um unless I'm
 
00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
missing something there's nothing even
 
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
if a board normally meets quarterly
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that prevents them from
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
meeting more often if they have work to
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
do and so it seems to me that your
 
00:23:24.029 --> 00:23:24.039 align:start position:0%
position is valid you send them
 
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
something saying here's a you know we've
 
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
just gotten this application now they're
 
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
they J is to is to meet and if it's you
 
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
know if that if that means they have to
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
meet more more frequently than quarterly
 
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
well that's the way it goes so I I think
 
00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
that's a perfectly valid explanation yes
 
00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:41.950 align:start position:0%
that's a perfectly valid explanation yes
I

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
um how often does
 
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
a such a a application come in that it
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
is obviously correct with a say with a
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
clear criminal record do you consult
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
with the board in that case depends on
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
the board so the Board of Nursing um we
 
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
we do often have findings on criminal
 
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
history records they've actually done a
 
00:24:04.669 --> 00:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
matrix that tells us exactly what to do
 
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
if you have a if you have a history of
 
00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
this then this is what you do if you
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
have a history of this then we want to
 
00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:11.720 align:start position:0%
see it and they meet very regularly at
 
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
least once a month um other boards where
 
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
we have uh positive findings and
 
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
criminal history records checks they do
 
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
not have such a matrix we're working
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
with them on trying to develop that um
 
00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:25.720 align:start position:0%
and so essentially as the applications
 
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
come in um we upload them into the
 
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
agenda and say you have applications
 
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
that need to be reviewed which means you
 
00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
can't conduct a meeting electronically
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
we don't do this business via V via
 
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
email because that's a violation of 91a
 
00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
what that means is that they have to
 
00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
schedule a
 
00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.269 align:start position:0%
schedule a
meeting

00:24:44.269 --> 00:24:44.279 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
but with that with a clear criminal
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
history you would process the license
 
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
without necessarily Consulting with the
 
00:24:54.389 --> 00:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
board is that correct or not no only if
 
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
the board has uh set forth in a standing
 
00:24:59.669 --> 00:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
order a Del of what they would like to
 
00:25:02.389 --> 00:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
see because the challenges under
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
332g there has the crime first of all
 
00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:08.039 align:start position:0%
the board has to prove by clear and
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence that um that the the
 
00:25:15.389 --> 00:25:15.399 align:start position:0%
person is more likely to offend um
 
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
reoffend with the license so we can't
 
00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:20.559 align:start position:0%
unless we have some sort of Delegation
 
00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:23.919 align:start position:0%
we can't make that showing upon a review
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
okay so that unless the board has
 
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
decided that this is okay you don't just
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
process a license correct okay correct
 
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
unless they don't meet and if they don't
 
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
meet then we need to move forward okay
 
00:25:41.789 --> 00:25:41.799 align:start position:0%
thank you rep representative fellows um
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I'm wondering if you can
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
tell me if how often the this issue is
 
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
coming up when it's not a criminal
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
records check and also how much is there
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
is there a specification of how much
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
lead time you're supposed to to give the
 
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
board to respond and to meet so the
 
00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
rules the rules that are proposed here
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
um are intended to comply with 541a 29
 
00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559 align:start position:0%
which means that as um within 60 days of
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
receiving a response to a request for
 
00:26:18.029 --> 00:26:18.039 align:start position:0%
information the agency has to act um and
 
00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:20.120 align:start position:0%
either approve or deny the application
 
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
so as soon as we get the complete
 
00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
application we essentially upload it
 
00:26:26.909 --> 00:26:26.919 align:start position:0%
into our electronic system you know most
 
00:26:29.549 --> 00:26:29.559 align:start position:0%
times most boards have a monthly meeting
 
00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
so they're they're going to they're
 
00:26:33.389 --> 00:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
going to be seeing these in a timely
 
00:26:36.269 --> 00:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
fashion it's just the boards that um
 
00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
don't meet regularly meet quarterly meet
 
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
once a year Meet twice a year that's the
 
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
challenge um with respect to whether we
 
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
see this on other matters not involving
 
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
criminal history records checks um it's
 
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
not typical because the boards are
 
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to have objective standards um
 
00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
there are some boards that still have
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
subjective standards you still have
 
00:26:59.350 --> 00:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
essays and that sort of thing and we're
 
00:27:01.389 --> 00:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
working with them on
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
those okay other question
 
00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
repres so I just want to um support the
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
um motion that Senator Greg made because
 
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:15.640 align:start position:0%
this is this kind of conversation is not
 
00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
one that we had intended when we
 
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
reviewed all those um amendments this
 
00:27:24.269 --> 00:27:24.279 align:start position:0%
summer concerning the authority of the
 
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
board to issue licenses so I do think
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
that we need to look at the legislation
 
00:27:30.909 --> 00:27:30.919 align:start position:0%
on this to make sure that we haven't
 
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
somehow um in intendedly unintendedly
 
00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:35.720 align:start position:0%
made it more
 
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
complicated okay thank you director
 
00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:42.559 align:start position:0%
moral um I have somewhat of a concern I
 
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
understand that the process that
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
director Courtney mentioned as far as
 
00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
the board interacting uh with oplc and
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
setting standards for oplc to act but
 
00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned whether or not those
 
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
things that the board is telling oplc
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know if this happens then it's okay
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
to approve if they don't have you know
 
00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:08.120 align:start position:0%
if this is negative and uh do not
 
00:28:11.509 --> 00:28:11.519 align:start position:0%
approve whether those items are actually
 
00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:17.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:20.269 --> 00:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
rules I don't believe so because I
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
haven't seen them but we'll director you
 
00:28:24.909 --> 00:28:24.919 align:start position:0%
have a comment on that they're not in
 
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:27.640 align:start position:0%
the board's rules I would say if if
 
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
that's the position position of the
 
00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:31.519 align:start position:0%
committee we can certainly work with
 
00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
them on that
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
um we did um we have used these
 
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
guidelines um on advice of council over
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Justice for many
 
00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
years um if we are required to send
 
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
every application with a criminal
 
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
history records check for to the board
 
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
of nursing for example that is going to
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
be um that's going to be a lot of work
 
00:28:56.789 --> 00:28:56.799 align:start position:0%
so I think there's some practical issues
 
00:28:59.149 --> 00:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
here and we'd be happy to that's the a
 
00:29:00.509 --> 00:29:00.519 align:start position:0%
directive of the committee we'd be happy
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
to work with them on rules um but we
 
00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
have been operating on advice of council
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
for quite some
 
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.509 align:start position:0%
for quite some
time

00:29:07.509 --> 00:29:07.519 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:12.200 align:start position:0%
M comments questions yes director I
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
think this is a my concern is limited
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
because presumably each of the boards
 
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
have um criteria in their rules for when
 
00:29:24.389 --> 00:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
they are going to U approve or not
 
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
approve of a license it's the concern is
 
00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:29.240 align:start position:0%
simply if they add add something to that
 
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
when they talk to oplc that is not in
 
00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:35.240 align:start position:0%
their rules which is hypop from the
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
comments it appears that it's a matter
 
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
of how to evaluate an imperfect criminal
 
00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
records check and that
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
is something that each board has to
 
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
decide for themselves I was just going
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
to um Echo director Mor's comments you
 
00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
know to the extent that these
 
00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
matrices are you know um have required
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
IR ments that are different from the
 
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
rules or that they should be in the
 
00:30:04.269 --> 00:30:04.279 align:start position:0%
rules then they need to be in the rules
 
00:30:06.509 --> 00:30:06.519 align:start position:0%
but we don't know that until we see
 
00:30:06.519 --> 00:30:09.070 align:start position:0%
but we don't know that until we see
those

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:12.669 --> 00:30:12.679 align:start position:0%
matricies we'll take that under
 
00:30:15.029 --> 00:30:15.039 align:start position:0%
advisement not to continue to add to the
 
00:30:17.549 --> 00:30:17.559 align:start position:0%
confusion but there's a lot of crimes
 
00:30:20.269 --> 00:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
both statutory and under common law and
 
00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
so what we find is that you know there
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
are certain buckets that I think the
 
00:30:26.549 --> 00:30:26.559 align:start position:0%
boards can give us Direction on and the
 
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
issue is whether whether the matter
 
00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
requires consultation that's the issue
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
so what they've said to us is you don't
 
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
need to consult with us on these issues
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
the rest does require consultation and
 
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
we leave those to the boards I I think
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
and and we can certainly talk offline
 
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
but I I I don't know that it would be
 
00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
possible to put every potential crime
 
00:30:51.789 --> 00:30:51.799 align:start position:0%
into a rule because there are many um
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
and then there's aggravating and
 
00:30:55.509 --> 00:30:55.519 align:start position:0%
mitigating factors that we could
 
00:30:58.029 --> 00:30:58.039 align:start position:0%
potentially not consider in that process
 
00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
yes right so so the board could for
 
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
example say you have a 20-year-old
 
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
possession of marijuana we're not going
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
to worry about it if you've got a
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
current uh fenel with intent to sell we
 
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
definitely want to talk about it right
 
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
right light example well just off the
 
00:31:19.629 --> 00:31:19.639 align:start position:0%
top of my head thank you all right any
 
00:31:21.789 --> 00:31:21.799 align:start position:0%
further comments
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
questions all right we have a motion to
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
approve with a consultation and that
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
would be with conditional approval
 
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
conditional approval yes those in favor
 
00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.389 align:start position:0%
conditional approval yes those in favor
I

00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:31:35.399 --> 00:31:38.470 align:start position:0%
I
opposed

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
okay all right PLC
 
00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
3113 we do have some public comment on
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
that uh I think we'll hear from the
 
00:31:50.269 --> 00:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
staff and then the public and then
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
director Court yes um I have no comments
 
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
on this uh proposal the public testimony
 
00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
that I received
 
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
for it um talked about the the the oplc
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
not Consulting with the board of
 
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
acupuncture but it appears that they
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
were given notice with the letter first
 
00:32:13.509 --> 00:32:13.519 align:start position:0%
and then were consulted with for 45
 
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
minutes about these rules excuse me so
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
it did not affect my uh analysis of
 
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
possible reasons for objection all
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
right thank you I if I could add one
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
thing um and taking a look at that
 
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
testimony in the letter that the oplc
 
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
sent to the acupuncture board um
 
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
director uh Courtney did let me know
 
00:32:40.269 --> 00:32:40.279 align:start position:0%
that that same sort of letter went to
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
all of the boards prior to them filing
 
00:32:45.629 --> 00:32:45.639 align:start position:0%
the initial proposal so they did
 
00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
actively seek out feedback from the
 
00:32:51.789 --> 00:32:51.799 align:start position:0%
boards on those rules all
 
00:32:53.629 --> 00:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
right thank
 
00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:03.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh good morning um so I just have a a
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
comment on the uh propos uh I'm sorry my
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
name is Michael Peltier I live in
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro New Hampshire um and I have a
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
comment on the uh substantially similar
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
rule for the plumbing board is that okay
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
we're on target um
 
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
so uh I remotely attended the uh board
 
00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
meeting last week and what the proposal
 
00:33:35.549 --> 00:33:35.559 align:start position:0%
As I understood it was um is if another
 
00:33:40.269 --> 00:33:40.279 align:start position:0%
state has um the same year or subsequent
 
00:33:40.279 --> 00:33:41.950 align:start position:0%
state has um the same year or subsequent
year

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:33:46.029 --> 00:33:46.039 align:start position:0%
um uh Statewide adoption of uh the same
 
00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
plumbing code the international plumbing
 
00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:49.960 align:start position:0%
code that New Hampshire aderes to or has
 
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
adopted um it's presumed to be
 
00:33:56.909 --> 00:33:56.919 align:start position:0%
substantially similar um what um my
 
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
concern is in that respect if um New
 
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh decides for example later
 
00:34:06.669 --> 00:34:06.679 align:start position:0%
this year to adopt the 2024
 
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
IPC uh what used to be substantially
 
00:34:12.069 --> 00:34:12.079 align:start position:0%
similar uh considered substantially
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
similar in the 2021 code is no longer
 
00:34:18.149 --> 00:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
considered substantially similar uh with
 
00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:20.919 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's adoption the 2024 code
 
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
so um what I would suggest is not only
 
00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
the uh current and subsequent codes be
 
00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
recognized as you know sort of de facto
 
00:34:34.349 --> 00:34:34.359 align:start position:0%
uh substantially similar but also the
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
previous year's code
 
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
um you know you know one one can observe
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
that uh the the technology of Plumbing
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh dates back 6,000 years and uh if you
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
brought a a Roman plumber uh forward in
 
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
time to present day he would recognize
 
00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
the principles of gravity and water
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
pressure and so on um so I think that um
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
you know over the past uh several years
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh the technology of of plumbing and the
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
the rules around uh Plumbing safety uh
 
00:35:11.069 --> 00:35:11.079 align:start position:0%
have matured and uh I think that uh
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
recognizing you know uh perhaps previous
 
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
year or previous two two uh versions of
 
00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
the code as well as potentially uh the
 
00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:24.200 align:start position:0%
uniform pum code um would uh would serve
 
00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:26.200 align:start position:0%
the interests uh of the legislature in
 
00:35:28.829 --> 00:35:28.839 align:start position:0%
encouraging uh skill trades people from
 
00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:31.400 align:start position:0%
other states to move to the great state
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
of New
 
00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you I will mention that
 
00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is deliberately not on the
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
latest version of the codes we are now
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
contemplating moving to the 2021 code so
 
00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
Most states will be with us or ahead of
 
00:35:52.109 --> 00:35:52.119 align:start position:0%
us so that while valid I think your
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
concern is less of an issue than it
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
might be if we were trying to be the
 
00:35:59.069 --> 00:35:59.079 align:start position:0%
latest greatest
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
yes but thank you for your comments any
 
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you thank
 
00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:21.880 align:start position:0%
duet my name is Jesse duet I'm the chair
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
of the mechanical board um and I'm just
 
00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
speaking on the 313 as we're here but um
 
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
we just talked about it quite a bit in
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
this past meeting and one of the things
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
that really stuck out to us was giving
 
00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.430 align:start position:0%
that really stuck out to us was giving
licenses

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:43.720 align:start position:0%
to pick a state um and the board we
 
00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
definitely did not like that idea in the
 
00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.910 align:start position:0%
definitely did not like that idea in the
sense

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:36:50.109 --> 00:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
that we're being held to the same
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
standard as and no offense like
 
00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
cosmetology um and what we do is a
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
little bit different there's a lot of
 
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
Life Safety involved um when you're
 
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with gas there's a reason we
 
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
have a gas law in this state and it's
 
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
because bad things happen we are not
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
making sure that people are being held
 
00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
to the same standard that we do require
 
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:14.440 align:start position:0%
in the state of New
 
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um if this is going to be the
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
way it's going to be we would at least
 
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
like to see people come in at least just
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
test just take the test if if you say
 
00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
you're a plumber and you know yourself
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
you should be able to take the test
 
00:37:30.309 --> 00:37:30.319 align:start position:0%
and the biggest thing that we had a
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
bigger concern on was New Hampshire law
 
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
which there should be some sort of a
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
Juris Prudence test um and we did vote
 
00:37:40.829 --> 00:37:40.839 align:start position:0%
in this past meeting to actually start
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
putting together one um we were not even
 
00:37:45.309 --> 00:37:45.319 align:start position:0%
aware that that was something that we
 
00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
could do uh we are now aware of that and
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
we would definitely like to see I guess
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
those would be the two biggest things
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
that if great if you have a license in
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
another state but
 
00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:00.079 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean you know what you're
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
doing here in New Hampshire so we would
 
00:38:04.109 --> 00:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
like to see them be able to take the
 
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
test and then some sort of a jurist
 
00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:08.309 align:start position:0%
test and then some sort of a jurist
Prudence

00:38:08.309 --> 00:38:08.319 align:start position:0%
Prudence
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
test will you when you develop that
 
00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
jurist Prudence test will you be
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
requiring it of New Hampshire applicants
 
00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.550 align:start position:0%
requiring it of New Hampshire applicants
as

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:38:18.589 --> 00:38:18.599 align:start position:0%
well um that is covered in the testing
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
that they take in the schooling that
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
they take here in New
 
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you very much for your
 
00:38:55.829 --> 00:38:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:59.069 --> 00:38:59.079 align:start position:0%
Evans Can't prepare
 
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
he's a pro yeah we deal with him
 
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
before good morning my name is Ted Evans
 
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:09.160 align:start position:0%

00:39:12.589 --> 00:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
appearances before you uh with me is um
 
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%

Plumbing gas bers Etc other companies
 
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:36.200 align:start position:0%
that are on our committee and on our
 
00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
association with the plumbing gas
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
Fitters HVAC Association of New
 
00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so um we attended the hearing
 
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
on the proposed um rules for the 33 PLC
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
31334 to be
 
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
specific uh with regard to the
 
00:39:58.910 --> 00:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
mechanical licensing board and we have
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
some comments uh further comments uh
 
00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
based on uh the final version that we've
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
seen be looking at uh the first thing is
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
that we appreciate that the references
 
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:15.640 align:start position:0%
to the current additions of the code or
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
later was incorporated in the change in
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
the rules but we do have some
 
00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
suggestions on a better way to say it in
 
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
in that paragraph one um the original
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
language that landed in the final
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
version was those codes adopted by the
 
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
legislature in accordance with it with
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
for residential and Commercial
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
properties but we think the more precise
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
thing to do would be to reference the um
 
00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:43.839 align:start position:0%
definition of the State Building Code in
 
00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
RSA 155a
 
00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:49.480 align:start position:0%
paragraph 4 and
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
4A and the New Hampshire State Fire code
 
00:40:57.870 --> 00:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
RSA 153 colon 1 paragraph 6A where it
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
specifies what addition of the code is
 
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
currently in law and we think that's a
 
00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
better way to do that especially because
 
00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature is considering moving to
 
00:41:12.109 --> 00:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
the 21 codes both on the um ICC side the
 
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
building code and also on the fire code
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
which covers the gas so we think that's
 
00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:19.640 align:start position:0%
a little bit more precise way to word it
 
00:41:22.589 --> 00:41:22.599 align:start position:0%
we sure the attorneys on the committee
 
00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
will appreciate
 
00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:27.640 align:start position:0%
that uh the term residential commercial
 
00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
is just kind of vague and uh the codes
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
that we adopt in New Hampshire include
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
other types of buildings
 
00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
institutional storage things that aren't
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily refer to uh be included in
 
00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:43.309 align:start position:0%
necessarily refer to uh be included in
residential

00:41:43.309 --> 00:41:43.319 align:start position:0%
residential
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
commercial um paragraph two uh we were
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
asking for uh at the time what we
 
00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:52.119 align:start position:0%
thought was a some qualifying event to
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
verify the applicant is familiar with
 
00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
the board's administrative rules
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
especally especially the the 600 rules
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh Etc and um the response was that uh
 
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
the board does not appear to require a
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
jurist Prudence examination so no exam
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
has been
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
added subsequent to that we found out
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
there's a name for this a Juris Prudence
 
00:42:15.069 --> 00:42:15.079 align:start position:0%
examination we didn't know that at the
 
00:42:16.829 --> 00:42:16.839 align:start position:0%
time and the board didn't know that now
 
00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:19.240 align:start position:0%
they know it and they voted to develop
 
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
one and our request is that that be
 
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
included in this final version of the
 
00:42:28.589 --> 00:42:28.599 align:start position:0%
rules a juren prudent exam and when the
 
00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
board has approved one it'll be ready to
 
00:42:33.549 --> 00:42:33.559 align:start position:0%
be used uh for that
 
00:42:37.549 --> 00:42:37.559 align:start position:0%
purpose so rather than um delay and make
 
00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:39.800 align:start position:0%
us go through the the full rule process
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
for that little change we ask that that
 
00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:44.910 align:start position:0%
for that little change we ask that that
be

00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
included um the reason for this uh part
 
00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:49.640 align:start position:0%
of some of the reasons for this is the
 
00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
response said that well uh once they're
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
licensed uh they'll be going to continue
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
education and be come uh learned or they
 
00:43:01.589 --> 00:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
will learn all about their rules and law
 
00:43:03.549 --> 00:43:03.559 align:start position:0%
in these continuing education
 
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
classes but that's really not going to
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
work first of all it has to be
 
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
understood that if if an applicant is
 
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
issued a license from another
 
00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:13.839 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction let's say in June of
 
00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
24 they'll be able to operate and
 
00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:20.680 align:start position:0%
practice until June of 26 May or June of
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
26 before they attend both classes for
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
both years yes there's a class for each
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
year but they're not required to to
 
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
attend it in that year they can pick up
 
00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:31.720 align:start position:0%
two classes in the second year that's
 
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
and that's I would say maybe 20 30% of
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
the of the trades people do that they
 
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
wait they don't take it every year they
 
00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
wait until they have to renew oh I have
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
to get my classes in and then the
 
00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
providers of this service make both
 
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
years classes available so so somebody
 
00:43:52.829 --> 00:43:52.839 align:start position:0%
could be running around without being
 
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
aware of the board's uh administrative
 
00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.790 align:start position:0%
aware of the board's uh administrative
rules

00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:43:59.670 --> 00:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
secondly I think it already been pointed
 
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
out that the board does have these kinds
 
00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
of questions covering law and
 
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
administrative rules on their
 
00:44:08.549 --> 00:44:08.559 align:start position:0%
examinations for New Hampshire
 
00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:11.720 align:start position:0%
applicants so we have to I think make
 
00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:15.800 align:start position:0%
this equal and safe at the same
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
time um the part of the reply that said
 
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
that in any event professionally the uh
 
00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
the ly would be professionally obligated
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
to comply with the applicable code
 
00:44:30.829 --> 00:44:30.839 align:start position:0%
um I I think that just ignores the
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
public safety aspect of this licensing
 
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
program we're we're installing gas
 
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
appliances we're doing plumbing and some
 
00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:42.079 align:start position:0%
of us do electrical uh and there's a a a
 
00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
pure Public Safety interest involved
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
that I think should
 
00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
overrule um thoughts like oh yeah
 
00:44:51.309 --> 00:44:51.319 align:start position:0%
they'll just learn and on their way so
 
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh and just to uh illuminate the board's
 
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
600 rules called Professional Standards
 
00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
um include things like uh what we call
 
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
Professional obligations and that is the
 
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
things they're required to do uh we have
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
um ongoing requirements for licenses uh
 
00:45:13.109 --> 00:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
advertising obligations prohibited
 
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
actions what they're not allowed to do
 
00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
as lenses and then in 608 the duty to
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
notify and this is an obligation to um
 
00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
correct uh um situations that are uh a
 
00:45:30.549 --> 00:45:30.559 align:start position:0%
risk to life
 
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
safety and by notifying the owner in
 
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
writing uh specifically and then if we
 
00:45:38.349 --> 00:45:38.359 align:start position:0%
don't get action from the owner they're
 
00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:41.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to notify a local official or a
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
Fire official of this dangerous
 
00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:46.280 align:start position:0%
situation and uh remove the equipment
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
from service if possible so you don't
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
see that in other states I'm sorry that
 
00:45:52.109 --> 00:45:52.119 align:start position:0%
was something that was developed by the
 
00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
department of safety when we were under
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
them and it's pretty specific and I
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
think it really does um lead to the
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
aspect of public safety I think that we
 
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
think that if if this is omitted uh that
 
00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:08.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to be creating and fostering
 
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm trying not to get lost
 
00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:24.200 align:start position:0%
here I'm sorry I I was we were very uh
 
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
inclusive in our
 
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
comments um
 
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
um so number four uh eligibility
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
requirements for gas fitting
 
00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:37.240 align:start position:0%
licenses um we made a comment that there
 
00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
were there were no exams required in the
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
in the rule writing uh the response was
 
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
uh there are no rules for or
 
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
requirements for examinations for the
 
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
gas fitting we all dropped our Jaws when
 
00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:53.480 align:start position:0%
we read that because uh that is not was
 
00:46:55.549 --> 00:46:55.559 align:start position:0%
not our understanding we think that's an
 
00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:01.160 align:start position:0%
error uh and uh the board's rule uh
 
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
requires in MEC 3044 under required
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
supporting materials for licensing uh in
 
00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
paragraph G number three proof of
 
00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
successful completion of the license
 
00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
exam taken at the end of the courses the
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
endorsement is being applied so there is
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
testing um in number five uh we asked
 
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
for the inclusion of con continuing
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
education requirements as uh
 
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
constituting the word similar
 
00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
requirements uh the response was not
 
00:47:38.349 --> 00:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
reasonable that only individuals from
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions uh require continuation be
 
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
eligible once licensed again they're
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
obligated to comply with the continuing
 
00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.390 align:start position:0%
obligated to comply with the continuing
education

00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
requirements uh and all lenses are
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
required to comply with the codes Etc
 
00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
but we feel perhaps some additional
 
00:47:57.549 --> 00:47:57.559 align:start position:0%
explanation is necessary the IC C and
 
00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
NFPA codes the ICC would be the plumbing
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
code and the NFPA would be the gas code
 
00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh that have been adopted in New
 
00:48:06.589 --> 00:48:06.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are published on a three-year
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
cycle with new requirements and or
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
change requ is that a jurisdiction might
 
00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
have adopted the same code as New
 
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now currently but the ly from
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
that jurisdiction may have been licensed
 
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
years earlier under an older addition of
 
00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
the code or perhaps some other code
 
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
entirely it might have been in effect at
 
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
the time they were like licensed without
 
00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
some kind of form of continuing
 
00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:32.440 align:start position:0%
education on those changes the leny
 
00:48:34.109 --> 00:48:34.119 align:start position:0%
would not have been required to keep up
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
with those changes it's possible that
 
00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
licenses in other jurisdictions are also
 
00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
issued under grandfathering conditions
 
00:48:44.829 --> 00:48:44.839 align:start position:0%
which creates more concerns we have
 
00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:46.559 align:start position:0%
continuing aging requirements once they
 
00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
are licensed here but the but again they
 
00:48:50.789 --> 00:48:50.799 align:start position:0%
can be here for quite a while before
 
00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:53.240 align:start position:0%
getting up to speed uh and it might take
 
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
a while excuse me quite a while to get
 
00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
up to speed if relying only on
 
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
continuing education classes and the
 
00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:01.839 align:start position:0%
so-called professional
 
00:49:03.789 --> 00:49:03.799 align:start position:0%
obligations uh as you might be able to
 
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
tell we were not fans of this change in
 
00:49:08.789 --> 00:49:08.799 align:start position:0%
the legislation legislation giving out
 
00:49:12.309 --> 00:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
licenses to other jurisdiction license
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
holders um and and we're not the same as
 
00:49:21.309 --> 00:49:21.319 align:start position:0%
cosmetology or massage therapy please
 
00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
understand we have a serious Public
 
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
Safety concern here about this licensing
 
00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
and I think thank you entertain any
 
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
questions Madam chair just so everyone
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
knows if you take a look at page 31 of
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%
the FP packet um these comments relate
 
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:49.470 align:start position:0%

yes that's on my sheet in the
 
00:49:56.789 --> 00:49:56.799 align:start position:0%
top right that's professions regular
 
00:49:58.750 --> 00:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
ated by the mechanical licensing board
 
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
there okay other uh any other questions
 
00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:09.309 align:start position:0%
there okay other uh any other questions
or

00:50:09.309 --> 00:50:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:29.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair Lindsay Courtney
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
executive director office of
 
00:50:32.109 --> 00:50:32.119 align:start position:0%
professional lice Insurance
 
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
certification um so a couple of things I
 
00:50:38.109 --> 00:50:38.119 align:start position:0%
just want to um set the stage this the
 
00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
results uh these rules are a direct
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
result of the legislation that e folks
 
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
passed last year HB 594 which
 
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
essentially requires the office to issue
 
00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:50.200 align:start position:0%
a license to individuals who are
 
00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
licensed and in good standing in another
 
00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:55.720 align:start position:0%
state uh with substantially similar uh
 
00:50:57.870 --> 00:50:57.880 align:start position:0%
requirements as determined by the
 
00:50:59.470 --> 00:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
executive director enroll in
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
consultation with the board's councils
 
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
and commissions so we um and and I think
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
as you may recall This was um very high
 
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
priority on the governor's uh
 
00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:11.720 align:start position:0%
initiatives for last year and an effort
 
00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
to reduce barriers to Workforce um and
 
00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:16.760 align:start position:0%
allow qualified people to enter um
 
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
Workforce in New Hampshire in a
 
00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:20.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable time frame so initially we
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
had some interm roles we identified
 
00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
several professions I think about 10 um
 
00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
that we thought uh would have the
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
greatest impact and we focused on those
 
00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:32.200 align:start position:0%
we filed some interm rules in October
 
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
those rules have expired as of April
 
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
12th um So currently we have no
 
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
endorsement requirements in the state of
 
00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and then what we did is um
 
00:51:44.789 --> 00:51:44.799 align:start position:0%
taking Our obligation to consult with
 
00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:47.720 align:start position:0%
the boards very seriously is that I went
 
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
through every Statute in New Hampshire
 
00:51:53.309 --> 00:51:53.319 align:start position:0%
and developed a draft of what I thought
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
would be substantially similar based on
 
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
the stat statutory requirements I sent
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
an individual letter to each board prior
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
prior to filing the IP in October I
 
00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:08.559 align:start position:0%
asked for um feedback and or meeting um
 
00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
and many boards we did meet with I did
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
meet with mechanical I met with
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
acupuncture I met with many boards who
 
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
were interested in participating in this
 
00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
conversation sometime around January we
 
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
filed the IP again we notified the
 
00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:25.400 align:start position:0%
boards this was our draft uh and we
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
invited additional comments so I do
 
00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
believe that we um did everything we
 
00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:31.839 align:start position:0%
could to fulfill the statutory
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
requirement that we consult with the
 
00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:36.280 align:start position:0%
boards and we did incorporate the
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
feedback HB 594 requirements are not
 
00:52:41.829 --> 00:52:41.839 align:start position:0%
specific to certain professions they
 
00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
apply to all professions as long as
 
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
they're substantially similar
 
00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
requirements so not only does it apply
 
00:52:50.589 --> 00:52:50.599 align:start position:0%
to Mechanical it applies to cosmetology
 
00:52:52.109 --> 00:52:52.119 align:start position:0%
massage but it also applies to
 
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
Physicians it applies to pharmacists it
 
00:52:56.789 --> 00:52:56.799 align:start position:0%
applies to also other safety sens
 
00:52:58.470 --> 00:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
position so the directive from the
 
00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:01.720 align:start position:0%
legislature was very clear if there are
 
00:53:04.109 --> 00:53:04.119 align:start position:0%
professions in other states that are
 
00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
substantially similar to our professions
 
00:53:08.589 --> 00:53:08.599 align:start position:0%
and our requirements here we are to
 
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
issue a
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
license the statute was also clear that
 
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
the really the only requirement is that
 
00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
they have a license and good standing in
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
another state we have existing statutory
 
00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:21.720 align:start position:0%
authority to establish fees so we
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
thought okay at least they have to fill
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
out an application and pay a fee and the
 
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
statute also said that if the person is
 
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
required to undergo a criminal history
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
records check in New Hampshire to get an
 
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
initial license we're going to require
 
00:53:35.549 --> 00:53:35.559 align:start position:0%
that of our endorsement applicants there
 
00:53:38.589 --> 00:53:38.599 align:start position:0%
is no language that would authorize the
 
00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
office to uh impose additional
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
requirements um but what we and and so I
 
00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
think we are taking some Liberty with
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
respect to Juris Prudence exams but the
 
00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
position we took with the boards is that
 
00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:53.839 align:start position:0%
if the board has an existing Jance
 
00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
prints exam if the laws in New Hampshire
 
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
de deviate significantly or impose
 
00:54:00.589 --> 00:54:00.599 align:start position:0%
additional requirements that people need
 
00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
to be aware of in order to practice
 
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
safely we're going to try to put that in
 
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
the role and a prime example of that is
 
00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:07.640 align:start position:0%
psychology or the other Mental Health
 
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
Professions where there's different
 
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
there's there's differences in the law
 
00:54:14.109 --> 00:54:14.119 align:start position:0%
for practice purposes as to duty to
 
00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:16.280 align:start position:0%
notify duty to inform confidentiality
 
00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:17.720 align:start position:0%
requirements so we thought that was
 
00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable that said I think an argument
 
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
could be made that we don't have that
 
00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:23.720 align:start position:0%
seary Authority so that's the position
 
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
we took with the boards um that if you
 
00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
have an existing Prudence exam and it is
 
00:54:30.349 --> 00:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
based on specific New Hampshire law and
 
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
not just a smoke screen for another
 
00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
licensing examination then we will we
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
will add that so that that's basically
 
00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
how this played out originally with
 
00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:43.640 align:start position:0%
respect to Mechanical we didn't have a
 
00:54:47.349 --> 00:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
requirement that the code be um the same
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
addition or later that was added after
 
00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:51.400 align:start position:0%
we consulted with the boards and at
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
their request and I think that's
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable um to do so
 
00:54:58.270 --> 00:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
um but the mechanical licensing board
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
does not currently have a Juris Prudence
 
00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:02.440 align:start position:0%
exam I would be I would be happy to put
 
00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
that in in the rules uh if in when they
 
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
develop a Juris Prudence exam that
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
applies to all applicants um but if we
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
were to add that in the rules now I
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
think that would uh impede our ability
 
00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
to actually issue licenses under PLC 313
 
00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
is because they haven't developed the
 
00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:21.400 align:start position:0%
the licensing examination so my
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
suggestion is that if and when they do
 
00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:25.720 align:start position:0%
develop this JP exam and it it is
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
specific to newtra law that we go back
 
00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:31.480 align:start position:0%
and we uh open up the rules again um and
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
rules I think that's all I wanted to say
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:51.160 align:start position:0%
you okay Senator agay wondering got any
 
00:55:54.270 --> 00:55:54.280 align:start position:0%
comments on this side of the room no we
 
00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
have no comments
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
second I'd like to add to that
 
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
um that if a jurist Prudence exam is
 
00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:13.160 align:start position:0%
developed it be added to the rule in a
 
00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:14.190 align:start position:0%
developed it be added to the rule in a
timely

00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:14.200 align:start position:0%
timely
 
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
manner I accept that
 
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:24.200 align:start position:0%
you U I did have a question for director
 
00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
Courtney the testimony IND ated that
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
the there is a test for gas Fitters as
 
00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
part of the their licensing
 
00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
procedure is that something that needs
 
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
to be added or ought to be uh ought to
 
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.549 align:start position:0%
to be added or ought to be uh ought to
be

00:56:41.549 --> 00:56:41.559 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
added so I think so I think the test it
 
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
so the statute doesn't specifically
 
00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:49.160 align:start position:0%
require an examination and that's what
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
we were looking at as a statutory
 
00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:53.319 align:start position:0%
requirements interestingly what we found
 
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
during our analysis is that some board
 
00:56:59.309 --> 00:56:59.319 align:start position:0%
by either practice or rule had
 
00:57:02.829 --> 00:57:02.839 align:start position:0%
established um requirements that
 
00:57:05.029 --> 00:57:05.039 align:start position:0%
exceeded what was authorized by Statute
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
and so that that has facilitated some
 
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
additional discussions I think the
 
00:57:11.829 --> 00:57:11.839 align:start position:0%
examination piece is part of the actual
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
program and the education requirements
 
00:57:16.349 --> 00:57:16.359 align:start position:0%
so when we did the analysis um it wasn't
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
a statutory requirement um I that is
 
00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
feedback that I had not personally
 
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
received um so I mean we would be open
 
00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
to adding an examination but our
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the examination is
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
at the conclusion of the course and is
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
part and parcel of the course and is not
 
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
examination do does the mechanical
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
licensing board have the authority to
 
00:57:45.470 --> 00:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
add requirements in addition to those in
 
00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
statute because some boards do and I
 
00:57:49.309 --> 00:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
don't believe all of them do I don't
 
00:57:54.029 --> 00:57:54.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative representing fora so I do
 
00:57:59.950 --> 00:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
have a question if for example there is
 
00:58:03.390 --> 00:58:03.400 align:start position:0%
a Jud jurist Prudence test that is
 
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
accepted how do
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
we it would be put in
 
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
rules and then you would come forward to
 
00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
How would how does that happen what's
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
the mechanism for that so many boards
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
have Juris Prudence exams and many
 
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
boards have drafted them on their own um
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
we've we've tried to get away from that
 
00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:25.559 align:start position:0%
and actually utilize experts in drafting
 
00:58:27.069 --> 00:58:27.079 align:start position:0%
tests because because that can be that's
 
00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
a specific technique and what we do is
 
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
we have a contract where um we're moving
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
all of those exams uh to a contractor to
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
be able to allow the the applicant to
 
00:58:42.589 --> 00:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
access the test at any given time um so
 
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
they don't have to wait quarterly to
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
take the examination so the requirement
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
to take the jurus Prudence exam is put
 
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
forth in rules but the actual questions
 
00:58:54.829 --> 00:58:54.839 align:start position:0%
are are not but this but the scope of
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
the test is as specified by the board
 
00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
the scope of the task has specified the
 
00:59:02.029 --> 00:59:02.039 align:start position:0%
board a true jurist Prudence exam will
 
00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
be about New Hampshire laws what we've
 
00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
seen in reviewing some of the exams is
 
00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:07.960 align:start position:0%
that there's they're about New Hampshire
 
00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:09.400 align:start position:0%
law and then they're about the practice
 
00:59:11.069 --> 00:59:11.079 align:start position:0%
of the profession so we're trying to get
 
00:59:13.710 --> 00:59:13.720 align:start position:0%
the boards to limit it to to New
 
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire laws and specifically their
 
00:59:19.230 --> 00:59:19.240 align:start position:0%
rules thank you other
 
00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:23.430 align:start position:0%
rules thank you other
questions

00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
comments thank you for your time okay
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
okay M Mr ranard you're wishing to
 
00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
testify and didn't bother to turn your
 
00:59:43.029 --> 00:59:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:45.069 --> 00:59:45.079 align:start position:0%
earlier thank you madam chair my name is

Step ranor I'm a license electrician
 
00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
state of Hampshire and represent the
 
00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
ecba electrical contractors Business
 
00:59:53.069 --> 00:59:53.079 align:start position:0%
Association I just was from a procedural
 
00:59:54.270 --> 00:59:54.280 align:start position:0%
standpoint I would just hope that the
 
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
board would consider this the committee
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
that we've been told to many of us that
 
01:00:01.309 --> 01:00:01.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of these things are not in our law
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
and Courtney is right the executive
 
01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
director is right if you look in the law
 
01:00:06.109 --> 01:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
it's not in there the procedure has been
 
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
for the 40 years I've been licensed that
 
01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
you put the basic in the law you defined
 
01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
it in the rules houseful 594 554 which
 
01:00:17.230 --> 01:00:17.240 align:start position:0%
passed last year which made these
 
01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
widespread changes okay happened and now
 
01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
we're now we're getting that kind of
 
01:00:23.589 --> 01:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
pushed back at us but they didn't do
 
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
anything to fix it there's not been
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
enough time to fix the laws many of the
 
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
boards have the same thing so I just
 
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
hope the committee considers that
 
01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
because we're putting this through
 
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
saying oh it's not in the law it's not
 
01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:35.720 align:start position:0%
in the law because we didn't do anything
 
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
there's been no effort to try to fix the
 
01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
law just tell us it's not in it we ran
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
into the same thing with some education
 
01:00:43.029 --> 01:00:43.039 align:start position:0%
we worked through some Waring with them
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
that isn't the best we want but it was
 
01:00:47.589 --> 01:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
it was compromised and that's what you
 
01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:49.720 align:start position:0%
have to do but so there hasn't been any
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
time to fix the rules and put the stuff
 
01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
in the law that they want we're just
 
01:00:56.589 --> 01:00:56.599 align:start position:0%
looking at this legally when for 30
 
01:00:58.270 --> 01:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
years and 40 years it's been like this
 
01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:00.200 align:start position:0%
so maybe this committee maybe the
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
legislature can try to fix that and
 
01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
before we just sweep through this maybe
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
you look at addressing some of these or
 
01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
at least going forward I just think that
 
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
we keep talking about it's not in the
 
01:01:11.309 --> 01:01:11.319 align:start position:0%
law not in the law but it never was the
 
01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
change happened and now we're here we
 
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
never had time to fix the law so so what
 
01:01:18.109 --> 01:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
sort of thing are you saying is not in
 
01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
the law that you believe needs to be in
 
01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
the licensing procedure for an
 
01:01:25.589 --> 01:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
electrician the for an electrician in
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
general continue education is important
 
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
like I said there's a big gap there when
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
that happens we have 19 amendments right
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
now with the electrical so if they come
 
01:01:34.589 --> 01:01:34.599 align:start position:0%
in and they're not aware of them and
 
01:01:36.309 --> 01:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
they're not installing by him we just
 
01:01:38.589 --> 01:01:38.599 align:start position:0%
had a situation in one of the town where
 
01:01:40.109 --> 01:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
somebody installed above and beyond the
 
01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
code because it was amended out and now
 
01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:43.480 align:start position:0%
they're having troubles with it I know
 
01:01:46.829 --> 01:01:46.839 align:start position:0%
you'll be surprised arals right and so
 
01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
these are important to continue
 
01:01:50.069 --> 01:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
education for us and again we worked it
 
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
out there was a schooling hours um she
 
01:01:53.470 --> 01:01:53.480 align:start position:0%
did meet with the board the executive
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
director and they came to an agreement
 
01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
so what they did is we tried listed the
 
01:01:59.269 --> 01:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
schooling hours as a requirement with
 
01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:01.160 align:start position:0%
the substantial equivalent which was
 
01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
less than what's required and our rules
 
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
right now but something that was
 
01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:07.480 align:start position:0%
substantially equivalent and we were
 
01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
told we can't put it in there because
 
01:02:12.910 --> 01:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
our law doesn't say it so we the
 
01:02:14.670 --> 01:02:14.680 align:start position:0%
compromise was they put it into the top
 
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
part PLC
 
01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
31324 is the section for us and they
 
01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:21.640 align:start position:0%
added it in so it's part of the 8,000
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
hours now so technically they only need
 
01:02:25.549 --> 01:02:25.559 align:start position:0%
7,400 hours of OJT and they could in
 
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
five 60 hours of school not the 8,000
 
01:02:30.829 --> 01:02:30.839 align:start position:0%
hours of OJT and schooling and I'm just
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
giving you this as an example this is so
 
01:02:35.870 --> 01:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
it it goes throughout all of the boards
 
01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
and professions as you've seen with the
 
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
mechanical and stuff it's not just us we
 
01:02:42.069 --> 01:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
jumped ahead with hille 594 and then
 
01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:43.640 align:start position:0%
never gave it a chance to catch up
 
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
saying okay for now on we need all these
 
01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:48.200 align:start position:0%
things in the law okay ours is clearly
 
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
defined in rules what the schooling
 
01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
requirement is the Bo decides how many
 
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
hours safety blah blah
 
01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:55.480 align:start position:0%
blah previously the legislature didn't
 
01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
want all that information a lot because
 
01:02:58.510 --> 01:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
every time there's a little change you
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
got to come back to the legislature to
 
01:03:03.269 --> 01:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
do it so I just would hope the committee
 
01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
considers that going forward to all this
 
01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
and take that into account before we
 
01:03:09.269 --> 01:03:09.279 align:start position:0%
just push it Forward because it's not in
 
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
our law I would say that having only
 
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
7500 hours of Hands-On work and 500
 
01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
hours of education is substantially
 
01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
similar that's why we came to a
 
01:03:22.349 --> 01:03:22.359 align:start position:0%
compromise I'm not disagreeing you know
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
it's we don't we don't want to insists
 
01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
that we'll only accept people from
 
01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
states that have identical requirements
 
01:03:35.069 --> 01:03:35.079 align:start position:0%
we want to say it covers the same
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
material it's substantially similar
 
01:03:39.789 --> 01:03:39.799 align:start position:0%
that's but the education part is
 
01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
important with the that and you made
 
01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:45.400 align:start position:0%
that point and it's it's agreed yeah but
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
it's not in our laws because it wasn't
 
01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:49.160 align:start position:0%
necessary to be in the laws before and I
 
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
agree substantial equivalent we talked
 
01:03:52.510 --> 01:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
about defining that and there was much
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
discussion about it there is ways to be
 
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
clear with that make it very easy easy
 
01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
but you can just put time frames in you
 
01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
know if you've been licensed for 10
 
01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
years ours even has it in our RSA I
 
01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:02.599 align:start position:0%
believe are the rules that if you've
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
been licensed for 10 years that
 
01:04:05.470 --> 01:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
qualifies you to come and get reciprocal
 
01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
you don't have to have all that stuff so
 
01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:09.640 align:start position:0%
you know experience does count in our
 
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
particular section it talks about they
 
01:04:12.829 --> 01:04:12.839 align:start position:0%
have to be license in their state for a
 
01:04:15.269 --> 01:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
year so that covers the additional 2,000
 
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
hours that they would have so that was
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
why the compromise was made and we
 
01:04:20.549 --> 01:04:20.559 align:start position:0%
appreciate lindsy working with us and
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
coming up with that but just wanted you
 
01:04:24.589 --> 01:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
to realize that it's never going to be
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
in the law because it's changed too fast
 
01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
that's there's a lot going on thank you
 
01:04:31.109 --> 01:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony any
 
01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
other comments
 
01:04:38.069 --> 01:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
questions Mr Evans you you wish to speak
 
01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
again Madam chair if I could for just a
 
01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
second um if you look at Mr Evans
 
01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
testimony on item number one um he makes
 
01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
a recommendation to change the rules
 
01:04:53.549 --> 01:04:53.559 align:start position:0%
there uh currently it requires that the
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
um licensing jurisdiction of the State
 
01:04:58.510 --> 01:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
shall use the same addition or later of
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
the same plumbing and fuel gas codes I
 
01:05:04.349 --> 01:05:04.359 align:start position:0%
don't think that's exactly the same as
 
01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
the State Building Code and fire code
 
01:05:08.269 --> 01:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
that he has referenced in his
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
recommendation for language actually the
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
plumbing code is part of the State
 
01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
Building Code okay and the gas code is I
 
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
believe part of the state fire code
 
01:05:20.309 --> 01:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
perfect um and we are in the process of
 
01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
updating both of
 
01:05:25.069 --> 01:05:25.079 align:start position:0%
those Mr Evans I just want to respond to
 
01:05:27.269 --> 01:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
a comination that a comment that uh the
 
01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
director made that there is no Authority
 
01:05:32.309 --> 01:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
for license examinations in the
 
01:05:36.829 --> 01:05:36.839 align:start position:0%
law under 15329 titled examinations
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
licenses and it basically says the
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
board shall established through
 
01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
rulemaking pursuant to RSA 54 541a the
 
01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
nature of the examinations required for
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
issuance of fuel gas fitter licenses and
 
01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
plumbers licenses the scope of such
 
01:05:55.269 --> 01:05:55.279 align:start position:0%
examinations and the methods of
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
proceeding proced shall be prescribed by
 
01:05:59.150 --> 01:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
the board and this may include an
 
01:06:01.309 --> 01:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
outside organization approved by the
 
01:06:05.549 --> 01:06:05.559 align:start position:0%
board so they are required so what what
 
01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
is that citation again please I'm
 
01:06:15.150 --> 01:06:15.160 align:start position:0%
sorry the citation is uh RSA 153 col 29
 
01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:23.910 align:start position:0%
sorry the citation is uh RSA 153 col 29
paragraph

01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:29.589 --> 01:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
so has the board done so
 
01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
yes you can let the there is still here
 
01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
or not but uh I think he would agree
 
01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:41.839 align:start position:0%
that we do license for all examinations
 
01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:48.549 --> 01:06:48.559 align:start position:0%
fitting okay so I was surprised to see
 
01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:49.799 align:start position:0%
that and I was surprised to hear the
 
01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
director say that that's all I have okay
 
01:07:03.069 --> 01:07:03.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
Lindy cording executive director oplc um
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
I did um not include this previously but
 
01:07:13.269 --> 01:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
we are happy to um modify
 
01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
313 um. 34 to specifically reference the
 
01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
actual rsas we're happy to do that I
 
01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
agree that I think that's more
 
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
transparent and easier for the public um
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
with the respect to the examination
 
01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
issue I think the challenge that and I'm
 
01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
happy to add past the state approved
 
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
examination I I think for gas feds the
 
01:07:36.349 --> 01:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
challenge is we don't have an actual so
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
we have a contract right now and
 
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
everybody who um takes uh takes the
 
01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:43.640 align:start position:0%
Examination for journeyman for example
 
01:07:44.910 --> 01:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
they go through that contract it's a
 
01:07:46.750 --> 01:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
state standardized test what I
 
01:07:48.109 --> 01:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
understand and Mr Evans can correct me
 
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong is that the examination is
 
01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
given as part and parcel of the actual
 
01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
course and so they may not it's not
 
01:07:58.630 --> 01:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily one Statewide exam that
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
everybody has to take if we want to add
 
01:08:03.549 --> 01:08:03.559 align:start position:0%
pass a state approved examination we can
 
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
do that for those who are endorsing in
 
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
um based on the RSA that he referenced
 
01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
but I think I think that's currently the
 
01:08:13.069 --> 01:08:13.079 align:start position:0%
challenge the scope of our contractual
 
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
obligations for standardized tests does
 
01:08:18.510 --> 01:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
not include um gas Fitters the other
 
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
thing that I would mention and just
 
01:08:21.789 --> 01:08:21.799 align:start position:0%
briefly is I think what we're I think
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
what you're probably seeing is that um
 
01:08:27.390 --> 01:08:27.400 align:start position:0%
as Authority has shifter of the office
 
01:08:29.550 --> 01:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
we're we're we're diving into the
 
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
statutes and we're seeing um that uh
 
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
there's been some what I call regulatory
 
01:08:38.829 --> 01:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
drift you know there's been some um
 
01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
historic practices that don't
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily line up with statutory
 
01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
Authority and specific to electricians
 
01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
for example their statute authorized
 
01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
them to give credit um toward the 8,000
 
01:08:53.669 --> 01:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
hours for education but it doesn't
 
01:08:56.349 --> 01:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
require education and so when we are
 
01:08:58.430 --> 01:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
looking at the statutes in terms of
 
01:09:00.829 --> 01:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
what's substantially similar we can't
 
01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
require that the other state um require
 
01:09:06.269 --> 01:09:06.279 align:start position:0%
education because we don't require
 
01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
education and that's been the historic
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
practice but that's that's actually a
 
01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
deviation from statute I can't in good
 
01:09:15.229 --> 01:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
faith uh make it you know make an
 
01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:17.080 align:start position:0%
argument that we should just continue
 
01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:20.199 align:start position:0%
the practice and so I think what um what
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
we're currently working on is really
 
01:09:23.550 --> 01:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
trying to come together with the boards
 
01:09:27.070 --> 01:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
to clean up the sor practices um that
 
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
deviate from statute either by changing
 
01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
the statute to be in accordance with the
 
01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
intent is or by modifying the rules but
 
01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
obviously that that takes that takes
 
01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:40.229 align:start position:0%
obviously that that takes that takes
time

01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
okay okay further comments
 
01:09:46.669 --> 01:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
questions okay we have a motion to
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
approve the rule with
 
01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
the uh addition that the Juris Prudence
 
01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.590 align:start position:0%
the uh addition that the Juris Prudence
exam

01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
exam
 
01:09:57.149 --> 01:09:57.159 align:start position:0%
once uh included will be once developed
 
01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
included Madam chair did you want to add
 
01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
um um director Courtney had said that
 
01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
she was willing to amend to include the
 
01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
reference to the statutes um in that
 
01:10:13.149 --> 01:10:13.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:15.790 --> 01:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
31334 I'll make that motion if we need a
 
01:10:19.149 --> 01:10:19.159 align:start position:0%
motion well
 
01:10:22.030 --> 01:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
I'll Senator gray you'll accept that
 
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
well he's he's ah well that is a shame
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
on his behalf on his behalf yes thank
 
01:10:30.990 --> 01:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
you all right any further comments
 
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.990 align:start position:0%
you all right any further comments
questions

01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
discussion representative fellows is in
 
01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:39.080 align:start position:0%
for Senator gray since he Ste out May I
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
just clarify do you want me to add the
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
state approved exam piece for
 
01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
gasfitters can you know can I can I just
 
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
raise a question on that I I I guess I
 
01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
have a concern that if we do that that
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
that may be inconsistent with the the
 
01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
sort of intent of the statute in other
 
01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
words it you know and I obviously I have
 
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
no expertise in this area but I the the
 
01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
only analogy I can come to is the bar
 
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
exam if you say that we're going to
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
allow people from uh from other state to
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
become lawyers in New Hampshire as long
 
01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
as they take the bar exam that's that's
 
01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
a big discouragement to having out of
 
01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
state lawyers come to New Hampshire so I
 
01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
would think that it would be more that
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
the more appropriate thing would be that
 
01:11:29.709 --> 01:11:29.719 align:start position:0%
you and I assume you've done this you
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
would look into what are the
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
requirements in the in the other states
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
to determine whether it's substantially
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
similar and for example if you have to
 
01:11:40.669 --> 01:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
take an exam in New Hampshire presumably
 
01:11:42.669 --> 01:11:42.679 align:start position:0%
you would you would you know the other
 
01:11:43.950 --> 01:11:43.960 align:start position:0%
state that you're going to let somebody
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
in they would have an exam that was
 
01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
generally similar to the exam you have
 
01:11:50.189 --> 01:11:50.199 align:start position:0%
to take in New Hampshire I mean is that
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
the process you generally are following
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
and that's what we did and we did
 
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
consult with the boards and determining
 
01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
the jurisdictions um that are
 
01:11:59.830 --> 01:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
substantially similar and we are
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
reviewing them on an annual basis so I I
 
01:12:04.229 --> 01:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
guess I would I would tend to think that
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
the requirement that you take an exam um
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
might might be inconsistent
 
01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
with with the idea of the of the statute
 
01:12:17.229 --> 01:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
if it's to encourage you know allowing
 
01:12:19.390 --> 01:12:19.400 align:start position:0%
allowing other out of sters to come in
 
01:12:23.390 --> 01:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
particularly if the test in question is
 
01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:25.960 align:start position:0%
at the completion of the training
 
01:12:27.390 --> 01:12:27.400 align:start position:0%
so it
 
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
basically is the confirmation that
 
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
you've completed the training rather
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
than a separate test as the um there is
 
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
a separate test for plumbers and and uh
 
01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
electricians maybe what I can do is um
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
take this back and when I talk to the
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
board and work with the board on their
 
01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
jurist Prudence exam issues with respect
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
to Plumbers um we can evaluate the gas
 
01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
Fitters I'm not sure that that I'm not
 
01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
sure moving forward in the future that
 
01:12:58.189 --> 01:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
that's the model that they would like to
 
01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
use in terms of having the test at the
 
01:13:01.870 --> 01:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
conclusion of the program so we can we
 
01:13:03.229 --> 01:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
can work with them on that I will say
 
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
lnas are very similar to that um there
 
01:13:07.709 --> 01:13:07.719 align:start position:0%
so there is a model in New Hampshire for
 
01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you any further cor
 
01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
director moral I would add to at least
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
from a legal standpoint if you put a
 
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
requirement in that say you shall pass
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
an exam and an exam doesn't currently
 
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
exist then they can't comply with that
 
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
requirement I me why the the request is
 
01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
that when the Juris Prudence exam is
 
01:13:32.669 --> 01:13:32.679 align:start position:0%
available it be added I I know the
 
01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
committee has sometimes approved a rule
 
01:13:37.629 --> 01:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
that says you shall comply with this
 
01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:40.120 align:start position:0%
other Rule and the other rule is still a
 
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
couple of months out but uh you know
 
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's a case by case
 
01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
determination okay all right any further
 
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
comments um to be clear this is uh
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
conditional approval based on the change
 
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
in 313 34 which was adding the
 
01:13:59.790 --> 01:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
statute um and then with the
 
01:14:01.149 --> 01:14:01.159 align:start position:0%
understanding that when Juris Prudence
 
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
exams are added they will be timely
 
01:14:05.550 --> 01:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
added to the rules correct correct okay
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
correct all right everyone understand
 
01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
yep all right those in
 
01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:11.960 align:start position:0%
favor those
 
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
opposed all right thank you very much
 
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm really impressed we got this out
 
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:30.910 --> 01:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
energy so this one is actually a
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
conditional approval and um I worked
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
with the Department to um come up with
 
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
what they need what they need is an oral
 
01:14:47.709 --> 01:14:47.719 align:start position:0%
conditional approval um that's to change
 
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
in the very first paragraph of the rule
 
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
it says nothing in this rule or this
 
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
part shall be construed
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
and it's it will be changed to um
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
nothing in this rule is to be
 
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
construed um that's removing the sh
 
01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
because shs do not belong in purpose
 
01:15:11.070 --> 01:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
statements um and then down on page 10
 
01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
of the rule uh Ian
 
01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
1541 B we're also changing that may uh
 
01:15:21.790 --> 01:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
to to a shall so the department shall
 
01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
condition any license issued under this
 
01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
paragraph in any manner the department
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
finds necessary to ensure that the
 
01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
license is likely to be exercised
 
01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
safely paragraph C is the same thing
 
01:15:35.070 --> 01:15:35.080 align:start position:0%
we're changing the May to a shall so
 
01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
using a non adjudicative process the
 
01:15:39.310 --> 01:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
department of energy shall reject
 
01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
incomplete or improperly filed
 
01:15:42.669 --> 01:15:42.679 align:start position:0%
applications so those are the only
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
changes that still need to be made so
 
01:15:46.350 --> 01:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
this would be a conditional approval
 
01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
with the added oral conditional approval
 
01:15:52.669 --> 01:15:52.679 align:start position:0%
for this role okay is there any
 
01:16:03.070 --> 01:16:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
here could you turn your microphone on
 
01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
please thank
 
01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
you there is that
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
better again Andrew Haron Department of
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
energy and I think um it was just the
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
intention to also state in
 
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
C um it would say and shell also using a
 
01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
non adjudicative process issue or deny a
 
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
license within 90 days of reeding
 
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
receiving a comp you know what strike
 
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
that yes that's correct um it it's above
 
01:16:41.709 --> 01:16:41.719 align:start position:0%
that NC what was left out was unless an
 
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
application is cured upon request by the
 
01:16:47.229 --> 01:16:47.239 align:start position:0%
department just wanted to make sure that
 
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
language was was what was agreed upon
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
and we do we do a agree entirely with
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
the changes and um would ask for an oral
 
01:17:00.990 --> 01:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
CA okay I hope that was clear I hope I
 
01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
made it more clear rather than less
 
01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:04.310 align:start position:0%
made it more clear rather than less
thank

01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:17:07.229 --> 01:17:07.239 align:start position:0%
you all right questions is there a
 
01:17:11.189 --> 01:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
motion so moved second all right move by
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
Senator inis second by representative ly
 
01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
discussion those in favor I I
 
01:17:28.229 --> 01:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
AJ Jo uh so the final one on today's
 
01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
agenda is 20247 from the Department of
 
01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services treatment of
 
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
specific types of income the only
 
01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
comments I had on this proposal is that
 
01:17:48.189 --> 01:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
all of the um section except for two
 
01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
paragraphs have been expired since June
 
01:17:53.470 --> 01:17:53.480 align:start position:0%
12th of
 
01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
2023 um
 
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
section A the only paragraph that
 
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
remains is A7 but the whole section has
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
to do with the types of income to be
 
01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
excluded for eligibility
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
purposes and section B which is all
 
01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
expired is how certain types of income
 
01:18:14.350 --> 01:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
shall be treated and then paragraph C
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
which is also expired has to do with the
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
treatment of supplemental security
 
01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
income how that will not be counted or
 
01:18:25.709 --> 01:18:25.719 align:start position:0%
shall be counted as unearned income for
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh fan if assistance so that was the
 
01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
only comment I had on this
 
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
proposal good morning Nicole Valena
 
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Youth and Health
 
01:18:37.790 --> 01:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human
 
01:18:40.830 --> 01:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
Services um yes regrettably this is an
 
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
example again where years ago you could
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
open up just one paragraph and sub
 
01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
paragraph and make an edit um and it
 
01:18:50.669 --> 01:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
Alters The Source note and so yes
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
did um miss that and when it was
 
01:18:58.229 --> 01:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
realized began Ru making we're here if
 
01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:03.189 --> 01:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
questions and have
 
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
you enforced this this rule while yeah
 
01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
we did continue business as usual it was
 
01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the client there
 
01:19:12.669 --> 01:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
would have to have been an entire system
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
overhaul um with our programs and such
 
01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
so business continued as usual it was
 
01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
realized Ru making began and we are here
 
01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
um and do not plan to we're glad that
 
01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
there's no longer opening up a paragraph
 
01:19:30.510 --> 01:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
or a sub paragraph for editing in entire
 
01:19:32.910 --> 01:19:32.920 align:start position:0%
sections moving
 
01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
forward I believe some of these
 
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
too lovely we all browse through federal
 
01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
laws in our spare time yes other uh
 
01:19:50.709 --> 01:19:50.719 align:start position:0%
questions comments does somebody have a
 
01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
motion second okay move by represent L
 
01:19:58.750 --> 01:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
on second by represent groa further
 
01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
discussion those in favor I those
 
01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
opposed thank you and I do hope you're
 
01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
scouring your rules for similar cases we
 
01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean honestly we have 3,000 rules
 
01:20:12.750 --> 01:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
there's two of us in the rules unit and
 
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
our um program areas of course do rules
 
01:20:17.390 --> 01:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
in addition to everything else they do
 
01:20:20.229 --> 01:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
but we are working very hard with every
 
01:20:22.750 --> 01:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
program area um it is sometimes really
 
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
hard to catch these ones because when
 
01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
you're even looking at the source note
 
01:20:27.310 --> 01:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
then you have to go and research the
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
actual rule to find out which part was
 
01:20:31.629 --> 01:20:31.639 align:start position:0%
amended it's not just there on gen court
 
01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
so um It's Not Our intention to let
 
01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:35.629 align:start position:0%
so um It's Not Our intention to let
things

01:20:35.629 --> 01:20:35.639 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:20:39.870 --> 01:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
expire thank you all right anyone
 
01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
else do we have any other
 
01:20:46.629 --> 01:20:46.639 align:start position:0%
business right I direct no uh nothing
 
01:20:48.750 --> 01:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
other than consideration of the
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
continued meeting I don't think we need
 
01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
one does anyone okay we will not have a
 
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
continued meeting this month all right
 
01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:58.669 align:start position:0%
continued meeting this month all right
anything

01:20:58.669 --> 01:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
