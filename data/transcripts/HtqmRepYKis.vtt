00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%

present we have representative Lane
 
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
replacing representative huitt

representative muray and representative
 
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:27.560 align:start position:0%
groa representing replacing
 
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
representative Lehman
 
00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
and we have one bill that we didn't
 
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
complete in yesterday's calendar
 
00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
453 making appropriation to the
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
Statewide voter registration system
 
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
recognize representative
 
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you Mr chair so as you
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
recall this is um just a a simple bill
 
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
to pay for this um uh voter registration
 
00:07:59.909 --> 00:07:59.919 align:start position:0%
portal and um the problem we ran into
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
yesterday was that the uh that the
 
00:08:06.189 --> 00:08:06.199 align:start position:0%
committee in the senate for some crazy
 
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
reason that I don't you know it's like
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
above my pay grade um the bill there's a
 
00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:15.639 align:start position:0%
house bill that has all the policy to
 
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
create the portal and how it's to be
 
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
done and so on but there's this Senate
 
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
bill to pay for it why it can't be in
 
00:08:27.629 --> 00:08:27.639 align:start position:0%
one bill is unknown but anyways so but
 
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't make sense so that Bill the
 
00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
house bill in the Senate is currently uh
 
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
recommended for interim study so that's
 
00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
the problem we don't really want to
 
00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:40.190 align:start position:0%
the problem we don't really want to
spend

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
spend
 
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
$450,000 and I spoke to Assistant
 
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
Attorney J assistant Secretary of State
 
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
Hennessy who says the money is
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
specifically for that so if they don't
 
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
have the house bill they can't have they
 
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
can't spend this money and so on um so
 
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
what this does what this amendment does
 
00:09:01.069 --> 00:09:01.079 align:start position:0%
and I'm talking about Amendment 1926 H
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
which I am moving um is to change the
 
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
dollar amount to a dollar and therefore
 
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:11.320 align:start position:0%
should the Senate decide to change their
 
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
mind from interim study and go back to
 
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:18.200 align:start position:0%
um ought to pass then they could ask for
 
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
a committee of conference on this we
 
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
could change it back to
 
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
$450,000 and everybody would be happy I
 
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
guess um I'll second his move thank you
 
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
um now it seems to me there actually is
 
00:09:35.069 --> 00:09:35.079 align:start position:0%
an alternative which is the Senate could
 
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:38.680 align:start position:0%
amend the house bill to add the
 
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
$450,000 and then it would be all in one
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
bill Etc but for some reason people
 
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
don't seem to want that or I don't know
 
00:09:50.069 --> 00:09:50.079 align:start position:0%
what but anyways that's this
 
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:52.360 align:start position:0%
amendment can we adopt the
 
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
representative able yes thank you Mr
 
00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
chair I um uh understand what
 
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire is trying to
 
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
accomplish with this but since the
 
00:10:04.829 --> 00:10:04.839 align:start position:0%
Senate hasn't actually voted and there's
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
only a recommend recommendation on the
 
00:10:08.949 --> 00:10:08.959 align:start position:0%
floor from the committee and it's a
 
00:10:12.509 --> 00:10:12.519 align:start position:0%
three to2 recommendation at that um I
 
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:15.959 align:start position:0%
will be uh opposing the amendment thank
 
00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you further discussion on the
 
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
amendment which is 1
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
1926 if there is no further discussion
 
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
all in favor of adopting the amendment
 
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.200 align:start position:0%

Maguire further
 
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
discussion representative tki I just
 
00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
want to reiterate what representative
 
00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:42.200 align:start position:0%
eel said um we don't even know how the
 
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
Senate's going to act on this I say we
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
go ahead we take the division one
 
00:11:48.509 --> 00:11:48.519 align:start position:0%
recommendation of ought to pass we pass
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
it and we work it out in Committee of
 
00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
conference if if there's something to be
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
done we'll work it out I don't
 
00:11:58.269 --> 00:11:58.279 align:start position:0%
understand why we are going to kill a
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
bill that we the division unanimously
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
thought was a good idea so I'll be
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
voting against interim study thank you
 
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.310 align:start position:0%
voting against interim study thank you
Mr

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:08.519 align:start position:0%
chair all right representative Abel and
 
00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%
then I'll come to representative hle
 
00:12:12.509 --> 00:12:12.519 align:start position:0%
yeah just uh circling back once again I
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
would just reiterate the fact that this
 
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
came out with a unanimous recommendation
 
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:19.240 align:start position:0%
from The Division I also went back and
 
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
looked at the uh house floor vote it was
 
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
a unanimous Voice vote um I don't see
 
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
why just because the Senate May interim
 
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
study this that we should be wiping out
 
00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
the bill so I'll be voting against the
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
result representa hle yes thank you Mr
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
chair um in that this bill is verbatim
 
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
with what the Senate passed if we pass
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
this bill it heads to the governor it
 
00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
does not go back to the Senate
 
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
procedurally so if we want to do
 
00:12:59.150 --> 00:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
anything about a committee of conference
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of discussion we need to
 
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
do something it can be any amendment of
 
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
any type but otherwise procedurally it
 
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
does not return to the Senate it goes to
 
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:07.829 align:start position:0%
does not return to the Senate it goes to
the

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839 align:start position:0%

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.680 align:start position:0%

discussion

00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative maen Phillips thank you
 
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so um division 2 heard um
 
00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 217 in committee and um
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
largely heard from um one um lobbyist
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
who was really trying to deliver the
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
deliberations he had witnessed uh in the
 
00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
other body um it's important to know
 
00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:55.079 align:start position:0%
that this house bill uh I'm sorry the
 
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
Senate bill when it came to the house
 
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
looked slightly different um
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
the um it is not a loan repayment
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
program for uh Rural and underserved
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
area Educators
 
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
um um instead it's more of a retention
 
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
payment over time to keep Target um
 
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
target areas of Rural and underserved
 
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
areas in public schools those teachers
 
00:17:20.909 --> 00:17:20.919 align:start position:0%
committed to the work that they're doing
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
over time uh the primary intent of the
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
bill was to exp um was to support these
 
00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.310 align:start position:0%
bill was to exp um was to support these
teachers

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh as we all know their U professional
 
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
educational expenses are um
 
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
exponentially increasing and it gets
 
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
harder to keep them retaining the jobs
 
00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
over time if they're not um addressing
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
kind of their
 
00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
long-term um repayment programs um so
 
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:51.640 align:start position:0%
the funding is intended um to to keep
 
00:17:54.669 --> 00:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
them where they are uh this in fact
 
00:17:57.549 --> 00:17:57.559 align:start position:0%
would be a future budget um increase for
 
00:18:00.669 --> 00:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
an appropriation and another time um
 
00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
although the values as you can see on
 
00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
page two of the original bill that total
 
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
incentive program does increase over
 
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
time I think the total was about
 
00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:12.799 align:start position:0%
$112,000 um but it's like a four-year
 
00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:13.950 align:start position:0%
$112,000 um but it's like a four-year
retention

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
retention
 
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
program but it is not appropriated um
 
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
it's only a dollar appropriation
 
00:18:22.149 --> 00:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
included in the bill so this is really a
 
00:18:24.669 --> 00:18:24.679 align:start position:0%
in in like aspirational program for
 
00:18:24.679 --> 00:18:26.230 align:start position:0%
in in like aspirational program for
future

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
budgeting uh as such the felt it was
 
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
important to retain those rural um
 
00:18:34.909 --> 00:18:34.919 align:start position:0%
teachers where they are and noted that
 
00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:36.799 align:start position:0%
this is also similar to a healthcare
 
00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:39.039 align:start position:0%
provider program that the state supports
 
00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:44.039 align:start position:0%
so um we felt um I guess a six to2 vote
 
00:18:45.789 --> 00:18:45.799 align:start position:0%
we felt it was important as it ought to
 
00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:49.559 align:start position:0%
pass thank you further discussion on
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
217 representative Emer thank you Mr
 
00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
chairman uh in committee I I say I
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
agreed with intent of this bill it had
 
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
no the cost was $1 so it was not an
 
00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
expensive Bill however it did obligate
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
future uh legislature to fund
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
it since we had this committee meeting
 
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh the amount of liability we have for
 
00:19:22.029 --> 00:19:22.039 align:start position:0%
the senu center has grown exponentially
 
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
so I'm very reluctant to commit a
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
program for a future legislature when
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to be handing off a a huge
 
00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
liability on the news center so I cannot
 
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
support the bill at this
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
time further
 
00:19:40.029 --> 00:19:40.039 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Heath um I I'd
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
just like to talk a little bit about
 
00:19:45.149 --> 00:19:45.159 align:start position:0%
those school districts in our most rural
 
00:19:48.149 --> 00:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
areas and the difficulty that they have
 
00:19:50.669 --> 00:19:50.679 align:start position:0%
attracting teachers this would be an
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
incentive that would encourage our young
 
00:19:56.909 --> 00:19:56.919 align:start position:0%
new teachers going to places that they
 
00:19:59.149 --> 00:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that they might not other wise
 
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
go um and actually Esa um our title
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
$1 often provide these incentives so it
 
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
may be something that the Department of
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
Education could use some federal dollars
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
for I don't know the answer to that but
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
I think we need to think seriously about
 
00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
those school districts that is very
 
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
difficult right now there are school
 
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
districts that are using vac as the
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
means by which they teach AP courses um
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
advanced science courses math courses
 
00:20:32.669 --> 00:20:32.679 align:start position:0%
and it would be so much better if they
 
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
could attract teachers to those areas
 
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I hope you'll
 
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
consider the OTP
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
motion further
 
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
discussion representa Hull thank you Mr
 
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
chair um currently there's no Financial
 
00:20:48.669 --> 00:20:48.679 align:start position:0%
note on this or even an estimate other
 
00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.039 align:start position:0%
than the
 
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
$1 the the modified bill as passed by
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
the house is roughly $112,000 per
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
applicant of reimbursement grants
 
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
um not understanding the number of
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
teachers that's eligible if we if we
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
actually you if actually every one of
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
the approximately 15,000 teachers was
 
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
eligible we're talking over $100 million
 
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:13.480 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how many teachers would
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
be eligible to to move to these new
 
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
areas do we have any information for
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
that does anyone know the answer I don't
 
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
have an exact figure but the number of
 
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
teachers in our rural school districts
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
is I I would say in the low numbers
 
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
depending and in particular subject
 
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
areas so um I would not say they would
 
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
be I'm not sure I can't give you an
 
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.510 align:start position:0%
be I'm not sure I can't give you an
exact

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
exact
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
number represent hacken Philip Mr some
 
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
of the testimony that division 2 heard

um was about teacher teaching
 
00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:49.799 align:start position:0%
eligibility in these areas um and we do
 
00:21:52.909 --> 00:21:52.919 align:start position:0%
we were reminded that there were um some
 
00:21:56.669 --> 00:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
alternative Pathways to teaching in our
 
00:21:59.789 --> 00:21:59.799 align:start position:0%
state through an all three or alt four
 
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
track which uh would basically be people
 
00:22:05.149 --> 00:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
who are not certified teachers and our
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
traditional understanding of who becomes
 
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
a teacher but instead those who have a
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
college degree or credit hours in a
 
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
certain teaching um educational area and
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
have experience in the field who can um
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
either become a teacher or a pair
 
00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
professional through these additional
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
Pathways this provides um you know it's
 
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
really getting at the teacher um
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
shortage that we're seeing across the
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
state and provides an alternative
 
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
pathway for folks to get into the
 
00:22:35.149 --> 00:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
profession this program is meant to also
 
00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
be available to those folks so we're not
 
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:40.120 align:start position:0%

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.360 align:start position:0%

00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
experts from our areas who might be
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
willing you know in a second career to
 
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.440 align:start position:0%

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
discussion the funding had been added to
 
00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:05.919 align:start position:0%
excess arpa
 
00:30:09.389 --> 00:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
funds um for the ventilation and exhaust
 
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
fans in New Hampshire culinary arts
 
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
teaching kits at William Palmer CTE
 
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
Senator and Hudson
 
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
so last I looked
 
00:30:23.549 --> 00:30:23.559 align:start position:0%
um Kevin Ripple had had the
 
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:25.640 align:start position:0%
Amendments is is
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
he if you give me one moment I can print
 
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
we we were asked to draft this but
 
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
nobody indicated it was going for you
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
show me a stack of these ones that we
 
00:30:36.029 --> 00:30:36.039 align:start position:0%
had from these ARA funds I I can print
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
it if you just give me a few minutes
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
here all right in the meantime I think
 
00:30:42.269 --> 00:30:42.279 align:start position:0%
representative Heath was very happy now
 
00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
bill do we need to wait for the
 
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
amendment um it's just a source of
 
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:55.799 align:start position:0%
funding that we're um looking for all
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
prepared with that Amendment today I do
 
00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:31.720 align:start position:0%
have the department here to verify that
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
if you want hear find out cuz Kevin
 
00:31:37.389 --> 00:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
showed me a pile of amendments he had
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
so anyone here that can give us an
 
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
opinion on that
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
hiding think I think there are other
 
00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
bills with arpa amendments and this one
 
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
was discussed however I think this use
 
00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:52.919 align:start position:0%
was deemed not something permissible for
 
00:31:55.029 --> 00:31:55.039 align:start position:0%
those funds which is why I wasn't
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
prepared with that Amendment for you
 
00:31:59.070 --> 00:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
today but we can is anyone here that can
 
00:32:02.509 --> 00:32:02.519 align:start position:0%
discuss it and please identify
 
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
yourself good afternoon Melissa white
 
00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
division director for learner support at
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:32:10.629 --> 00:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
Education um this uh particular project
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
would not qualify for the arpa funds
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
because of all the federal requirements
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
needed for construction this has already
 
00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
happened in the past we can't go back
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
and come into compliance with the
 
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:24.440 align:start position:0%
federal requirements in the past so that
 
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
it would not
 
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
qualify that's right does have have a a
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
deadline for construction I think the
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
other two ones that are down here for
 
00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:36.559 align:start position:0%
arpa funds do not have construction
 
00:32:40.269 --> 00:32:40.279 align:start position:0%
involved so they won't be correct
 
00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:42.679 align:start position:0%
overridden all right well just moved
 
00:32:45.149 --> 00:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
from arpa funds to General funds so then
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
then the motion before us is ought to
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
pass yes I believe it's from the
 
00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
education trust fund yes the education
 
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
trust funds okay can I speak to the
 
00:32:56.269 --> 00:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
that's representative Heath is
 
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
recognized so I would like to move ought
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
to pass on Senate Bill 396
 
00:33:06.149 --> 00:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
second and if I could speak to my
 
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
motion um Senator Carson um brought this
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
bill to us um the um Wilbur Palmer
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
Regional Career and Technical education
 
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
center was qualified for a grant I
 
00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
believe through the capital budget and
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
there was a miscommunication between the
 
00:33:28.509 --> 00:33:28.519 align:start position:0%
department and the center
 
00:33:30.669 --> 00:33:30.679 align:start position:0%
um and they went ahead believing that
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
they had been approved to do um a an
 
00:33:36.269 --> 00:33:36.279 align:start position:0%
adjustment and use the additional funds
 
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
that they had so I would ask that we um
 
00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:44.200 align:start position:0%
pass this bill and and take the funds
 
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
that that are necessary from the
 
00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
education trust fund to make the um
 
00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:52.120 align:start position:0%
School District hold it was um a
 
00:33:54.509 --> 00:33:54.519 align:start position:0%
miscommunication and um I spoke with

Senator Carson last night and she's
 
00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%

myself yeah Senate Bill 311 this one I
 
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
do have an
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
amendment doesn't involve construction
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
so as I said before I attended an arpa
 
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
meeting on April 30th the only members
 
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
of the House were myself and the speaker
 
00:36:56.109 --> 00:36:56.119 align:start position:0%
and I saw that uh the senate had put
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 311 as one of the bills that
 
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
they wanted to fund with excess arpa
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:08.079 align:start position:0%
meeting so the mo the amendment you see
 
00:37:08.079 --> 00:37:08.990 align:start position:0%
meeting so the mo the amendment you see
before

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:37:15.309 --> 00:37:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:32.200 align:start position:0%
all right I move the
 
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
amendment is there a
 
00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:38.190 align:start position:0%
amendment is there a
second

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
it so this is only for this current year
 
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
this will be I think the third year that
 
00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:55.640 align:start position:0%
the town has received property tax
 
00:37:59.710 --> 00:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
abatement U that was an important item I
 
00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:00.790 align:start position:0%
abatement U that was an important item I
did

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
represent Hamad when all this was
 
00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:06.280 align:start position:0%
ongoing um the town was not in favor of
 
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
it this was to elay some of their
 
00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:09.870 align:start position:0%
it this was to elay some of their
complaints

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
about adopting
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
this Hospital in their town and they of
 
00:38:18.309 --> 00:38:18.319 align:start position:0%
course I think expect it to continue but
 
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
for this year this is the one-time
 
00:38:23.309 --> 00:38:23.319 align:start position:0%
payment that will be approved for this
 
00:38:23.319 --> 00:38:29.470 align:start position:0%
payment that will be approved for this
year

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
and we adopt the amendment by a show of
 
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:47.720 align:start position:0%
hand hands down any
 
00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
opposition didn't think they any so the
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:58.750 --> 00:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
adopted I would now move
 
00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
not to pass second on Senate Bill 311
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
okay further
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Stringham
 
00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:23.079 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 311 provides a one town
 
00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
onetime payment to the town of Hamstead
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
for $191,000
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh in fiscal year 2025 to offset the
 
00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
impact of the town's uh property tax
 
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
base uh resulting from the state's
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
acquisition of the Hemstead Hospital
 
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
Hemstead hospital is an accredited
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
Specialty Hospital that serves acute
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
psychiatric and substance abuse abuse
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
disorders uh for the needs of children's
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
adolescents and young adults as a
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
state-owned facility the state does not
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
pay property tax and therefore payment
 
00:39:58.910 --> 00:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
in Le in Le of tax taxes or a pilot is
 
00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:01.960 align:start position:0%
used on occasion uh in New Hampshire to
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
offset lost revenues or to offset added
 
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
costs uh this payment was anticipated in
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
last year's hb2 but uh reportedly was
 
00:40:12.829 --> 00:40:12.839 align:start position:0%
inadvertently excluded in the Senate
 
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
version of the bill uh as amended this
 
00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
payment would largely come from federal
 
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
funds or arpa funds uh so uh I move uh
 
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
support a to pass very good and you're
 
00:40:26.309 --> 00:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
writing the report and it's already
 
00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:29.560 align:start position:0%
written is there a
 
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
second I'll second
 
00:40:34.309 --> 00:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
it it was already seconded it's already
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
seconded okay all right motion is ought
 
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:41.720 align:start position:0%
to pass as amended and the amendment is
 
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
before you
 
00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:47.960 align:start position:0%
1867 representative Maguire thank you Mr
 
00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
chairman so I I caught the the phrase uh
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
on occasion that we do this and I'm
 
00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
wondering is there any kind of
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
principal reason why we do it in this
 
00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
case and not some other case and so on I
 
00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
mean I've never heard of one I have
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
Connecticut River
 
00:41:08.829 --> 00:41:08.839 align:start position:0%
Valley I don't mean that I haven't heard
 
00:41:11.309 --> 00:41:11.319 align:start position:0%
of payments being made I haven't heard
 
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
of a reason why we do it here and not
 
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
there do you see what I mean because
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
there were I could certainly come up
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
with cases where we don't make some kind
 
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
of payment like
 
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
this it's always up to the legislature M
 
00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:28.599 align:start position:0%
Mr chair can I may I offer
 
00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh I don't I
 
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
don't think this is
 
00:41:36.109 --> 00:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
um describes a principle as much as a a
 
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
real situation you know with Hamstead
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
they had a longstanding uh history with
 
00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
the private ownership of the Hamstead
 
00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:47.480 align:start position:0%
hospital and when the state bought it
 
00:41:50.069 --> 00:41:50.079 align:start position:0%
the Hamstead lost a significant amount
 
00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
of of um uh real uh property taxes and
 
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
and uh when we went in there as a State
 
00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:01.079 align:start position:0%
we increased the level of Acuity the of
 
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
the patients that would be seen there
 
00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
and we have had a series of uh
 
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
disruptions relative
 
00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
to what had happened prior to our
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
takeover that has brought into bear fire
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
EMT police and so uh so we've taken
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
their property tax revenue away we've
 
00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
increased their cost on their local
 
00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and so this is a this is a
 
00:42:34.589 --> 00:42:34.599 align:start position:0%
good faith commitment in this case to uh
 
00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
try to keep them whole while we
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
transition into getting the kind of uh
 
00:42:42.069 --> 00:42:42.079 align:start position:0%
stability that we really expect at the
 
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
Hamstead hospital I I don't I don't
 
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
think this precludes future
 
00:42:49.829 --> 00:42:49.839 align:start position:0%
negotiations but I think it is um
 
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
fundamentally a reasonable transition
 
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
thing to
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
do and they've had to B had to hire two
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
more police officers
 
00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:01.640 align:start position:0%

00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%

to highlight our support for the
 
00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:07.640 align:start position:0%
increased risk that our uh active and
 
00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
retired firefighters have taken on our
 
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
behalf um uh it it came to us as a good
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
bill uh we had some debate we came out
 
00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:19.640 align:start position:0%
with an amendment uh that is uh an
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
amendment number I don't have in front
 
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%

1915

00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
1915
 
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
um uh this this amendment was discussed
 
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
it had bipartisan support within the
 
00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
division three and and because it was
 
00:45:40.109 --> 00:45:40.119 align:start position:0%
also simultaneously being coordinated
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
with the the involved community so I
 
00:45:46.309 --> 00:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
think this has Community uh support and
 
00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
and because of that I I I I would look
 
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
to uh representative tersi if you want
 
00:45:54.829 --> 00:45:54.839 align:start position:0%

352 um comes to
 
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
us it was a very emotional hearing um
 
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
approximately 48 and a half percent of
 
00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:32.680 align:start position:0%
firefighters will be diagnosed with some
 
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
form of cancer in their lifetime and
 
00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:37.720 align:start position:0%
they have a 14% higher risk of dying
 
00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
from cancer than the general
 
00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
population occupational cancer is the
 
00:46:45.309 --> 00:46:45.319 align:start position:0%
leading cause of line of duty deaths in
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
the fire service despite best practices
 
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
to reduce exposure to dangerous
 
00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:51.880 align:start position:0%
chemicals the inherent risks of the job
 
00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:52.790 align:start position:0%
chemicals the inherent risks of the job
are

00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
unavoidable since we cannot eliminate
 
00:46:58.109 --> 00:46:58.119 align:start position:0%
all risk this bill right here implements
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
an aggressive approach to detecting
 
00:47:01.549 --> 00:47:01.559 align:start position:0%
cancer through a combination of blood
 
00:47:05.309 --> 00:47:05.319 align:start position:0%
testing ultrasound and lung CT if needed
 
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
now the amendment was
 
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.710 align:start position:0%
now the amendment was
drafted

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
um with the work of Representative
 
00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:13.640 align:start position:0%
Mooney and an interest by representative
 
00:47:16.349 --> 00:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
Lyon who was substituting at the
 
00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:20.079 align:start position:0%
time um it basically does three things
 
00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
um number one there's a language
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
correction um on line five of the
 
00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:27.349 align:start position:0%
correction um on line five of the
amendment

00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
which um or I'm sorry line four to say
 
00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
that um you can do a combination of one
 
00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
or more of the following tests um which
 
00:47:37.829 --> 00:47:37.839 align:start position:0%
means if you just want an ultrasound
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
that's fine but you're not mandated to
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
do all three
 
00:47:45.309 --> 00:47:45.319 align:start position:0%
things um we are also removing the skin
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
cancer check that was included in the
 
00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
bill because it was made clear to us
 
00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
that skin cancer checks are available
 
00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
through um Regular Insurance programs
 
00:47:58.950 --> 00:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
and um the advocates for this bill were
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
good with that as a way to potentially
 
00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
save money we also removed a $1300 per
 
00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:09.160 align:start position:0%
person um individual cap because they
 
00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
felt um that that could possibly limit
 
00:48:15.069 --> 00:48:15.079 align:start position:0%
things when it comes to testing but we
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
did keep the overall cost of the bill
 
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
the same at a maximum cap of $5 million
 
00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
so that does not
 
00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:25.150 align:start position:0%
so that does not
change

00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
um and it add added the last
 
00:48:31.549 --> 00:48:31.559 align:start position:0%
paragraph which
 
00:48:36.109 --> 00:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
um calls for a report to be written um
 
00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
after the program is completed to report
 
00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
out on a variety of things as you can
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
see there the number of firefighters
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
that were screened the test conducted
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
the results Etc um that was something
 
00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
that representative Lon felt very
 
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
strongly about so um this was the
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
Compromise amendment that we came up
 
00:48:59.349 --> 00:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:01.549 --> 00:49:01.559 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to speak a little bit
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
more about the bill but if we just want
 
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and move the amendment I can
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:10.589 --> 00:49:10.599 align:start position:0%
that everyone had a chance to read the
 
00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
amendment number 1
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
1915 all in favor of adopting the
 
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:25.720 align:start position:0%
hand unanimous hands down any opposed I
 
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
didn't see any thank you continue thank
 
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chairman I just wanted
 
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
to now that we've adopted the amendment
 
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
um be clear that what this program is
 
00:49:42.349 --> 00:49:42.359 align:start position:0%
going to do is potentially screen nearly
 
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
4,000 active duty firefighters and
 
00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:47.839 align:start position:0%
retired firefighters um if they choose
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
to participate this is not a mandated
 
00:49:54.589 --> 00:49:54.599 align:start position:0%
program at all um we really know that
 
00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
early detection and screen in saves
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
lives um we heard from um we heard
 
00:50:05.789 --> 00:50:05.799 align:start position:0%
testimony about a firefighter in my own
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
city of nasua um fire Lieutenant Jessica
 
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
Wyman and her passing due to
 
00:50:15.549 --> 00:50:15.559 align:start position:0%
occupational cancer um that had not been
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
found just through regular physicals
 
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
whereas it's believed that with a
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
program such as this detection could
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
have been made early treatment could
 
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
have started much earlier
 
00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:31.240 align:start position:0%
and um lives potentially could have been
 
00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:32.990 align:start position:0%
and um lives potentially could have been
saved

00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
saved
 
00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:37.720 align:start position:0%
um this program will possibly deliver
 
00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
life-saving intervention and treatment
 
00:50:43.309 --> 00:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
before the disease has significantly
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
progressed and overall could potentially
 
00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:49.839 align:start position:0%
reduce costs for patient employers and
 
00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
insurance providers um to treat the
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
cancer early I urge the committee to
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
please support me in the ought to pass
 
00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
as amended motion for Senate Bill 352
 
00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
thank you further
 
00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
discussion representative McGuire thank
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman two questions uh what's
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
the general fund cost of this and I
 
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
heard you say when the program ends so
 
00:51:17.349 --> 00:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
is this like a one-time screening or
 
00:51:20.349 --> 00:51:20.359 align:start position:0%
every 10 years or something like
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
that um it is written into the bill it's
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
a pilot program with a maximum cap of
 
00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.109 align:start position:0%
a pilot program with a maximum cap of
5,00

00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
5,00
 
00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
$5 million um so the intention is to
 
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
offer this program to those who want to
 
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
participate and yes it will end so sorry
 
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
May jump in there did you have a second
 
00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
question I asked
 
00:51:44.349 --> 00:51:44.359 align:start position:0%
two what your what was your second
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
question one was what's the cost and and
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
one was is it Ono I guess both of those
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
are answered yes
 
00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:53.720 align:start position:0%
but but the the value of the report that
 
00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
we added in the amendment is to document
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
the value and utility of the program and
 
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
it's been said that if we partner with a
 
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
clinical research facility we may
 
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
actually provide some information that
 
00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:09.839 align:start position:0%
it'll be useful around the nation so so
 
00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
this is viewed as a one-time project
 
00:52:14.829 --> 00:52:14.839 align:start position:0%
with a report to tell us the value and
 
00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
benefit of
 
00:52:19.309 --> 00:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
it further
 
00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none clerk will call a
 
00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%

U thank you Mr chair um this is a the
 
00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
355 is a Senate bill to uh create a new
 
00:53:59.589 --> 00:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
screening program for a disease uh among
 
00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:01.400 align:start position:0%
newborns that I'm not going to try to
 
00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
pronounce it's you often referred to as
 
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
CMV um the I the idea here uh is that uh
 
00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
this given that this is new uh we're
 
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
going to be asking bringing an amendment
 
00:54:17.069 --> 00:54:17.079 align:start position:0%
forward uh at the request of the
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
hospital Association in anticipation
 
00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
that we may pass this to change the
 
00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:25.160 align:start position:0%
effective date so that they have an
 
00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
additional six months after um passage
 
00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:31.720 align:start position:0%
uh to uh prepare for everything that

we've discussed several times inid three
 
00:54:59.309 --> 00:54:59.319 align:start position:0%

adoption motion to adopt Amendment 1878
 
00:56:58.710 --> 00:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 355 is there any further

discussion seeing none will you accept
 
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
the hand hand count for the adoption of

opposed okay you've adopted Amendment
 
00:57:19.589 --> 00:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
1878 I believe the next Amendment amends
 
00:57:21.789 --> 00:57:21.799 align:start position:0%
the effective date on that
 
00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:23.839 align:start position:0%
Amendment yes I could certainly make
 
00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
that motion I would move the adoption
 
00:57:29.029 --> 00:57:29.039 align:start position:0%
now now of additionally amendment number
 
00:57:29.039 --> 00:57:30.990 align:start position:0%
now now of additionally amendment number
20241

00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
20241
 
00:57:36.910 --> 00:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
1934 H second Motion in a second
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
describe describe your Amendment thank
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
you uh representative walner first and
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
foremost is the sponsor of this
 
00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
amendment but what it does is simply
 
00:57:48.069 --> 00:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
changes the effective date through the
 
00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:49.839 align:start position:0%
hospital Association and others that
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
have to actually Implement Senate Bill
 
00:57:55.789 --> 00:57:55.799 align:start position:0%
355 this date is far more reasonable and
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
so for that I fully endorse the walner
 
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
amendment number 1934 H and ask that
 
00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
everyone else adopt it too thank
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
Earth Mr Ripple can I just ask you a
 
00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
question sure does it matter what order
 
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
we approve the amendments in the reason
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
I ask is the second one says replace
 
00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
section two with the effective data and
 
00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
section two is not the effective date
 
00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
correct it's drafted this way because in
 
00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:25.480 align:start position:0%
the bill in the unamended version of the
 
00:58:27.069 --> 00:58:27.079 align:start position:0%
bill section two is the effective date
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
so if the committee were to pass both of
 
00:58:30.549 --> 00:58:30.559 align:start position:0%
these we would combine them and it this
 
00:58:32.109 --> 00:58:32.119 align:start position:0%
the effective date would replace section
 
00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
three in the amendment thank
 
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
catching that representative hle so if I
 
00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:41.480 align:start position:0%
understand Mr Ripple correctly there
 
00:58:43.029 --> 00:58:43.039 align:start position:0%
would be a new amendment number merging
 
00:58:44.549 --> 00:58:44.559 align:start position:0%
these two that would be the committee
 
00:58:47.589 --> 00:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
Amendment that's correct
 
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.760 align:start position:0%

00:58:57.029 --> 00:58:57.039 align:start position:0%

a vote then on amendment number 1934
 
00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
hand hands down any
 
00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:14.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
adopted and by the description they will
 
00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:17.950 align:start position:0%

01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
care um sector would have their own
 
01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
children eligible for the child care
 
01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:22.910 align:start position:0%
children eligible for the child care
scholarship

01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
program child care has been having a
 
01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:27.880 align:start position:0%
very very difficult time as you probably
 
01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
all know from Reading um and hearing
 
01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:35.720 align:start position:0%
about child care very hard time um
 
01:03:38.069 --> 01:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
retaining and
 
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
um recruiting a Workforce and this is
 
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
just one tool that would be in the
 
01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
toolbox of um employe
 
01:03:52.510 --> 01:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
employers to attract employees to the
 
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
child care field so if a um
 
01:03:59.109 --> 01:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
person was interested in being a child
 
01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
care provider but they had young
 
01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
children of their own and as you know
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
Child Care is very
 
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
expensive so they decide that they would
 
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
take a job in child care but they would
 
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
need assistance with their own child's
 
01:04:21.789 --> 01:04:21.799 align:start position:0%
um tuition in the child care center or
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
the or with the family child care
 
01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.829 align:start position:0%
the or with the family child care
provider

01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:25.839 align:start position:0%
provider
 
01:04:29.309 --> 01:04:29.319 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow for there to be
 
01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
some help for those families Child Care
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
tuition scholarships are on a sliding
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
fee scale so all families pay
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
something some pay more some pay less
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
depending on their income and their
 
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
family size um what the and the
 
01:04:55.390 --> 01:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
um bill as WR the amendment actually
 
01:04:58.990 --> 01:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
made made the eligibility up to median
 
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
income families with elig with incomes
 
01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
up to median
 
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
income I'm glad to answer questions if
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
people have them questions from the
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:15.160 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you Mr chairman so yeah my
 
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
question for representative
 
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
wner are you saying that this makes um
 
01:05:24.029 --> 01:05:24.039 align:start position:0%
child care providers eligible for the
 
01:05:24.039 --> 01:05:26.230 align:start position:0%
child care providers eligible for the
program

01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:05:28.349 --> 01:05:28.359 align:start position:0%
and assuming that they otherwise
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be that their income is too
 
01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
high to to otherwise qualify is that so
 
01:05:36.109 --> 01:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
their income has to be between some kind
 
01:05:38.589 --> 01:05:38.599 align:start position:0%
of level right below median but above
 
01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
whatever the qualifies you is that right
 
01:05:44.109 --> 01:05:44.119 align:start position:0%
yes in order to receive a child care
 
01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
scholarship help paying for child care
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
you um it's under 85% of meet State
 
01:05:51.039 --> 01:05:52.109 align:start position:0%
you um it's under 85% of meet State
meeting

01:05:52.109 --> 01:05:52.119 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
income for people going into the Vare
 
01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:04.349 --> 01:06:04.359 align:start position:0%
income further questions
 
01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:07.400 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair can
 
01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
you speak to the likelihood of the
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
Federal Department of Health and Human
 
01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:13.480 align:start position:0%
Services granting the waiver so that
 
01:06:16.349 --> 01:06:16.359 align:start position:0%
federal funds would cover the cost well
 
01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
I certain I certainly have my fingers
 
01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
crossed that that will happen um there
 
01:06:25.309 --> 01:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
are other states that are looking at
 
01:06:25.319 --> 01:06:26.430 align:start position:0%
are other states that are looking at
this

01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
and I believe actually it is Kentucky
 
01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
where this is already taking place so I
 
01:06:33.870 --> 01:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
think this is something that we're going
 
01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:36.200 align:start position:0%
to see the federal government looking at
 
01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
closely so I'm certainly um optimistic
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
that we will have this waiver or request
 
01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
for a waiver
 
01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
accepted we we do receive considerable
 
01:06:54.029 --> 01:06:54.039 align:start position:0%
amount of funding for child care through
 
01:06:57.069 --> 01:06:57.079 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
01:06:59.390 --> 01:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Mooney
 
01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just want to point
 
01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
out when this bill was originally
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
introduced the fiscal note for fiscal
 
01:07:10.029 --> 01:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
year 2025 was between $18 to $26
 
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
million the house amended it in the
 
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
policy committee to be about 2.5 and now
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's down to a million covered likely by
 
01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:19.880 align:start position:0%
federal funds I want to commend division
 
01:07:22.349 --> 01:07:22.359 align:start position:0%
three I'll be voting for this amendment
 
01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
okay I I believe we've adopted the
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
amendment now the next motion will be
 
01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended representative
 
01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
walner I'll move on to pass as
 
01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:40.599 align:start position:0%
amended second second by repr solki
 
01:07:40.599 --> 01:07:42.349 align:start position:0%

01:07:44.910 --> 01:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Maguire thank
 
01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so I'm going to vote for
 
01:07:49.950 --> 01:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
this but I just want to point out that
 
01:07:52.269 --> 01:07:52.279 align:start position:0%
programs like this can have negative
 
01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
consequences in the sense that when you
 
01:07:59.230 --> 01:07:59.240 align:start position:0%
put a cap on income to receive a benefit
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
that's an incentive not to ex to have
 
01:08:05.109 --> 01:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
your income not exceed so I know in in
 
01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
my business we have people who get
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
certain medical subsidies as long as
 
01:08:14.109 --> 01:08:14.119 align:start position:0%
their income is below X so we ask them
 
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
to work extra hours they're not
 
01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
interested because it would throw them
 
01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
off their their benefits and that's kind
 
01:08:24.030 --> 01:08:24.040 align:start position:0%
of thing could happen here in the same
 
01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
way because now we're saying if your
 
01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
income's below X median you won't you
 
01:08:32.829 --> 01:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
will get this benefit if it's above you
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
won't so that's in it's going to have
 
01:08:37.110 --> 01:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
some some negative
 
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
consequences representative cherski
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just want to
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
point out that um the nature of this
 
01:08:46.349 --> 01:08:46.359 align:start position:0%
bill is actually a win-win for um our
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
Workforce issue and our child care
 
01:08:50.590 --> 01:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
crisis that the state is currently
 
01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:53.239 align:start position:0%
experiencing if this bill passes and
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
attracts someone who is not in the work
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
workplace right now because they don't
 
01:09:00.349 --> 01:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
have child care if they decide I can
 
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
become a child care worker I can reenter
 
01:09:05.229 --> 01:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
the workforce have a little bit of
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
assistance in paying for my own child's
 
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
child care that adds a worker to a child
 
01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
care center which allows the child care
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
center to then open up more spots for
 
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
children which allows more parents to
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
enter the workforce because there's more
 
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
places to put their children so I'll be
 
01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:27.239 align:start position:0%

recommended an itl on this um um along
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
party lines what uh we've gotten some
 
01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
new information though from uh the
 
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
chairman who attended an arpa meeting
 
01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
and said that the uh arpa funds would be
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
available to support this and I believe
 
01:11:38.830 --> 01:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple is passing out an amendment to
 
01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
saying such a thing and and because we
 
01:11:46.510 --> 01:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
have a funding source for this albe it a
 
01:11:50.350 --> 01:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
a one-time funding source um it may it
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
may change some minds of um the the
 
01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
people who considered this in division
 
01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:58.149 align:start position:0%
people who considered this in division
three

01:11:58.149 --> 01:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
I'll be I'll be going when when that
 
01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
gets handed out I recommend we go to
 
01:12:02.719 --> 01:12:06.350 align:start position:0%
gets handed out I recommend we go to
representative

01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%

01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%

01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:15.189 align:start position:0%
[Music]
representative

01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
hle I was the person who made the motion
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
itl so maybe someone else wants to make
 
01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
the motion if it's with the amendment I
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
would I would like to move Rec consider
 
01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
since this is for the negotiation status
 
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
with the Senate the Senate tacked this
 
01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
on to the arpa funds and they they place
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
this as a priority they heard testimony
 
01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:42.280 align:start position:0%
we did not hear when we heard the bill
 
01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
that some fairly large shelter in
 
01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
Manchester said they would close if they
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
didn't get this extra money on a daily
 
01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
basis and it was I think 100 beds up for
 
01:12:58.669 --> 01:12:58.679 align:start position:0%
grabs so the Senate heard that I don't
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
know why that same person didn't come
 
01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
and speak to us but we didn't hear him I
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
think all the testimony we heard people
 
01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
were fairly happy with going up from 8
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
to 20 so we decided we didn't need the
 
01:13:11.709 --> 01:13:11.719 align:start position:0%
extra money but now he's insisted that
 
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
he wants to use this money and and he
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
wants to uh pass this bill and add the
 
01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
25 per day versus the 20 per day to the
 
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
people that provide shelter so so
 
01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
representative wer I I'd like to make a
 
01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:29.840 align:start position:0%

ambulance services under the Medicaid
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%

passed uh easily I think out of uh
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
division three with an amendment
 
01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
1860 and uh I would I would ask
 
01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham for a motion
 
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:00.320 align:start position:0%

01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
explain thank you uh ambulance services
 
01:18:09.149 --> 01:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
have become an increasingly important
 
01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
Cog in the granite State's healthc care
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
system and under great financial stress
 
01:18:16.510 --> 01:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
a significant portion of an ambulance's
 
01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
Services calls do not lead to the
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
transport from one location to another
 
01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
and therefore are not reimbursed an
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
example ex of such a service is an
 
01:18:28.950 --> 01:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
emergency call where an ambulance is
 
01:18:31.870 --> 01:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
dispatched to a location to assist an
 
01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
individual suffering from a drug
 
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
overdose the ambulance provider drives
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
to the scene delivers Naran saves the
 
01:18:41.790 --> 01:18:41.800 align:start position:0%
person's life and the ambulance returns
 
01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
to its station with no transport under
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
current Medicaid rules ambulance
 
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
companies providing such Services would
 
01:18:51.070 --> 01:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
not receive any
 
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:53.880 align:start position:0%

since I am not part of division three I
 
01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
have worked for a medical uh service
 
01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:21.400 align:start position:0%
provider and I know that there are a lot
 
01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
of services you provide that you don't
 
01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
get reimbursed for and therefore
 
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
the uh charges that you issue for other
 
01:19:29.310 --> 01:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
services tend to account for those
 
01:19:31.470 --> 01:19:31.480 align:start position:0%
unpaid Services my question would be was
 
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
there any discussion on whether adopting
 
01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
this and filling a gap in the billing
 
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
structure would result in the ambulance
 
01:19:41.950 --> 01:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
Services overall reducing other rates to
 
01:19:45.629 --> 01:19:45.639 align:start position:0%
compensate for this well unfortunately
 
01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
at this time when we when we began this
 
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
by anym we had four ambulance service
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
companies go out of business in the
 
01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
first three months of last year uh
 
01:19:57.229 --> 01:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
there's still great uh Financial stress
 
01:19:58.990 --> 01:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
even at this current level of
 
01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursement overall there's
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
approximately 11.5 million of Medicaid
 
01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
payments for ambulance services this is
 
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
definitely new money on top of that uh
 
01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
the the there's not any anticipation of
 
01:20:13.709 --> 01:20:13.719 align:start position:0%
decreasing the reimbursement of the
 
01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
other rates and the other rates are
 
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
probably still insufficient to cover the
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
cost as uh this service model continues
 
01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:22.669 align:start position:0%
cost as uh this service model continues
its

01:20:22.669 --> 01:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
its
 
01:20:24.910 --> 01:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
transformation uh from being volunteer
 
01:20:27.229 --> 01:20:27.239 align:start position:0%
firefighters to professional uh medical
 
01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:29.310 align:start position:0%
firefighters to professional uh medical
service

01:20:29.310 --> 01:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
technicians further discussion I'm
 
01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
delighted we have some experience on the
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
committee in this areas representative
 
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
hacken Phillips thank you Mr chair I do
 
01:20:40.709 --> 01:20:40.719 align:start position:0%
know uh this is particularly relevant
 
01:20:43.629 --> 01:20:43.639 align:start position:0%
for smaller communities supporting these
 
01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
Services uh you might you might imagine
 
01:20:50.030 --> 01:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
that larger um cities or towns that have
 
01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
multiple ambulatory services and calls
 
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
with a large budget may not not feel the
 
01:20:59.070 --> 01:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
effects of uh as much as smaller towns
 
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
with smaller budgets so you know one
 
01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
ride two rides can really blow up um you
 
01:21:07.149 --> 01:21:07.159 align:start position:0%
know their expectation of what they're
 
01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to be spending on these
 
01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
services so um I really think this is
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
something our rural communities can
 
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
benefit from and I support the motion
 
01:21:17.470 --> 01:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Mooney oh thank
 
01:21:20.110 --> 01:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um an amendment was just
 
01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
distributed and it's numbered
 
01:21:28.669 --> 01:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
1862 h from our sheet 1860 H so I would
 
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
like to move uh the adoption of
 
01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:33.910 align:start position:0%
like to move uh the adoption of
amendment

01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
1862 H which is the proper Amendment it
 
01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
adds the uh appropriation to the bill
 
01:21:42.830 --> 01:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
that was missing as discovered in
 
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
division three so I would request a
 
01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
second to that motion and then uh a vote
 
01:21:50.910 --> 01:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
thank you second we have a second and it
 
01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
it's clear this replaces the previous
 
01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:56.070 align:start position:0%
it's clear this replaces the previous
Amendment

01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:21:58.910 --> 01:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know what amendment number
 
01:22:02.669 --> 01:22:02.679 align:start position:0%
186 is Mr Ripple can you comment I think
 
01:22:04.110 --> 01:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
it's just a mistake on the sheet I think
 
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
1862 H was the correct Amendment all
 
01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
along oh it is oh
 
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
okay it's just a correction in the the
 
01:22:14.110 --> 01:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
numbering of the amendment all those in
 
01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
favor of adopting Amendment 1862 raise
 
01:22:17.159 --> 01:22:19.430 align:start position:0%
favor of adopting Amendment 1862 raise
your

01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%

hands hands down any
 
01:22:25.950 --> 01:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
opposed that motion is adopted
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
and now we go to representative
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
motion he's probably got the report
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
written well I I would say pretty you
 
01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:41.600 align:start position:0%

01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%

Mr Ripple to make sure I'm talking about
 
01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
the correct Amendment here uh
 
01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative Hull had a a late
 
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
breaking Amendment um relative to uh
 
01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
4177 do do do we do we have that
 
01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
available to us so I I believe the
 
01:24:47.790 --> 01:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
amendment for 417 number 1923 was the
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
one that was voted on in division three
 
01:24:52.149 --> 01:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
earlier today U is that consistent with
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
what the division three members okay oh
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
good good thank you um so uh so
 
01:25:00.990 --> 01:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
representative H can uh talk to his
 
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment and uh it it does a it does a
 
01:25:07.390 --> 01:25:07.400 align:start position:0%
couple of things that uh are are pretty
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
pivotable so uh representative H do you
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
want to speak sure thank you so um for
 
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
the purpose of discussion I move 2024
 
01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:20.360 align:start position:0%
1923 H as an amendment to Senate Bill
 
01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
417 I will quickly summarize the changes
 
01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
um the the purpose of this bill is to
 
01:25:29.229 --> 01:25:29.239 align:start position:0%
prioritize making sure that we can place
 
01:25:31.870 --> 01:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
children who are in danger of harm or
 
01:25:34.990 --> 01:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
neglect um with some sort of instate
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
placement um family as opposed to an
 
01:25:40.629 --> 01:25:40.639 align:start position:0%
instate placement in a in a facility
 
01:25:45.149 --> 01:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
like a um either a hotel or a group home
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
um or even worse yet would be out of
 
01:25:49.790 --> 01:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
state the the changes are as follows in
 
01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
lines 24 through 30 it changes the
 
01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
presumption that an app parent who has
 
01:25:56.669 --> 01:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
not been charged with abuse or neglect
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
is presumed innocent and deemed a fit
 
01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
parent and that the dcyf or the
 
01:26:04.629 --> 01:26:04.639 align:start position:0%
department can challenge that in and
 
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
call for a court hearing um it raises
 
01:26:10.149 --> 01:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
the bar from a propond of evidence to
 
01:26:11.669 --> 01:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence which is
 
01:26:13.510 --> 01:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
the standard that we use in other
 
01:26:17.790 --> 01:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
sections in our statutes relative to um
 
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
both civil and criminal cases um there
 
01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
was an a fair amount of discussion
 
01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
within our division on that next um is
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
page two it makes changes um it adopts
 
01:26:31.950 --> 01:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
an amendment that was proposed by the
 
01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
chairman wer it makes changes in line
 
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
five instead of just unique needs it it
 
01:26:41.109 --> 01:26:41.119 align:start position:0%
describes unique and and quantifies that
 
01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
to be physical mental emotional or
 
01:26:45.310 --> 01:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
medical needs of the child and then in
 
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
lines 13 through
 
01:26:50.189 --> 01:26:50.199 align:start position:0%
17 it incentivizes the parent to
 
01:26:51.709 --> 01:26:51.719 align:start position:0%
cooperate with the Department instead of
 
01:26:53.950 --> 01:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
penalizing the department the the parent
 
01:26:56.189 --> 01:26:56.199 align:start position:0%
in failure to cooperate with the
 
01:26:58.030 --> 01:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
department and it reads a parent
 
01:26:59.350 --> 01:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
cooperation with the Department's
 
01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
assessment or their effort to provide
 
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
any records necessary to such
 
01:27:03.669 --> 01:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
determination shall be weighed as a
 
01:27:05.070 --> 01:27:05.080 align:start position:0%
factor in favor of the fitness of the
 
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
parent um moving away from a penalty
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
based system of working with parents to
 
01:27:13.709 --> 01:27:13.719 align:start position:0%
a um rewards based system would be
 
01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
better um and then it makes minor tweaks
 
01:27:19.149 --> 01:27:19.159 align:start position:0%
relative to the language of adult this
 
01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
is line 29 um with related adult or kin
 
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
as defined in RSA 170 25 Roman numeral 8
 
01:27:29.830 --> 01:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
and that was discussed at length within
 
01:27:31.550 --> 01:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
our our committee or
 
01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
division um this gives the judicial
 
01:27:35.709 --> 01:27:35.719 align:start position:0%
branch some ability to make sure that
 
01:27:37.109 --> 01:27:37.119 align:start position:0%
the best interests of the child are
 
01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
taken care
 
01:27:41.669 --> 01:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
of and that is done throughout the bill
 
01:27:44.229 --> 01:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
um relative to that change of kin versus
 
01:27:47.950 --> 01:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
fictive kin which was in the the prior
 
01:27:50.590 --> 01:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
version representative Edwards uh thank
 
01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair representative hle you you
 
01:27:58.229 --> 01:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
put this uh on page two um lines 16 17
 
01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
and 18 the fact that parent owns a
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
firearm shall not make a home unsafe nor
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
be weighed against the parent could
 
01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
could you explain what the motivation of
 
01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
why that's important to have in there
 
01:28:14.709 --> 01:28:14.719 align:start position:0%
are we uh experiencing issues where a
 
01:28:17.470 --> 01:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
gun has caused a poor
 
01:28:20.149 --> 01:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
determination so thank you I I apologize
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
to the committee for not bringing that
 
01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
up it is a significant change um we have
 
01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
seen evidence in looking at the bridges
 
01:28:29.229 --> 01:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
files where the the mere presence of a
 
01:28:32.109 --> 01:28:32.119 align:start position:0%
firearm is now weighed against a parent
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
um ownership or or possession should not
 
01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
be we already have under our current
 
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:43.390 --> 01:28:43.400 align:start position:0%
650c right an entire chapter of law
 
01:28:44.950 --> 01:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
relative to negligent storage of
 
01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
firearms so if the if the family is
 
01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
misusing or mis storing a firearm it's
 
01:28:54.189 --> 01:28:54.199 align:start position:0%
already a a criminal um a violation of
 
01:28:57.189 --> 01:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
criminal code and is at a misdemeanor or
 
01:28:59.830 --> 01:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
felony level so obviously we're not
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
talking about failure to store these
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
correctly we're talking about the mere
 
01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
presence of one in the home or that the
 
01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
parent owns one and we've seen enough
 
01:29:10.669 --> 01:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
evidence that that is an issue that this
 
01:29:12.070 --> 01:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
that this amendment would correct that
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that is not a baseline
 
01:29:18.990 --> 01:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:22.189 --> 01:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
you further discussion representative
 
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
tersi thank you very much Mr chair I do
 
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
um have a problem with which with a
 
01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
couple parts of this but I'll just point
 
01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
out to
 
01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
um page
 
01:29:37.470 --> 01:29:37.480 align:start position:0%
two line
 
01:29:42.390 --> 01:29:42.400 align:start position:0%
five where the whole Amendment says um
 
01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
the unique physical mental emotional and
 
01:29:47.470 --> 01:29:47.480 align:start position:0%
medical needs of the child the original
 
01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:49.270 align:start position:0%
medical needs of the child the original
Bill

01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
said the unique needs of the child and
 
01:29:54.590 --> 01:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
whether or not the parent parent is
 
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
adequately prepared to address those
 
01:29:59.590 --> 01:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
needs and I believe removing the section
 
01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
about if a parent is adequately prepared
 
01:30:05.229 --> 01:30:05.239 align:start position:0%
to address the needs is problematic the
 
01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
reason why this section is so important
 
01:30:10.629 --> 01:30:10.639 align:start position:0%
is if we reflect on the harmony
 
01:30:13.070 --> 01:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
Montgomery case we all know that case
 
01:30:16.470 --> 01:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
very very well and Harmony Montgomery
 
01:30:21.229 --> 01:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
had unique needs she had unique
 
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
um developmental needs and it is clear
 
01:30:27.070 --> 01:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
that her
 
01:30:31.310 --> 01:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
parent was not prepared to address those
 
01:30:36.830 --> 01:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
needs so I feel removing that section
 
01:30:41.629 --> 01:30:41.639 align:start position:0%
there is really problematic um in that
 
01:30:44.229 --> 01:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
circumstance which we all know so well
 
01:30:47.550 --> 01:30:47.560 align:start position:0%
the other thing um with that section is
 
01:30:50.189 --> 01:30:50.199 align:start position:0%
representive whole went on to list
 
01:30:52.350 --> 01:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
physical mental emotional
 
01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
medical what does he missing there's not
 
01:30:57.950 --> 01:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
educational in there a child may have
 
01:31:00.430 --> 01:31:00.440 align:start position:0%
educational needs that we need to
 
01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
address um when considering the best
 
01:31:05.229 --> 01:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
place for a child so that's my problem
 
01:31:06.270 --> 01:31:06.280 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
section um and then regarding the
 
01:31:14.109 --> 01:31:14.119 align:start position:0%
firearm um line on page 17 um I
 
01:31:18.030 --> 01:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
understand the you know the there's a um
 
01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
safe storage um statute already um but
 
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
there are circum cumstances
 
01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
where um perhaps there is a history of
 
01:31:32.790 --> 01:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
domestic violence in the home or if um
 
01:31:34.709 --> 01:31:34.719 align:start position:0%
you know there are other outstanding
 
01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances where having a firearm in
 
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
the home is problematic I'm not saying
 
01:31:42.070 --> 01:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
owning a firearm removes your right of
 
01:31:43.830 --> 01:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
being able to provide a safe home for
 
01:31:46.830 --> 01:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
your child not at all but I do believe
 
01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
that there are unique circum again
 
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
there's that word unique circumstances
 
01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
and we need to keep those that option
 
01:31:58.070 --> 01:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
available um so I I cannot support this
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you I think at the top
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
of page two that paragraph 1A does the
 
01:32:08.430 --> 01:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
same thing as what was left out in
 
01:32:12.109 --> 01:32:12.119 align:start position:0%
a Mr Sher if I may speak to it go ahead
 
01:32:14.189 --> 01:32:14.199 align:start position:0%
thank you um in lines two and three it
 
01:32:15.870 --> 01:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
says in determining whether a parent is
 
01:32:18.430 --> 01:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
pit to fit to perform his or her
 
01:32:21.790 --> 01:32:21.800 align:start position:0%
duties um I think that is in fact the
 
01:32:23.350 --> 01:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
exact language that we would need
 
01:32:26.430 --> 01:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
relative to a and the reason we captured
 
01:32:28.270 --> 01:32:28.280 align:start position:0%
physical mental emotional and medical
 
01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
are those are physical physical
 
01:32:33.629 --> 01:32:33.639 align:start position:0%
attributes we can at some level measure
 
01:32:33.639 --> 01:32:34.629 align:start position:0%
attributes we can at some level measure
and

01:32:34.629 --> 01:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
quantify um and while the member from
 
01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
nashille brings up educational and I'm
 
01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
not horribly opposed to adding that to
 
01:32:45.790 --> 01:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
this list um I I do think we needed a
 
01:32:48.189 --> 01:32:48.199 align:start position:0%
Quantified list
 
01:32:51.629 --> 01:32:51.639 align:start position:0%
there further discussion representative
 
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
Edwards uh thank you Mr chair uh to
 
01:32:57.910 --> 01:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative's concern about uh
 
01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
flexibility I I read at the line uh page
 
01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
two lines 1 through four as providing a
 
01:33:08.830 --> 01:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of emphasis on the the
 
01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
child's welfare and also saying that the
 
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
following factors should be considered
 
01:33:16.910 --> 01:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
in addition to any other relevant
 
01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
evidence presented so so although there
 
01:33:22.590 --> 01:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
is a list there this list is is not
 
01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
meant to be incl exclusive this list is
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
meant to be you know a sort of a minimal
 
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
standard of considerations while leaving
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
the door open to any other
 
01:33:34.510 --> 01:33:34.520 align:start position:0%
considerations that are relevant to the
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
determining the welfare of the
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
child represent
 
01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
walner thank you Mr
 
01:33:45.510 --> 01:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
chair so this kind of amendment is
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
exactly what scares me when it comes to
 
01:33:54.030 --> 01:33:54.040 align:start position:0%
making legislation at the last minute
 
01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
um this came in there are significant
 
01:33:57.600 --> 01:33:59.030 align:start position:0%
um this came in there are significant
very

01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:34:03.709 --> 01:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
significant um changes to our laws in
 
01:34:06.830 --> 01:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation we did not
 
01:34:10.750 --> 01:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
have public input on it we did not have
 
01:34:13.550 --> 01:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
the department speak to this amendment
 
01:34:16.030 --> 01:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
to tell us how this would affect their
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
work uh we did have
 
01:34:22.510 --> 01:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
um a a representative from the court who
 
01:34:25.709 --> 01:34:25.719 align:start position:0%
did speak briefly on on it um there are
 
01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
some very significant changes to law and
 
01:34:32.189 --> 01:34:32.199 align:start position:0%
I will just bring up the one that um
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
sort of jumps out at me at least is we
 
01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.149 align:start position:0%
sort of jumps out at me at least is we
are

01:34:37.149 --> 01:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
changing um how cases um go before the
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
court um and we're changing from
 
01:34:45.470 --> 01:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence
 
01:34:48.910 --> 01:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
preponderance of to clear and convincing
 
01:34:52.510 --> 01:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
evidence and that is a very serious
 
01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
serious move for us to be making here at
 
01:34:58.229 --> 01:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
the last minute we actually saw this
 
01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
amendment I think um sometime around
 
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
noon today and I think it's not a way
 
01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
not a good way for us to make
 
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
legislation particularly when the woman
 
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
from the court even told us that this
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
means that fewer cases will come before
 
01:35:19.950 --> 01:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
the before the court and this has the
 
01:35:22.910 --> 01:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
potential and we do not know the number
 
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
we this has the potential of putting
 
01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
children in danger and I think we have
 
01:35:31.350 --> 01:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
to think very long and hard before we
 
01:35:34.669 --> 01:35:34.679 align:start position:0%
make these kinds of decisions without
 
01:35:36.550 --> 01:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
the right
 
01:35:38.990 --> 01:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
information further discussion represent
 
01:35:41.550 --> 01:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
Hull thank you Mr chair if I I may
 
01:35:44.550 --> 01:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
respond to that if I bring up one of the
 
01:35:47.070 --> 01:35:47.080 align:start position:0%
sections of the guidelines relative to
 
01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
guardianship of minors and what is the
 
01:35:50.830 --> 01:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
process and this is a document that I
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
have pulled from um our State website
 
01:35:56.229 --> 01:35:56.239 align:start position:0%
it says and I quote if however a person
 
01:35:58.030 --> 01:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
seeking guardianship is not the parent
 
01:36:00.189 --> 01:36:00.199 align:start position:0%
of a minor that person must prove by
 
01:36:01.790 --> 01:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence that the
 
01:36:03.310 --> 01:36:03.320 align:start position:0%
best interests of the minor require
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
substitution or supplementation of
 
01:36:06.870 --> 01:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
Parental care and the supervision to
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
provide the essential physical and
 
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
safety needs of the minor or to present
 
01:36:12.590 --> 01:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
specific or significant psychological
 
01:36:14.830 --> 01:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
harm to the minor the reason I bring
 
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
that up is we are using this standard in
 
01:36:19.470 --> 01:36:19.480 align:start position:0%
child welfare cases already there's
 
01:36:21.550 --> 01:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
other places within our statutes that we
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
use both preponderance of of evidence as
 
01:36:27.629 --> 01:36:27.639 align:start position:0%
well as clear and convincing um it's in
 
01:36:30.550 --> 01:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
the rules within the department under
 
01:36:34.470 --> 01:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
H 20 h-c
 
01:36:38.510 --> 01:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
20314 standards of burden of proof so
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
what's been changed here is to minimize
 
01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
the roadblocks to getting a child into a
 
01:36:47.310 --> 01:36:47.320 align:start position:0%
home where the parent or or Guardian
 
01:36:51.550 --> 01:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't charged or with any right this is
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
where the pro the respective
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
home the the parents are have not had
 
01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
any issues with dcyf so why are we
 
01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
making it that much harder to move
 
01:37:04.830 --> 01:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
children into these new homes I would
 
01:37:06.510 --> 01:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
think we would want to incentivize this
 
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
instead of warehousing them in hotel
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
rooms or group homes where there's a
 
01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
much higher likelihood for abuse so this
 
01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
just means that DCF has a slightly
 
01:37:20.109 --> 01:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
higher burden and to prove that they
 
01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
can't the children can't move to this
 
01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
new home represent Gro thank you uh Mr
 
01:37:28.990 --> 01:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
chair I realized that this is only my
 
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
second day on this committee however I
 
01:37:33.629 --> 01:37:33.639 align:start position:0%
must tell you that once again I'm going
 
01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:38.159 align:start position:0%
to throw up the policy card because this
 
01:37:41.310 --> 01:37:41.320 align:start position:0%
is not a financial decision I'm sorry to
 
01:37:44.589 --> 01:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
say up until now I've been very diligent
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
in making sure that I understand the
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
financial implications and you've and
 
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
I've learned a lot however this policy
 
01:37:55.750 --> 01:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
belongs either in judiciary or or child
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
of family law it does not belong here
 
01:38:02.589 --> 01:38:02.599 align:start position:0%
and I I can understand the the interest
 
01:38:07.390 --> 01:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
but I really cannot support an amendment
 
01:38:11.149 --> 01:38:11.159 align:start position:0%
that is strictly policy which this
 
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
is I just I can't support that and I
 
01:38:17.470 --> 01:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
would hope that you would all recognize
 
01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
that your as your perview because you
 
01:38:22.669 --> 01:38:22.679 align:start position:0%
have your strength and other committees
 
01:38:25.390 --> 01:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
have their strength and furthermore this
 
01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
is a kind of Bill that needs a hearing
 
01:38:32.430 --> 01:38:32.440 align:start position:0%
with everyone's input this is a serious
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
deal thank you further discussion
 
01:38:38.109 --> 01:38:38.119 align:start position:0%
representative Hull thank you Mr chair
 
01:38:39.589 --> 01:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
um I would like to bring up the docket
 
01:38:41.589 --> 01:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
for this bill because this bill came
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
from the Senate and went to the house
 
01:38:45.390 --> 01:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
and children and family law had a
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
discussion on this and they proposed an
 
01:38:49.629 --> 01:38:49.639 align:start position:0%
amendment that was defeated on the floor
 
01:38:52.270 --> 01:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
by a vote of 175 in favor and 188
 
01:38:54.270 --> 01:38:54.280 align:start position:0%
opposed subsequently I moved to table it
 
01:38:55.589 --> 01:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
so we could have start having these
 
01:38:57.910 --> 01:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
discussions and that narrowly failed by
 
01:38:57.920 --> 01:38:59.149 align:start position:0%
discussions and that narrowly failed by
180

01:38:59.149 --> 01:38:59.159 align:start position:0%
180
 
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
184 um yes there is some policy things
 
01:39:04.030 --> 01:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
but the policy change relative to
 
01:39:05.550 --> 01:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
section 3 is important because it
 
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
minimizes the number of Court hearings
 
01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
that are going to happen by changing the
 
01:39:10.910 --> 01:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
presumption that this is a fit parent to
 
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
move the children
 
01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
into representative
 
01:39:18.629 --> 01:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
Stringham I I think I fall in line with
 
01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
those to keep the language as a
 
01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence uh the
 
01:39:26.070 --> 01:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
um you know there's obviously a
 
01:39:29.109 --> 01:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
trade-off of risk of of uh of a fit
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
parent uh losing access to a child
 
01:39:34.510 --> 01:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
versus a child being put in a perilous
 
01:39:36.629 --> 01:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
um potentially life-threatening
 
01:39:39.070 --> 01:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
situation and I I think clear and
 
01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence is just uh you know
 
01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
there's there's not a camera go what's
 
01:39:45.870 --> 01:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
going on in these households 24 hours a
 
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
day I still think it's a very very high
 
01:39:50.669 --> 01:39:50.679 align:start position:0%
bar that's uh uh that's used very
 
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
judiciously and and without Committee
 
01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:54.070 align:start position:0%
judiciously and and without Committee
hearing

01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:39:56.669 --> 01:39:56.679 align:start position:0%
and and experts voicing on it um I'm
 
01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
going to vote against the amendment and
 
01:40:01.470 --> 01:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
in support of the preponderance of the
 
01:40:03.669 --> 01:40:03.679 align:start position:0%
evidence language thank
 
01:40:07.070 --> 01:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
you further
 
01:40:11.310 --> 01:40:11.320 align:start position:0%
discussion we've just had two people
 
01:40:13.870 --> 01:40:13.880 align:start position:0%
leave all right one's coming back should
 
01:40:17.109 --> 01:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
we wait for the other one yes all
 
01:40:20.830 --> 01:40:20.840 align:start position:0%
right all right we have a full
 
01:40:23.149 --> 01:40:23.159 align:start position:0%
committee there's no further discussion
 
01:40:24.750 --> 01:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
the the clerk will call the role on the
 
01:40:27.589 --> 01:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
motion of ought to pass as amended
 
01:40:29.950 --> 01:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 47 the amendment first Mr
 
01:40:31.589 --> 01:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
chairman wait a minute Amendment
 
01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:54.830 --> 01:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:56.750 --> 01:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
13 to
 
01:41:02.430 --> 01:41:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:04.830 --> 01:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
adopted representative H is recognized
 
01:41:08.709 --> 01:41:08.719 align:start position:0%
for a motion I move to pass um Senate
 
01:41:11.709 --> 01:41:11.719 align:start position:0%
Bill 47 with the amendment 1923
 
01:41:14.550 --> 01:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
H motion is not to pass as amended
 
01:41:19.109 --> 01:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1923 on Senate Bill 417 second
 
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
and a second may may I make an
 
01:41:24.990 --> 01:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
observation certainly um th this bill
 
01:41:27.790 --> 01:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
covers some of the same terrain that we
 
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:30.719 align:start position:0%
covered in house bill 1573 that division
 
01:41:33.910 --> 01:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
3 looked at went over to the Senate uh
 
01:41:36.669 --> 01:41:36.679 align:start position:0%
Senate has passed us and sent it to us
 
01:41:42.990 --> 01:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
um if if we get a positive floor vote on
 
01:41:46.910 --> 01:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 417 as amended it's not
 
01:41:49.310 --> 01:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
done what'll happen is uh Committee of
 
01:41:51.870 --> 01:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
conference will probably be
 
01:41:55.550 --> 01:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
required I re recommend that we pass
 
01:41:58.990 --> 01:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
this further discussion seeing none the
 
01:42:01.229 --> 01:42:01.239 align:start position:0%
clerk will call the role on the motion
 
01:42:04.470 --> 01:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
of ought to pass as amended by Amendment
 
01:42:07.550 --> 01:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
1923 on Senate Bill
 
01:42:10.950 --> 01:42:10.960 align:start position:0%

01:46:01.189 --> 01:46:01.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment 20241 958 H um uh on line six
 
01:46:05.830 --> 01:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh establishes a Medica a Medicaid
 
01:46:08.350 --> 01:46:08.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate dependent upon a
 
01:46:11.350 --> 01:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
Medicare reference and in order to make
 
01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:14.719 align:start position:0%
that reference uh fixed the date of
 
01:46:16.270 --> 01:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
January 1
 
01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
2024 was uh selected um because those
 
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
rate changes come out as frequently is
 
01:46:26.189 --> 01:46:26.199 align:start position:0%
quarterly so as a using that as our
 
01:46:28.830 --> 01:46:28.840 align:start position:0%
Benchmark we said that U the
 
01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate for Medicaid should
 
01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
be 90% of that uh in order to avoid uh a
 
01:46:40.830 --> 01:46:40.840 align:start position:0%
a a constant escalation in that um rate
 
01:46:44.550 --> 01:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
over time uh we we left it at 90% of
 
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
that Benchmark as of that day this bill
 
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
appropriates uh $620,000
 
01:46:55.310 --> 01:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
uh to uh get get the uh rate re um
 
01:46:57.589 --> 01:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
implemented and and begin reimbursement
 
01:46:57.599 --> 01:46:58.430 align:start position:0%

supplemental appropriation to the

Medicaid patients these medical devices

include back and knee braces Orthotics
 
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:08.960 align:start position:0%

body parts uh the current payment rate
 
01:48:19.510 --> 01:48:19.520 align:start position:0%

01:48:22.390 --> 01:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rate table uh this supplemental
 
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
appro ration would provide an increase
 
01:48:28.270 --> 01:48:28.280 align:start position:0%
to most uh most products and a reduction
 
01:48:31.270 --> 01:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
in a few so that the payment rate
 
01:48:34.189 --> 01:48:34.199 align:start position:0%

reimbursement for these essential
 
01:48:55.030 --> 01:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
services uh this increase represents the
 
01:48:57.229 --> 01:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
floor payment that our New Hampshire
 
01:48:59.790 --> 01:48:59.800 align:start position:0%

professionals and making an
 
01:50:39.550 --> 01:50:39.560 align:start position:0%
appropriation there um the division
 
01:50:44.069 --> 01:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
three U recommended OTP nine to nothing
 
01:50:46.350 --> 01:50:46.360 align:start position:0%
uh you you you were the one in the
 
01:50:50.069 --> 01:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
committee that made that initial um uh
 
01:50:52.990 --> 01:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
motion um would you would would you like
 
01:50:55.470 --> 01:50:55.480 align:start position:0%
to take this discussion at this point
 
01:50:57.149 --> 01:50:57.159 align:start position:0%
sir or do you want me yes I will thank
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
you so the HHS came before us this is a
 
01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
program that's been in existence for
 
01:51:04.589 --> 01:51:04.599 align:start position:0%
quite a while they referred us to the
 
01:51:08.629 --> 01:51:08.639 align:start position:0%
slrp the state loan repayment program uh
 
01:51:11.589 --> 01:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
it's for nurses working in underserved
 
01:51:16.709 --> 01:51:16.719 align:start position:0%
areas um and they had a r the modest
 
01:51:17.870 --> 01:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
request for
 
01:51:20.550 --> 01:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
300,000 because the the fund was running
 
01:51:23.189 --> 01:51:23.199 align:start position:0%
a little short and they wanted to keep
 
01:51:26.910 --> 01:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
uh that incentive going for the for the
 
01:51:30.030 --> 01:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
areas that needed nurses so we
 
01:51:32.870 --> 01:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
unanimously adopted it and I move ought
 
01:51:45.550 --> 01:51:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
second further discussion I I I have
 
01:51:50.310 --> 01:51:50.320 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Edwards uh
 
01:51:52.310 --> 01:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I I I hate to do
 
01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
this to my division 3 counterparts uh
 
01:51:58.270 --> 01:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
but the longer I thought about this um
 
01:52:02.069 --> 01:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
Bill the less and less I I liked it uh
 
01:52:05.229 --> 01:52:05.239 align:start position:0%
the $300,000 does in fact supplement an
 
01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
existing program uh it was said in
 
01:52:11.550 --> 01:52:11.560 align:start position:0%
testimony that that 300,000 would cover
 
01:52:15.310 --> 01:52:15.320 align:start position:0%
uh funds for six people who are serving
 
01:52:18.109 --> 01:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
in underserved areas and as I started
 
01:52:20.830 --> 01:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
thinking about it the state would grant
 
01:52:23.430 --> 01:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
them a $500,000
 
01:52:26.470 --> 01:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
or excuse me a $50,000 bonus those six
 
01:52:29.990 --> 01:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
people to work in an area where the
 
01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:31.390 align:start position:0%
people to work in an area where the
median

01:52:31.390 --> 01:52:31.400 align:start position:0%
median
 
01:52:35.270 --> 01:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
income probably isn't $50,000 and so it
 
01:52:40.350 --> 01:52:40.360 align:start position:0%
just felt to me feels to me now uh like
 
01:52:44.270 --> 01:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
a heavy Distortion of economic benefit
 
01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:46.189 align:start position:0%
a heavy Distortion of economic benefit
being

01:52:46.189 --> 01:52:46.199 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:52:50.709 --> 01:52:50.719 align:start position:0%
assigned into an area of the state that
 
01:52:53.390 --> 01:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
um has has a lot of E economic issues
 
01:52:55.709 --> 01:52:55.719 align:start position:0%
and and and while I want to provide some
 
01:52:58.709 --> 01:52:58.719 align:start position:0%
relief I'm not convinced this program
 
01:53:01.069 --> 01:53:01.079 align:start position:0%
was the right way to do that so I'll
 
01:53:04.510 --> 01:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
I'll be voting no representative thank
 
01:53:06.189 --> 01:53:06.199 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I just want to provide a
 
01:53:07.709 --> 01:53:07.719 align:start position:0%
little more information about what this
 
01:53:12.069 --> 01:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
bill actually does um this is a bill
 
01:53:14.790 --> 01:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
that will attract Workforce of nurses
 
01:53:17.069 --> 01:53:17.079 align:start position:0%
and medical professionals to an area
 
01:53:19.310 --> 01:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
that's underserved in testimony we heard
 
01:53:20.910 --> 01:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
primarily what we are talking about here
 
01:53:23.709 --> 01:53:23.719 align:start position:0%
is Coos County it's really hard to get
 
01:53:26.470 --> 01:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
young nursing graduates uh to say I'm
 
01:53:28.629 --> 01:53:28.639 align:start position:0%
going to go start my life up in Coos
 
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
County if they're graduating from say
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
Rivier University in nasua or St anum's
 
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
nursing school in Manchester what this
 
01:53:38.149 --> 01:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
is is a bit of an incentive for them to
 
01:53:40.950 --> 01:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
move to Coos County to participate in
 
01:53:42.870 --> 01:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
the program they sign a contract that
 
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
they are going to work up there for an
 
01:53:46.910 --> 01:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
extended period of time I believe it was
 
01:53:50.950 --> 01:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
three three years um the program at
 
01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:52.629 align:start position:0%
three three years um the program at
$300,000

01:53:52.629 --> 01:53:52.639 align:start position:0%
$300,000
 
01:53:55.470 --> 01:53:55.480 align:start position:0%
would provide at minimum they said
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
program to six nurses however when you
 
01:54:02.109 --> 01:54:02.119 align:start position:0%
run the numbers of what those six nurses
 
01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
can do over the course of those years
 
01:54:06.109 --> 01:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
25,000 patient visits 25,000 patient
 
01:54:12.510 --> 01:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
visits up in Coos County that would not
 
01:54:14.790 --> 01:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
be able to happen otherwise without
 
01:54:16.870 --> 01:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
these people up there six nurses may not
 
01:54:19.030 --> 01:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
sound like a lot but when we're talking
 
01:54:21.390 --> 01:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
about 25,000 patient visits for kids
 
01:54:23.709 --> 01:54:23.719 align:start position:0%
with ear infection for strep throat
 
01:54:26.430 --> 01:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
visits all of those things we need these
 
01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
people up there I think it's a strong
 
01:54:30.109 --> 01:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
program we already know it works because
 
01:54:32.830 --> 01:54:32.840 align:start position:0%
it's an ongoing program I am going to
 
01:54:35.790 --> 01:54:35.800 align:start position:0%
vote Yes on the motion about about to
 
01:54:38.430 --> 01:54:38.440 align:start position:0%

01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:39.669 align:start position:0%

Shapiro yes thank you Mr chairman and um
 
01:54:44.550 --> 01:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
this bill came before Health and Human
 
01:54:47.069 --> 01:54:47.079 align:start position:0%
Services committee and what we heard in
 
01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
our committee when people testified on
 
01:54:52.830 --> 01:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is that it would um
 
01:54:55.669 --> 01:54:55.679 align:start position:0%
serve six to 10 full-time nurses and up
 
01:55:00.189 --> 01:55:00.199 align:start position:0%
to 17 part-time nurses um this is a
 
01:55:03.629 --> 01:55:03.639 align:start position:0%
program that um as was already stated is
 
01:55:07.750 --> 01:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
in existence for a long time um and
 
01:55:11.430 --> 01:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
serves Physicians nurses a whole host of
 
01:55:14.510 --> 01:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
um medical providers but this money
 
01:55:17.430 --> 01:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
would just be earmarked for nurses
 
01:55:20.310 --> 01:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
because there's a particular Acuity of
 
01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:22.629 align:start position:0%
because there's a particular Acuity of
um

01:55:22.629 --> 01:55:22.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
you know in Workforce shortages of
 
01:55:28.629 --> 01:55:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:31.629 --> 01:55:31.639 align:start position:0%
um I just I'm going to support this bill
 
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
because I think it is re it's not enough
 
01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
it's insufficient um it's not going to
 
01:55:39.629 --> 01:55:39.639 align:start position:0%
resolve our whole Workforce shortage but
 
01:55:42.589 --> 01:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
for those providers for those hospitals
 
01:55:46.510 --> 01:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
or nursing homes that are having to pay
 
01:55:49.629 --> 01:55:49.639 align:start position:0%
um traveling nurses this will make a
 
01:55:51.750 --> 01:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
significant difference if they can keep
 
01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:53.270 align:start position:0%
significant difference if they can keep
permanent

01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%

01:58:46.149 --> 01:58:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:48.149 --> 01:58:48.159 align:start position:0%
not I'm just going to point out that the
 
01:58:50.350 --> 01:58:50.360 align:start position:0%
one I'm handing out now in 1948 is the
 
01:58:53.030 --> 01:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
one that was discussed in
 
01:58:54.990 --> 01:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
represent does have an alternative
 
01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:56.350 align:start position:0%
represent does have an alternative
version

01:58:56.350 --> 01:58:56.360 align:start position:0%
version
 
01:59:00.109 --> 01:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
Don't okay so so you couldn't hear that
 
01:59:04.229 --> 01:59:04.239 align:start position:0%
so the version being handed out is 1948
 
01:59:07.149 --> 01:59:07.159 align:start position:0%
this is the version that was discussed
 
01:59:10.790 --> 01:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
and voted on out of division three and
 
01:59:12.830 --> 01:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll defer to even though it's got
 
01:59:15.589 --> 01:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
my name on it I'll defer to represent
 
01:59:19.069 --> 01:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
walner do you
 
01:59:23.430 --> 01:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
yeah okay PA hold your hat because this
 
01:59:27.390 --> 01:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
is GNA be a little confusing
 
01:59:32.069 --> 01:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
okay so when we heard this bill this is
 
01:59:36.510 --> 01:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
um about courta appointed lawyers for
 
01:59:39.390 --> 01:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
children and
 
01:59:44.270 --> 01:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
um there was a concern brought up that
 
01:59:46.390 --> 01:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
it's very it you know it's it's really
 
01:59:48.629 --> 01:59:48.639 align:start position:0%
challenging in this market to find
 
01:59:51.030 --> 01:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
enough lawyers to do this
 
01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:52.550 align:start position:0%
enough lawyers to do this
work

01:59:52.550 --> 01:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:59:56.229 --> 01:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
so we tried some we tried some language
 
02:00:00.550 --> 02:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
about what to do about that um and then
 
02:00:04.589 --> 02:00:04.599 align:start position:0%
over the weekend we were I worked with
 
02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:09.679 align:start position:0%
some folks around developing a phase in
 
02:00:14.510 --> 02:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
process so what will happen is on July 1
 
02:00:14.520 --> 02:00:16.589 align:start position:0%
process so what will happen is on July 1
of

02:00:16.589 --> 02:00:16.599 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:00:20.030 --> 02:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
2025 all children will be all children
 
02:00:22.790 --> 02:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
in residential care they're in the
 
02:00:24.510 --> 02:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
custody of the state they live in a
 
02:00:27.910 --> 02:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
residential facility all th all of those
 
02:00:30.109 --> 02:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
children will be eligible for a Loy to
 
02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
have a
 
02:00:34.750 --> 02:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
lawyer there are about
 
02:00:37.709 --> 02:00:37.719 align:start position:0%
124 25 of those children we don't know
 
02:00:41.790 --> 02:00:41.800 align:start position:0%
exactly how many there'll be on um July
 
02:00:44.790 --> 02:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
1 of 2025 but it will probably be in
 
02:00:46.870 --> 02:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
that that round
 
02:00:50.430 --> 02:00:50.440 align:start position:0%
range imagine trying to find on that day
 
02:00:52.629 --> 02:00:52.639 align:start position:0%
125 lawyers
 
02:00:55.350 --> 02:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
probably really a big
 
02:00:55.360 --> 02:00:57.109 align:start position:0%
probably really a big
steep

02:00:57.109 --> 02:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
steep
 
02:01:02.189 --> 02:01:02.199 align:start position:0%
um for us to do so what we did was we on
 
02:01:05.870 --> 02:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
page two of the amendment you'll see at
 
02:01:10.390 --> 02:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
the bottom we did a phase in so we
 
02:01:12.550 --> 02:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
phased in the oldest
 
02:01:15.750 --> 02:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
children then the next and the next and
 
02:01:18.669 --> 02:01:18.679 align:start position:0%
the next taking a year to make sure that
 
02:01:22.589 --> 02:01:22.599 align:start position:0%
every child who was in residential care
 
02:01:23.629 --> 02:01:23.639 align:start position:0%
had a
 
02:01:27.109 --> 02:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
lawyer the other thing that we did in
 
02:01:30.069 --> 02:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
this amendment was we
 
02:01:33.550 --> 02:01:33.560 align:start position:0%
um made sure that children who were out
 
02:01:36.109 --> 02:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
England had a lawyer so children placed
 
02:01:43.350 --> 02:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
in outof state placements and we do have
 
02:01:46.270 --> 02:01:46.280 align:start position:0%
some not many we're working on getting
 
02:01:48.069 --> 02:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
that number down but we do have some
 
02:01:50.189 --> 02:01:50.199 align:start position:0%
children who are in outof state
 
02:01:50.199 --> 02:01:53.589 align:start position:0%
children who are in outof state
placements

02:01:53.589 --> 02:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:58.229 --> 02:01:58.239 align:start position:0%
and right under the phase down on page
 
02:02:00.390 --> 02:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
two you'll
 
02:02:03.990 --> 02:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
see I'll read this paragraph to you not
 
02:02:07.069 --> 02:02:07.079 align:start position:0%
withstanding this subparagraph in any
 
02:02:09.750 --> 02:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
action in which despite diligent efforts
 
02:02:12.709 --> 02:02:12.719 align:start position:0%
to secure counsel an attorney is not
 
02:02:15.629 --> 02:02:15.639 align:start position:0%
available for appointment litigation May
 
02:02:18.390 --> 02:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
proceed until an attorney becomes
 
02:02:22.069 --> 02:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
available in such cases the court shall
 
02:02:22.079 --> 02:02:23.149 align:start position:0%
available in such cases the court shall
where

02:02:23.149 --> 02:02:23.159 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:02:23.159 --> 02:02:24.830 align:start position:0%
where
possible

02:02:24.830 --> 02:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
possible
 
02:02:27.990 --> 02:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
prioritize consideration of legal issues
 
02:02:30.310 --> 02:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
that do not affect the child's expressed
 
02:02:32.709 --> 02:02:32.719 align:start position:0%
interest until an attorney becomes
 
02:02:35.709 --> 02:02:35.719 align:start position:0%
available so we will have the phase down
 
02:02:39.270 --> 02:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
we will have the phase down but if we're
 
02:02:42.830 --> 02:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
just not able to accomplish it we do
 
02:02:46.669 --> 02:02:46.679 align:start position:0%
have this paragraph well what happened
 
02:02:50.709 --> 02:02:50.719 align:start position:0%
is there's a drafting error probably my
 
02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
fault um um and I will tell you where
 
02:02:58.310 --> 02:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
that is if you turn to your bill and you
 
02:03:02.669 --> 02:03:02.679 align:start position:0%
look at line8 of page two you'll also
 
02:03:06.990 --> 02:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
there see notwithstanding the above it
 
02:03:09.350 --> 02:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
does not fit there that's not where it
 
02:03:12.870 --> 02:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
belongs it belongs Down Below on line
 
02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
35 okay so it needs to come out of there
 
02:03:23.189 --> 02:03:23.199 align:start position:0%
then in reading it a little further
 
02:03:27.030 --> 02:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
again it appears on line 18 on page
 
02:03:30.709 --> 02:03:30.719 align:start position:0%
three not withstanding the
 
02:03:34.750 --> 02:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
above that's not where this belongs it
 
02:03:40.149 --> 02:03:40.159 align:start position:0%
belongs it belongs in L on line 35 under
 
02:03:43.629 --> 02:03:43.639 align:start position:0%
the phase down it refers to the phase
 
02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
down not withstanding the
 
02:03:49.709 --> 02:03:49.719 align:start position:0%
above so what we have here is a little
 
02:03:52.830 --> 02:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
bit of a mess um
 
02:03:55.149 --> 02:03:55.159 align:start position:0%
I do have an amendment that takes it out
 
02:03:58.790 --> 02:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
of that fixed it up to line eight took
 
02:03:59.750 --> 02:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
it out
 
02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
there but I didn't turn the page and see
 
02:04:07.149 --> 02:04:07.159 align:start position:0%
that in line on page three it also
 
02:04:10.709 --> 02:04:10.719 align:start position:0%
repeated it and then we found that so I
 
02:04:12.350 --> 02:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
don't know how the chairman would like
 
02:04:15.189 --> 02:04:15.199 align:start position:0%
to proceed at this
 
02:04:17.870 --> 02:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
point my amend my Amendment takes it out
 
02:04:21.310 --> 02:04:21.320 align:start position:0%
in one place um but now there are two
 
02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:23.589 align:start position:0%
in one place um but now there are two
places

02:04:23.589 --> 02:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
places
 
02:04:26.510 --> 02:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
may I may I offer repres Edward I I I I
 
02:04:29.069 --> 02:04:29.079 align:start position:0%
want to um thank representative walner
 
02:04:30.910 --> 02:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
for all the work that she's put into
 
02:04:34.109 --> 02:04:34.119 align:start position:0%
this um it it may feel chaotic and
 
02:04:36.709 --> 02:04:36.719 align:start position:0%
unsettled to people that would like uh
 
02:04:40.629 --> 02:04:40.639 align:start position:0%
this to be more stable by now um but I
 
02:04:42.510 --> 02:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
think the issue is that we've all been
 
02:04:45.390 --> 02:04:45.400 align:start position:0%
trying very hard to work very quickly to
 
02:04:48.270 --> 02:04:48.280 align:start position:0%
get the very best bill we can and I
 
02:04:49.830 --> 02:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate representative walner
 
02:04:53.629 --> 02:04:53.639 align:start position:0%
stepping in I I I I think in the past
 
02:04:57.470 --> 02:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
we've accepted an amendment noting
 
02:05:01.830 --> 02:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
technical uh Corrections or or um the
 
02:05:04.390 --> 02:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
other word
 
02:05:10.109 --> 02:05:10.119 align:start position:0%
um grammatical fixes and I I I assume
 
02:05:11.870 --> 02:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
that these the the fixes that
 
02:05:14.229 --> 02:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
representative walner just alluded to
 
02:05:16.790 --> 02:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
could fall into that category but I
 
02:05:20.350 --> 02:05:20.360 align:start position:0%
would look to Mr Ripple to say if if if
 
02:05:23.390 --> 02:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
if these Corrections could be accepted I
 
02:05:24.990 --> 02:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
think if the committee were so inclined
 
02:05:26.830 --> 02:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
you could take a vote to adopt
 
02:05:29.750 --> 02:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
1948 with the understanding that I would
 
02:05:32.229 --> 02:05:32.239 align:start position:0%
remove the sentence that begins with
 
02:05:36.030 --> 02:05:36.040 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding on page two lines 8- 12
 
02:05:40.910 --> 02:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:43.510 --> 02:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
22 that's what my recommendation to you
 
02:05:44.790 --> 02:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
would be Mr
 
02:05:47.189 --> 02:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
chair would they get moved to somewhere
 
02:05:49.149 --> 02:05:49.159 align:start position:0%
else or are they just not needed where
 
02:05:49.159 --> 02:05:49.870 align:start position:0%
else or are they just not needed where
they

02:05:49.870 --> 02:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:05:52.350 --> 02:05:52.360 align:start position:0%
are just I think representative Walter's
 
02:05:53.470 --> 02:05:53.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation is that they're not
 
02:05:55.830 --> 02:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
needed where they are the phrase would
 
02:05:58.149 --> 02:05:58.159 align:start position:0%
remain on page
 
02:06:01.669 --> 02:06:01.679 align:start position:0%
two beginning on line 35 yeah that's
 
02:06:06.030 --> 02:06:06.040 align:start position:0%
where we decided it did belong yes just
 
02:06:09.709 --> 02:06:09.719 align:start position:0%
okay you have a question representative
 
02:06:11.830 --> 02:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
papichi thank you just to make sure I
 
02:06:13.950 --> 02:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
understand because there is a lot of um
 
02:06:17.310 --> 02:06:17.320 align:start position:0%
changes we would be removing essentially
 
02:06:19.270 --> 02:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
starting with a word not withstanding
 
02:06:21.870 --> 02:06:21.880 align:start position:0%
the above and then the next four lines
 
02:06:24.870 --> 02:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
both on starting on line 8 page two and
 
02:06:28.910 --> 02:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
then the line 18 page three current line
 
02:06:31.589 --> 02:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
numbers that's what we are talking about
 
02:06:33.870 --> 02:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
that not just the words not withstanding
 
02:06:36.030 --> 02:06:36.040 align:start position:0%
the above the whole phrase four four
 
02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
lines wor thank you I I just want you to
 
02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
make sure I understood it was needed in
 
02:06:42.350 --> 02:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
one place but it got put more we're
 
02:06:45.790 --> 02:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:48.030 --> 02:06:48.040 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr
 
02:06:51.750 --> 02:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
chair representa hle thank you um so in
 
02:06:54.750 --> 02:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
addition um to the removal that was
 
02:06:56.950 --> 02:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
discussed by the member from conquer
 
02:06:58.589 --> 02:06:58.599 align:start position:0%
there's a small tweak that we should
 
02:07:00.589 --> 02:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
make in whatever this proposed amendment
 
02:07:04.390 --> 02:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
is which is relative to the repeal date
 
02:07:07.790 --> 02:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
because the repeal date deletes a small
 
02:07:10.669 --> 02:07:10.679 align:start position:0%
reference in line 29 on page one
 
02:07:12.510 --> 02:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
relative to this phase in schedule well
 
02:07:14.629 --> 02:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
the phasin schedule is repealed but we
 
02:07:17.709 --> 02:07:17.719 align:start position:0%
leave in statute part of 28 and 29 so I
 
02:07:19.750 --> 02:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
would also propose that we clean that up
 
02:07:21.310 --> 02:07:21.320 align:start position:0%
I think this amendment actually does
 
02:07:23.709 --> 02:07:23.719 align:start position:0%
that it's section three on page three
 
02:07:31.030 --> 02:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
line five uh this replaces 169 C10 um
 
02:07:33.910 --> 02:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
after after paragraph 2E is repealed it
 
02:07:36.750 --> 02:07:36.760 align:start position:0%
would read this way that's why the
 
02:07:38.790 --> 02:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
phrase subject to the phase uh phase in
 
02:07:40.709 --> 02:07:40.719 align:start position:0%
schedule establish in sub paragraph 2 C
 
02:07:45.709 --> 02:07:45.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:48.189 --> 02:07:48.199 align:start position:0%
out yeah so this is the version of
 
02:07:50.189 --> 02:07:50.199 align:start position:0%
Statute that would
 
02:07:52.709 --> 02:07:52.719 align:start position:0%
remain after to the repeal of the other
 
02:07:52.719 --> 02:07:57.709 align:start position:0%
remain after to the repeal of the other
paragraph

02:07:57.709 --> 02:07:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:01.030 --> 02:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
occurs I understand that prospective
 
02:08:03.910 --> 02:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
repeal on page three lines right
 
02:08:07.030 --> 02:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
sections five and six my concern is
 
02:08:09.390 --> 02:08:09.400 align:start position:0%
right in What We Leave Behind is Roman
 
02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:12.189 align:start position:0%
right in What We Leave Behind is Roman
numeral

02:08:12.189 --> 02:08:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:16.830 --> 02:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
2B um I believe stays around referencing
 
02:08:19.069 --> 02:08:19.079 align:start position:0%
sub paragraph 2E but sub paragraph 2E
 
02:08:22.109 --> 02:08:22.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't live so on page three okay
 
02:08:25.430 --> 02:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
section three of the bill oh oh that's
 
02:08:27.589 --> 02:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't catch that new section
 
02:08:29.629 --> 02:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the new version that would
 
02:08:32.390 --> 02:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
exist that would no longer reference to
 
02:08:36.030 --> 02:08:36.040 align:start position:0%
e okay got it thank you and that's also
 
02:08:37.510 --> 02:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
that's why the phrase notwithstanding
 
02:08:39.709 --> 02:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
the above ends up appearing multiple
 
02:08:41.629 --> 02:08:41.639 align:start position:0%
times in the amendment thank you
 
02:08:44.870 --> 02:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
understood all right is the situation
 
02:08:48.910 --> 02:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
for amending the amendment
 
02:08:52.470 --> 02:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
clear and um
 
02:08:54.669 --> 02:08:54.679 align:start position:0%
when it goes to press that will be the
 
02:08:57.430 --> 02:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
amendment that goes with it Mr
 
02:09:00.830 --> 02:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
Ripple whatever the number may be how
 
02:09:03.510 --> 02:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
many people find that those Corrections
 
02:09:05.990 --> 02:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
that Mr Ripple will make acceptable in
 
02:09:09.990 --> 02:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:15.390 --> 02:09:15.400 align:start position:0%

okay as printed further discussion on
 
02:10:39.589 --> 02:10:39.599 align:start position:0%
the on Senate Bill 463 representative
 
02:10:42.390 --> 02:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you Mr chairman I'm going
 
02:10:45.390 --> 02:10:45.400 align:start position:0%
to refrain on making any comments about
 
02:10:47.390 --> 02:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
legislating in the finance
 
02:10:51.669 --> 02:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
committee but but I'd like to ask I I'm
 
02:10:53.390 --> 02:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
not sure I understand what the bill does
 
02:10:56.310 --> 02:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
so is this a bill that for children that
 
02:10:59.549 --> 02:10:59.559 align:start position:0%
already have Guardians at Lim they will
 
02:11:03.589 --> 02:11:03.599 align:start position:0%
also get an attorney maybe in some cases
 
02:11:06.069 --> 02:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
and if so how many attorneys are we
 
02:11:08.950 --> 02:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
talking about and and what's the the
 
02:11:11.430 --> 02:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
cost of those attorneys and is it all
 
02:11:13.589 --> 02:11:13.599 align:start position:0%
general fund money or is it from other
 
02:11:15.750 --> 02:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
sources thank
 
02:11:19.069 --> 02:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
you who would like to
 
02:11:21.350 --> 02:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
answer representative H do you have any
 
02:11:23.229 --> 02:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
answer I I will I will take a shot at
 
02:11:26.270 --> 02:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
that um it's a policy change um that I
 
02:11:27.790 --> 02:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
have argued for in children and family
 
02:11:30.990 --> 02:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
law before in a different Bill currently
 
02:11:34.830 --> 02:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
children have a Casta assigned or and or
 
02:11:37.950 --> 02:11:37.960 align:start position:0%
a g assigned but in both of those cases
 
02:11:40.109 --> 02:11:40.119 align:start position:0%
they are not representing the expressed
 
02:11:41.549 --> 02:11:41.559 align:start position:0%
interests of the
 
02:11:45.310 --> 02:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
child and we experienc personally
 
02:11:47.310 --> 02:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
through um various things that happened
 
02:11:50.790 --> 02:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago that a 13-year-old
 
02:11:52.149 --> 02:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
might be
 
02:11:53.910 --> 02:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
the subject of a court proceeding and
 
02:11:55.750 --> 02:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
never have their own wishes showed up in
 
02:11:57.430 --> 02:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
show up in the courtroom and there's no
 
02:12:00.069 --> 02:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
way for them to to make that happen and
 
02:12:03.350 --> 02:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
in this case allowing the party that has
 
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
the most skin in the game to have an
 
02:12:06.669 --> 02:12:06.679 align:start position:0%
attorney representing their expressed
 
02:12:08.350 --> 02:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
interest is valuable
 
02:12:12.270 --> 02:12:12.280 align:start position:0%
policy um uh there are concerns about
 
02:12:13.830 --> 02:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
how to do the training and the costs and
 
02:12:15.270 --> 02:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
the ramp in and all of that's been
 
02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
discussed and I I I do think the the
 
02:12:18.910 --> 02:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
member from conquer figured out at least
 
02:12:21.390 --> 02:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
some solution to start to do this for a
 
02:12:23.310 --> 02:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
small group of children who are
 
02:12:25.549 --> 02:12:25.559 align:start position:0%
currently in in out of home
 
02:12:28.109 --> 02:12:28.119 align:start position:0%
placements I do think long term this
 
02:12:30.790 --> 02:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
needs to be expanded to all children
 
02:12:33.510 --> 02:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
that are being removed from their home
 
02:12:35.470 --> 02:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
the the kid who's going to be removed
 
02:12:37.629 --> 02:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
should have some say in where he ends up
 
02:12:40.069 --> 02:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
and currently they're not capable of
 
02:12:41.669 --> 02:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
even getting into the courtroom let
 
02:12:43.629 --> 02:12:43.639 align:start position:0%
alone having their expressed
 
02:12:46.430 --> 02:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
wishes and I think that is an incredibly
 
02:12:48.669 --> 02:12:48.679 align:start position:0%
valuable policy change that we are doing
 
02:12:51.629 --> 02:12:51.639 align:start position:0%
for our children so while not perfect
 
02:12:53.109 --> 02:12:53.119 align:start position:0%
and it's it's a little bit of a last
 
02:12:56.109 --> 02:12:56.119 align:start position:0%
minute hurdle um and I don't necessarily
 
02:12:57.830 --> 02:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
agree with all of the underlying
 
02:13:00.189 --> 02:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
assumptions that are in part one of the
 
02:13:02.669 --> 02:13:02.679 align:start position:0%
bill I do believe that this is the right
 
02:13:04.910 --> 02:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
step forward as a small incremental
 
02:13:09.069 --> 02:13:09.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:12.149 --> 02:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
question I didn't hear any dollar amount
 
02:13:15.589 --> 02:13:15.599 align:start position:0%
in that there was no dollar amount and I
 
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
do think that we're going to have to
 
02:13:19.189 --> 02:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
figure out the additional costs relative
 
02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
to the to the assignment of the
 
02:13:23.470 --> 02:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
attorneys um but children are
 
02:13:25.109 --> 02:13:25.119 align:start position:0%
effectively not capable of paying
 
02:13:27.390 --> 02:13:27.400 align:start position:0%
financially and in all those cases in
 
02:13:29.270 --> 02:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
the court process we routinely assign
 
02:13:31.350 --> 02:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
attorneys to represent those who can't
 
02:13:34.629 --> 02:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
pay themselves the the testimony we
 
02:13:37.350 --> 02:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
heard from people involved in this area
 
02:13:40.589 --> 02:13:40.599 align:start position:0%
there was also an the original bill 14
 
02:13:42.629 --> 02:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
additional child protective service
 
02:13:45.229 --> 02:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
workers which have been eliminated that
 
02:13:47.069 --> 02:13:47.079 align:start position:0%
people that spoke about it said what do
 
02:13:49.390 --> 02:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
you need all those people for so we took
 
02:13:51.350 --> 02:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
them out and it was the biggest saving
 
02:13:55.030 --> 02:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
14 positions representative Edwards uh
 
02:13:57.270 --> 02:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you I I think what representative
 
02:14:00.030 --> 02:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
McGuire's wanting is kind of a financial
 
02:14:01.669 --> 02:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
accounting answer and I'm going to I'm
 
02:14:03.069 --> 02:14:03.079 align:start position:0%
going to give you a managerial
 
02:14:06.470 --> 02:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
accounting answer instead um in the
 
02:14:10.149 --> 02:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
population of about 1,200 uh affected
 
02:14:13.830 --> 02:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
youth um the number affected by this
 
02:14:16.069 --> 02:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
bill is about
 
02:14:20.709 --> 02:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
120 and of that 120 the estimated cost
 
02:14:20.719 --> 02:14:21.629 align:start position:0%
120 and of that 120 the estimated cost
per

02:14:21.629 --> 02:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
per
 
02:14:25.310 --> 02:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh a placement is about
 
02:14:30.390 --> 02:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
$300,000 so the so an idea is if out of
 
02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:31.189 align:start position:0%
$300,000 so the so an idea is if out of
that

02:14:31.189 --> 02:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:14:35.430 --> 02:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
120 if even just three of them get
 
02:14:39.589 --> 02:14:39.599 align:start position:0%
directed in a less expensive way that's
 
02:14:41.910 --> 02:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
also probably more appropriate to the
 
02:14:44.950 --> 02:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
child then then that would generate
 
02:14:46.750 --> 02:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
internally some
 
02:14:51.990 --> 02:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
savings that that is a theory uh that I
 
02:14:55.549 --> 02:14:55.559 align:start position:0%
will figure out if it works that
 
02:14:58.069 --> 02:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
way answer your
 
02:15:02.189 --> 02:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:04.549 --> 02:15:04.559 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none the clerk will
 
02:15:06.910 --> 02:15:06.920 align:start position:0%

02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
possibility of Representative hle

submitting a study committee
 
02:16:48.589 --> 02:16:48.599 align:start position:0%
amendment I have an amendment for

representative po yes so I have three
 
02:16:52.389 --> 02:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
amendments to this bill the one that was
 
02:16:56.349 --> 02:16:56.359 align:start position:0%
originally adopted in division 3 uh last
 
02:16:59.790 --> 02:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
week or earlier this week 1650 yes I
 
02:17:01.150 --> 02:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
have an amendment from representative
 
02:17:03.190 --> 02:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
tersi and I have an amendment from
 
02:17:06.070 --> 02:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative po I I Mr Sher I'd
 
02:17:09.549 --> 02:17:09.559 align:start position:0%
recommend you just pass out all three of
 
02:17:13.110 --> 02:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
them do they all meld together nicely no
 
02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:14.150 align:start position:0%
them do they all meld together nicely no
there's

02:17:14.150 --> 02:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:17:16.790 --> 02:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
um this this is fun there it's going to
 
02:17:19.190 --> 02:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
be a little conflict
 
02:17:21.669 --> 02:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
here all right
 
02:17:25.270 --> 02:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
what's the first discussion I I would
 
02:17:28.110 --> 02:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
say that the first discussion ought to
 
02:17:31.669 --> 02:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
be uh around Amendment
 
02:17:35.709 --> 02:17:35.719 align:start position:0%
1650 I think repres uh um Amendment
 
02:17:39.750 --> 02:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
1650 is is adopted into each of the
 
02:17:43.190 --> 02:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
other amendments 16 the other amendments
 
02:17:46.270 --> 02:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
do more than what 1650 does but none of
 
02:17:48.990 --> 02:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
them disagree with 1650 oh I can't even
 
02:17:53.110 --> 02:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
find um 16 1950 was was the part where
 
02:17:55.150 --> 02:17:55.160 align:start position:0%
we said we would take the
 
02:17:59.629 --> 02:17:59.639 align:start position:0%
senior um enrollment component of
 
02:18:03.830 --> 02:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
499 uh and and pass it there there has
 
02:18:06.549 --> 02:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
been really no issue by anyone saying no
 
02:18:09.870 --> 02:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't do that so I I think
 
02:18:14.309 --> 02:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
1650 is probably an an an easy yes the
 
02:18:18.910 --> 02:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
the harder conversation is to
 
02:18:22.230 --> 02:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
um try to come to an agreement within
 
02:18:24.389 --> 02:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
the finance committee on the tersi
 
02:18:26.349 --> 02:18:26.359 align:start position:0%
amendment which deals with the summer
 
02:18:29.709 --> 02:18:29.719 align:start position:0%
EBT program and the whole amendment that
 
02:18:32.790 --> 02:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
I would summarize if I heard it right to
 
02:18:35.589 --> 02:18:35.599 align:start position:0%
be let's not take on the summer EBT
 
02:18:38.110 --> 02:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
program let's put it into a study
 
02:18:40.429 --> 02:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
committee so I I don't know how you want
 
02:18:42.709 --> 02:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
to do with that but I I I'd recommend we
 
02:18:45.230 --> 02:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
discuss 1650
 
02:18:47.830 --> 02:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
first and and just accept it as an
 
02:18:50.190 --> 02:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
amendment you are recognized to discuss
 
02:18:53.070 --> 02:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
it okay okay I I need to find it so
 
02:18:55.990 --> 02:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
everyone probably should look for
 
02:18:58.950 --> 02:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
1650 I don't find
 
02:19:01.589 --> 02:19:01.599 align:start position:0%
it is that that's one of the ones Mr
 
02:19:16.190 --> 02:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:18.549 --> 02:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
out you moving
 
02:19:21.990 --> 02:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
this right now I'm I'm I'm I I I I would
 
02:19:25.429 --> 02:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:28.669 --> 02:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
1650 but there's some other amendments
 
02:19:30.910 --> 02:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
and motions
 
02:19:39.349 --> 02:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:42.950 --> 02:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
juggler yeah I kept talking until you
 
02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:45.230 align:start position:0%
juggler yeah I kept talking until you
were

02:19:45.230 --> 02:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:54.630 --> 02:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:54.640 --> 02:20:11.309 align:start position:0%
 
thank

02:20:11.309 --> 02:20:11.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:14.190 --> 02:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
you I'm I'm going to keep talking about
 
02:20:16.510 --> 02:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
1650 for some
 
02:20:16.520 --> 02:20:18.590 align:start position:0%
1650 for some
context

02:20:18.590 --> 02:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
context
 
02:20:22.870 --> 02:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
1650 uh to those who want more than 1650
 
02:20:25.950 --> 02:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
I I think their argument really is
 
02:20:29.389 --> 02:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
mostly uh 1650 is necessary but not
 
02:20:33.230 --> 02:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
sufficient it's not enough of$ 499 to to
 
02:20:35.590 --> 02:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
to be the bill that they want but I
 
02:20:37.230 --> 02:20:37.240 align:start position:0%
don't think that there's really any
 
02:20:40.790 --> 02:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
argument about 1650 this is I think us
 
02:20:43.910 --> 02:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
all saying that we want to make the
 
02:20:45.590 --> 02:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
senior uh
 
02:20:49.550 --> 02:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
enrollment eligibility portion of of of$
 
02:20:52.870 --> 02:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
499 we want want to make that law the
 
02:20:56.510 --> 02:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is that currently uh
 
02:20:58.230 --> 02:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
there's a good deal of paperwork where
 
02:21:01.910 --> 02:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
seniors have to uh enroll annually uh to
 
02:21:04.630 --> 02:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
to gain access to uh programs and
 
02:21:07.950 --> 02:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
benefits that they're entitled to and
 
02:21:11.429 --> 02:21:11.439 align:start position:0%
what um what this bill will allow for
 
02:21:14.469 --> 02:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
relatively small investment of
 
02:21:17.270 --> 02:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
37,500 which would change up the
 
02:21:21.150 --> 02:21:21.160 align:start position:0%
enrollment processes so that um they
 
02:21:24.070 --> 02:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
would only need to uh enroll once every
 
02:21:26.710 --> 02:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
three years and so that would obviously
 
02:21:30.389 --> 02:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
save our seniors uh time dealing with
 
02:21:32.910 --> 02:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
paperwork and fighting eligibility
 
02:21:35.110 --> 02:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
systems it would just make it their
 
02:21:37.469 --> 02:21:37.479 align:start position:0%
their quality of life better but it'll
 
02:21:40.910 --> 02:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
also have an A A Manpower impact because
 
02:21:43.710 --> 02:21:43.720 align:start position:0%
processing fewer applications takes
 
02:21:47.870 --> 02:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
fewer people so so I think 1650 is a
 
02:21:47.880 --> 02:21:49.030 align:start position:0%
fewer people so so I think 1650 is a
financially

02:21:49.030 --> 02:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
financially
 
02:21:51.349 --> 02:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
sound it's
 
02:21:52.670 --> 02:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to say it's a small
 
02:21:54.309 --> 02:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
amount of money I'd say it's an amount
 
02:21:56.309 --> 02:21:56.319 align:start position:0%
of money where I think we're going to re
 
02:21:58.510 --> 02:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
recoup the investment in a few
 
02:22:01.630 --> 02:22:01.640 align:start position:0%
years representative
 
02:22:05.030 --> 02:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
tersi thank you Mr chairman um while I
 
02:22:06.550 --> 02:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
don't disagree with anything that
 
02:22:08.429 --> 02:22:08.439 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards just said about
 
02:22:11.389 --> 02:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
the simplified elderly application I
 
02:22:14.110 --> 02:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
disagree with his suggestion that we can
 
02:22:17.870 --> 02:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
pass this one first and move along and
 
02:22:19.910 --> 02:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
consider other options I think every one
 
02:22:22.150 --> 02:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
of us have received our inboxes have
 
02:22:25.590 --> 02:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
been flooded with emails about this bill
 
02:22:27.910 --> 02:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
and about this amendment right here this
 
02:22:32.150 --> 02:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
amendment right here is um one that is
 
02:22:36.910 --> 02:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
simply not in the um the spirit of the
 
02:22:41.030 --> 02:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
original bill that passed the Senate and
 
02:22:44.710 --> 02:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
passed the house so um while I do
 
02:22:46.590 --> 02:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
support the simplified elderly
 
02:22:51.429 --> 02:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
application it is in my Amendment um
 
02:22:56.830 --> 02:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
I would be very uncomfortable voting
 
02:22:58.070 --> 02:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
just for
 
02:23:02.830 --> 02:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
1650 um because I um have hope that we
 
02:23:07.349 --> 02:23:07.359 align:start position:0%
can discuss further how we can um expand
 
02:23:10.990 --> 02:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
more on Senate Bill 499 so so what I'd
 
02:23:14.070 --> 02:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
be happy to do is withhold moving this
 
02:23:15.990 --> 02:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
amendment at this point and have the
 
02:23:18.349 --> 02:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
debate on the other two amendments and
 
02:23:19.950 --> 02:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
once we have that debate on the other
 
02:23:21.950 --> 02:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
two amends mend ments this may still
 
02:23:24.670 --> 02:23:24.680 align:start position:0%
need to be brought forward uh if either
 
02:23:27.389 --> 02:23:27.399 align:start position:0%
of the other two amendments get passed
 
02:23:29.710 --> 02:23:29.720 align:start position:0%
this amendment becomes overcome by
 
02:23:34.910 --> 02:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
events and and is redundant so so so Mr
 
02:23:37.389 --> 02:23:37.399 align:start position:0%
chair I however you want to proceed on
 
02:23:39.550 --> 02:23:39.560 align:start position:0%
debating the other two amendments I can
 
02:23:43.429 --> 02:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
withhold u a motion on 1650 I understand
 
02:23:46.030 --> 02:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
it's bad politics to tell the public
 
02:23:47.910 --> 02:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
that we know more about the situation
 
02:23:50.030 --> 02:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
than they do but that's kind of where
 
02:23:50.990 --> 02:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
we're at
 
02:23:53.429 --> 02:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
um I think that's the avoidance part of
 
02:23:55.510 --> 02:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
1650 Mr chair well if you if you wish
 
02:23:56.950 --> 02:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
not to bring It Forward then I'll
 
02:23:58.990 --> 02:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
recognize representa
 
02:24:02.670 --> 02:24:02.680 align:start position:0%
tersi Mr chair if I may representative H
 
02:24:05.550 --> 02:24:05.560 align:start position:0%
thank you um I just to bring us back to
 
02:24:07.710 --> 02:24:07.720 align:start position:0%
where the dock it is the bill came over
 
02:24:08.910 --> 02:24:08.920 align:start position:0%
from the
 
02:24:11.910 --> 02:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
Senate the bill was assigned um over to
 
02:24:13.510 --> 02:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
education but it was vacated and
 
02:24:16.190 --> 02:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
referred to finance it has not been on
 
02:24:18.870 --> 02:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
the floor yet in the house um I
 
02:24:22.230 --> 02:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
apologize you were and so there has been
 
02:24:24.309 --> 02:24:24.319 align:start position:0%
no policy decisions on this there is a
 
02:24:25.670 --> 02:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
lot of policy in this this was an
 
02:24:27.349 --> 02:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
Omnibus Bill that came over from the
 
02:24:29.550 --> 02:24:29.560 align:start position:0%
Senate with a number of parts we did our
 
02:24:31.510 --> 02:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
best in in a in a somewhat sprinted
 
02:24:33.750 --> 02:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
fashion to review
 
02:24:36.790 --> 02:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
those um but it because there have been
 
02:24:39.950 --> 02:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
no policy discussions and we're we're
 
02:24:42.269 --> 02:24:42.279 align:start position:0%
wandering into that policy Arena here at
 
02:24:44.349 --> 02:24:44.359 align:start position:0%
this point because of the time the the
 
02:24:46.429 --> 02:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
calendar time I do think it's
 
02:24:48.070 --> 02:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate because it hasn't seen a
 
02:24:49.790 --> 02:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
policy committee that we work on this
 
02:24:51.790 --> 02:24:51.800 align:start position:0%
but I do think we have to be a little
 
02:24:54.269 --> 02:24:54.279 align:start position:0%
bit cautious about driving policy at the
 
02:24:54.279 --> 02:24:55.110 align:start position:0%
bit cautious about driving policy at the
last

02:24:55.110 --> 02:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
last
 
02:24:57.429 --> 02:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
minute recognize represent thank you I
 
02:24:58.630 --> 02:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
would like to except my apologies you
 
02:25:00.670 --> 02:25:00.680 align:start position:0%
are correct I um with the number of
 
02:25:03.830 --> 02:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
bills division 3 had I mashed up this
 
02:25:07.349 --> 02:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
one that came to us directly so um but
 
02:25:09.990 --> 02:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
if I may um if we are going to talk
 
02:25:13.710 --> 02:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
about um the policy may I discuss my
 
02:25:16.230 --> 02:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment Mr chairman you are recognized
 
02:25:18.710 --> 02:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you um before you is amendment
 
02:25:23.190 --> 02:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:27.630 --> 02:25:27.640 align:start position:0%
um first I want to talk about SB 499
 
02:25:29.110 --> 02:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
which brought us to this point which was
 
02:25:32.429 --> 02:25:32.439 align:start position:0%
a much larger much more comprehensive
 
02:25:35.190 --> 02:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
Omnibus Bill that came from the Senate
 
02:25:37.830 --> 02:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
um an anti-hunger Bill if you will when
 
02:25:41.030 --> 02:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
we had the public hearing we heard about
 
02:25:43.590 --> 02:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
five I think it was five different
 
02:25:47.190 --> 02:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
sections of that bill that addressed a
 
02:25:52.510 --> 02:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
many different um areas of um um hunger
 
02:25:56.309 --> 02:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
and they included things like um the
 
02:25:57.950 --> 02:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
simplified elderly application which we
 
02:26:01.070 --> 02:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
just heard the summer EBT program then
 
02:26:03.990 --> 02:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
there was also three different sections
 
02:26:07.510 --> 02:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
that related specifically to education
 
02:26:12.389 --> 02:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
division 2 and um were tied into reduced
 
02:26:14.830 --> 02:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
and free lunch
 
02:26:17.990 --> 02:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
programming I won't go necessarily into
 
02:26:20.030 --> 02:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
what happened with that larger bill
 
02:26:21.429 --> 02:26:21.439 align:start position:0%
because because we had some joint work
 
02:26:23.590 --> 02:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
sessions we were told it would be
 
02:26:28.110 --> 02:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
divided up um and then found out that
 
02:26:30.309 --> 02:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
division two would not be digging into
 
02:26:33.469 --> 02:26:33.479 align:start position:0%
this bill so with that I will agree um
 
02:26:33.479 --> 02:26:35.030 align:start position:0%
this bill so with that I will agree um
that

02:26:35.030 --> 02:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:26:37.750 --> 02:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
policy my Amendment does not address the
 
02:26:42.070 --> 02:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
education part of policy I my Amendment
 
02:26:44.590 --> 02:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
only addresses the sections that relate
 
02:26:44.600 --> 02:26:45.469 align:start position:0%
only addresses the sections that relate
to

02:26:45.469 --> 02:26:45.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:26:48.349 --> 02:26:48.359 align:start position:0%
DHHS so I'll start there that I am
 
02:26:51.389 --> 02:26:51.399 align:start position:0%
already approaching Senate bill $499 by
 
02:26:53.910 --> 02:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
removing the three sections that had to
 
02:26:58.110 --> 02:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
do with um the Department of Education
 
02:27:00.670 --> 02:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
what you have before you is um an
 
02:27:03.110 --> 02:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
amendment that is a little unusual in
 
02:27:06.630 --> 02:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
the way it was drafted because um we
 
02:27:09.230 --> 02:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
heard some feedback that perhaps members
 
02:27:12.030 --> 02:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to see a breakout in costs
 
02:27:15.790 --> 02:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
whereas the original Bill had one price
 
02:27:19.150 --> 02:27:19.160 align:start position:0%
tag on it so I'll just jump ahead um if
 
02:27:21.269 --> 02:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
you look at line 50 that's your elderly
 
02:27:24.030 --> 02:27:24.040 align:start position:0%
simplified application that is exactly
 
02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
what representative Edwards just
 
02:27:27.830 --> 02:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
presented to you about um making it
 
02:27:29.990 --> 02:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
easier for elderly and disabled persons
 
02:27:33.389 --> 02:27:33.399 align:start position:0%
to um only have to apply um every few
 
02:27:37.429 --> 02:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
years that's fine the other part is the
 
02:27:40.190 --> 02:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
directing the department to implement
 
02:27:43.469 --> 02:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
the sumary EBT program now for those of
 
02:27:46.510 --> 02:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
you who may not know what that's about
 
02:27:49.670 --> 02:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
um for many children who receive free
 
02:27:52.030 --> 02:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch during the school year
 
02:27:54.830 --> 02:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
um they receive two meals a day through
 
02:27:57.429 --> 02:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
their neighborhood school um when it
 
02:27:59.830 --> 02:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
comes to Summer Time many of these
 
02:28:03.630 --> 02:28:03.640 align:start position:0%
children you know are back at home and
 
02:28:05.950 --> 02:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
families are faced with having to
 
02:28:09.070 --> 02:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
provide those two meals for the kids on
 
02:28:10.990 --> 02:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
those 5 days a week that they would have
 
02:28:14.150 --> 02:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
been in school and received um now that
 
02:28:18.870 --> 02:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
is um hitting their uh grocery budget
 
02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
this program is very similar to um the
 
02:28:24.870 --> 02:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
standard DBT program we probably all
 
02:28:27.309 --> 02:28:27.319 align:start position:0%
know about which is like a debit card
 
02:28:30.030 --> 02:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
that you can use on F food only um at
 
02:28:32.670 --> 02:28:32.680 align:start position:0%
grocery stores that type of thing but
 
02:28:37.030 --> 02:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
what this does is provide $40 a
 
02:28:39.670 --> 02:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
month to each child who would qualify
 
02:28:41.349 --> 02:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
for free and reduced
 
02:28:44.870 --> 02:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
lunch for the three summer months so
 
02:28:47.389 --> 02:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
what this really is is
 
02:28:51.590 --> 02:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
$120 per child to help help and assist
 
02:28:54.910 --> 02:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
with a family's um grocery budget
 
02:28:56.710 --> 02:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
because those meals that the child would
 
02:28:59.590 --> 02:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
have eaten at school are no longer
 
02:29:02.030 --> 02:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
covered um I just want to look quickly
 
02:29:05.630 --> 02:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
at a few um data points that we got um
 
02:29:09.550 --> 02:29:09.560 align:start position:0%
estimates are showing that
 
02:29:12.830 --> 02:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
37,325 children in our state would
 
02:29:15.030 --> 02:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
qualify for this program that's a lot of
 
02:29:17.630 --> 02:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
kids who get their meals at school
 
02:29:19.349 --> 02:29:19.359 align:start position:0%
during the school year so in the
 
02:29:19.359 --> 02:29:21.070 align:start position:0%
during the school year so in the
summertime

02:29:21.070 --> 02:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
summertime
 
02:29:24.309 --> 02:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
their home and it's quite possible that
 
02:29:26.590 --> 02:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
hard choices had to be made and those
 
02:29:30.030 --> 02:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
kitchens don't have um the peanut butter
 
02:29:32.389 --> 02:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
and jelly and the bread that you know
 
02:29:34.429 --> 02:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
would have been there
 
02:29:38.710 --> 02:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise the program um is broken down
 
02:29:40.870 --> 02:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
in the amendment the Appropriations
 
02:29:43.670 --> 02:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
excuse me are broken down as I stated
 
02:29:45.590 --> 02:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
there was some interest in seeing where
 
02:29:48.389 --> 02:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
the different um line items would go so
 
02:29:51.230 --> 02:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
you can see that but um the state would
 
02:29:53.910 --> 02:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
bear 50% of the administrative cost for
 
02:29:56.910 --> 02:29:56.920 align:start position:0%
this program and the benefits for it are
 
02:30:00.269 --> 02:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
100% uh federal funds so we are looking
 
02:30:04.150 --> 02:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
at $4.5 million of federal funds that
 
02:30:06.309 --> 02:30:06.319 align:start position:0%
will come in and be distributed to the
 
02:30:10.269 --> 02:30:10.279 align:start position:0%
families in this way um and that money
 
02:30:12.110 --> 02:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
will be spent locally here in New
 
02:30:14.150 --> 02:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at our corner corner stores
 
02:30:17.190 --> 02:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
and our supermarkets um and reinvested
 
02:30:18.830 --> 02:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
back into the
 
02:30:22.670 --> 02:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:27.030 --> 02:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
um the cost for the program in terms of
 
02:30:30.150 --> 02:30:30.160 align:start position:0%
doing the system updates I know that
 
02:30:33.830 --> 02:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
that looks to be rather significant the
 
02:30:37.150 --> 02:30:37.160 align:start position:0%
issue is this without building out the
 
02:30:39.389 --> 02:30:39.399 align:start position:0%
technology we're always going to be
 
02:30:41.349 --> 02:30:41.359 align:start position:0%
behind the eightball and not being able
 
02:30:44.630 --> 02:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
to participate in some kind of program
 
02:30:48.469 --> 02:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
um there has been some concerns raised
 
02:30:50.910 --> 02:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
that um if you look at if look at my
 
02:30:53.389 --> 02:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
Amendment it takes effect July 1
 
02:30:55.830 --> 02:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
obviously July 1 you have kids that
 
02:30:57.990 --> 02:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
would qualify in July we don't have the
 
02:31:01.630 --> 02:31:01.640 align:start position:0%
system up and running so for the 2024
 
02:31:04.150 --> 02:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
summer and this seems to be a bone of
 
02:31:07.190 --> 02:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
contention this the DHS would ramp up
 
02:31:08.830 --> 02:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
and build the program over the summer
 
02:31:11.230 --> 02:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
and then the families would receive the
 
02:31:16.590 --> 02:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
funds of the hund and $20 per child by
 
02:31:18.790 --> 02:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
the time the program got built up I'm
 
02:31:22.030 --> 02:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
sorry just a 80 because it's July and
 
02:31:22.040 --> 02:31:23.550 align:start position:0%
sorry just a 80 because it's July and
August

02:31:23.550 --> 02:31:23.560 align:start position:0%
August
 
02:31:28.429 --> 02:31:28.439 align:start position:0%
oh I sure um by the time the systems got
 
02:31:31.230 --> 02:31:31.240 align:start position:0%
built out it would be the fall and so
 
02:31:34.990 --> 02:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
they would get that uh benefit in the
 
02:31:39.070 --> 02:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
fall they estimated maybe October so yes
 
02:31:41.150 --> 02:31:41.160 align:start position:0%
I understand that it's not actually a
 
02:31:43.670 --> 02:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
summer program at that point however it
 
02:31:46.870 --> 02:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
is a supplement for these families that
 
02:31:49.590 --> 02:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have the money in the
 
02:31:51.990 --> 02:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
growth fre budget to help feed these
 
02:31:56.349 --> 02:31:56.359 align:start position:0%
kids um now building out the system this
 
02:31:58.309 --> 02:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
summer will allow us to participate
 
02:32:00.110 --> 02:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
fully for
 
02:32:04.510 --> 02:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
2025 um if we push it off any further
 
02:32:06.590 --> 02:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
again you have the ramp up you know you
 
02:32:08.990 --> 02:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
need to be ready to implement the
 
02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:10.750 align:start position:0%
need to be ready to implement the
program

02:32:10.750 --> 02:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:32:13.510 --> 02:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
um I've probably gone on a little too
 
02:32:17.110 --> 02:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
long I just want you to realize that
 
02:32:19.950 --> 02:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
this program as drafted in my Amendment
 
02:32:21.830 --> 02:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
is significantly less than what the
 
02:32:24.550 --> 02:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
original bill was this is really just
 
02:32:28.710 --> 02:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
two parts um that DHHS is
 
02:32:33.630 --> 02:32:33.640 align:start position:0%
um willing to implement it has the way
 
02:32:35.190 --> 02:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
that my amendment was drafted actually
 
02:32:36.550 --> 02:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
brought the total cost down from the
 
02:32:38.830 --> 02:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
original fiscal note uh by a little bit
 
02:32:41.630 --> 02:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate that I hope that you can
 
02:32:44.790 --> 02:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
consider this we have kids in this state
 
02:32:47.190 --> 02:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
that are hungry
 
02:32:50.389 --> 02:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
um there are I know that people will say
 
02:32:53.389 --> 02:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
that there's other programs there are
 
02:32:55.590 --> 02:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
but we need to make sure that none of
 
02:32:57.790 --> 02:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
these kids slip through the cracks these
 
02:33:00.070 --> 02:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
are these are kids who through no choice
 
02:33:04.030 --> 02:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
of their own um are in a household that
 
02:33:07.910 --> 02:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps can't afford to get food um in
 
02:33:09.630 --> 02:33:09.640 align:start position:0%
their kitchens during the summer months
 
02:33:12.349 --> 02:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
and I please ask that you consider my
 
02:33:14.429 --> 02:33:14.439 align:start position:0%
Amendment thank you for giving me so
 
02:33:16.510 --> 02:33:16.520 align:start position:0%
much time I appreciate
 
02:33:20.110 --> 02:33:20.120 align:start position:0%
it may I comment there Edward uh uh
 
02:33:23.309 --> 02:33:23.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um the the department
 
02:33:25.630 --> 02:33:25.640 align:start position:0%
had contacted me after the division vote
 
02:33:27.230 --> 02:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
saying that this was a really high
 
02:33:29.870 --> 02:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
priority for them they uh they
 
02:33:32.870 --> 02:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
entertained me for an hour uh on two
 
02:33:34.830 --> 02:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
separate days to go over
 
02:33:37.389 --> 02:33:37.399 align:start position:0%
details the one of the biggest details
 
02:33:40.990 --> 02:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
we went into was exactly what the money
 
02:33:43.510 --> 02:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
would buy and what we found in general
 
02:33:46.590 --> 02:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
was that the the money spent would help
 
02:33:51.190 --> 02:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
some in 2024 and really pay off in 20 25
 
02:33:52.910 --> 02:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
and that there were a lot of different
 
02:33:55.349 --> 02:33:55.359 align:start position:0%
things that needed to be invested in and
 
02:33:57.550 --> 02:33:57.560 align:start position:0%
so when we had initially just taken a
 
02:34:02.230 --> 02:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
look at a a single total dollar amount
 
02:34:05.269 --> 02:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh it it just it struck me that there
 
02:34:07.510 --> 02:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
was uncertainty about what that money
 
02:34:09.990 --> 02:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
was really going to pay for and so
 
02:34:12.349 --> 02:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
that's why you see sort of an unusual
 
02:34:14.950 --> 02:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
breakout in the appropriation because
 
02:34:17.510 --> 02:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative tersi was open to that
 
02:34:20.269 --> 02:34:20.279 align:start position:0%
and in her Amendment and and I I think
 
02:34:23.309 --> 02:34:23.319 align:start position:0%
that was for visibility and transparency
 
02:34:26.070 --> 02:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
and intended to breed some confidence in
 
02:34:29.309 --> 02:34:29.319 align:start position:0%
the in the in the uh committee should
 
02:34:32.389 --> 02:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
they want to pass this that this was a
 
02:34:35.750 --> 02:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
legit serious uh budgeting effort to to
 
02:34:39.230 --> 02:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
forecast the costs so I'm I'm not I'm
 
02:34:41.870 --> 02:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
not advocating for or against the tersi
 
02:34:44.550 --> 02:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
amendment I just did want to explain
 
02:34:46.830 --> 02:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
that there was a lot of extra work
 
02:34:49.349 --> 02:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
outside of the committee and and that
 
02:34:51.910 --> 02:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
this Amendment reflects the the the
 
02:34:53.830 --> 02:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
input of the department representative
 
02:34:56.469 --> 02:34:56.479 align:start position:0%
tersi and I think a lot of people trying
 
02:34:58.469 --> 02:34:58.479 align:start position:0%
to figure out what the money would be
 
02:35:01.670 --> 02:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
going for so thank thank
 
02:35:04.750 --> 02:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
you representative hle thank you Mr
 
02:35:07.670 --> 02:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you representative Tori
 
02:35:09.150 --> 02:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
for bringing this forward it does in
 
02:35:11.830 --> 02:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
fact reduce the costs a little bit um
 
02:35:14.750 --> 02:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
not withstanding my concern about the
 
02:35:16.670 --> 02:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
fact that our federal deficit is growing
 
02:35:20.630 --> 02:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
and is now north of $103,000 per person
 
02:35:22.030 --> 02:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
and I can't guarantee that we're going
 
02:35:24.070 --> 02:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
to continue to be able to receive money
 
02:35:26.190 --> 02:35:26.200 align:start position:0%
from the federal government I do think
 
02:35:28.830 --> 02:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
as an engineer um the costs associated
 
02:35:32.349 --> 02:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
with lines 31 through on page one
 
02:35:36.389 --> 02:35:36.399 align:start position:0%
through lines three on page two is
 
02:35:36.399 --> 02:35:38.030 align:start position:0%
through lines three on page two is
excessive

02:35:38.030 --> 02:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
excessive
 
02:35:40.269 --> 02:35:40.279 align:start position:0%
and that is the part of the reason I
 
02:35:44.870 --> 02:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
drafted an amendment 1957 H I would love
 
02:35:47.070 --> 02:35:47.080 align:start position:0%
to see a plan from our from the
 
02:35:49.590 --> 02:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
Department of DHHS that shows how we're
 
02:35:51.110 --> 02:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to roll this out have the
 
02:35:53.870 --> 02:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
rfps in place have some preliminary
 
02:35:57.190 --> 02:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
language necessary to do this such that
 
02:35:59.429 --> 02:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
this could be filed in next legislative
 
02:36:02.469 --> 02:36:02.479 align:start position:0%
season I do understand that that
 
02:36:06.670 --> 02:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
does that does create the potential cost
 
02:36:10.070 --> 02:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
loss of this year's funding for for
 
02:36:12.750 --> 02:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
those that are impacted but I also think
 
02:36:14.990 --> 02:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
having a plan that might in fact reduce
 
02:36:17.910 --> 02:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
that number down significantly maybe
 
02:36:20.830 --> 02:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
north of 4 or 500,000
 
02:36:23.590 --> 02:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
even better leverages what we spend in
 
02:36:25.870 --> 02:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
in the state relative to what we receive
 
02:36:29.309 --> 02:36:29.319 align:start position:0%
from the federal government so um I know
 
02:36:31.630 --> 02:36:31.640 align:start position:0%
there's three amendments here um I do
 
02:36:33.790 --> 02:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
think there is some Appropriations in
 
02:36:37.070 --> 02:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment 1917 H that are excessive
 
02:36:38.990 --> 02:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
and I think it behooves us to look at
 
02:36:42.670 --> 02:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
the third amendment I I agree with you
 
02:36:46.190 --> 02:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
that you know that it seems to me that
 
02:36:47.910 --> 02:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
all these people that are covered by
 
02:36:49.910 --> 02:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
this program are already covered by
 
02:36:52.389 --> 02:36:52.399 align:start position:0%
another program they should be getting
 
02:36:55.030 --> 02:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
food stamps they should be getting snap
 
02:36:56.910 --> 02:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
and so why are we so worried that
 
02:36:59.870 --> 02:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
they're not covered and this is perhaps
 
02:37:02.630 --> 02:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
double spending and redundant spending
 
02:37:04.790 --> 02:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
and and if you have a study maybe that
 
02:37:06.710 --> 02:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
will discover one one way or the other
 
02:37:08.990 --> 02:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
if there's anybody overlooked so I would
 
02:37:10.510 --> 02:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
support your Amendment if you want to
 
02:37:14.070 --> 02:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
bring that forward sure Mr chair I would
 
02:37:18.269 --> 02:37:18.279 align:start position:0%
like to move Amendment um 2024 1957 H
 
02:37:22.429 --> 02:37:22.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:29.550 --> 02:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:29.560 --> 02:37:31.349 align:start position:0%
 
by

02:37:31.349 --> 02:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:37:31.359 --> 02:37:33.590 align:start position:0%
by
second

02:37:33.590 --> 02:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
second
 
02:37:36.670 --> 02:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
second representative Mooney motion
 
02:37:41.309 --> 02:37:41.319 align:start position:0%
before us is to adopt Amendment 1957
 
02:37:44.710 --> 02:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
H further discussion may I speak to the
 
02:37:48.510 --> 02:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
amendment yes thank you so um lines 1
 
02:37:50.710 --> 02:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
through 19 are effectively the same as
 
02:37:53.150 --> 02:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
what was adopted in Prior amendments
 
02:37:55.910 --> 02:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
relative to the elderly section of the
 
02:37:58.269 --> 02:37:58.279 align:start position:0%
snap program so there's no changes there
 
02:38:00.030 --> 02:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
the changes start with line 20 and run
 
02:38:03.030 --> 02:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
through 31 and what this does is to
 
02:38:06.389 --> 02:38:06.399 align:start position:0%
allow for us to facilitate working with
 
02:38:08.710 --> 02:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
the federal government for this EBT
 
02:38:11.750 --> 02:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
program but to start the to getting the
 
02:38:14.030 --> 02:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
department ready to adopt these plans by
 
02:38:16.070 --> 02:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
putting together a project plan putting
 
02:38:17.790 --> 02:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
together the necessary
 
02:38:20.309 --> 02:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
rfps and getting in and the the
 
02:38:22.870 --> 02:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
quotations relative to getting this done
 
02:38:24.910 --> 02:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
but not actually implementing this until
 
02:38:28.790 --> 02:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
a subsequent Bill happens and I think
 
02:38:31.190 --> 02:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
the $50,000 which was a number pulled
 
02:38:33.110 --> 02:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
out of the air a little bit is more than
 
02:38:35.790 --> 02:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
sufficient for them to cover the cost to
 
02:38:37.830 --> 02:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
put together a project plan for of this
 
02:38:39.830 --> 02:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
size so I would ask that you would
 
02:38:39.840 --> 02:38:41.590 align:start position:0%
size so I would ask that you would
support

02:38:41.590 --> 02:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:38:44.230 --> 02:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
it represent
 
02:38:47.030 --> 02:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
stringle uh thank you Mr
 
02:38:50.630 --> 02:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
chair um uh I'd like to challenge the
 
02:38:52.309 --> 02:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
assumptions that come with this
 
02:38:56.950 --> 02:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
amendment that by um reducing uh the
 
02:39:00.950 --> 02:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
appropriation of 667,000 with this bill
 
02:39:02.950 --> 02:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
and replacing it with a
 
02:39:07.429 --> 02:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
$50,000 uh study uh that that uh uh were
 
02:39:11.150 --> 02:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
only losing the October payments um that
 
02:39:13.389 --> 02:39:13.399 align:start position:0%
these uh students would be eligible for
 
02:39:15.429 --> 02:39:15.439 align:start position:0%
these children would be eligible for
 
02:39:18.550 --> 02:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
because um basically by the time this
 
02:39:21.429 --> 02:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
project plan is complet uh completed
 
02:39:25.469 --> 02:39:25.479 align:start position:0%
will be in the next uh next bium uh we
 
02:39:29.550 --> 02:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
file a bill uh in January it comes out
 
02:39:32.469 --> 02:39:32.479 align:start position:0%
uh the uh we have a project plan it's
 
02:39:34.030 --> 02:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to be implemented
 
02:39:36.870 --> 02:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
by the summer of 2025 we're going to be
 
02:39:40.990 --> 02:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
either either uh um uh Distributing
 
02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
these cards in the fall of 2025 late or
 
02:39:47.389 --> 02:39:47.399 align:start position:0%
we'll maybe all the way to the summer of
 
02:39:51.830 --> 02:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
2026 so uh the the question is and if if
 
02:39:54.429 --> 02:39:54.439 align:start position:0%
if you know this is indeed a worth a
 
02:39:56.429 --> 02:39:56.439 align:start position:0%
worthwhile plan and I know understand
 
02:39:58.670 --> 02:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
that uh some have concerns about the
 
02:40:01.870 --> 02:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
necessity because of other uh uh food
 
02:40:03.710 --> 02:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
programs that are available for these
 
02:40:07.030 --> 02:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
people um this does nothing to address
 
02:40:09.389 --> 02:40:09.399 align:start position:0%
address that question uh to have a
 
02:40:12.070 --> 02:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
project plan and a $50,000
 
02:40:14.830 --> 02:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation um uh I think in the
 
02:40:18.190 --> 02:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
process of implementing this uh uh each
 
02:40:20.389 --> 02:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
one of these sections the the the uh
 
02:40:22.630 --> 02:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
department is going to follow their
 
02:40:25.950 --> 02:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
their good purchasing processes uh and
 
02:40:29.349 --> 02:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
um uh and we'll we'll get the value out
 
02:40:31.590 --> 02:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
of the the money that's appropriated to
 
02:40:34.750 --> 02:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
implement this program uh so I would uh
 
02:40:36.950 --> 02:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
strongly uh urge us to turn this
 
02:40:38.910 --> 02:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
amendment down and go back to the tersi
 
02:40:41.150 --> 02:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
amendment which is still a very very
 
02:40:43.750 --> 02:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
scaled down compromised version of what
 
02:40:46.349 --> 02:40:46.359 align:start position:0%
came over from the Senate thank you
 
02:40:50.670 --> 02:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:55.349 --> 02:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative walner thank
 
02:40:58.750 --> 02:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
you I just want to remind the committee
 
02:41:01.710 --> 02:41:01.720 align:start position:0%
that by not moving forward with this at
 
02:41:05.429 --> 02:41:05.439 align:start position:0%
this point what we're doing is denying
 
02:41:08.750 --> 02:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
about $4.5 million do a year for the
 
02:41:12.070 --> 02:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
next year to some of the lowest income
 
02:41:13.830 --> 02:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
families in this
 
02:41:16.349 --> 02:41:16.359 align:start position:0%
state yes the kids are home in the
 
02:41:18.590 --> 02:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
summer and they need to be fed because
 
02:41:20.630 --> 02:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
they don't have SCH school lunch but I
 
02:41:23.990 --> 02:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
can tell you that those kids also need F
 
02:41:27.750 --> 02:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
meals in October November December
 
02:41:30.790 --> 02:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
January they need additional funds these
 
02:41:34.309 --> 02:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
families are living on such limited
 
02:41:38.150 --> 02:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
budgets our food stamps or SNAP program
 
02:41:40.670 --> 02:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
does not provide them with what they
 
02:41:45.269 --> 02:41:45.279 align:start position:0%
need to really nourish their families
 
02:41:48.630 --> 02:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
and I really think that everyone needs
 
02:41:51.070 --> 02:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
to walk out of here today thinking about
 
02:41:54.550 --> 02:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
that we have just denied the lowest
 
02:41:57.190 --> 02:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
income families in this state these
 
02:41:57.200 --> 02:41:59.349 align:start position:0%
income families in this state these
additional

02:41:59.349 --> 02:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
additional
 
02:42:01.349 --> 02:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
benefits further discussion
 
02:42:03.590 --> 02:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative tersi thank you very much
 
02:42:04.830 --> 02:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
I just want
 
02:42:08.230 --> 02:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
to dispel one myth that these are
 
02:42:09.870 --> 02:42:09.880 align:start position:0%
families that are already receiving the
 
02:42:12.349 --> 02:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
benefits if you think about it this way
 
02:42:14.110 --> 02:42:14.120 align:start position:0%
say you have a family that receives the
 
02:42:15.910 --> 02:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
monthly SNAP
 
02:42:18.150 --> 02:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
benefit and their children go to school
 
02:42:19.990 --> 02:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
their child goes to school
 
02:42:22.790 --> 02:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
and they're getting two meals a day at
 
02:42:24.750 --> 02:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
school that the family does not have to
 
02:42:28.190 --> 02:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
pay for because they qualify for that
 
02:42:31.510 --> 02:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
program so their snap monthly benefit
 
02:42:33.790 --> 02:42:33.800 align:start position:0%
pays for all the other meals that they
 
02:42:36.150 --> 02:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
have in that household including the
 
02:42:38.510 --> 02:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
dinner for the child now let's go to
 
02:42:41.790 --> 02:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
Summertime the child is not receiving
 
02:42:43.630 --> 02:42:43.640 align:start position:0%
those meals because they are not in
 
02:42:46.630 --> 02:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
school and that same monthly benefit
 
02:42:49.230 --> 02:42:49.240 align:start position:0%
that the family receives has to now pay
 
02:42:52.030 --> 02:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
for 10 more meals for that child for
 
02:42:53.950 --> 02:42:53.960 align:start position:0%
that breakfast and lunch that that child
 
02:42:55.389 --> 02:42:55.399 align:start position:0%
is no longer
 
02:42:57.910 --> 02:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
receiving so I just wanted to make that
 
02:43:01.030 --> 02:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
clear um
 
02:43:05.510 --> 02:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
I have some thoughts about um
 
02:43:07.030 --> 02:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative H's Amendment how he
 
02:43:08.670 --> 02:43:08.680 align:start position:0%
basically said he made up the number of
 
02:43:13.230 --> 02:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
$50,000 as being enough um I just I
 
02:43:15.670 --> 02:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
don't think it's worth kicking the can
 
02:43:17.469 --> 02:43:17.479 align:start position:0%
down the road kicking the can down the
 
02:43:20.429 --> 02:43:20.439 align:start position:0%
road um we have
 
02:43:23.150 --> 02:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
children right now in this state that
 
02:43:26.710 --> 02:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
can benefit from this yes it is a
 
02:43:29.750 --> 02:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
investment in state funds to get there
 
02:43:32.550 --> 02:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
but once we invest in this program to
 
02:43:36.870 --> 02:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
set it up then we have over 37,000 kids
 
02:43:39.630 --> 02:43:39.640 align:start position:0%
that are going to get meals and I please
 
02:43:42.550 --> 02:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
encourage you to come back to my
 
02:43:45.110 --> 02:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
amendment to see how we can implement it
 
02:43:47.750 --> 02:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible thank you it is my
 
02:43:49.710 --> 02:43:49.720 align:start position:0%
belief that those 10 meals they get a
 
02:43:52.230 --> 02:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
week in school are all Al already paid
 
02:43:55.630 --> 02:43:55.640 align:start position:0%
for under snap and food stamps so
 
02:43:58.230 --> 02:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
they're double dipping if you will so
 
02:44:01.710 --> 02:44:01.720 align:start position:0%
that's what I've always believed further
 
02:44:04.309 --> 02:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Heath thank
 
02:44:06.110 --> 02:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
02:44:09.309 --> 02:44:09.319 align:start position:0%
chair we've just come through a pandemic
 
02:44:11.870 --> 02:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
people rents are out of
 
02:44:11.880 --> 02:44:13.550 align:start position:0%
people rents are out of
control

02:44:13.550 --> 02:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
control
 
02:44:17.870 --> 02:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
um we we know that our senior citizens
 
02:44:23.389 --> 02:44:23.399 align:start position:0%
are a population that are in
 
02:44:27.190 --> 02:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
need I I this bill came out of the
 
02:44:30.630 --> 02:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
Senate with I believe a 25 to zero
 
02:44:33.950 --> 02:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
vote I have to say if I we walk out of
 
02:44:36.710 --> 02:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
here today without passing at least the
 
02:44:41.510 --> 02:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
tersi me uh amendment I will be
 
02:44:45.389 --> 02:44:45.399 align:start position:0%
ashamed we are better than this we need
 
02:44:49.150 --> 02:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
to do something this is a tough time for
 
02:44:51.630 --> 02:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
a lot me New Hampshire is a wealthy
 
02:44:54.710 --> 02:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
State luckily our revenues are still
 
02:44:57.950 --> 02:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
coming in at a pretty good Pace not as
 
02:45:00.309 --> 02:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
good as they were but we have some
 
02:45:03.309 --> 02:45:03.319 align:start position:0%
obligations to our poorest children
 
02:45:06.429 --> 02:45:06.439 align:start position:0%
families and adults we need to do
 
02:45:09.150 --> 02:45:09.160 align:start position:0%
something I just think we we need to go
 
02:45:11.630 --> 02:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
with at least the turoski amendment we
 
02:45:13.590 --> 02:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
can't put this off anymore it's not
 
02:45:15.950 --> 02:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
right it's not fair thank
 
02:45:21.030 --> 02:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:25.230 --> 02:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:28.469 --> 02:45:28.479 align:start position:0%
chair so I look at this at a much a
 
02:45:28.479 --> 02:45:29.550 align:start position:0%
chair so I look at this at a much a
broader

02:45:29.550 --> 02:45:29.560 align:start position:0%
broader
 
02:45:32.750 --> 02:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
perspective this is yet another welfare
 
02:45:35.429 --> 02:45:35.439 align:start position:0%
program and it goes
 
02:45:38.389 --> 02:45:38.399 align:start position:0%
back to the 60s in the Great Society
 
02:45:41.389 --> 02:45:41.399 align:start position:0%
program that President Johnson
 
02:45:44.110 --> 02:45:44.120 align:start position:0%
passed and that program was passed with
 
02:45:46.750 --> 02:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
the strong support of the late former
 
02:45:49.469 --> 02:45:49.479 align:start position:0%
Senator Daniel Patrick Monahan who was a
 
02:45:51.710 --> 02:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
stalwart of the Democrat Party and a big
 
02:45:54.830 --> 02:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
supporter of the great the Great Society
 
02:45:57.070 --> 02:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
program when it was
 
02:45:59.670 --> 02:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
passed decades later and he was a
 
02:46:01.990 --> 02:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
researcher um when he did
 
02:46:04.269 --> 02:46:04.279 align:start position:0%
research what he found was these welfare
 
02:46:08.510 --> 02:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
programs are not working they only serve
 
02:46:12.469 --> 02:46:12.479 align:start position:0%
to keep people in poverty they have not
 
02:46:15.110 --> 02:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
helped to bring them out of poverty and
 
02:46:17.750 --> 02:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
here we have another Federal program in
 
02:46:19.429 --> 02:46:19.439 align:start position:0%
the case of New Hampshire 5 million doll
 
02:46:22.630 --> 02:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
for summer food on top of all the other
 
02:46:24.190 --> 02:46:24.200 align:start position:0%
welfare programs that we have for food
 
02:46:26.469 --> 02:46:26.479 align:start position:0%
and other aspects of
 
02:46:26.479 --> 02:46:28.269 align:start position:0%
and other aspects of
life

02:46:28.269 --> 02:46:28.279 align:start position:0%
life
 
02:46:31.190 --> 02:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
and as we've heard others say the
 
02:46:33.870 --> 02:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
federal government's broke so the fact
 
02:46:36.950 --> 02:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
that we're taking more money from them
 
02:46:39.510 --> 02:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
to continue to impoverish people just
 
02:46:41.590 --> 02:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
does not make sense I oppose this from
 
02:46:44.870 --> 02:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
the get-go um I'm I am supportive of
 
02:46:47.790 --> 02:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
Representative Hall's amendment to look
 
02:46:49.550 --> 02:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
into whether the this is something that
 
02:46:52.389 --> 02:46:52.399 align:start position:0%
can be um implemented but I don't think
 
02:46:54.030 --> 02:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
it makes sense to continue to take
 
02:46:56.429 --> 02:46:56.439 align:start position:0%
federal dollars um at infan item as
 
02:46:57.790 --> 02:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
we've been doing especially over the
 
02:47:01.550 --> 02:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
last TW four years since 2020 thank
 
02:47:04.150 --> 02:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
you further discussion representative
 
02:47:07.030 --> 02:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
hle thank you Mr chair
 
02:47:09.550 --> 02:47:09.560 align:start position:0%
um yesterday you handed out a sheet of
 
02:47:11.870 --> 02:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
paper from the LBA showing what we had
 
02:47:13.750 --> 02:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
for bills that were house bills not
 
02:47:15.790 --> 02:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
including Senate bills and the total
 
02:47:17.990 --> 02:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
Appropriations at this time was 152
 
02:47:21.790 --> 02:47:21.800 align:start position:0%
million right with general fund having
 
02:47:24.670 --> 02:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
potentially um 62 million available or
 
02:47:26.469 --> 02:47:26.479 align:start position:0%
something so we're going to have to make
 
02:47:29.150 --> 02:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
some tough choices in the next six weeks
 
02:47:32.269 --> 02:47:32.279 align:start position:0%
before session ends and I think it's
 
02:47:33.910 --> 02:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
time to start making some of those tough
 
02:47:35.950 --> 02:47:35.960 align:start position:0%
choices and one way to make that tough
 
02:47:38.830 --> 02:47:38.840 align:start position:0%
choice is to allow this conceptual
 
02:47:40.630 --> 02:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
planning to go forward but not
 
02:47:42.349 --> 02:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily start the program if you
 
02:47:44.110 --> 02:47:44.120 align:start position:0%
start the program we are actually
 
02:47:46.269 --> 02:47:46.279 align:start position:0%
spending not the
 
02:47:48.349 --> 02:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
$667,000 that was just talked about but
 
02:47:50.190 --> 02:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
it's a little over a million dollars on
 
02:47:52.590 --> 02:47:52.600 align:start position:0%
this one program and I don't think that
 
02:47:55.150 --> 02:47:55.160 align:start position:0%
funding is coming out of anything else
 
02:47:58.590 --> 02:47:58.600 align:start position:0%
and I haven't seen a detailed sheet from
 
02:48:01.030 --> 02:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
the Department showing why the costs are
 
02:48:04.070 --> 02:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
so high when we've seen from the IT
 
02:48:06.030 --> 02:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
department on other programs the
 
02:48:07.710 --> 02:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
implementation costs are closer to
 
02:48:10.670 --> 02:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
$100,000 not over
 
02:48:13.790 --> 02:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
600,000 thank you are we ready for the
 
02:48:17.269 --> 02:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
vote representative groden thank you I
 
02:48:19.790 --> 02:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
want to make an observation
 
02:48:19.800 --> 02:48:21.269 align:start position:0%
want to make an observation
in

02:48:21.269 --> 02:48:21.279 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:48:24.670 --> 02:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
that I've heard that I
 
02:48:28.349 --> 02:48:28.359 align:start position:0%
believe that food stamps and snap
 
02:48:31.469 --> 02:48:31.479 align:start position:0%
programs take care of this and that this
 
02:48:34.429 --> 02:48:34.439 align:start position:0%
is double dipping and I see some nods
 
02:48:37.710 --> 02:48:37.720 align:start position:0%
like this and I see some nods like this
 
02:48:40.950 --> 02:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
and this committee should know that you
 
02:48:42.990 --> 02:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
should have those facts and you should
 
02:48:44.030 --> 02:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
have that
 
02:48:47.590 --> 02:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
data and I'm disappointed that you don't
 
02:48:52.670 --> 02:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:56.110 --> 02:48:56.120 align:start position:0%
Point representative papichi Muller
 
02:48:57.830 --> 02:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
we're beating this to death by the I
 
02:49:00.190 --> 02:49:00.200 align:start position:0%
agree that we should have that data the
 
02:49:01.990 --> 02:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
burden to provide the data to support
 
02:49:03.910 --> 02:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
the bill is with the people who advocate
 
02:49:06.110 --> 02:49:06.120 align:start position:0%
for the bill we've done the best we
 
02:49:08.030 --> 02:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
could we've asked for additional data
 
02:49:09.590 --> 02:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
this is all the data we got so that's
 
02:49:12.190 --> 02:49:12.200 align:start position:0%
the data we are working
 
02:49:14.510 --> 02:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
with representative
 
02:49:18.389 --> 02:49:18.399 align:start position:0%
Lane thank you um I would Echo what uh
 
02:49:21.630 --> 02:49:21.640 align:start position:0%
repres representative Grody said and I
 
02:49:24.670 --> 02:49:24.680 align:start position:0%
guess in recognition of the fact that
 
02:49:27.990 --> 02:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
welfare does not solve poverty my
 
02:49:30.830 --> 02:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
thought is until we find a way to do it
 
02:49:33.550 --> 02:49:33.560 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't cut out those who are most
 
02:49:36.469 --> 02:49:36.479 align:start position:0%
in need and if we need a new solution
 
02:49:38.630 --> 02:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
then let's come up with it but leaving
 
02:49:41.590 --> 02:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
money on the table for those for the
 
02:49:44.710 --> 02:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
children is just to me inexcusable and
 
02:49:47.309 --> 02:49:47.319 align:start position:0%
like representative Heath said I'm only
 
02:49:48.950 --> 02:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
a substitute but I'm going to have to go
 
02:49:50.630 --> 02:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
explain this to people and I'm going to
 
02:49:54.229 --> 02:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
be it's going to be hard thank
 
02:49:57.550 --> 02:49:57.560 align:start position:0%
you are we ready for the vote cler we'll
 
02:50:01.150 --> 02:50:01.160 align:start position:0%

02:50:08.389 --> 02:50:08.399 align:start position:0%

02:50:11.309 --> 02:50:11.319 align:start position:0%

02:50:20.349 --> 02:50:20.359 align:start position:0%
it you you you discussed an amendment
 
02:50:21.910 --> 02:50:21.920 align:start position:0%

02:50:25.269 --> 02:50:25.279 align:start position:0%

02:56:25.790 --> 02:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Providers through 11 weeks
 
02:56:27.670 --> 02:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
for safe medical abortions they've been
 
02:56:32.550 --> 02:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
using the medication for years decades
 
02:56:35.150 --> 02:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
even access to appropriate health care
 
02:56:37.110 --> 02:56:37.120 align:start position:0%
and in particular to reproductive Health
 
02:56:39.630 --> 02:56:39.640 align:start position:0%
Care does vary throughout the
 
02:56:43.269 --> 02:56:43.279 align:start position:0%
state and while we recognize that the
 
02:56:44.710 --> 02:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
02:56:47.389 --> 02:56:47.399 align:start position:0%
could compile this report without the
 
02:56:49.269 --> 02:56:49.279 align:start position:0%
legislation We Believe believe that this
 
02:56:52.030 --> 02:56:52.040 align:start position:0%
issue is an important policy area in
 
02:56:53.510 --> 02:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
which the legislature should give
 
02:56:56.229 --> 02:56:56.239 align:start position:0%
specific Direction about an initiative
 
02:56:58.550 --> 02:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
that could inform both DHHS and the
 
02:57:01.710 --> 02:57:01.720 align:start position:0%
legislature about any changes that need
 
02:57:03.750 --> 02:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
to be made to ensure access to this
 
02:57:07.710 --> 02:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
important reproductive Health Care
 
02:57:11.429 --> 02:57:11.439 align:start position:0%
Drug and the fiscal impact we were told
 
02:57:13.550 --> 02:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
is exceedingly minimal so I will be
 
02:57:16.150 --> 02:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
voting against the itl motion and I urge
 
02:57:18.469 --> 02:57:18.479 align:start position:0%
my colleagues to join me thank you is
 
02:57:21.309 --> 02:57:21.319 align:start position:0%
only about a report remember comment
 
02:57:23.710 --> 02:57:23.720 align:start position:0%
representative um I I I just want to
 
02:57:26.830 --> 02:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
make it clear that the division 3 vote
 
02:57:28.870 --> 02:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
to say itl had nothing to do with
 
02:57:31.150 --> 02:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
abortion I'll say it again because it's
 
02:57:33.429 --> 02:57:33.439 align:start position:0%
going to get misrepresented in the media
 
02:57:36.269 --> 02:57:36.279 align:start position:0%
and once we leave the room our vote had
 
02:57:39.389 --> 02:57:39.399 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with abortion what we have
 
02:57:43.269 --> 02:57:43.279 align:start position:0%
as facts before us is that the law
 
02:57:47.389 --> 02:57:47.399 align:start position:0%
around uh whether or not the FDA had
 
02:57:50.510 --> 02:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
used the prop procedures to approve
 
02:57:54.110 --> 02:57:54.120 align:start position:0%
these two particular drugs uh are have
 
02:57:56.750 --> 02:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
been adjudicated by a Texas Federal
 
02:57:59.750 --> 02:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
court and then reviewed by uh an appell
 
02:58:03.190 --> 02:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
at court and uh it went to an appeals
 
02:58:07.910 --> 02:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
court uh and neither of those two courts
 
02:58:11.309 --> 02:58:11.319 align:start position:0%
had any conflict in the their opinion
 
02:58:13.750 --> 02:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
that these drugs did not go through the
 
02:58:16.990 --> 02:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
standard FDA practices for safety and
 
02:58:20.190 --> 02:58:20.200 align:start position:0%
efficacy the the the rules around safety
 
02:58:23.790 --> 02:58:23.800 align:start position:0%
and efficacy were violated Texas thought
 
02:58:27.150 --> 02:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
that the violation was so severe that
 
02:58:28.950 --> 02:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
they wanted to do an injunction against
 
02:58:32.469 --> 02:58:32.479 align:start position:0%
having the two drugs the uh Circuit
 
02:58:35.469 --> 02:58:35.479 align:start position:0%
Court agreed that the that the drugs had
 
02:58:38.229 --> 02:58:38.239 align:start position:0%
not gone through an a proper approval U
 
02:58:40.590 --> 02:58:40.600 align:start position:0%
but disagreed that an injunct an
 
02:58:44.670 --> 02:58:44.680 align:start position:0%
injunction was appropriate neither Court
 
02:58:47.550 --> 02:58:47.560 align:start position:0%
disputed that the FDA violated their
 
02:58:50.510 --> 02:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
safety efficacy uh clinical research
 
02:58:53.429 --> 02:58:53.439 align:start position:0%
protocols not a not an issue this went
 
02:58:55.309 --> 02:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
to the Supreme Court it's in the Supreme
 
02:58:59.389 --> 02:58:59.399 align:start position:0%
Court still um where the Supreme Court
 
02:59:01.469 --> 02:59:01.479 align:start position:0%
is determining whether or not the
 
02:59:04.550 --> 02:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
injunction and the relief from the re
 
02:59:07.790 --> 02:59:07.800 align:start position:0%
injunction was good law they're they're
 
02:59:09.269 --> 02:59:09.279 align:start position:0%
as I understand it they're not even
 
02:59:12.510 --> 02:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
reviewing the the fact that um the the
 
02:59:15.349 --> 02:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
the FDA approval process was uh
 
02:59:18.110 --> 02:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
circumvented to to uh get these to
 
02:59:21.030 --> 02:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
Market Center so it's not settled law
 
02:59:23.110 --> 02:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
it's still in the Supreme Court so it's
 
02:59:25.590 --> 02:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
premature I think for New Hampshire to
 
02:59:28.429 --> 02:59:28.439 align:start position:0%
step out in front of something that is
 
02:59:30.630 --> 02:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
going to be settled probably in a few
 
02:59:32.269 --> 02:59:32.279 align:start position:0%
months we don't know when it's going to
 
02:59:33.750 --> 02:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
be settled but it's not going to be a
 
02:59:36.030 --> 02:59:36.040 align:start position:0%
year because the Supreme Court's already
 
02:59:38.950 --> 02:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh taken testimony on it so so it's not
 
02:59:42.190 --> 02:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
settled law also the the comment was
 
02:59:43.830 --> 02:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
made that the department could do this
 
02:59:43.840 --> 02:59:44.990 align:start position:0%
made that the department could do this
without

02:59:44.990 --> 02:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
without
 
02:59:46.910 --> 02:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
legislation the department could do a
 
02:59:48.630 --> 02:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
lot of things without legis islation but
 
02:59:50.469 --> 02:59:50.479 align:start position:0%
they have no Charter to do this sort of
 
02:59:52.590 --> 02:59:52.600 align:start position:0%
thing they have no history no precedent
 
02:59:55.429 --> 02:59:55.439 align:start position:0%
no experience no existing reports that
 
02:59:58.030 --> 02:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
cause them to go in and take a look at
 
03:00:00.950 --> 03:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh the availability of of a particular
 
03:00:05.229 --> 03:00:05.239 align:start position:0%
by name uh prescription and determine if
 
03:00:08.349 --> 03:00:08.359 align:start position:0%
there are barriers to access and and the
 
03:00:11.469 --> 03:00:11.479 align:start position:0%
like so we would this law is necessary
 
03:00:16.190 --> 03:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
to compel DHHS to do an unn an unnatural
 
03:00:18.229 --> 03:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
act that it's never done before it's not
 
03:00:22.750 --> 03:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
in their mission so um so there's that
 
03:00:28.389 --> 03:00:28.399 align:start position:0%
um but uh there there there is this it
 
03:00:31.389 --> 03:00:31.399 align:start position:0%
happens to be passionate because in the
 
03:00:34.269 --> 03:00:34.279 align:start position:0%
background is the whole abortion debate
 
03:00:36.429 --> 03:00:36.439 align:start position:0%
but from a legislative perspective from
 
03:00:38.469 --> 03:00:38.479 align:start position:0%
what New Hampshire ought to be doing we
 
03:00:40.790 --> 03:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
ought not to be trying to supplement
 
03:00:44.349 --> 03:00:44.359 align:start position:0%
multi-billion doll marketing budgets of
 
03:00:46.790 --> 03:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
the pharmaceutical companies we don't do
 
03:00:48.630 --> 03:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
this for any other drug
 
03:00:50.910 --> 03:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
there are currently because of the China
 
03:00:52.590 --> 03:00:52.600 align:start position:0%
supply chain issues there are a number
 
03:00:55.830 --> 03:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
of prescription drugs that are having
 
03:00:59.030 --> 03:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
accessib problems we're not asking to go
 
03:01:01.309 --> 03:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
research those drugs to make sure that
 
03:01:04.429 --> 03:01:04.439 align:start position:0%
they're more available so I I I I don't
 
03:01:06.630 --> 03:01:06.640 align:start position:0%
think that we need to be getting into
 
03:01:08.910 --> 03:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
the micromanagement of this and I I
 
03:01:11.830 --> 03:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
strongly think that itl was the proper
 
03:01:15.190 --> 03:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
motion representative hacken
 
03:01:18.590 --> 03:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
Phillips thank you Mr chair for
 
03:01:22.349 --> 03:01:22.359 align:start position:0%
recognizing me um so I'm trying to stay
 
03:01:24.790 --> 03:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
as calm as possible I am a co-sponsor on
 
03:01:27.590 --> 03:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
this bill and
 
03:01:31.910 --> 03:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
um I just so happen to be one of the 50%
 
03:01:34.710 --> 03:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
of the state in voters who believe this
 
03:01:37.389 --> 03:01:37.399 align:start position:0%
issue is of critical importance in fact
 
03:01:39.429 --> 03:01:39.439 align:start position:0%
the number one issue in my voting
 
03:01:44.870 --> 03:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
district so to hear folks say that um
 
03:01:47.190 --> 03:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
that this bill that could have an effect
 
03:01:51.070 --> 03:01:51.080 align:start position:0%
in our state is not um you know worthy
 
03:01:54.790 --> 03:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
of discussion today or passage into law
 
03:01:57.309 --> 03:01:57.319 align:start position:0%
um I think that's severely misguided
 
03:02:01.070 --> 03:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
from the actual um way our voters feel
 
03:02:03.670 --> 03:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
let me start by saying that the federal
 
03:02:06.030 --> 03:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
court cases that are you know working
 
03:02:09.389 --> 03:02:09.399 align:start position:0%
through the system right now will take
 
03:02:11.309 --> 03:02:11.319 align:start position:0%
take place and they will they will come
 
03:02:14.070 --> 03:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
out we will find out what they think um
 
03:02:17.910 --> 03:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
but for us to relitigate that FDA
 
03:02:21.429 --> 03:02:21.439 align:start position:0%
concern here um is inappropriate because
 
03:02:24.030 --> 03:02:24.040 align:start position:0%
that this bill is not talking about that
 
03:02:26.190 --> 03:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
um the FDA process is not what this bill
 
03:02:28.790 --> 03:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
is about what this bill would do for our
 
03:02:30.990 --> 03:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
state would to be studying the increased
 
03:02:33.389 --> 03:02:33.399 align:start position:0%
access and challenges to that access to
 
03:02:34.550 --> 03:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
these two
 
03:02:37.910 --> 03:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
drugs so when I think of those 50% of
 
03:02:40.469 --> 03:02:40.479 align:start position:0%
Voters across the state who are
 
03:02:42.510 --> 03:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
affected by whether or not they can
 
03:02:44.950 --> 03:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
receive these drugs the challenges that
 
03:02:47.150 --> 03:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
are presented to them and their
 
03:02:48.830 --> 03:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
providers when trying to get access to
 
03:02:48.840 --> 03:02:49.950 align:start position:0%
providers when trying to get access to
those

03:02:49.950 --> 03:02:49.960 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:02:52.630 --> 03:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
drugs I know it affects our estate and
 
03:02:54.389 --> 03:02:54.399 align:start position:0%
that we should be studying it because of
 
03:02:57.229 --> 03:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
the fact that there's an ongoing OBGYN
 
03:02:58.910 --> 03:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
shortage in our
 
03:03:01.469 --> 03:03:01.479 align:start position:0%
state and this particular bill is
 
03:03:04.070 --> 03:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
relevant to that because these two drugs
 
03:03:05.990 --> 03:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
are part of the toolbox that this
 
03:03:08.229 --> 03:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
profession uses to address Health Care
 
03:03:11.229 --> 03:03:11.239 align:start position:0%
access and procedures in our state that
 
03:03:14.269 --> 03:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
affects 50% of the people in our state
 
03:03:17.469 --> 03:03:17.479 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure if everyone's aware here
 
03:03:19.630 --> 03:03:19.640 align:start position:0%
but last week the American Medical
 
03:03:23.070 --> 03:03:23.080 align:start position:0%
Association produced a journal article
 
03:03:23.080 --> 03:03:23.790 align:start position:0%
Association produced a journal article
that

03:03:23.790 --> 03:03:23.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:03:27.190 --> 03:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
tracks states that have enacted bans yes
 
03:03:29.469 --> 03:03:29.479 align:start position:0%
bans including those States like ours
 
03:03:31.750 --> 03:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
that has a 24-week abortion ban with
 
03:03:33.990 --> 03:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
limited exceptions so that was within
 
03:03:37.790 --> 03:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
the prview of the study the study showed
 
03:03:39.309 --> 03:03:39.319 align:start position:0%
that in states that have enacted this
 
03:03:40.950 --> 03:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
legislation that they're having trouble
 
03:03:43.950 --> 03:03:43.960 align:start position:0%
recruiting and retaining OBGYN residents
 
03:03:46.150 --> 03:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
in their programs across the
 
03:03:48.469 --> 03:03:48.479 align:start position:0%
country that
 
03:03:51.550 --> 03:03:51.560 align:start position:0%
creating healthc care delivery problems
 
03:03:55.469 --> 03:03:55.479 align:start position:0%
it's also creating a shortage of future
 
03:03:59.030 --> 03:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
OBGYNs uh yes this bill is of critical
 
03:04:01.950 --> 03:04:01.960 align:start position:0%
importance for the future of not only
 
03:04:04.150 --> 03:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
Women's Healthcare but of the health
 
03:04:06.870 --> 03:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
care of their family members as well and
 
03:04:08.750 --> 03:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
the way that their families can function
 
03:04:10.110 --> 03:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
and the way they can contribute to
 
03:04:12.910 --> 03:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
society and our economy in particular
 
03:04:14.309 --> 03:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
which I know is relevant to this
 
03:04:14.319 --> 03:04:15.710 align:start position:0%
which I know is relevant to this
committee's

03:04:15.710 --> 03:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
committee's
 
03:04:18.630 --> 03:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
work I do not believe the motion is
 
03:04:20.670 --> 03:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate at this time for those exact
 
03:04:23.590 --> 03:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
reasons and I hope that this membership
 
03:04:25.229 --> 03:04:25.239 align:start position:0%
on this committee will be able to see
 
03:04:28.469 --> 03:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
beyond the larger culture War before The
 
03:04:31.590 --> 03:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court um and you know working
 
03:04:33.990 --> 03:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
through our court systems and focus on
 
03:04:36.550 --> 03:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
what's Happening Here in our
 
03:04:39.309 --> 03:04:39.319 align:start position:0%
state be concerned about the access
 
03:04:41.309 --> 03:04:41.319 align:start position:0%
issues and the challenges to those
 
03:04:44.990 --> 03:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
access and to also I'm so sorry I'm very
 
03:04:46.670 --> 03:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
close to finishing chair wer if you
 
03:04:50.750 --> 03:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
could just let me wrap that up um so I I
 
03:04:53.670 --> 03:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
would say that you
 
03:04:57.229 --> 03:04:57.239 align:start position:0%
know to dismiss this is not relevant to
 
03:04:59.349 --> 03:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
our state I think is a major error I
 
03:05:01.469 --> 03:05:01.479 align:start position:0%
think that it is relevant I think that
 
03:05:03.750 --> 03:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
the study will be important that the
 
03:05:05.950 --> 03:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
reporting mechanisms built into the law
 
03:05:08.070 --> 03:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
will be important for the future of
 
03:05:10.190 --> 03:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
healthc care in our state thank you you
 
03:05:12.469 --> 03:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
Mr repetition that's
 
03:05:15.550 --> 03:05:15.560 align:start position:0%
all representative Edwards make it short
 
03:05:17.269 --> 03:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
yes yes sir I think the video will show
 
03:05:19.590 --> 03:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
I never used the word irrelevant so that
 
03:05:22.550 --> 03:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
didn't come from me uh I said that uh
 
03:05:25.269 --> 03:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
this is premature because the body of
 
03:05:27.990 --> 03:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
law is not settled I said that this is
 
03:05:29.710 --> 03:05:29.720 align:start position:0%
something the department never does
 
03:05:32.469 --> 03:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
hasn't been in their mission and uh and
 
03:05:35.429 --> 03:05:35.439 align:start position:0%
that the selection of these two drugs is
 
03:05:37.429 --> 03:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
the initiation of a culture war that
 
03:05:40.510 --> 03:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't necessary and to have a response
 
03:05:43.309 --> 03:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
to it is is of course there's going to
 
03:05:45.990 --> 03:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
be a response if there's an initiative
 
03:05:49.750 --> 03:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
and and the implication of of the prior
 
03:05:52.550 --> 03:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
comments is that we have women who can't
 
03:05:54.309 --> 03:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
get these two drugs there's nothing that
 
03:05:57.229 --> 03:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
interferes with uh uh physicians in New
 
03:05:59.389 --> 03:05:59.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire prescribing these uh they
 
03:06:01.309 --> 03:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
we're not getting in between we're not
 
03:06:04.070 --> 03:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
stopping we're not hindering these the
 
03:06:07.349 --> 03:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
availability of these two drugs uh as a
 
03:06:11.030 --> 03:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
legislature and so to pretend as though
 
03:06:13.870 --> 03:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
you know access is somehow constrained
 
03:06:17.229 --> 03:06:17.239 align:start position:0%
and restricted I I that's a dystopian
 
03:06:20.190 --> 03:06:20.200 align:start position:0%
View that just doesn't seem to exist in
 
03:06:22.870 --> 03:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire these drugs are not
 
03:06:25.790 --> 03:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
being withheld they are available
 
03:06:29.670 --> 03:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
through normal physician patient
 
03:06:33.590 --> 03:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
relationships so that I I itl is the
 
03:06:35.910 --> 03:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
right recommendation sir cler will
 
03:06:37.830 --> 03:06:37.840 align:start position:0%

motion is adopted representative Edwards
 
03:07:53.309 --> 03:07:53.319 align:start position:0%
for Senate Bill
 
03:07:55.590 --> 03:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
596 there will be a Minority Report on
 
03:07:57.190 --> 03:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
the previous Bill sir who will be the
 
03:08:00.429 --> 03:08:00.439 align:start position:0%
author uh me okay we got a lot of work
 
03:08:03.469 --> 03:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
to do okay and and so you should have me
 
03:08:06.910 --> 03:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
down as um majority report majority
 
03:08:10.870 --> 03:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
report yes sir all right okay so um last
 
03:08:14.389 --> 03:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
but not least SB
 
03:08:17.870 --> 03:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
596 um this is relative to definition of
 
03:08:20.429 --> 03:08:20.439 align:start position:0%
disability or special needs under the
 
03:08:21.830 --> 03:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
child care
 
03:08:25.710 --> 03:08:25.720 align:start position:0%
scholarship um I have an amendment that
 
03:08:30.389 --> 03:08:30.399 align:start position:0%
was uh shown to division 3 earlier today
 
03:08:32.950 --> 03:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
um to be fair to the process there
 
03:08:35.830 --> 03:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
hadn't been a lot of time to to discuss
 
03:08:39.750 --> 03:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
it um essentially what the underlying
 
03:08:42.429 --> 03:08:42.439 align:start position:0%
bill is attempting to well I'll I'll
 
03:08:44.710 --> 03:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
just leave it at that I I I could make a
 
03:08:49.309 --> 03:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
motion to adopt um
 
03:08:49.319 --> 03:08:50.550 align:start position:0%
motion to adopt um
Amendment

03:08:50.550 --> 03:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
03:08:57.030 --> 03:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
2024 1933 H to SB 596 second Motion in a
 
03:08:59.670 --> 03:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
second to adopt 1 19338 representative
 
03:09:02.429 --> 03:09:02.439 align:start position:0%
Edwards is recognized to explain it uh
 
03:09:05.150 --> 03:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
thank you uh the underlying Bill
 
03:09:08.070 --> 03:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
596 um basically
 
03:09:12.150 --> 03:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
untethers the U the discovery of
 
03:09:16.429 --> 03:09:16.439 align:start position:0%
children who who may have in the future
 
03:09:20.429 --> 03:09:20.439 align:start position:0%
um propensity to having special needs or
 
03:09:23.229 --> 03:09:23.239 align:start position:0%
or at risk for it so the objective is a
 
03:09:25.630 --> 03:09:25.640 align:start position:0%
good one let's let's try to
 
03:09:29.190 --> 03:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
identify kids as early as possible and
 
03:09:31.950 --> 03:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
because we think it's a good idea to try
 
03:09:34.269 --> 03:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
to do that we'd like to make sure that
 
03:09:38.030 --> 03:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
we do it well and do it right and so so
 
03:09:39.990 --> 03:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
rather than un what what what the
 
03:09:43.229 --> 03:09:43.239 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill does it tethers us from
 
03:09:46.790 --> 03:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
any legal definition of the new category
 
03:09:51.070 --> 03:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
of eligib ability and instead refers to
 
03:09:55.469 --> 03:09:55.479 align:start position:0%
uh uh care assessment plans that would
 
03:10:01.710 --> 03:10:01.720 align:start position:0%
be um uh used to test kids uh and those
 
03:10:03.990 --> 03:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
assessment plans which have not been
 
03:10:05.870 --> 03:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
picked or Chosen and that the
 
03:10:07.990 --> 03:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
legislature has no clue which ones they
 
03:10:10.429 --> 03:10:10.439 align:start position:0%
are what the selection criteria for them
 
03:10:13.590 --> 03:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
would be uh would be determinative on
 
03:10:16.389 --> 03:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
whether or not um a a a kid was
 
03:10:19.630 --> 03:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
identified as as having a a current or
 
03:10:22.550 --> 03:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
Future Special Needs problem um and if
 
03:10:25.070 --> 03:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
they do have a special needs problem
 
03:10:27.830 --> 03:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
then they become eligible for an extra
 
03:10:31.630 --> 03:10:31.640 align:start position:0%
$100 a month or so uh to help with um
 
03:10:33.990 --> 03:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
child care expenses there's nothing in
 
03:10:36.630 --> 03:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
the bill currently to say what a child
 
03:10:39.510 --> 03:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
care provider should do in exchange for
 
03:10:42.150 --> 03:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
the additional money that they would get
 
03:10:44.309 --> 03:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the bill the interest
 
03:10:46.469 --> 03:10:46.479 align:start position:0%
behind the bill seems to be let's just
 
03:10:48.990 --> 03:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
get our child care people more money and
 
03:10:52.710 --> 03:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
this is a good way to do it well it's I
 
03:10:55.309 --> 03:10:55.319 align:start position:0%
I understand the temptation to just get
 
03:10:58.229 --> 03:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
more money to child care providers but
 
03:11:00.070 --> 03:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
there are too many uncertain questions
 
03:11:03.750 --> 03:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
here we don't know uh uh which tests
 
03:11:05.790 --> 03:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
might be used and which ones wouldn't be
 
03:11:08.510 --> 03:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate we don't know which
 
03:11:12.190 --> 03:11:12.200 align:start position:0%
community of evaluators should be used
 
03:11:15.630 --> 03:11:15.640 align:start position:0%
in order to uh conduct these assessments
 
03:11:17.990 --> 03:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
um in the bill itself s it just says
 
03:11:20.550 --> 03:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
they need to be licensed professionals
 
03:11:23.309 --> 03:11:23.319 align:start position:0%
but licensed professionals at what uh
 
03:11:24.990 --> 03:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
this is really these kind of assessments
 
03:11:28.389 --> 03:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
are critical and so uh you wouldn't even
 
03:11:30.110 --> 03:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
want a bachelor's person do it I think
 
03:11:32.030 --> 03:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
you'd want a master's level person do it
 
03:11:36.990 --> 03:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
the Bill's silent on that um so uh also
 
03:11:39.510 --> 03:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
once these kids get identified there
 
03:11:42.150 --> 03:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
really ought to be a way to make sure
 
03:11:44.190 --> 03:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
that they get some Services immediately
 
03:11:45.790 --> 03:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
for the extra money that would be
 
03:11:48.110 --> 03:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
invested in them but but as
 
03:11:50.910 --> 03:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
significantly and maybe more importantly
 
03:11:53.269 --> 03:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
is that there ought to be some concept
 
03:11:56.630 --> 03:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
of how th that identification would feed
 
03:11:59.510 --> 03:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
into um integrated services like
 
03:12:03.030 --> 03:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and public schools so so what
 
03:12:05.750 --> 03:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
this proposal does is essentially
 
03:12:08.750 --> 03:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
says look great idea we're not
 
03:12:10.910 --> 03:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
disagreeing with the objective but let's
 
03:12:13.349 --> 03:12:13.359 align:start position:0%
please let's just get it right let's get
 
03:12:16.269 --> 03:12:16.279 align:start position:0%
a study committee together and have the
 
03:12:19.229 --> 03:12:19.239 align:start position:0%
uh study committee um study the
 
03:12:21.150 --> 03:12:21.160 align:start position:0%
definition of disability or special
 
03:12:23.309 --> 03:12:23.319 align:start position:0%
needs under the child scholarship
 
03:12:26.269 --> 03:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
program study the standardized and
 
03:12:28.429 --> 03:12:28.439 align:start position:0%
approved Early Childhood developmental
 
03:12:30.590 --> 03:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
screening tools necessary to determine
 
03:12:33.429 --> 03:12:33.439 align:start position:0%
the eligibility study the verification
 
03:12:35.229 --> 03:12:35.239 align:start position:0%
process for the results of the screening
 
03:12:37.389 --> 03:12:37.399 align:start position:0%
tool used to determine
 
03:12:39.910 --> 03:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
eligibility the bill is silent on all of
 
03:12:42.070 --> 03:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
those determine the size of the
 
03:12:44.469 --> 03:12:44.479 align:start position:0%
population served by the program
 
03:12:46.630 --> 03:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
identify how incremental changes to the
 
03:12:48.309 --> 03:12:48.319 align:start position:0%
program including changes to the
 
03:12:49.990 --> 03:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
definition of disability or special
 
03:12:53.110 --> 03:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
needs may affect its scope and project
 
03:12:56.229 --> 03:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
and project Associated costs in state
 
03:12:59.190 --> 03:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
and federal funding sources so so lines
 
03:13:02.590 --> 03:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
25 through 27 basically say come on we
 
03:13:04.750 --> 03:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
need to do a good financial analysis of
 
03:13:08.349 --> 03:13:08.359 align:start position:0%
this and that hasn't been done yet um uh
 
03:13:10.590 --> 03:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
line 28 picks up with the the section
 
03:13:14.190 --> 03:13:14.200 align:start position:0%
five study any other issues identified
 
03:13:17.510 --> 03:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
through the legislative hearings on 596
 
03:13:21.190 --> 03:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
including but not necessarily limited to
 
03:13:23.150 --> 03:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
uh the minimum performance standards and
 
03:13:25.349 --> 03:13:25.359 align:start position:0%
metrics to be achieved in exchange for
 
03:13:27.309 --> 03:13:27.319 align:start position:0%
receipt of additional funds made
 
03:13:30.510 --> 03:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
available by the program uh issues
 
03:13:33.070 --> 03:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
associated with integrating this program
 
03:13:35.910 --> 03:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
with Medicaid or public school service
 
03:13:38.550 --> 03:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
transitions so I that's good committee
 
03:13:41.070 --> 03:13:41.080 align:start position:0%
work that would make a really great Bill
 
03:13:42.990 --> 03:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
if we knew what we were doing and
 
03:13:45.990 --> 03:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
currently 596 doesn't have the
 
03:13:48.830 --> 03:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
legislature in informed about what it is
 
03:13:51.309 --> 03:13:51.319 align:start position:0%
we would be asking the department to do
 
03:13:53.469 --> 03:13:53.479 align:start position:0%
I think we need to slow down and do our
 
03:13:55.269 --> 03:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
homework and the study committee does
 
03:13:57.870 --> 03:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
that so it's got the regular represent
 
03:14:00.830 --> 03:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
representations of the legislature and
 
03:14:03.229 --> 03:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
then it invites the committee to invite
 
03:14:06.910 --> 03:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
a design of uh the DHHS commissioner the
 
03:14:09.710 --> 03:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
design of the Department of Education uh
 
03:14:12.190 --> 03:14:12.200 align:start position:0%

and communication and integration that
 
03:14:40.469 --> 03:14:40.479 align:start position:0%
should precede the legislation and
 
03:14:43.990 --> 03:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
hasn't yet representative Edwards moves

walner thank you so I I'd just like to
 
03:15:00.950 --> 03:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
move back to square one for a minute
 
03:15:04.110 --> 03:15:04.120 align:start position:0%

at

03:15:12.830 --> 03:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:15:16.190 --> 03:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
so often there are children we're talk
 
03:15:17.990 --> 03:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about very young children
 
03:15:20.070 --> 03:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
children under the age of
 
03:15:23.030 --> 03:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
five one two I look around the room I
 
03:15:25.590 --> 03:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
imagine everybody has spent time in
 
03:15:28.469 --> 03:15:28.479 align:start position:0%
their life with a one or a two or a
 
03:15:32.309 --> 03:15:32.319 align:start position:0%
three-year-old um sometimes those
 
03:15:35.550 --> 03:15:35.560 align:start position:0%
children are not developing
 
03:15:39.790 --> 03:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
at the regular rate and they may have
 
03:15:43.030 --> 03:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
behaviors particularly that make it kind
 
03:15:45.670 --> 03:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
of difficult for them to be in a
 
03:15:49.110 --> 03:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
group and what this bill is looking
 
03:15:53.550 --> 03:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
at is finding a way of doing an early
 
03:15:55.830 --> 03:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
assessment and these are done all the
 
03:15:59.630 --> 03:15:59.640 align:start position:0%
time the department would decide which
 
03:16:02.389 --> 03:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
instrument would be used which of the um
 
03:16:05.550 --> 03:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
instruments would be used and through
 
03:16:05.560 --> 03:16:06.469 align:start position:0%
instruments would be used and through
this

03:16:06.469 --> 03:16:06.479 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:16:09.870 --> 03:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
assessment it would help them integrate
 
03:16:13.550 --> 03:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
into a child care center many of these
 
03:16:16.910 --> 03:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
children actually end up finding the par
 
03:16:19.229 --> 03:16:19.239 align:start position:0%
parents find those children expelled
 
03:16:22.070 --> 03:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
from child care because their ha
 
03:16:25.590 --> 03:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
behavior is such that the providers
 
03:16:28.349 --> 03:16:28.359 align:start position:0%
cannot meet their
 
03:16:31.630 --> 03:16:31.640 align:start position:0%
needs they often cannot get into child
 
03:16:34.429 --> 03:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
care for the same reasons the the
 
03:16:36.189 --> 03:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
provider feels they can't meet their
 
03:16:39.349 --> 03:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
needs this gives the provider a little
 
03:16:43.990 --> 03:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
bit of Revenue to help the provider try
 
03:16:46.150 --> 03:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
to address those needs and most of it's
 
03:16:48.070 --> 03:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
around being able to have some
 
03:16:48.080 --> 03:16:49.189 align:start position:0%
around being able to have some
additional

03:16:49.189 --> 03:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
additional
 
03:16:51.590 --> 03:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
Staffing so you know the additional
 
03:16:55.590 --> 03:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
person to sit at in circle time so that
 
03:16:57.950 --> 03:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
this little person isn't touching
 
03:17:00.269 --> 03:17:00.279 align:start position:0%
everybody and running around the
 
03:17:03.150 --> 03:17:03.160 align:start position:0%
room going on field trips so that this
 
03:17:06.150 --> 03:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
child can be also included in going on
 
03:17:06.160 --> 03:17:07.110 align:start position:0%
child can be also included in going on
field

03:17:07.110 --> 03:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
field
 
03:17:10.590 --> 03:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
trips sitting down and reading a story
 
03:17:13.950 --> 03:17:13.960 align:start position:0%
with a child one on-one these are kids
 
03:17:17.269 --> 03:17:17.279 align:start position:0%
who need a lot of often need a lot of
 
03:17:19.910 --> 03:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
one-on-one attention and this would just
 
03:17:22.550 --> 03:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
help provide some
 
03:17:25.510 --> 03:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
additional U financing to help the
 
03:17:27.590 --> 03:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
centers and the child care providers
 
03:17:30.429 --> 03:17:30.439 align:start position:0%
have that the the division of Health and
 
03:17:33.790 --> 03:17:33.800 align:start position:0%
Human Services already runs a program
 
03:17:37.830 --> 03:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
this program it's already in place this
 
03:17:42.510 --> 03:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
just includes a new group of children in
 
03:17:46.630 --> 03:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
that program um the cost is actually
 
03:17:49.309 --> 03:17:49.319 align:start position:0%
very very low I don't even I can't
 
03:17:51.309 --> 03:17:51.319 align:start position:0%
remember what it is they've spent to
 
03:17:53.990 --> 03:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
date uh but I don't believe they're even
 
03:17:56.349 --> 03:17:56.359 align:start position:0%
spending in this program what they had
 
03:18:00.429 --> 03:18:00.439 align:start position:0%
scheduled to spend um in the last
 
03:18:04.670 --> 03:18:04.680 align:start position:0%
budget so this is just really enabling
 
03:18:08.070 --> 03:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
those children to be able to attend
 
03:18:11.469 --> 03:18:11.479 align:start position:0%
child care and get the kind of extra
 
03:18:15.229 --> 03:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
help they need and a little bit of a
 
03:18:18.189 --> 03:18:18.199 align:start position:0%
little bit of extra help when you're 2
 
03:18:22.269 --> 03:18:22.279 align:start position:0%
three 4 is going to go a long way
 
03:18:24.950 --> 03:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
towards getting you ready for school so
 
03:18:27.110 --> 03:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
that you can be successful in
 
03:18:29.710 --> 03:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
school so I hope that the committee will
 
03:18:34.110 --> 03:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
take a look at this and not not develop
 
03:18:36.309 --> 03:18:36.319 align:start position:0%
another committee I can tell you there
 
03:18:38.269 --> 03:18:38.279 align:start position:0%
are so many Child Care committees and
 
03:18:40.389 --> 03:18:40.399 align:start position:0%
many of them have already done the work
 
03:18:43.030 --> 03:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
here the department knows how to run
 
03:18:45.469 --> 03:18:45.479 align:start position:0%
this program they know how to pick an
 
03:18:47.630 --> 03:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
instrument to do the
 
03:18:51.309 --> 03:18:51.319 align:start position:0%
assessments um everything is already in
 
03:18:54.229 --> 03:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
place to do this this is not Reinventing
 
03:18:58.429 --> 03:18:58.439 align:start position:0%
the wheel this is all there we just need
 
03:19:01.550 --> 03:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
to have some resources to help these
 
03:19:04.150 --> 03:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
children be able to integrate into child
 
03:19:06.189 --> 03:19:06.199 align:start position:0%
care and I also want to remind you that
 
03:19:09.269 --> 03:19:09.279 align:start position:0%
these if these kids cannot be in child
 
03:19:12.030 --> 03:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
care that probably means their parent is
 
03:19:14.469 --> 03:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
not working and I would think that would
 
03:19:15.950 --> 03:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
be something this committee would be
 
03:19:18.590 --> 03:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
very concerned about um if children are
 
03:19:21.870 --> 03:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
not being able to be cared for in child
 
03:19:25.870 --> 03:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
care and parents are unable to work so
 
03:19:28.710 --> 03:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
I'm you know glad that I would you
 
03:19:30.710 --> 03:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
allowed me to tell you what the real
 
03:19:34.830 --> 03:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
story was I I protest I I did tell a
 
03:19:36.630 --> 03:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
real story I I don't like the
 
03:19:38.630 --> 03:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
implication that what I said wasn't
 
03:19:40.950 --> 03:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
truthful you may disagree with it but it
 
03:19:42.910 --> 03:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
was truthful and
 
03:19:46.189 --> 03:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
real all those in favor of adopting
 
03:19:46.199 --> 03:19:47.189 align:start position:0%
real all those in favor of adopting
Amendment
