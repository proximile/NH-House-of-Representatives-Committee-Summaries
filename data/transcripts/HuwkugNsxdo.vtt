00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
here and so this is what we're talking
 
00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 align:start position:0%
about out here I guess is the um
 
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
sections let's see here in House Bill 2
 
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
um that are where are they uh Pages 25
 
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.789 align:start position:0%
um that are where are they uh Pages 25
through

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
65 hi good morning Mr chair my name is
 
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 align:start position:0%
Jan Goodwin I'm the executive director
 
00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:30.439 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire retirement system
 
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
um with me is Mark Kavanaugh our deputy
 
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
chief Council and he has put together a
 
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
comparison of the group two tier B
 
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
legislation that compares those aspects
 
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
from House Bill 2 from
 
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
2023 and this year's House Bill 2 2025
 
00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
excellent so um it's a onepage summary
 
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 align:start position:0%
with the two Actuarial reports someone
 
00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 align:start position:0%
want to dive into the numbers um
 
00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
essentially these bills are almost
 
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
identical uh the the main substantive
 
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
difference is that the 2025 Bill does
 
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
not have an increase in the maximum
 
00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 align:start position:0%
benefit like the 2023 Bill had um that's
 
00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 align:start position:0%
a very nominal amount of money according
 
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
to the actuary uh we don't have an
 
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
actual Dollar on it yet
 
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 align:start position:0%
um the other uh difference okay doesn't
 
00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 align:start position:0%
have a maximum benefit so what was the
 
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 align:start position:0%
previous maximum benefit was it was like
 
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 align:start position:0%
somebody's salary 100,000 versus they
 
00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
were increasing at
 
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
$5,000 okay and and when it comes to the
 
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
maximum benefit it's higher paid people
 
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
who are going to get close to that not
 
00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 align:start position:0%
not people with long service because
 
00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
group one you got to work 62 years to
 
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
get to 100% which which is the other
 
00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 align:start position:0%
part of the limit right um oh so the
 
00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
limit on is 100% or 125 and you nobody
 
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
ever gets to 100% or not many people
 
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 align:start position:0%
work 62 years it's only 40 if you're if
 
00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 align:start position:0%
you're group two so that's possible we
 
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 align:start position:0%
know the longest serving guy is in the
 
00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 align:start position:0%
50e range
 
00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
right anyway 62 so he has to work
 
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
another 10 years so I mean when we talk
 
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
about the numbers I can point out gotcha
 
00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:25.639 align:start position:0%
uh how little it would be okay go ahead
 
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify when we talk about
 
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 align:start position:0%
the numbers that
 
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.430 align:start position:0%
the numbers that
[Music]

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 align:start position:0%
um the valuation from our actuaries for
 
00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
hb2 is actually the valuation they did
 
00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 align:start position:0%
earlier this year for HB
 
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
727 so HB 727 is the same as hb2 except
 
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
for the maximum benefit part as well and
 
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
we we expect to get it an official
 
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
updated valuation from the actuary uh
 
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
this week is HP 727
 
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
still in progress or do we know it was
 
00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 align:start position:0%
or was this last year you're talking
 
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 align:start position:0%
about it was retained in Ed yeah oh
 
00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:09.319 align:start position:0%
retained okay thank
 
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
you um so the second difference is that
 
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.390 align:start position:0%
you um so the second difference is that
hb2

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
2025 differs from 727 of this year and
 
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 align:start position:0%
from the 2023 bill in that it appears to
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
eliminate uh a limit on extra and
 
00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
special Duty that existed since 200
 
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 align:start position:0%
uh prior to 2011 we think this was a
 
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
scrier error and we want to uh point
 
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
that out we will in our uh fiscal note
 
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
so you think we need to fix this yeah so
 
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
when they B under this bill they're
 
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
bifurcating the definition earnable comp
 
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
between group one and group two so they
 
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
took the section out of the group one
 
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
definition because they don't have
 
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
special Duty I think they just forgot to
 
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
put it back into the group two section
 
00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
because this is not a tier B rule this
 
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
is a tier a rule that limits High three
 
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 align:start position:0%
special duty to the average over year
 
00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:04.919 align:start position:0%
what do you mean by tier B the the
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
different ages of the yeah tier B is the
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
group that's this bill is designed to
 
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:14.120 align:start position:0%
okay Help the people who were not vested
 
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
not yet vested yeah okay fine yeah we we
 
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
call them we have tiers now I see tier a
 
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
is everyone who was vested tier B is
 
00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:24.879 align:start position:0%
everyone who was hired but not vested in
 
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
tier C of people hired after 112
 
00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:32.759 align:start position:0%
gotcha so um so this doesn't help tier C
 
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
this does not help tier C okay okay
 
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
that's new hires which now
 
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
um I don't have new hires as of on or
 
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
after 11
 
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:48.280 align:start position:0%
2012 which oh is getting to be a
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
substantial portion of our total
 
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
membership you know Mr chair 13 years
 
00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:55.759 align:start position:0%
all right represented month could could
 
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
you just could you just go through that
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
one more time the the T a tier B tier C
 
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
all right so in 2011 they they created
 
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
different sets of benefits they didn't
 
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:09.800 align:start position:0%
volunteers then that's a function of our
 
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:11.800 align:start position:0%
new computer system that went into
 
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
effect last year but they referred to
 
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
people who were
 
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
vested at the time the bill went into
 
00:08:20.589 --> 00:08:20.599 align:start position:0%
effect which meant they had 10 years or
 
00:08:20.599 --> 00:08:21.909 align:start position:0%
effect which meant they had 10 years or
more

00:08:21.909 --> 00:08:21.919 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
service that's tier and what was the
 
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:34.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
7111 two sets of dates
 
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
um so that's what we now call tier a
 
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
tier B are people who were hired before
 
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
11112 but did not have 10 years of
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
service so they were not vested so the
 
00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
prior law you'll see speaks in terms of
 
00:08:59.069 --> 00:08:59.079 align:start position:0%
vested by and not vested by and these
 
00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.519 align:start position:0%
chain changes would slowly bring the
 
00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:05.720 align:start position:0%
tier B people back to the tier a level
 
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
of benefits by changing that vested date
 
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
in a series of uh legislative changes
 
00:09:13.949 --> 00:09:13.959 align:start position:0%
over the next 10
 
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
years um uh so that at that point
 
00:09:18.509 --> 00:09:18.519 align:start position:0%
everyone will be back to the tier a
 
00:09:20.069 --> 00:09:20.079 align:start position:0%
benefits they just have to wait until
 
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
their particular
 
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
year is changed so there's a little bit
 
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
of a a retention incentive because if
 
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
you're retired now you get the lower
 
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
benefits but if you wait until the Law
 
00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:31.519 align:start position:0%
changes and for you it's going to change
 
00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
in two years you might stick around and
 
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
get the higher
 
00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
benefits now didn't yeah go ahead and
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
represent tierc of people hired honor
 
00:09:43.829 --> 00:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
2012 Mr chairman yes go it might be
 
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
helpful when Marty was there last year
 
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
before the retirement commission he put
 
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
together a real like onepage sheet with
 
00:09:59.790 --> 00:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
a c the dates the changes which would
 
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
certainly be very helpful I think to our
 
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
newer members because even though some
 
00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
of us have been around here a long time
 
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
it's still confusing of course I think
 
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
if you Pi up or maybe make something new
 
00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
but Marty put
 
00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:14.839 align:start position:0%
together oh okay very good thanks
 
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
because we have 15 pages of this stuff
 
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
now didn't um the house build tube that
 
00:10:22.269 --> 00:10:22.279 align:start position:0%
we passed two years ago from the house
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
didn't that help tier C's or not at all
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
no it didn't it was just tier B you one
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
of its first iterations it may have
 
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
included changing the earnable
 
00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:36.279 align:start position:0%
compensation definition but that's not
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
what passed I see what passed was just
 
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.030 align:start position:0%
what passed I see what passed was just
to

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
be that what passed the house what
 
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
passed the house was and then the from
 
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
the the final version is even less well
 
00:10:53.629 --> 00:10:53.639 align:start position:0%
the final version didn't adopt of hb2 in
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
2023 did not adopt these sets of rules
 
00:10:59.550 --> 00:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chair go ahead represent I believe
 
00:11:01.389 --> 00:11:01.399 align:start position:0%
and representative leean would know
 
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
better than I do the Senate removed the
 
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
provisions that we're discussing and
 
00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
they created a commission to look at
 
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
right to look at the issue they made the
 
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations and then there was a
 
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.629 align:start position:0%
recommendations and then there was a
bill

00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:19.519 align:start position:0%
passed took care of the the bees but not
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
the C's but it was like a $26 million
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
charge to the general
 
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.269 align:start position:0%
charge to the general
fund

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
yeah but he says this is more for the
 
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
bees can I just add a little context to
 
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
that bill so all right Melissa
 
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
representative eel you're correct with
 
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
what you said hb2 House pass version
 
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
similar to this went to the senate
 
00:11:41.069 --> 00:11:41.079 align:start position:0%
senate stripped it out created a
 
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
commission the following year in 2024
 
00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
the house had HB
 
00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:50.959 align:start position:0%
1647 that adjusted the multiplier for
 
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:53.720 align:start position:0%
tier B and tier C I think it was around
 
00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
$56 million price tag it went to the
 
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
Senate the Senate felt that price tag
 
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
was too big with the budget that they
 
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
had so they removed the tier C portion
 
00:12:06.269 --> 00:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
just the tier B multiplier was impacted
 
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
and that was a onetime 26
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
million um cost and that was last year
 
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
HB 1647 and did that affect both group
 
00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:16.959 align:start position:0%
one and group two no this is all group
 
00:12:16.959 --> 00:12:18.430 align:start position:0%
one and group two no this is all group
two

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
okay so uh that was increasing the
 
00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:26.519 align:start position:0%
multiplier for years 16 and forward in a
 
00:12:30.269 --> 00:12:30.279 align:start position:0%
career so not for your first 15 years
 
00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
originally it was 10 years but then the
 
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
Senate they tacked on five more till the
 
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
final version that's what passed that's
 
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
what cost the 26 million
 
00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:42.519 align:start position:0%
was if you work more than 15 years then
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
you multiply it goes up to two and a
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
half% per year for those years after
 
00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
that all right so maybe as a task or I
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
don't know how hard this is but um if
 
00:12:59.590 --> 00:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
you could get the House pass vers of
 
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
1647 and
 
00:13:08.189 --> 00:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
suppose we replaced this with that find
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
is but anyways keep going
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
with okay so um second part of this
 
00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:27.959 align:start position:0%
summary discusses the cost differences
 
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
between the 2020 3 bill and the 2025
 
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
Bill uh we have the two actual
 
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
reports uh and those cost differences
 
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
attributable to several um factors one
 
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.750 align:start position:0%
attributable to several um factors one
is

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
uh current 2025 Bill appropriates $2
 
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
and5 million doll more a year for 10
 
00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
years so that accounts for present value
 
00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
of 25 million not a present value but
 
00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
take that down to what the present value
 
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.150 align:start position:0%
take that down to what the present value
is

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
um in between the two bills we had
 
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
changes in we
 
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
had Actuarial assumptions in in a new
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
experience study and so there were
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
different inflation wage growth
 
00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
assumptions uh in the current valuation
 
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
versus the one done in
 
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
2023 and uh of course logically under
 
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
hb2 the benefit changes would have
 
00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.790 align:start position:0%
hb2 the benefit changes would have
started

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
started
 
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
earlier and so C that increases the cost
 
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
and there are fewer people in that tier
 
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
B now than there was when we priced it
 
00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
out um and and we were using different
 
00:14:48.509 --> 00:14:48.519 align:start position:0%
uh dates based on when legislation was
 
00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:52.279 align:start position:0%
first submitted and what the most recent
 
00:14:56.749 --> 00:14:56.759 align:start position:0%
valuation or closed uh um audited books
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
we had so from one from from
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
63022 to
 
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
63023 uh the number of trb people
 
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
reduced by
 
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
90 well that could be another 90 for the
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
year that's transpired since then we we
 
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
just don't have the Clos book numbers on
 
00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:16.759 align:start position:0%
those uh so those are the factors that
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
taken together give you a difference in
 
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
cost in and if it draw your attention to
 
00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:27.880 align:start position:0%
uh there are two actual reports one from
 
00:15:30.509 --> 00:15:30.519 align:start position:0%
uh 2023
 
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
April 21st you turn to page 16 question
 
00:15:37.629 --> 00:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
I don't be super dense here but where
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
did the 70 people go so now they so they
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
retired yeah or or they might have just
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
terminated or or some something else
 
00:15:51.309 --> 00:15:51.319 align:start position:0%
they're just yeah tier B is yeah can't
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
get bigger can only get smaller get
 
00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:55.399 align:start position:0%
smaller right yeah and and in general
 
00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
when someone retires that's it they they
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
they unless there's is later their their
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
pension at that moment is fixed right so
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so in um you know as as as you
 
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
know there were different ways that we
 
00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:13.240 align:start position:0%
measure costs and one is uh what is the
 
00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:15.959 align:start position:0%
increase in the unfunded Actuarial crude
 
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
liabilities the other is what's the
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
impact on on um contribution rates for
 
00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.629 align:start position:0%
impact on on um contribution rates for
the

00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:27.160 align:start position:0%
employers um the 2023
 
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
Bill assuming the funding of 25 million
 
00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
would have reduced the UA by 68.5
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
million the current bill for 2025 would
 
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
reduce it
 
00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:43.030 align:start position:0%
reduce it
by

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
98.2 so uh the current bill has a
 
00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:50.360 align:start position:0%
has a more beneficial effect on the U
 
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
for the factors discussed in B one
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
through four of my
 
00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:00.279 align:start position:0%
summary um in terms of contribution ions
 
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:07.640 align:start position:0%
were nominal amounts of contribution
 
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
increases 64 to
 
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
75 100s of 1%
 
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
increase the the current bill for 2025
 
00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:21.079 align:start position:0%
would actually show a a
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
3% difference in police reduction and a
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
0.03 increase for fire
 
00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
um so again the 2025 bill is more
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
favorably compared to the other bill but
 
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
they're both not huge numbers uh and
 
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
both of these sets of numbers assume
 
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
that the Appropriations in the
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
legislation will be made for 10
 
00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
years okay and so let's do have a number
 
00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
if they're not made yeah well let's talk
 
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:01.720 align:start position:0%
about that because this says that we're
 
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
going to appropriate 27.5 million per
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
year right but what we see actually in
 
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
house bill one is only 5 million the
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
first year so do you know why that is no
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
I see the shaking
 
00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
hands okay all right does
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
Melissa I think that was based on the
 
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
revenue um estimate from the governor
 
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
VT uh revenue of
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
first year there's not enough coming in
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
the first year there's full amount is
 
00:18:35.909 --> 00:18:35.919 align:start position:0%
coming in 27 so that's why it was only
 
00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
so you haven't really analyzed it with a
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
22 and A5 million shortfall in the first
 
00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:44.799 align:start position:0%
year of payments right we have not yeah
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
you haven't okay uh representative Ms
 
00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh and and please bear with me
 
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
because this is my my first rodeo here
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
um um so you know what what came first
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
the the decision on the am on the amount
 
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
that was going to be appropriated
 
00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
or decisions about what the benefit
 
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
changes would
 
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:14.200 align:start position:0%
be it was all part of for this year what
 
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
now hb2 was HB
 
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
727 which was a piece of legislation
 
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
that came in with the benefit changes
 
00:19:27.149 --> 00:19:27.159 align:start position:0%
and the appropriation in the bill as
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
like I guess I guess what I'm asking was
 
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
was I I guess what I'm trying to
 
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
understand is if you make changes to the
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
the benefit formula which I believe is
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
what is being proposed here that then
 
00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:49.799 align:start position:0%
that then determines what the amount is
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
that you need to the additional amount
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
that you need to
 
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
fund right but we don't or you know was
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
that the process that went through or
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
did somebody say you know what we want
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
to give 25 million or $27.5
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
million they picked a number out of the
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
blue and said that's what we want to
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
contrib additionally we want to
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
contribute and then there and then we
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
kind of backed into what the formula was
 
00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:14.799 align:start position:0%
going to be yeah no no I think there was
 
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
a set of benefit changes there have been
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
multiple attempts at this in the 13
 
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:22.919 align:start position:0%
years since the law first passed uh and
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
so people and the sponsors were quite
 
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
aware of what they were trying to
 
00:20:29.549 --> 00:20:29.559 align:start position:0%
achieve benefit wise I would say and I
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
think the 275 was their best guess of
 
00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:33.919 align:start position:0%
what it would cost based on past years
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
but we didn't put a dollar amount on it
 
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
until the bill was introduced and we got
 
00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note worksheet request and it
 
00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:44.440 align:start position:0%
turns out that the
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
275 if you're going to receive it is
 
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
more than you need to pay for the
 
00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
changes to the tune of $98
 
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
million reduction in her un unfunded
 
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
account so that unfunded liability
 
00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
that's interesting and I missed that I
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
guess so if I'm if I hear what you're
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
saying we could reduce the
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
275 by a certain amount without it
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
impacting the the desire
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
to um make the tier B people
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
whole it would be possible to back into
 
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
a number that said if it if the
 
00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation is X then the UA would be
 
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
unchanged so neutral right now the
 
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.350 align:start position:0%
unchanged so neutral right now the
unfunded

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
liability would go
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
down 98.2 million and and I just excuse
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
me and and and I know that you know
 
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
everyone is very interested in reducing
 
00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:43.559 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability but we're already
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
on a we're already ready on a trajectory
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
to do that um do you have any
 
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
idea how much we could reduce the
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
275 buy and still maintain the desire to
 
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
levelize the benefits have to ask the
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
actu order of
 
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
magnitude five million 10 million like
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
to law school thing the teach is don't
 
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
mess with yeah that's that's that's
 
00:22:14.909 --> 00:22:14.919 align:start position:0%
that's a good that's good advice have to
 
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
rely on the actual all right thank
 
00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.190 align:start position:0%
rely on the actual all right thank
you

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:20.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
um I think I can make a
 
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039 align:start position:0%
guess but if you have an unfunded
 
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
liability of hundred million right the
 
00:22:35.789 --> 00:22:35.799 align:start position:0%
um the payments on it
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
are we we assume 6 and a half% per year
 
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
that it's growing right so so to keep it
 
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
level if we paid in um six and a half
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
say it's 100 million right so if we paid
 
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
in six and a half million a year that
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
would unch the unfunded liability
 
00:22:59.310 --> 00:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change I think right so so
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the number that I think
 
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:07.400 align:start position:0%
is um involved can I yeah can I can I
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
ask another question so I mean if if 275
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
is more than enough to cover the tier
 
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
two people could it also cover the tier
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
one without it having tier one didn't
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
have any benefit changes it didn't no oh
 
00:23:25.269 --> 00:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
so we're just trying to get tier B I
 
00:23:27.549 --> 00:23:27.559 align:start position:0%
think the the objective simply put is to
 
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
get tier B back to where tier eight okay
 
00:23:32.909 --> 00:23:32.919 align:start position:0%
where they would have been which is I I
 
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
thought tier one was was impacted the
 
00:23:39.549 --> 00:23:39.559 align:start position:0%
same way group one group one group one
 
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm sorry yeah thank
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
you yeah I ain't too good with the
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
English that once you go to group one
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
then your your your your Quantum of cost
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
is is way more because it's so much
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
larger okay much much no that that makes
 
00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919 align:start position:0%
sense much bigger so
 
00:23:59.919 --> 00:24:01.470 align:start position:0%
sense much bigger so
how

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
um what does this bill change the
 
00:24:08.669 --> 00:24:08.679 align:start position:0%
definition of final compensation in any
 
00:24:12.909 --> 00:24:12.919 align:start position:0%
way yes yes it would eliminate for the
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
tier be people the current rule that
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
limits the compensation over base that
 
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
we count in calculating your average
 
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
final compensation for the purposes of
 
00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
determining your benefit so we look at
 
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
the compensation over base which
 
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
is special Duty and overtime primarily
 
00:24:35.149 --> 00:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
for group twos it would also include a
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
payout of um well it doesn't right now
 
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
under the new lot would um but so that
 
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.909 align:start position:0%
under the new lot would um but so that
formula

00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
formula
 
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
is we look at your average comp over
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
base for your high five years that your
 
00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:50.799 align:start position:0%
benefits calculated on and then we look
 
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
at the average over your whole career
 
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
and if the whole career average is lower
 
00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
we limit what we count to that lower
 
00:24:59.549 --> 00:24:59.559 align:start position:0%
percentage and this takes that away this
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
takes that away and then it also
 
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
redefines earnable
 
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
compensation so that it includes payout
 
00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
of sick and vacation acrs at the time of
 
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
retirement I see so that is going to
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
boost your final that's spiking that um
 
00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:19.640 align:start position:0%
no I
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
don't call term that people have
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
different meaning for so I'll stay away
 
00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
from it uh it's way the way the law was
 
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
until 2011 we same you know some states
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
count base salary and nothing else we
 
00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
count some right so from my point of
 
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
view this is very dangerous okay just
 
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
for you know discussion
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
purposes I'm I'm okay with changing
 
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
rates I mean the the um the multipliers
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
like we did in I guess according to
 
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
Melissa House Bill
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
1647 but changing the definition of
 
00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.750 align:start position:0%
1647 but changing the definition of
earnable

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
earnable
 
00:25:58.990 --> 00:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
compensation and also
 
00:26:01.789 --> 00:26:01.799 align:start position:0%
I think it's right the way it is all
 
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
right and
 
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
so this that allows a lot more game
 
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
playay and and things like that so this
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
is not something I I would care to go
 
00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
with anyway go ahead represent M so so
 
00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
um so what you're saying is these
 
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
changes to you know final average
 
00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:23.480 align:start position:0%
compensation and all that good stuff
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
that just it gets everything back to the
 
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
way it was prior to 2011
 
00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:31.399 align:start position:0%
we're basically putting back all of the
 
00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:34.120 align:start position:0%
definitions that were in place then so
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
the three parts to it the definition of
 
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:38.799 align:start position:0%
earnable comp by bringing in acrs and
 
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
other things that were excluded yeah um
 
00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
the change in the comp over base rule
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
for average final compensation as well
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
as changing the definition average final
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
compensation to High three not high five
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
so that's going to have oh that's in
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
here too that's in here too I see okay
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
so but all of that was was in place
 
00:27:01.149 --> 00:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
prior that's to everyone had the same
 
00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:03.320 align:start position:0%
benefits we're not we're not going we're
 
00:27:05.789 --> 00:27:05.799 align:start position:0%
not which tier we're not creating some
 
00:27:08.669 --> 00:27:08.679 align:start position:0%
new we're not going into new territory
 
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
no the intent was to restore okay not my
 
00:27:14.789 --> 00:27:14.799 align:start position:0%
intent the sponsor's intent was to
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
restore The Tib people to where they
 
00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
were prior to
 
00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:24.200 align:start position:0%
2011 yeah but so in when we had this
 
00:27:26.669 --> 00:27:26.679 align:start position:0%
rough budget year and maybe even rougher
 
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
than what we have this today
 
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
um in 2011 there was a whole bunch of
 
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
changes made to the retirement system
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
but the particular changes in the
 
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
definition of earnable compensation to
 
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
to reduce or eliminate
 
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
spiking I think were needed regardless
 
00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.039 align:start position:0%
of what the budget was at the time right
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
so so what were what was fixed or
 
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
partially fixed by 1647 changing the
 
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
multiplier you know that you can argue
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
um was not justified and needed to be
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
restored and some of the kind of stuff
 
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
but but what people used to do with
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
their pension is sort of work all kinds
 
00:28:17.789 --> 00:28:17.799 align:start position:0%
of overtime in the last couple of years
 
00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:19.799 align:start position:0%
and and really boost it up because it
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
was only a three-year average now it's a
 
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
five-year average and and also this
 
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
other big part which is looking at the
 
00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
overall average over the career right so
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
it's a little different somebody works
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
in Corrections right now and is working
 
00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.710 align:start position:0%
in Corrections right now and is working
40%

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:37.720 align:start position:0%
40%
 
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
overtime constantly so for their whole
 
00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
career you know it makes sense that
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
their pension gets much higher right but
 
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
somebody who only works in their final
 
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
few years a lot of overtime that doesn't
 
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
really make sense right and so that's
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
what those changes fixed and so to undo
 
00:28:59.279 --> 00:29:00.389 align:start position:0%
what those changes fixed and so to undo
those

00:29:00.389 --> 00:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
things you know I think is wrong so we
 
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to look at this in
 
00:29:06.669 --> 00:29:06.679 align:start position:0%
in a lot more detail did those represent
 
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
did those changes impact tier one t I'm
 
00:29:12.789 --> 00:29:12.799 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm getting my group one no tier a
 
00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
did they did no no so so TI still
 
00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:18.200 align:start position:0%
maintained the
 
00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799 align:start position:0%
three-year yes threee and the definition
 
00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
of arnal right because they were vested
 
00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
right so yes okay
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
that makesense that Mak sense could take
 
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
yeah that makes sense right yeah okay so
 
00:29:35.509 --> 00:29:35.519 align:start position:0%
you see what I mean at the time makes
 
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:41.240 align:start position:0%
sense so but but if we if we if the goal
 
00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.190 align:start position:0%
sense so but but if we if we if the goal
is

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:42.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
to get the tier B back to where they
 
00:29:47.509 --> 00:29:47.519 align:start position:0%
would have
 
00:29:51.509 --> 00:29:51.519 align:start position:0%
been um and and equal to tier
 
00:29:55.149 --> 00:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
a then we well by definition have to
 
00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
make these changes if that's the goal
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
right and I would
 
00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.110 align:start position:0%
right and I would
argue

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
argue
 
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
um that's not really the goal I mean our
 
00:30:08.509 --> 00:30:08.519 align:start position:0%
goal is retention and and recruiting
 
00:30:13.149 --> 00:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
right and so doing something for tier C
 
00:30:15.149 --> 00:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
is more important but that's not but
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
that's not what the governor said in her
 
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:19.640 align:start position:0%
address well she the her goal was to
 
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
restore the benefits for The Tib people
 
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:26.440 align:start position:0%
fine but should that be the legislator's
 
00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.149 align:start position:0%
fine but should that be the legislator's
goal

00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
goal
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
you know I would argue no but okay you
 
00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
know um all right any other questions so
 
00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to read all these
 
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
other yeah all right some of us I guess
 
00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
but but we do have some some uh we we
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
did ask the Edna committee about this
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
and they gave us a bunch of comments
 
00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
some of which are questions so
 
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:03.320 align:start position:0%
um let's uh let's ask these detailed
 
00:31:06.669 --> 00:31:06.679 align:start position:0%
questions so
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
um first of first response from medna so
 
00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
they said um definition new definition
 
00:31:12.399 --> 00:31:13.269 align:start position:0%
they said um definition new definition
of

00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
vested so so they say
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
um it's adds a new requirement that the
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
pension calculations shall not be
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
reduced after 3 years of service oh so
 
00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.070 align:start position:0%
reduced after 3 years of service oh so
so

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:34.629 --> 00:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
um let's look at so so this is in um
 
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
let's look at the page and House Bill
 
00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:40.360 align:start position:0%
too yes repres could we get copies of
 
00:31:42.269 --> 00:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
that I mean I had it on my
 
00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
computer yeah it would great to follow
 
00:31:48.629 --> 00:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
along with you yes all right so let's
 
00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:52.360 align:start position:0%
look for this this is uh RSA 100a colon
 
00:31:54.669 --> 00:31:54.679 align:start position:0%
one section
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
38 very first provision so that's on
 
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
page 25 yes okay so right so it's on
 
00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.350 align:start position:0%
page 25 yes okay so right so it's on
page

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
25 um section
 
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
27 um so shall not be reduced after
 
00:32:18.509 --> 00:32:18.519 align:start position:0%
three years of service right so what
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
this is is a direction to Future
 
00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:25.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
RSA all right so this has no effect
 
00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:31.480 align:start position:0%
right because if if you want to tell
 
00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
legislator something to do you got to
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
put it in the
 
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution you can't really put it in
 
00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
the law and so you know I would tend to
 
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
say section 25 is
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
is has no
 
00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
no serious effect precatory as we say
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
yeah okay all right so possibly we'll
 
00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:05.629 --> 00:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
um okay all right now next one
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
um the the um the next section no it's
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
um page 29 line 19 see she worked they
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
worked off of the old one so so our line
 
00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:20.200 align:start position:0%
numbers are no longer yeah they're
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
working off HB 727 because that's the
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
bill that was in place when we committed
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
so this is um XV uh section
 
00:33:32.269 --> 00:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
18 uh
 
00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:35.240 align:start position:0%
XVI 17 that's a definition of earnable
 
00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
compensation well it says deletes anti-s
 
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
spiking provision limiting extra and
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
special duty pay in the highest years to
 
00:33:46.509 --> 00:33:46.519 align:start position:0%
average percentages over the
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
career uh well that's mixing two things
 
00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:54.190 align:start position:0%
career uh well that's mixing two things
together

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
um that's that's see using the word
 
00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:00.559 align:start position:0%
special duty but that's describing the
 
00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
coov rule which is high high five
 
00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:09.560 align:start position:0%
to total career average for special Duty
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
and overtime and anything else that
 
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
counts as comp over base the special
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
Duty rule which applies currently only
 
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
to tier a is if your average in your
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
high three is more than your average in
 
00:34:21.629 --> 00:34:21.639 align:start position:0%
your high seven since the law passed in
 
00:34:24.669 --> 00:34:24.679 align:start position:0%
2009 will limit you to the high seven so
 
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
there similar
 
00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
objectives operate differently apply to
 
00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:30.389 align:start position:0%
objectives operate differently apply to
different

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
groups um this bill
 
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
would eliminate the compensation over
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
base rule for tier B and revert them to
 
00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
the pre-existing rule that currently
 
00:34:45.629 --> 00:34:45.639 align:start position:0%
applies to tier only which is just a
 
00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
limit on special
 
00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
Duty High three versus high seven for
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
average of seven right so what they're
 
00:34:56.829 --> 00:34:56.839 align:start position:0%
saying is that what they're saying is
 
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
that it's making a change for tier
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
a well that's that's my point in a too
 
00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
is was that intended or is that a scrier
 
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
eror I see I see because when you look
 
00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
at it in the bill especially in hb2 it's
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
removed from the definition that would
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
be applicable to group one in the very
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
next section is the definition for group
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
two and I think someone just said wait
 
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
they forgot to put it in that section oh
 
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
this is your number two yeah because if
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
the intent of of this bill is to rectify
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
the tier B changes then why are they
 
00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
changing the tier a law that existed
 
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
since prior to 2011 so I'm just deducing
 
00:35:40.349 --> 00:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
it's a scrier there and that's what they
 
00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
mean okay and our current valuation with
 
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
the actuary we told them to assume it
 
00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
was a mistake and and can we notice
 
00:35:50.589 --> 00:35:50.599 align:start position:0%
where in House Bill 2 that
 
00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
is at the bottom of page
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
25 let's see you right where the group
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
one definition ends
 
00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
um for earnable
 
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
compensation so it would be
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh oh page 26 the crossed out section
 
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:14.599 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the cross down and then it
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
what it should have been is added to the
 
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:19.720 align:start position:0%
section I believe right after
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
that okay where it starts the uh I
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
believe it's lines five six and seven
 
00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
section d i subsection D which would be
 
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
the the new definition it should go into
 
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.270 align:start position:0%
the the new definition it should go into
section

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:36:44.069 --> 00:36:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
is all right but anyways that's the
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
that's the um we'll point it out in the
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal note worksheet
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
okay okay so that's your number two
 
00:36:59.710 --> 00:36:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
nhrs number two okay the next thing they
 
00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.109 align:start position:0%
nhrs number two okay the next thing they
say

00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:37:08.589 --> 00:37:08.599 align:start position:0%
is um the annuity multiplier for
 
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
creditable service changes but is not a
 
00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
change um is not a change but its
 
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
current law it was passed in 2023 and
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
time um sections 30 to 31
 
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:33.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
all so that speaking to the changes last
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
year that increased the multiplier to
 
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
2.5 for member um for members who work
 
00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
more than 15 years so for years of
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
service higher than 15 so this bill is
 
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
going to eventually get everyone to 2.5
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
for their whole career so there's
 
00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
there's overlap there
 
00:38:00.589 --> 00:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
in that part of to the extent you're
 
00:38:02.589 --> 00:38:02.599 align:start position:0%
working over 15 years and you're just
 
00:38:04.109 --> 00:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
talking about the multiplier that part's
 
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
already been fixed last year and and
 
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
paid for with the 26
 
00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.430 align:start position:0%
paid for with the 26
million

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
um so valuation by our act this year was
 
00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.390 align:start position:0%
um so valuation by our act this year was
to

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
compare what this bill would do which
 
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
would give them the 2.5 for the years
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
one through
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
15 taking in consideration that the bill
 
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
last year already gave him 15 16 and and
 
00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
over uh another reason that I didn't put
 
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
on this that I just thought of
 
00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:37.240 align:start position:0%
why 25 Bill cost less than the 23 bill
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
because the 23 bill was restoring 2.5
 
00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
for all years including over 15 because
 
00:38:51.069 --> 00:38:51.079 align:start position:0%
HB 1647 hadn't passed yet so in 23 so
 
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
that's another reason that accounts for
 
00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
why 23 was more
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
expensive by because current law has
 
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
changed law on the inter change and has
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
already fixed the multiplier for year 16
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
I right right right so this is changing
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
the multiplier for years below 50
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
effectively yes doesn't say that but
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
effectively that's the I I see okay good
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
okay representative M yes so that meliss
 
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
um what Mr kavana was just speaking of
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
that would be the one comparison I think
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's similar to
 
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
1647 house past version
 
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:30.200 align:start position:0%
right in the sense that it was they
 
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to do 10 years in the House pass
 
00:39:36.069 --> 00:39:36.079 align:start position:0%
version um but what was passed by the
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
Senate was 15 correct so they increased
 
00:39:42.109 --> 00:39:42.119 align:start position:0%
it ah so you had asked what the diff
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
this compared to 1647 house passed was
 
00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
and that's the area in that area yeah
 
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah now did House Bill 1647 affect
 
00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:55.079 align:start position:0%
Group C I mean tier C or no so the House
 
00:39:58.430 --> 00:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
pass version did 10 10 years for the
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
multiplier 10 years forward it adjusted
 
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
the multiplier to half% and it did tier
 
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
B and tier C what passed was 15 years
 
00:40:09.069 --> 00:40:09.079 align:start position:0%
for tier B only gotcha and that was the
 
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
that price difference from the 53
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
million to the 26 million noted on the
 
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
last sheet of paper that I just handed
 
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
out but okay um just for comparison
 
00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
that's the only overlap I believe that's
 
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
in hb2 as you see compared to 1647 mhmh
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
the rest is all different
 
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:31.640 align:start position:0%
than 1647 now on your paper when you say
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
UA impact is that a one time or is I
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
guess that is a one time right yeah
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
that's uh that element of the cost
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
estimate is how much it goes up or down
 
00:40:47.309 --> 00:40:47.319 align:start position:0%
for benefits that are or are not funded
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
at the time of the legislation I see the
 
00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:53.720 align:start position:0%
other cost aspect are the the impact on
 
00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:55.640 align:start position:0%
contributions which are going to be
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
ongoing every year
 
00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
right I see so so this is a good
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go back and revisit this
 
00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
1647 um and put
 
00:41:12.109 --> 00:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
it put the force of House Bill 2 behind
 
00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
it right as opposed to
 
00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
okay yeah well I mean there's already
 
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:19.910 align:start position:0%
okay yeah well I mean there's already
the

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
money in is some money for it I mean
 
00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
anyway okay good so the next thing they
 
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
say is um I guess that's it for retire
 
00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.190 align:start position:0%
say is um I guess that's it for retire
for

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
this right now there were there's a
 
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
couple of other Provisions in House Bill
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
2 that are about
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
retirement um so let me look for those 1
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
150 and
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
151 which deal with reclassification of
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
a couple of positions at
 
00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
safety one for
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste something or other and
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
the other for Deputy policy person okay
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
why don't that's actually not on our
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
list oh uh because we're that's group
 
00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:13.839 align:start position:0%
two that's division two um but we might
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
as well talk about them since it's if
 
00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
it's involves
 
00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
you um but no I was thinking about um
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
section 142 on page
 
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
62 which dates what I don't have it says
 
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
that accounting unit 1051 is
 
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
non-aps don't don't know what that
 
00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
means okay but it's titled New Hampshire
 
00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:41.829 align:start position:0%
means okay but it's titled New Hampshire
retirement

00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:41.839 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
00:42:44.349 --> 00:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
system correct
 
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
but okay do we know what Accounting in
 
00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:58.030 --> 00:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
1051 well look if you want to just give
 
00:42:59.950 --> 00:42:59.960 align:start position:0%
us a
 
00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:05.109 align:start position:0%
us a
second

00:43:05.109 --> 00:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
okay so that looks like it's the
 
00:43:08.829 --> 00:43:08.839 align:start position:0%
administration of the New Hampshire
 
00:43:08.839 --> 00:43:11.670 align:start position:0%
administration of the New Hampshire
retirement

00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
budget what is what it is okay so I
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
think sorry we're we're catching up a
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
little bit so I'm assuming Mr chair that
 
00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
is where that appropri appropriation
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
is I'm going to quote appropriation for
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
the V for this retirement hb2 retirement
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
um monies so I'm assuming putting that
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
in there so it doesn't because they
 
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
added it the five and the 28 or whatever
 
00:43:48.109 --> 00:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
they don't want it to lapse out I get it
 
00:43:50.589 --> 00:43:50.599 align:start position:0%
okay so it is related I guess okay and I
 
00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
would just point out again I think I
 
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
said it in the last meeting um the
 
00:43:58.270 --> 00:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
language or the the money for this bill
 
00:44:00.069 --> 00:44:00.079 align:start position:0%
show up in two places they show up in
 
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
hb1 under that accounting unit for 1051
 
00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
which is on the page 155 and
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
156 of hb1 and then they also show up it
 
00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
also shows up in hb2 so it is pulling
 
00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:17.480 align:start position:0%
twice so as the division we do need to
 
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
remove it preferably probably from hb1
 
00:44:22.109 --> 00:44:22.119 align:start position:0%
this isn't one that's typically in hp1
 
00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
the appropriation would be in hb2 so we
 
00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
just need to make sure we do remove
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
those okay all right and then and this
 
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
language if we take it out of one and
 
00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
there's the whole connection to the
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
lottery business right you know so
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
that's so Mr cin I and I were speaking
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
of this yesterday so there's a finding
 
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
in HB uh to where the appropriation Jack
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
got page um that
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
says the the governor the legislature
 
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
will want to use BLT Revenue to pay for
 
00:44:59.150 --> 00:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
the retirement however within the bill
 
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
the appropriation is coming from the
 
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
general fund so there is no tie to the
 
00:45:08.589 --> 00:45:08.599 align:start position:0%
VT Revenue to the retirement payment
 
00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:11.480 align:start position:0%
except to the extent that 45 um a
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
certain percentage I don't want to say
 
00:45:15.549 --> 00:45:15.559 align:start position:0%
45% if that's not right a certain
 
00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:17.839 align:start position:0%
percentage of the BLT Revenue will flow
 
00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:19.839 align:start position:0%
to the general fund and then I think the
 
00:45:22.109 --> 00:45:22.119 align:start position:0%
assumption is that money then flows
 
00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
through the retirement but there is
 
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
nothing in law that's stating the VT
 
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue will pay for the retirement
 
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:32.200 align:start position:0%
there's just a finding statement which
 
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
um statement of intent whoever said it
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
yes statement of intent if that's
 
00:45:41.349 --> 00:45:41.359 align:start position:0%
helpful okay I get it but um I I can
 
00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:43.640 align:start position:0%
just tell you that the plans of division
 
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
two are to take any VT Revenue if there
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
is any and put it in the education trust
 
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
fund just so that there's no argument
 
00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
about you know Lottery money not going
 
00:45:59.069 --> 00:45:59.079 align:start position:0%
to to education right and then they're
 
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
going to adjust other monies going into
 
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund to make it come
 
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:07.400 align:start position:0%
out right so yeah so to that point if
 
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
that was done that still would not
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
impact this retirement funding because
 
00:46:13.589 --> 00:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
the appropriation just says just say
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
general f okay we've assumed the number
 
00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
will be zero that we receive from vat
 
00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
okay and then you wouldn't need this
 
00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:24.710 align:start position:0%
okay and then you wouldn't need this
non-lps

00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
non-lps
 
00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
33 million or something is
 
00:47:04.349 --> 00:47:04.359 align:start position:0%
it I think yes in one level uh on the
 
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
second level I think the numbers that
 
00:47:08.069 --> 00:47:08.079 align:start position:0%
you've already received from Mike Kane
 
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
already removed that devil counting oh
 
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
okay well we'll see all right um the the
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
other one let's see to talk
 
00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:24.270 align:start position:0%
other one let's see to talk
about

00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:32.559 align:start position:0%
where's my
 
00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
um one ah here it
 
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:47.069 --> 00:47:47.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
72 okay there's a couple of sections of
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 that strike me as a really
 
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
big deal you know the the executive
 
00:47:58.990 --> 00:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
brand kind of grabbing a a whole bunch
 
00:48:02.109 --> 00:48:02.119 align:start position:0%
of power that we don't normally give
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
them and so um this is one of them and
 
00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:07.109 align:start position:0%
them and so um this is one of them and
this

00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:09.880 align:start position:0%
is um section
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
177 on page
 
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
72 so it it says here after exhausting
 
00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
any relevant appeal process state
 
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
agencies may use
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
funds um from an existing class 60 or
 
00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
any other Pro apprpriate budget class to
 
00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
pay penalties fines interests or other
 
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
costs imposed on the state of New
 
00:48:35.069 --> 00:48:35.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by the New Hampshire
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
retirement system or by the IRS relating
 
00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
to employer payments reporting and
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
audits so do you know what this is about
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
penalties fines and interests and other
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
costs imposed by the New Hampshire
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
describe what kind of penalties cost and
 
00:48:57.150 --> 00:48:57.160 align:start position:0%
interests we impose for employers I
 
00:48:59.309 --> 00:48:59.319 align:start position:0%
don't know what was intended by putting
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
that in or the IRS I mean is the IRS
 
00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:04.520 align:start position:0%
well the
 
00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
IRS I have my Ms along law taxation but
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
I can't speak for the IR yeah right okay
 
00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
they have trouble speaking for
 
00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
themselves gotcha so our employers are
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
required to report every month and if
 
00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
they're late we can assess a
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
penalty 1% pen
 
00:49:27.599 --> 00:49:28.589 align:start position:0%
penalty 1% pen
if

00:49:28.589 --> 00:49:28.599 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:49:32.589 --> 00:49:32.599 align:start position:0%
they withhold money from a paycheck and
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
forget to give it to us they could pay
 
00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:37.960 align:start position:0%
one% per month penalty
 
00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
interest anytime they pay something late
 
00:49:41.789 --> 00:49:41.799 align:start position:0%
it's just regular
 
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
interest so if we were to discover on
 
00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:47.480 align:start position:0%
audit that they forgot entirely to even
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
report or withheld hold from someone's
 
00:49:52.349 --> 00:49:52.359 align:start position:0%
then we would say okay here's what you
 
00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
should have withheld and we would build
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
a member for that with interest and we'd
 
00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
build the employer for their share of
 
00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:01.240 align:start position:0%
the contribution with interest so uh
 
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's those are the penalties in
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
there's also uh penalties daily
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
penalties of 25 or
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
$250 a day for not reporting information
 
00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to report to us that
 
00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
was uh intended the interest and other
 
00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
penalties are more for economic reasons
 
00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
time value of money these daily ones are
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
kind of a sword to make you do because
 
00:50:26.789 --> 00:50:26.799 align:start position:0%
we had employers who just were ignoring
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
our requests for information so one
 
00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:31.960 align:start position:0%
applies to retire reporting other
 
00:50:34.349 --> 00:50:34.359 align:start position:0%
replies to applies to just general
 
00:50:36.109 --> 00:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
request for information like when we're
 
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
doing an audit but is the state as an
 
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
employer are they being getting are they
 
00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:43.480 align:start position:0%
getting these kind of penalties and
 
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
fines um I mean I can see interest maybe
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
if it's yeah yeah well we work closely
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
with with uh Das payroll and Carolyn
 
00:50:56.069 --> 00:50:56.079 align:start position:0%
Boyd and her staff to avoid penalties
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
and and it it's not common that we would
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
charge them a penalty they have a they
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
have a fairly sophisticated centralized
 
00:51:05.789 --> 00:51:05.799 align:start position:0%
payroll system and and they do a good
 
00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
job at that so um occasionally when
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
they're late you know we we'll
 
00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
wave the the penalty or interest because
 
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
it it was late by a week for some reason
 
00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
uh that's reasonable I see there there
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
is a reasonable good cause exception um
 
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
where we see more penalty in interest
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
with small political unsophisticated
 
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
political subdivision employers who just
 
00:51:33.789 --> 00:51:33.799 align:start position:0%
don't have the staff or that's what I
 
00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
would think anyway representative rang
 
00:51:37.789 --> 00:51:37.799 align:start position:0%
did you have a question he just oh okay
 
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
um I guess from your point of view
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
having this particular
 
00:51:52.829 --> 00:51:52.839 align:start position:0%
section doesn't really yeah it's just
 
00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:56.200 align:start position:0%
okay just who pays us yeah it's I I
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
viewed it that's just an accounting
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
thing so Melissa do we have a way of
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
asking the governor's office why they
 
00:52:03.789 --> 00:52:03.799 align:start position:0%
put this particular one
 
00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
in y we can ask them we've sent a couple
 
00:52:08.829 --> 00:52:08.839 align:start position:0%
out already to um commissioner Arling
 
00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:11.240 align:start position:0%
house and CC the governor's office so
 
00:52:12.589 --> 00:52:12.599 align:start position:0%
this will be one of them that will put
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
in there as well good all right um do we
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
know of anything else related to
 
00:52:21.549 --> 00:52:21.559 align:start position:0%
retirement just the two position changes
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to mention them there oh
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
yes um there are two positions at safety
 
00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
that they wanted to allow a member a
 
00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
person who took that position to be in
 
00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
group two if they were coming from a
 
00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:38.440 align:start position:0%
group two position or were a group two
 
00:52:41.069 --> 00:52:41.079 align:start position:0%
retiree and they wanted to take this job
 
00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
and maintain group two level benefits
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
because one of them's a policy position
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
and the other one's a hazardous
 
00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:50.200 align:start position:0%
management hazardous waste management
 
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
type position and neither one of neither
 
00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:54.559 align:start position:0%
one of them qualified for the the the
 
00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
core definition of group two because
 
00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
then not exposed to the hazards of
 
00:52:59.630 --> 00:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
firefighting or police work I you're
 
00:53:02.349 --> 00:53:02.359 align:start position:0%
saying so and the policy position is
 
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
optional so that could if that's a
 
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
retire he's not going to opt in he's
 
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
going to take the pension and the pay
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
the other position is mandatory but if
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's someone coming from a group to
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
position or someone who had retired from
 
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
a group two position they would be
 
00:53:19.549 --> 00:53:19.559 align:start position:0%
required to join but they could be a
 
00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
group two member that means for that
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
person's salary the state's going to pay
 
00:53:27.069 --> 00:53:27.079 align:start position:0%
the higher group to employer rate
 
00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
but you're only talking about one
 
00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
position one salary I understand tell me
 
00:53:34.789 --> 00:53:34.799 align:start position:0%
the the sections again 150 and 151 so
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's on page
 
00:53:40.829 --> 00:53:40.839 align:start position:0%
63 63 starts at the bottom the last send
 
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:42.799 align:start position:0%
is on the bottom and then it goes to
 
00:53:42.799 --> 00:53:46.230 align:start position:0%
is on the bottom and then it goes to
64

00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:52.510 --> 00:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:10.829 --> 00:54:10.839 align:start position:0%
I see so this is this is a
 
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:13.240 align:start position:0%
recruitment yeah yeah based thing and
 
00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
it's similar for instance to um group
 
00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:19.640 align:start position:0%
two firefighters who go to work as
 
00:54:22.589 --> 00:54:22.599 align:start position:0%
instructors at the uh fire academy
 
00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to stay in group too
 
00:54:26.349 --> 00:54:26.359 align:start position:0%
even though they're not out getting on
 
00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
Tru and fight fires regularly MH um and
 
00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
the same thing for the for the police
 
00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:33.720 align:start position:0%
academy police standards there a similar
 
00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:35.720 align:start position:0%
rule it says if you're coming from group
 
00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
two you can stay in group two even
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
though this really isn't so this is
 
00:54:42.309 --> 00:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
section 152 on page
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
64 yeah that's that's the the the second
 
00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
P it's um second uh chief of policy and
 
00:54:53.069 --> 00:54:53.079 align:start position:0%
planning yes yes yeah
 
00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
um as long ases six seven years ago they
 
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
were ask
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
that group to and I said it takes
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
legislation so I think it is finally
 
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
getting around all right represent thank
 
00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:07.160 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair so on that position so what
 
00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:08.799 align:start position:0%
I'm reading is that if the person
 
00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
retired in group two okay so they're on
 
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
retirement they can come into this
 
00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
position as a group two now how does
 
00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:19.559 align:start position:0%
that affect their retirement benefits it
 
00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
would stop okay so they'd stop receiving
 
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
retirement and then would acrew but they
 
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
addition service credit and then re
 
00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
retire based on the new length of
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
service so okay so so so that retirement
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
from their pre first group two position
 
00:55:39.549 --> 00:55:39.559 align:start position:0%
ends they assume the full-time position
 
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
it know it it actually doesn't even have
 
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
to be full-time right uh no it has to be
 
00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
oh okay so it has to group two
 
00:55:47.549 --> 00:55:47.559 align:start position:0%
definition is fulltime so they they now
 
00:55:50.309 --> 00:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
start this new position and they still
 
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
have to acrw the vested years or is that
 
00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:55.480 align:start position:0%
credited or it's just the benefit amount
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
it's we treat has a small break and
 
00:56:00.309 --> 00:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
serve active service for okay so you
 
00:56:01.789 --> 00:56:01.799 align:start position:0%
everything that you did before is still
 
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
on your record I got you and then we
 
00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
just add additional service so one of
 
00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:07.240 align:start position:0%
these positions is mandatory so if
 
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
someone took that position they'd have
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
to join and if they were a retiree the
 
00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:13.400 align:start position:0%
pension would stop the other Poli policy
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
position I believe is not mandatory it's
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
optional and therefore that person could
 
00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
um decide to keep the receiving their
 
00:56:25.470 --> 00:56:25.480 align:start position:0%
pension and their salary so it's it's
 
00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit different in an
 
00:56:28.589 --> 00:56:28.599 align:start position:0%
optional position because most of the
 
00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:31.480 align:start position:0%
state's optional positions are officials
 
00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
appointed for fixed terms where the term
 
00:56:37.549 --> 00:56:37.559 align:start position:0%
is expressed in in an enabling statute
 
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
that the governor nominates and and the
 
00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:43.240 align:start position:0%
executive Council uh um
 
00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
approves and the person can only be
 
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
removed for cause under the after a
 
00:56:50.109 --> 00:56:50.119 align:start position:0%
hearing through the executive counil
 
00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:51.640 align:start position:0%
this position just
 
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
gives Department of fire safety ability
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
to hire that person at a ra employee and
 
00:56:58.789 --> 00:56:58.799 align:start position:0%
make them exempt without the fixed term
 
00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
officials and fixed term officials are
 
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
your Commissioners you Commissioners you
 
00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
know are both of these positions
 
00:57:08.109 --> 00:57:08.119 align:start position:0%
unclassified or not I believe they state
 
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
that they're one is UN I believe it
 
00:57:13.789 --> 00:57:13.799 align:start position:0%
states that they're unclassified okay at
 
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
the beginning but some unclass the first
 
00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
one classified I'm sorry so you're
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
saying that for some unclassified
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
positions participation in the
 
00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:27.160 align:start position:0%
retirement system is optional right but
 
00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
classified but for some it's not correct
 
00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
majority of unclassified well no
 
00:57:35.109 --> 00:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
unclassified if you're not collecting
 
00:57:36.910 --> 00:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
the pension
 
00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
unclassified is optional okay once you
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
start collecting the pension it's only
 
00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
optional if you're a fixed term official
 
00:57:46.789 --> 00:57:46.799 align:start position:0%
I see what you're saying so okay young
 
00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
people who are in unclassified positions
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
have the choice do I want to join or do
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
I not and according to my discussions of
 
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
dop about 90% do join
 
00:58:00.309 --> 00:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
okay um even though they don't have to
 
00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:01.640 align:start position:0%
maybe they came from other departments
 
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
or they have other governmental Services
 
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
they want to keep it going right and
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
okay um what happens to a a retired
 
00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
group two member who takes a full-time
 
00:58:18.029 --> 00:58:18.039 align:start position:0%
job that's group one well then they
 
00:58:18.039 --> 00:58:19.150 align:start position:0%
job that's group one well then they
would

00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
retire when ending that group one
 
00:58:27.789 --> 00:58:27.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
retiree we would calculate their benefit
 
00:58:33.549 --> 00:58:33.559 align:start position:0%
in two parts the group two part based on
 
00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
the multipliers and the years of service
 
00:58:37.630 --> 00:58:37.640 align:start position:0%
in the group one p we combine them but
 
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
the big difference is under our
 
00:58:43.029 --> 00:58:43.039 align:start position:0%
administrative rules uh it states that
 
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
when you are a split benefit and that's
 
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:47.480 align:start position:0%
what we call these people you receive
 
00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
any ancillary
 
00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:52.280 align:start position:0%
benefits that are applicable to the
 
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
group you're in when you retire so for a
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
group two the main thing is under RSA
 
00:59:02.109 --> 00:59:02.119 align:start position:0%
a12 where they get a 50% survivorship
 
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
annuity for their spouse that they don't
 
00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
have to pay for so if you're split
 
00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:07.480 align:start position:0%
benefit your group two and then you
 
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
retire in group one you lose that free
 
00:59:11.470 --> 00:59:11.480 align:start position:0%
benefit and you have to now if you want
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
to give that 50% to your wife you can
 
00:59:16.069 --> 00:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
now pay for it most group twos they pay
 
00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
for 50 and they get the other 50 for
 
00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:21.839 align:start position:0%
free uh the one you pay for is under a13
 
00:59:25.630 --> 00:59:25.640 align:start position:0%
one that's free is under a12 um that's 5
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
to 7 % reduction in your maximum benefit
 
00:59:30.510 --> 00:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
to pay for that
 
00:59:34.829 --> 00:59:34.839 align:start position:0%
50% um and and so it's significant you'd
 
00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:36.839 align:start position:0%
also lose the medical subsidy benefit if
 
00:59:38.829 --> 00:59:38.839 align:start position:0%
you were eligible for it but there were
 
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
fewer and fewer people eligible for that
 
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
because you had to be in group one on
 
00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:45.640 align:start position:0%
June 30th 2000 so you know almost 25
 
00:59:47.950 --> 00:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
years ago so there are some people there
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
are you know quite a few but it's it's
 
00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
so there's a big disincentive for people
 
00:59:54.029 --> 00:59:54.039 align:start position:0%
to do what we just talk about yes well
 
00:59:57.390 --> 00:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
the other rule the other thing is that
 
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
um the coob rule for group twos Compares
 
01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:03.640 align:start position:0%
high five to whole career for group ones
 
01:00:07.029 --> 01:00:07.039 align:start position:0%
it Compares high five to rest of career
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
so if you're spiking it's not rolling
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
those numbers into the rest of the
 
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
career Gap understand so we we have a a
 
01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
real example where uh uh a group two did
 
01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of overtime towards the end of his
 
01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
career the haircut under the and then he
 
01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
he um he took a group two job a group
 
01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
one job for a couple of months so we
 
01:00:33.069 --> 01:00:33.079 align:start position:0%
said well the group one formula that
 
01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:35.480 align:start position:0%
formula allowed 25% of all that overtime
 
01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:37.880 align:start position:0%
to be counted the group two formula
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
would have allowed
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
65% so that is another significant
 
01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:45.640 align:start position:0%
difference if you are if the if if
 
01:00:47.549 --> 01:00:47.559 align:start position:0%
you're implicated by the cob rule by a
 
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
lot of overtime or special duty at the
 
01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
end of your
 
01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
career so those are the three impacts of
 
01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.390 align:start position:0%
career so those are the three impacts of
okay

01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:00:58.109 --> 01:00:58.119 align:start position:0%
that sounds like something more
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
complicated than we can fix in the
 
01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
budget okay do you know what the cost of
 
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
these two sections is for these two
 
01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.549 align:start position:0%
these two sections is for these two
particular

01:01:05.549 --> 01:01:05.559 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
people di Minimus it's I see it's a
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
different the state will be paying the
 
01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
group two employer rate of I think what
 
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
31% versus the group one employer rate
 
01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:24.589 align:start position:0%
31% versus the group one employer rate
of

01:01:24.589 --> 01:01:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
17 14 14 I don't know what the top of my
 
01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
head but um 14 maybe or something yeah
 
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
so the state's going to pay a little
 
01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
more on the employer contributions for
 
01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:38.440 align:start position:0%
that those two positions whatever that
 
01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
salary is okay and and and the member
 
01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
would also pay P the higher member
 
01:01:48.829 --> 01:01:48.839 align:start position:0%
contributions 11.5 versus 7 I see I see
 
01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
um but in terms of cost of the state
 
01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
you're just looking at the differential
 
01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:54.680 align:start position:0%
in the contribution rates for those two
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
positions what they're pay
 
01:02:01.789 --> 01:02:01.799 align:start position:0%
yeah but it's 10% or something for no
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah okay all right it makes some
 
01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.190 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah okay all right it makes some
all

01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.950 align:start position:0%
all
right

01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:02:14.589 --> 01:02:14.599 align:start position:0%
great any other things we can
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
think no no all right thank you very
 
01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
much thank you thank you all right yeah
 
01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
represent M okay um just one question um
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
how long is it how long does it take for
 
01:02:31.549 --> 01:02:31.559 align:start position:0%
you to do a an Actuarial Actuarial
 
01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:35.240 align:start position:0%
estimate of um you know kind of a a
 
01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
final final formula that we may come up
 
01:02:41.589 --> 01:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
with you about a week's turnaround okay
 
01:02:44.549 --> 01:02:44.559 align:start position:0%
with the actuary I there have been other
 
01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
times where we've rushed it through
 
01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
because legislature had deadlines to
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
meet and last minute changes especially
 
01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:54.440 align:start position:0%
on the floor oh can you do this
 
01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
overnight sometimes if it's a minor
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
change you know if they're got to do a
 
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
full evaluation that's going to take
 
01:03:02.589 --> 01:03:02.599 align:start position:0%
them long yeah and and the real Focus I
 
01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:05.000 align:start position:0%
think would be you know if we made any
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
changes to what's being proposed in
 
01:03:09.789 --> 01:03:09.799 align:start position:0%
terms of the the formula what would the
 
01:03:12.670 --> 01:03:12.680 align:start position:0%
annual uh contribution requirement for
 
01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
last year when when when HB 647 went
 
01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:19.720 align:start position:0%
over to the Senate and everyone's you
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
know hesitated at the price tag we did a
 
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
supplemental valuation with the lower
 
01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
benefit amounts and and that was
 
01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
performed fairly quickly but depends the
 
01:03:32.589 --> 01:03:32.599 align:start position:0%
cont typically it's it's a
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
week yeah and we and we'd also need to
 
01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:37.480 align:start position:0%
have a copy of the amendment so we can
 
01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:39.880 align:start position:0%
give that provide that to the actuary so
 
01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
representative Ms I just want to clarify
 
01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
a couple of things so for any Actuarial
 
01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:46.599 align:start position:0%
analysis that goes to the
 
01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:49.640 align:start position:0%
retirement um per the law has to be an
 
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
amendment because we actually they bill
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
us for that cost of because they ship it
 
01:03:56.029 --> 01:03:56.039 align:start position:0%
out to an actuary so they B the
 
01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
legislature for the cost of those so it
 
01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
what goes to them can't just be an email
 
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
or can't just be what if what if it has
 
01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
to be an official Amendment just because
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:15.269 --> 01:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:15.279 --> 01:04:16.870 align:start position:0%
 
hypotheticals

01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
hypotheticals
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
okay um we're done yeah thank you thank
 
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
you very
 
01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
much um so we want to continue continue
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
with House Bill 2 things I was thinking
 
01:04:29.789 --> 01:04:29.799 align:start position:0%
maybe we could just keep going with the
 
01:04:33.549 --> 01:04:33.559 align:start position:0%
Edna comments while we while we're on
 
01:04:38.109 --> 01:04:38.119 align:start position:0%
them um the the next one
 
01:04:38.119 --> 01:04:39.670 align:start position:0%
them um the the next one
is

01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:04:43.829 --> 01:04:43.839 align:start position:0%
um section 10 Board of tax and land
 
01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
appeals um these things uh just just
 
01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.470 align:start position:0%
appeals um these things uh just just
seem

01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:49.480 align:start position:0%
seem
 
01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
like reasonably good
 
01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
ideas um so we're on page let
 
01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
43 yeah so I mean this is
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
um a little bit of of flexibility in
 
01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:26.799 align:start position:0%
hiring and um all so on how that they
 
01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
can can conduct hearings by U electronic
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
means right so I don't see anything any
 
01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
big deal with
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
those so when they came in they were
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
having trouble hiring an appraiser yeah
 
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
because the private sector was offering
 
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:55.269 --> 01:05:55.279 align:start position:0%
yeah any any objections to these
 
01:05:55.279 --> 01:05:56.510 align:start position:0%
yeah any any objections to these
sections

01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
sections
 
01:05:59.870 --> 01:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
no okay whether we keep them or not as a
 
01:06:03.150 --> 01:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
whole is another question right but
 
01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:05.720 align:start position:0%
yeah that was my next question are we
 
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:07.640 align:start position:0%
are we taking a vote on it or we just
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
moving forward yeah I mean so for for
 
01:06:14.789 --> 01:06:14.799 align:start position:0%
the time being I I I would say um keep
 
01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
these sections if if we're going to keep
 
01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
the agency but
 
01:06:21.549 --> 01:06:21.559 align:start position:0%
okay any and I don't see any objections
 
01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:25.240 align:start position:0%
to that right so okay um the next thing
 
01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:32.870 align:start position:0%
 
was

01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
um administrative Services um section
 
01:06:37.599 --> 01:06:39.950 align:start position:0%
um administrative Services um section
26

01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
26
 
01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:43.069 align:start position:0%
26
which

01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
um uh Bridges house okay so where's the
 
01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:50.670 align:start position:0%
um uh Bridges house okay so where's the
that's

01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:56.789 --> 01:06:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:56.799 --> 01:06:58.710 align:start position:0%
 
brid's

01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
brid's
 
01:07:10.030 --> 01:07:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.549 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:07:11.549 --> 01:07:11.559 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
71 Bridge's house is it's essentially
 
01:07:17.549 --> 01:07:17.559 align:start position:0%
the governor's
 
01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
mansion but nobody lives there
 
01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
right they they sometimes have events
 
01:07:28.269 --> 01:07:28.279 align:start position:0%
there and things like that yeah
 
01:07:36.549 --> 01:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:36.559 --> 01:07:43.029 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:46.349 --> 01:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
so um just makes the fund for
 
01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance of bridges house
 
01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
non-aps and and allows the governor to
 
01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:57.359 --> 01:07:59.309 align:start position:0%
 
seems

01:07:59.309 --> 01:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
seems
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
okay any any issues okay so we'll keep
 
01:08:07.589 --> 01:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
keep that section where is it
 
01:08:12.829 --> 01:08:12.839 align:start position:0%
here Bridges has keep yes represent run
 
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
so there's no appropriation with that
 
01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
section it's just allowing the it makes
 
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
it non-aps yes and so there's already a
 
01:08:23.829 --> 01:08:23.839 align:start position:0%
fund okay I mean I guess we could if we
 
01:08:26.110 --> 01:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to we could go look up you know
 
01:08:29.309 --> 01:08:29.319 align:start position:0%
what's the balance of that fund
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
but I don't know it's in general I would
 
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
think since we already have I mean funds
 
01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
are not necessarily lapsing just because
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
they're there so can I yes go ah
 
01:08:44.070 --> 01:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
clarification so this this fund is
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
already non-aps yeah um it's not
 
01:08:48.030 --> 01:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
changing that it's just continuing
 
01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
approprate to the Department of
 
01:08:50.590 --> 01:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
administrative services so it's just
 
01:08:52.749 --> 01:08:52.759 align:start position:0%
giving them the authority I'm not sure
 
01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
where it lands at this point um I'm
 
01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
assuming that they probably already
 
01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
have access to that Jack just looked up
 
01:09:01.709 --> 01:09:01.719 align:start position:0%
the dedicated fund and it shows no
 
01:09:04.349 --> 01:09:04.359 align:start position:0%
dollars in there currently in the
 
01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
administrative Services is the agency
 
01:09:09.390 --> 01:09:09.400 align:start position:0%
that's um in charge of the fund so I
 
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
think it's just a clarification this
 
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
just clean up housekeeping okay so
 
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
there's no real change that this is
 
01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
doing okay that's
 
01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
yeah all right represent do we need a
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
vote to to say we keeping this section
 
01:09:27.149 --> 01:09:27.159 align:start position:0%
or we can I just wanted brid's house yes
 
01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
did you want to do an amendment to
 
01:09:32.189 --> 01:09:32.199 align:start position:0%
capitalize Bridge's house per Edna's
 
01:09:34.349 --> 01:09:34.359 align:start position:0%
recommendation or are you fine with
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
keeping it the same what's that Bridges
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
house because it's
 
01:09:40.799 --> 01:09:42.390 align:start position:0%
house because it's
a

01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
oh where is it on line seven oh I see on
 
01:09:46.199 --> 01:09:50.229 align:start position:0%
oh where is it on line seven oh I see on
line

01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
four page 71 so line four and line seven
 
01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
on page 71 okay
 
01:09:59.189 --> 01:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
it appears twice on line seven yes yes
 
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
yes yes yes okay I like that suggestion
 
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
okay and twice on line so yeah I see so
 
01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
what you can do is um you can take a
 
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
vote to keep the section with the
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that will capitalize those
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
those three places those three
 
01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
references right all right should we do
 
01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
that I move that we make those changes
 
01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
okay I'll in favor yeah second it yeah
 
01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
second by representative EV okay good so
 
01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
that's a simple
 
01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:31.070 align:start position:0%
that's a simple
one

01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
yeah okay um page uh section the next
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
section audit set aside so what she says
 
01:10:40.239 --> 01:10:44.390 align:start position:0%
section audit set aside so what she says
is

01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:48.189 --> 01:10:48.199 align:start position:0%
uh right she doesn't understand why we
 
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
want to um wave these audits set aside
 
01:10:54.030 --> 01:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
so they don't like this I guess so I
 
01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
have some information on this
 
01:10:58.110 --> 01:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
like uh so we reached out to edmin
 
01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
services on this and apparently when
 
01:11:04.590 --> 01:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
arpa monies were coming through they
 
01:11:06.669 --> 01:11:06.679 align:start position:0%
were struggling to do the audit set
 
01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
aside with the past arpa monies and
 
01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
there was it was getting a little messy
 
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
very rare situation because it was all
 
01:11:14.590 --> 01:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
these arpa dollars and now those are not
 
01:11:17.709 --> 01:11:17.719 align:start position:0%
coming in so this was only for that
 
01:11:21.189 --> 01:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
particular situation and it's very rare
 
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
So admin Services was fine either way
 
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
either keep it as it or put this into
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
statute so they have the ability to wave
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
it if these rare circumstances come up
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily Define those rare
 
01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:36.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances so it gives them a little
 
01:11:38.229 --> 01:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
bit more Authority than they would have
 
01:11:41.229 --> 01:11:41.239 align:start position:0%
had prior but if you're
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
comfortable that's what the request is
 
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
but admin Services took no position on
 
01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
another well obviously they asked for it
 
01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
in the first place because that's why
 
01:11:55.669 --> 01:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
it's here right so that's true they came
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
up with this when they were dealing with
 
01:11:58.350 --> 01:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
the arpa stuff but now that the arpa
 
01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
stuff has passed I
 
01:12:03.950 --> 01:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
see so they said they're good either way
 
01:12:08.350 --> 01:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
represent R um I'm um of the mind to
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
just delete this just because I think
 
01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
some of the terminology is vague like
 
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
State objectives you know it would
 
01:12:17.310 --> 01:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
really be up it's a very subjective
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
determination and leaving that to just
 
01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
one person I feel isn't in the best
 
01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
interest of the state to have that vague
 
01:12:26.990 --> 01:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
language yeah and it seems like Edna
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
didn't like it so and it also seems
 
01:12:31.669 --> 01:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
since it is such a rare occurrence I
 
01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
don't think we're going to see any
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
impact of deleting that on the function
 
01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
of the state okay so you want to move uh
 
01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
to remove section
 
01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
174 yes I move that we remove one
 
01:12:47.709 --> 01:12:47.719 align:start position:0%
section 174 from hb2 I'm on a roll here
 
01:12:49.149 --> 01:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
this is like my second motion all right
 
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative camell all
 
01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
those in favor I okay good so remove
 
01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:59.310 align:start position:0%
those in favor I okay good so remove
that

01:12:59.310 --> 01:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
176 uh also on the same
 
01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
page they say uh we don't see a problem
 
01:13:13.950 --> 01:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
with limiting the Surplus distribution
 
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
fund to three months operation and and
 
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
non-aps so they they're okay with this
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
one um
 
01:13:25.679 --> 01:13:30.310 align:start position:0%
one um
I

01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:33.229 --> 01:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
guess I'm not sure about
 
01:13:35.669 --> 01:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
non-aps does this fund
 
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
provide is there is there sort of a
 
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
or let's look up how much money is in
 
01:14:09.149 --> 01:14:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:11.189 --> 01:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
they are deleting it I mean they are
 
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
reducing it from three from six months
 
01:14:18.510 --> 01:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
looking up page um
 
01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah see this is one of those
 
01:14:47.709 --> 01:14:47.719 align:start position:0%
things where we only see part of the law
 
01:14:50.229 --> 01:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
right because there's a colon at the
 
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
bottom of page 71 and we're not seeing
 
01:14:58.750 --> 01:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:02.350 --> 01:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
think so representative Maguire um
 
01:15:06.990 --> 01:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
$539,000 and generally generally around
 
01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
22 was about 200,000 and then it went to
 
01:15:19.709 --> 01:15:19.719 align:start position:0%
400 in the last two years it's been
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
about 500,000 5 how much so expenses are
 
01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
about 300 to 400,000 a year I see
 
01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:31.990 align:start position:0%
about 300 to 400,000 a year I see
okay

01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:35.629 --> 01:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:38.430 --> 01:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
right and it's it the funds come from
 
01:15:42.430 --> 01:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
fees assessed for handling Surplus
 
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
assets okay and this non-lps part it
 
01:15:57.669 --> 01:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:59.229 --> 01:15:59.239 align:start position:0%
it appears looking at the fund that it
 
01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't lapse because there's a
 
01:16:02.189 --> 01:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
beginning balance it's not starting at
 
01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
zero every time so I'm not sure about
 
01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
that but we can look into that with
 
01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
admin Services if you like yeah I mean
 
01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
they're probably just confirming in
 
01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
statute what the
 
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
actual experience is could be all right
 
01:16:20.229 --> 01:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
but I'll I'll let me look this up just
 
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
to okay so this is number
 
01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
176 176 yeah all right so look up they
 
01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:34.470 align:start position:0%
176 176 yeah all right so look up they
did

01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:37.470 --> 01:16:37.480 align:start position:0%
recommend okay I you want to just accept
 
01:16:39.870 --> 01:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
it let just accept it yeah accept it
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
accept it okay make a motion to accept
 
01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:45.320 align:start position:0%
all right I'll second it okay all in
 
01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:48.280 align:start position:0%
favor yes all right good all right we'll
 
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
just move on from this one okay next one
 
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
is section one
 
01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:57.590 align:start position:0%
is section one
77

01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
77
 
01:17:00.430 --> 01:17:00.440 align:start position:0%
ah this is the one we just talked
 
01:17:02.510 --> 01:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
about so yeah we're going to get some
 
01:17:04.350 --> 01:17:04.360 align:start position:0%
more information from them as to why
 
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
they want this to me this sounds like a
 
01:17:10.990 --> 01:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
big deal right um use money from any
 
01:17:14.669 --> 01:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
budget class you know this this lets
 
01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
people bypass the the fiscal committee
 
01:17:20.550 --> 01:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
basically right when they want to move
 
01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:23.960 align:start position:0%
money around for all kinds of purposes
 
01:17:26.590 --> 01:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
so I this one I don't care
 
01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
for but yes represent R well is there an
 
01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
issue with this because if they're using
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
another class to pay penalties and fines
 
01:17:38.229 --> 01:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
how would we track how many penalties
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
and fines have been levied to me it's if
 
01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
they should have a class where if we
 
01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
want to find out okay you know were
 
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
there issues with those state agencies
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
and in withholding retirement
 
01:17:54.030 --> 01:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
contributions or retirement uh premiums
 
01:17:56.830 --> 01:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
so yeah you know I'd want to be able to
 
01:17:58.910 --> 01:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
look and say okay here oh my gosh this
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
agency was fined x amount yeah but if
 
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
they're able to pay that from different
 
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
classes I'm not sure how easily it would
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
be to determine what those fines and
 
01:18:11.550 --> 01:18:11.560 align:start position:0%
penalties were yeah that's just to me it
 
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
reads way too broad but we'll we'll get
 
01:18:16.110 --> 01:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
some some
 
01:18:18.030 --> 01:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
information uh from the governor's
 
01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
office so let's skip this
 
01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:23.430 align:start position:0%
office so let's skip this
one

01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:30.629 --> 01:18:30.639 align:start position:0%
this one starts at the bottom of the
 
01:18:32.590 --> 01:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
last line of page
 
01:18:38.550 --> 01:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
73 section 1899 y yeah
 
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
mechanical so for this one this is a uh
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
This falls under division two yeah okay
 
01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:47.950 align:start position:0%
This falls under division two yeah okay
yes

01:18:47.950 --> 01:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:52.229 --> 01:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
so okay so but I'll tell you the it's
 
01:18:55.790 --> 01:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
it's oplc right so that's why we
 
01:18:59.709 --> 01:18:59.719 align:start position:0%
they looked at it um but you should tell
 
01:19:03.149 --> 01:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
division 2 that there's no money coming
 
01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
with these nine people right so they
 
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
Edna likes the idea of moving it and
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
says it should have been done before
 
01:19:13.870 --> 01:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
it's an oversight that it wasn't right
 
01:19:16.110 --> 01:19:16.120 align:start position:0%
but because these people are not really
 
01:19:19.470 --> 01:19:19.480 align:start position:0%
doing licensing but they work for oplc
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
that's the issue but
 
01:19:24.990 --> 01:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
but so everybody agrees they should be
 
01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
moved right but but there's no money to
 
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
pay and they are um they actually
 
01:19:33.390 --> 01:19:33.400 align:start position:0%
already show up in hb1 in safety's
 
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
budget okay good division is aware of
 
01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
that so so these are good sections all
 
01:19:40.149 --> 01:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
right and then barbering and cosmetology
 
01:19:43.709 --> 01:19:43.719 align:start position:0%
so those are the last Parts page
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
um starts on page 74 line
 
01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:52.229 align:start position:0%
um starts on page 74 line
19

01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:56.189 --> 01:19:56.199 align:start position:0%
right okay wording changes to maintain
 
01:19:56.199 --> 01:20:00.070 align:start position:0%
right okay wording changes to maintain
sanitation

01:20:00.070 --> 01:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:05.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:08.830 --> 01:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
uh okay so we're going to wait for for
 
01:20:13.510 --> 01:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
oplc to to provide better language okay
 
01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:17.560 align:start position:0%
yeah okay all right so this is a weight
 
01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.430 align:start position:0%
yeah okay all right so this is a weight
here

01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:20:27.390 --> 01:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:29.629 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:20:29.629 --> 01:20:29.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
203 yep oh 203 repealing the apprentices
 
01:20:39.870 --> 01:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
to provide their social security number
 
01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:41.669 align:start position:0%
to provide their social security number
okay

01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:20:45.189 --> 01:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
necessary it violates federal law yeah
 
01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.950 --> 01:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
be clear okay okay can we don't use
 
01:21:04.629 --> 01:21:04.639 align:start position:0%
those funds how do we get them
 
01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
over can we vote on 203 though that's
 
01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
when I think in
 
01:21:12.629 --> 01:21:12.639 align:start position:0%
the just a moment representative Griffin
 
01:21:14.189 --> 01:21:14.199 align:start position:0%
so we're we're currently talking about
 
01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
203 right let's let's get that out of
 
01:21:19.550 --> 01:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
the way so I'd like to move to uh follow
 
01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
the instruction of Edna and repeal as
 
01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:25.510 align:start position:0%
the instruction of Edna and repeal as
indicated

01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
indicated
 
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
except section 203 except whatever the
 
01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
language is okay except 203 you okay yep
 
01:21:33.870 --> 01:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
okay y okay second by representative
 
01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
camell all in favor yes back to
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
unanimous all right now representative
 
01:21:49.149 --> 01:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:52.350 --> 01:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
174 if you get a f Federal Grant and
 
01:21:56.550 --> 01:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
they decide not to a time goes back how
 
01:21:59.149 --> 01:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
do you free those funds
 
01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
up some of the youth that's what I think
 
01:22:08.229 --> 01:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
all we could ask so um we have an answer
 
01:22:11.310 --> 01:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
from them for part of that so what the
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
intent of this language
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
was was that when the arpa funds came
 
01:22:20.229 --> 01:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
through there wasn't an audit set aside
 
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
requirement for those funds so what they
 
01:22:25.470 --> 01:22:25.480 align:start position:0%
did instead because there was wasn't the
 
01:22:28.189 --> 01:22:28.199 align:start position:0%
audit set aside fund was sort of flush
 
01:22:31.470 --> 01:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
so instead they waved the right to
 
01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
collect the audit fee on those so they
 
01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
were putting that into law that they
 
01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
could wave that right in that small
 
01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
particular situation with the arpa funds
 
01:22:45.709 --> 01:22:45.719 align:start position:0%
typically they do have language to set
 
01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
aside the 1% for the audit set aside or
 
01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
the 0.1% for the audit set aside so
 
01:22:53.790 --> 01:22:53.800 align:start position:0%
every every Federal audit that comes
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
down through the dollars are there and
 
01:22:58.110 --> 01:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
they will be collected to your question
 
01:23:00.550 --> 01:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there's ever extra funds
 
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
in there because there is the audit
 
01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
isn't pulled from it but B reading das's
 
01:23:07.470 --> 01:23:07.480 align:start position:0%
email where they said the account was
 
01:23:10.149 --> 01:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
flush I'm assuming those are getting
 
01:23:12.990 --> 01:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
used up and paid back for instance LBA
 
01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
when we do an audit of better funds like
 
01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
the the money gets transferred back to
 
01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
us for that
 
01:23:22.669 --> 01:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
1% of those audit that decide funds
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
that's probably conflating issue a
 
01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:25.709 align:start position:0%
that's probably conflating issue a
little

01:23:25.709 --> 01:23:25.719 align:start position:0%
little
 
01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
bit so just to restate it maybe in a
 
01:23:29.199 --> 01:23:31.070 align:start position:0%
bit so just to restate it maybe in a
different

01:23:31.070 --> 01:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:23:34.350 --> 01:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
way this small particular circumstance
 
01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
happened because all of that money
 
01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
flooded in from the federal government
 
01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
without audit set aside requirements so
 
01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
the 1% was not collected on those funds
 
01:23:47.830 --> 01:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
there was no extra dollars to collect
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
those funds so instead Das waved that
 
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
requirement to collect on those funds
 
01:23:56.510 --> 01:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
they want to put this in statute so they
 
01:23:59.390 --> 01:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
could do that again or they could
 
01:24:02.350 --> 01:24:02.360 align:start position:0%
collect on it but it's a very small
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
circumstance that may never arise again
 
01:24:06.149 --> 01:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
so it does seem like they have an option
 
01:24:07.629 --> 01:24:07.639 align:start position:0%
if they need an option because they used
 
01:24:09.070 --> 01:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
it last time but I think they were
 
01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
trying to put it in statute for clarity
 
01:24:14.709 --> 01:24:14.719 align:start position:0%
because they ran into an issue does that
 
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
answer the question on some level does
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
this 1% set aside for audits is it
 
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
always exactly 1% or it up to 1% cuz
 
01:24:29.229 --> 01:24:29.239 align:start position:0%
what you sounded like was the fund is
 
01:24:32.669 --> 01:24:32.679 align:start position:0%
flush meaning you know the one all the
 
01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
necessary there is some variations
 
01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
typically it's 1% I do know because
 
01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
you'll see this on fiscal items there'll
 
01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
be a line that says audit uh audit set
 
01:24:46.990 --> 01:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
aside when they're receiving fiscal um
 
01:24:48.390 --> 01:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
money for federal
 
01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
grants I do know we've questioned it a
 
01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
couple of times because it's been
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
different in particular um Department of
 
01:24:57.950 --> 01:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
Business and economic Affairs they have
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
a different audit set aside amount for a
 
01:25:02.270 --> 01:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
particular situation I don't remember
 
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
what that amount is but I would say 95%
 
01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
of the time it's that 1% yeah because I
 
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
mean the important thing is to have the
 
01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:11.990 align:start position:0%
mean the important thing is to have the
audit

01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
audit
 
01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
done right not that it's I mean maybe
 
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
certain audit only takes half a percent
 
01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
or something right
 
01:25:23.950 --> 01:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
so it's fair yeah all right but if but
 
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
that's maybe federal law that it's one
 
01:25:27.669 --> 01:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm thinking and I can look
 
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
into that and yeah because if especially
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
since they said the arpa funds didn't
 
01:25:34.109 --> 01:25:34.119 align:start position:0%
have the federal requirement right right
 
01:25:35.790 --> 01:25:35.800 align:start position:0%
but if it's New Hampshire law that it's
 
01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
exactly 1% we might want to change it to
 
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
up to 1% or something like that yeah we
 
01:25:43.709 --> 01:25:43.719 align:start position:0%
can look into that for you okay we did
 
01:25:47.550 --> 01:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
vote on that item though we did yes we
 
01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
voted to not accept Section
 
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
174 yeah okay
 
01:25:58.229 --> 01:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
next one let's see where how are we
 
01:26:01.109 --> 01:26:01.119 align:start position:0%
doing we still got plenty of time okay
 
01:26:04.030 --> 01:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
now as long as we're um there are a
 
01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
couple other of these kind of things
 
01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
that I marked as a big deal let's go to
 
01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:16.629 align:start position:0%
that I marked as a big deal let's go to
page

01:26:16.629 --> 01:26:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
70 and by the way I haven't I've only
 
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
heard from Edna I have not heard from
 
01:26:25.709 --> 01:26:25.719 align:start position:0%
any other committee that got pages so I
 
01:26:29.550 --> 01:26:29.560 align:start position:0%
may have to poke some of them
 
01:26:31.990 --> 01:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
um section
 
01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
170 not withstanding any other provision
 
01:26:38.070 --> 01:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
of law to the contrary any executive dep
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
Branch department or agency may fill
 
01:26:43.629 --> 01:26:43.639 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions during the bium
 
01:26:45.669 --> 01:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
provided that total expenditures for
 
01:26:47.550 --> 01:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
such positions shall not exceed the
 
01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:49.070 align:start position:0%
such positions shall not exceed the
amount

01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:26:52.030 --> 01:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
appropriated for personnel and
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:01.470 --> 01:27:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
no this is a new request that's come in
 
01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
um I think when we had agencies come in
 
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
I think Department of Revenue was one
 
01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
there was another agency that was asking
 
01:27:15.390 --> 01:27:15.400 align:start position:0%
for this ability I think Corrections
 
01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
already has this ability so this um was
 
01:27:20.629 --> 01:27:20.639 align:start position:0%
making it for all executive branches and
 
01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be a cost in the sense that
 
01:27:25.149 --> 01:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
when they're trans ing the amount is
 
01:27:28.189 --> 01:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
flush but it just allows them to fill a
 
01:27:30.990 --> 01:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
position more quickly or or maybe
 
01:27:32.669 --> 01:27:32.679 align:start position:0%
someone left I I believe the example
 
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
they gave was somebody left they no
 
01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
longer needed that position in
 
01:27:38.229 --> 01:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
particular but they had a lower grade
 
01:27:40.669 --> 01:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
position that they wanted to be able to
 
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
fill instead and this would allow them
 
01:27:45.669 --> 01:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
sort of to be more fluid to higher
 
01:27:48.990 --> 01:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
positions when someone leaves yeah I
 
01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
mean represent yeah I was just going to
 
01:27:53.470 --> 01:27:53.480 align:start position:0%
say it strikes me that this is a
 
01:27:55.350 --> 01:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
provision that allows for better
 
01:27:58.590 --> 01:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
management within the agency because if
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:06.189 align:start position:0%
 
mean

01:28:06.189 --> 01:28:06.199 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:28:09.669 --> 01:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
right well not exactly right because
 
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
they get their lapses from unfunded
 
01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
positions well they get their lapses
 
01:28:20.310 --> 01:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
from unused Personnel money right so um
 
01:28:23.229 --> 01:28:23.239 align:start position:0%
to the extent that they can spend faster
 
01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
or more
 
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
there'll be less lapses fewer lapses so
 
01:28:31.830 --> 01:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
um I mean I guess part of it is that
 
01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
just because it's unfunded it doesn't
 
01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
mean that it might not be vital and they
 
01:28:40.270 --> 01:28:40.280 align:start position:0%
might find over time that a need arises
 
01:28:42.310 --> 01:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
that they didn't anticipate or something
 
01:28:44.669 --> 01:28:44.679 align:start position:0%
and I just think from an agency
 
01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
standpoint point it makes for better
 
01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:48.109 align:start position:0%
standpoint point it makes for better
management

01:28:48.109 --> 01:28:48.119 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:28:48.119 --> 01:28:50.629 align:start position:0%
management
capabilities

01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
capabilities
 
01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
okay I agree don't you think you're the
 
01:28:55.149 --> 01:28:55.159 align:start position:0%
man you're a manager
 
01:28:58.510 --> 01:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
mean yeah yes I would make a motion to
 
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
to accept that I'll second it okay any
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
any more discussion no because so what
 
01:29:08.109 --> 01:29:08.119 align:start position:0%
this tells us is if we really don't want
 
01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
to spend on a position we have to
 
01:29:12.070 --> 01:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
eliminate the
 
01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
position right so then it won't be a
 
01:29:17.149 --> 01:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
position anymore right so there's a
 
01:29:20.109 --> 01:29:20.119 align:start position:0%
whole lot of unfunded positions right
 
01:29:23.109 --> 01:29:23.119 align:start position:0%
there's there's something like 20,000
 
01:29:26.709 --> 01:29:26.719 align:start position:0%
positions but 's only 14,000 people
 
01:29:30.270 --> 01:29:30.280 align:start position:0%
working or something like that right so
 
01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
so if we really don't want a position to
 
01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
be there then we have to eliminate the
 
01:29:40.870 --> 01:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
position okay all right but we can vote
 
01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
on this if you want yeah yeah okay all
 
01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:45.910 align:start position:0%
on this if you want yeah yeah okay all
in

01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
favor okay I'll be
 
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
against the motion passes all right so
 
01:29:55.070 --> 01:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep section 170
 
01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:57.310 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep section 170
all

01:29:57.310 --> 01:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
right now uh next one is similar let's
 
01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:04.109 align:start position:0%
right now uh next one is similar let's
see

01:30:04.109 --> 01:30:04.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:04.119 --> 01:30:08.030 align:start position:0%
 
172

01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:10.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:30:10.950 --> 01:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
172 so wait why why is 171 on our list
 
01:30:21.229 --> 01:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
works yeah Das
 
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:35.870 align:start position:0%
 
do

01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
171 we're 17 oh I was reading 172 yeah
 
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to go there in a minute I
 
01:30:43.109 --> 01:30:43.119 align:start position:0%
just as long as we were here I said
 
01:30:46.270 --> 01:30:46.280 align:start position:0%
highways and that's on our list so I
 
01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:11.950 --> 01:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
it's the same management argument I see
 
01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
right I mean and also this 50,000 was
 
01:31:16.629 --> 01:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
probably set a century ago so they're
 
01:31:20.030 --> 01:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
trying to up the up the ante oh so this
 
01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
is changing what has to go to governor
 
01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
and Council yes that's it I was just
 
01:31:26.750 --> 01:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
going to say it falls under uh division
 
01:31:29.229 --> 01:31:29.239 align:start position:0%
one because it's sort of legislative
 
01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
executive branch gotcha it's so the
 
01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:34.360 align:start position:0%
title's a little misleading but it's any
 
01:31:36.149 --> 01:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
administration of Federal Aid that goes
 
01:31:38.990 --> 01:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
to GNC so I'd like to wait on this one
 
01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:42.400 align:start position:0%
until we hear from representative wer um
 
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
and also we can research when was the
 
01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
$50,000 set because this is yet another
 
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
big deal right I mean this is
 
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh changing what goes to governor and
 
01:31:56.350 --> 01:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
Council Mr
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
chairman change that long ago I would
 
01:32:01.149 --> 01:32:01.159 align:start position:0%
say we should leave it at 50
 
01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
personally okay I think $100,000 still a
 
01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
lot of money even though we deal with
 
01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:07.910 align:start position:0%
lot of money even though we deal with
Millions

01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
Millions
 
01:32:11.629 --> 01:32:11.639 align:start position:0%
right so you'd like you like it as is
 
01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
without this section but but I think
 
01:32:19.470 --> 01:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
Aid I don't know I'm not sure we've read
 
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
it completely anyway yeah let's I I'll
 
01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
ask let's get a reaction
 
01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:30.870 align:start position:0%
ask let's get a reaction
from

01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:33.270 align:start position:0%
from
um

01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
assistance highways and other public
 
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
work it's for federal benefits
 
01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:39.400 align:start position:0%
facilities Grant AIDS or other Federal
 
01:32:41.109 --> 01:32:41.119 align:start position:0%
Appropriations or Services made
 
01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
available to assist theate activity
 
01:32:47.070 --> 01:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
right it's just being able it's just not
 
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
in the case of State money expenditures
 
01:32:53.070 --> 01:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
I think it's just facilitating easier uh
 
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
time with fed Federal monies yeah
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
because right now they can't if they
 
01:33:01.189 --> 01:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
they can apply they can apply and
 
01:33:04.709 --> 01:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
receive a a Federal grant but if it's
 
01:33:07.229 --> 01:33:07.239 align:start position:0%
over 50,000 they have to go to governor
 
01:33:11.149 --> 01:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
and Council to expend right I'm I'm kind
 
01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
of of the mind to accept this and go to
 
01:33:18.189 --> 01:33:18.199 align:start position:0%
100,000 because I think it would um
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
assist in the execution of projects or
 
01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
the implementation of projects speed
 
01:33:25.950 --> 01:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
them up yeah I mean if if you look at
 
01:33:29.669 --> 01:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
just uh grants that Dees gets from the
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
also the fiscal committee too oh is it
 
01:33:32.639 --> 01:33:33.830 align:start position:0%
also the fiscal committee too oh is it
oh

01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:33:37.790 --> 01:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
great so I like I said I let let's wait
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
and and see what represented wer think
 
01:33:41.629 --> 01:33:41.639 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire uh Jack just
 
01:33:44.350 --> 01:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
looked it up the 50,000 was set in 2005
 
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
in House Bill two okay so it's 20 years
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
20 it's 20 I know I just think it'd be
 
01:33:53.790 --> 01:33:53.800 align:start position:0%
more efficient and cost effective
 
01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
because it's such a timesaver to just
 
01:33:59.790 --> 01:33:59.800 align:start position:0%
allow agencies to manage that money
 
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
without having to jump through all those
 
01:34:03.870 --> 01:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
Hoops yeah okay well we'll we'll we'll
 
01:34:06.750 --> 01:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
come back to this one 100,000 isn't set
 
01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
in stone either you could do
 
01:34:12.870 --> 01:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
75 that's true true yeah I just like I'd
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
like a little more input okay well let's
 
01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
go to 172 okay excuse me Mr before we
 
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
move on um if I could ask Melissa if you
 
01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
and Jack if you could find find um or
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
get an estimate of how many times um
 
01:34:32.270 --> 01:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
agencies have had to go to get 50,000
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
approved over 50,000 I'd be interested
 
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
to see what type of
 
01:34:39.390 --> 01:34:39.400 align:start position:0%
work9 that's what I was just going to
 
01:34:42.109 --> 01:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
clarify okay like for every 50,000 they
 
01:34:43.709 --> 01:34:43.719 align:start position:0%
have to go but do you mean that that
 
01:34:46.270 --> 01:34:46.280 align:start position:0%
Delta between 50 I mean are we talking
 
01:34:50.669 --> 01:34:50.679 align:start position:0%
about 200 grants or are we talking about
 
01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
20 right I mean does this make the
 
01:34:54.910 --> 01:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee do half the work
 
01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
they're doing
 
01:34:59.870 --> 01:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
now or something huh yeah well one of
 
01:35:01.470 --> 01:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
the things the fiscal committee also
 
01:35:03.109 --> 01:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
does when they look at these grants is
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
to see if there's any sort of language
 
01:35:06.750 --> 01:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
that obligates the Departments to fund
 
01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
it going forward and this and it just
 
01:35:12.669 --> 01:35:12.679 align:start position:0%
makes us look further and $50,000 still
 
01:35:15.870 --> 01:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
seems like even to me a lot of money but
 
01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
it does require you know more oversite
 
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
more transparency you push it up
 
01:35:23.229 --> 01:35:23.239 align:start position:0%
$100,000 you may find that people come
 
01:35:23.239 --> 01:35:24.830 align:start position:0%
$100,000 you may find that people come
in

01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh less often but what's going on with
 
01:35:29.149 --> 01:35:29.159 align:start position:0%
the money with the grants being accepted
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
because there are requirements about
 
01:35:32.590 --> 01:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
Audits and this money any federal money
 
01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
that we get there is a requirement for
 
01:35:36.430 --> 01:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
audits so I just think it's worked well
 
01:35:39.790 --> 01:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
at 50 and gotta my opinion I know
 
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
Jerry's on fiscal too whether you want
 
01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
us a comment
 
01:35:45.709 --> 01:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
but okay representative McGuire just had
 
01:35:47.550 --> 01:35:47.560 align:start position:0%
one question actually for representative
 
01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
Lehman um we're looking it up now but is
 
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:54.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal currently 100,000 it is so this
 
01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
is GNC it seems like they're matching
 
01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
GNC to match fiscal yeah oh I see so it
 
01:36:03.109 --> 01:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
seems like GNC probably has this little
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
area of 50,000 to 100,000 that only
 
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
they're having to approve fiscal only
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:17.149 --> 01:36:17.159 align:start position:0%
differentation but it's GNC I think it's
 
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
GNC and fiscal because it says with
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
prior approval of the joint fiscal
 
01:36:26.310 --> 01:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
committee Ze yeah so if it's prior
 
01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
approval of the fiscal committee the
 
01:36:29.470 --> 01:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee would have only looked
 
01:36:33.870 --> 01:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
at it for a 100 right so they're oh so
 
01:36:36.109 --> 01:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
you think this is fixing aing it's
 
01:36:37.950 --> 01:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
really conforming
 
01:36:40.350 --> 01:36:40.360 align:start position:0%
language all right well let let's let's
 
01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:43.149 align:start position:0%
language all right well let let's let's
make

01:36:43.149 --> 01:36:43.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
sure yes I I think so too okay let's go
 
01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:54.030 --> 01:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
172 oh I see it's 100,000 in here too
 
01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:55.990 align:start position:0%
172 oh I see it's 100,000 in here too
yeah

01:36:55.990 --> 01:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.990 align:start position:0%
yeah
so

01:36:57.990 --> 01:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
um authorized to transfer every
 
01:37:06.229 --> 01:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
Department as defined by RSA 9on
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
1 whatever that is it's probably every
 
01:37:12.109 --> 01:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
department is authorized to tra transfer
 
01:37:15.189 --> 01:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
funds among all accounting
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
units with the approval of the
 
01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:26.070 --> 01:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
Das um so that's osing the commissioner
 
01:37:28.149 --> 01:37:28.159 align:start position:0%
right but the other language isn't
 
01:37:30.390 --> 01:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
changing so it's actually tightening it
 
01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
up yes right so this is making more work
 
01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:34.590 align:start position:0%
up yes right so this is making more work
for

01:37:34.590 --> 01:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
Charlie but Charlie must have had some
 
01:37:39.550 --> 01:37:39.560 align:start position:0%
input on it what you think I would guess
 
01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
is that is that really necessary I mean
 
01:37:45.149 --> 01:37:45.159 align:start position:0%
you know that that the commissioner of
 
01:37:46.950 --> 01:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
needs to go to the commissioner of admin
 
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
services to get his
 
01:37:55.510 --> 01:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
approval yeah I
 
01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
mean we can check with admin services on
 
01:38:00.830 --> 01:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
this one typically all fiscal items
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
before coming to fiscal do go through
 
01:38:04.750 --> 01:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
admin Services their business
 
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
supervisors review all of their items
 
01:38:09.109 --> 01:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
they work with the agencies on it they
 
01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
make sure it's correct um but we can
 
01:38:14.830 --> 01:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
check with Charlie to see if it's it
 
01:38:16.229 --> 01:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
could be that maybe they want to be able
 
01:38:17.669 --> 01:38:17.679 align:start position:0%
to kick them back when they're receiving
 
01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
them that they're not an accurate
 
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
request is that but the current
 
01:38:23.790 --> 01:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
procedure that's if I'm reading this
 
01:38:26.229 --> 01:38:26.239 align:start position:0%
right does that apply only to U
 
01:38:28.189 --> 01:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
transfers of over
 
01:38:30.310 --> 01:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
$100,000 are you saying every single
 
01:38:33.589 --> 01:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
transfer has to be review over every
 
01:38:35.189 --> 01:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
every item that goes to fiscal so over
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
the 100,000 goes through admin Services
 
01:38:41.310 --> 01:38:41.320 align:start position:0%
first but this is if I'm reading this
 
01:38:44.229 --> 01:38:44.239 align:start position:0%
right this is I want to move $20 yes
 
01:38:46.510 --> 01:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
right that's my point if I read it
 
01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
correctly it says any transfer has to be
 
01:38:50.350 --> 01:38:50.360 align:start position:0%
approved by the commissioner of
 
01:38:53.629 --> 01:38:53.639 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
01:38:55.109 --> 01:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
and then it says provided that anything
 
01:38:58.390 --> 01:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
over 100,000 has to go to fiscal yeah
 
01:39:00.390 --> 01:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
this doesn't look that great to me seems
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
we can look into that it
 
01:39:06.669 --> 01:39:06.679 align:start position:0%
just yeah
 
01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
Petty well he'll he's gonna come in for
 
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
some other things I imagine so we can
 
01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:12.870 align:start position:0%
some other things I imagine so we can
ask

01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
ask
 
01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:16.070 align:start position:0%
ask
him

01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:18.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:39:18.550 --> 01:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:21.390 --> 01:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
piy yeah we don't want to make work
 
01:39:24.629 --> 01:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
where it's not necessary okay all right
 
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:31.870 --> 01:39:31.880 align:start position:0%
maybe um did we do everything on the
 
01:39:34.669 --> 01:39:34.679 align:start position:0%
back oh Capital project overview
 
01:39:37.030 --> 01:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
committee um
 
01:39:42.030 --> 01:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
175 yeah so page 71 I actually have been
 
01:39:44.669 --> 01:39:44.679 align:start position:0%
trying to figure this out because you re
 
01:39:48.750 --> 01:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
remember that we um so um there's a
 
01:39:51.310 --> 01:39:51.320 align:start position:0%
thing called the capital project
 
01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
overview committee it used to be the
 
01:39:57.470 --> 01:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
capital uh budget overview committee and
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
we changed it to project because a lot
 
01:40:02.790 --> 01:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
because capital projects were ending up
 
01:40:05.629 --> 01:40:05.639 align:start position:0%
coming through the operating budget and
 
01:40:07.870 --> 01:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
they weren't really subject to any
 
01:40:11.310 --> 01:40:11.320 align:start position:0%
oversight at all um like you know for
 
01:40:13.350 --> 01:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
instance the women's prison went through
 
01:40:16.030 --> 01:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
the operating budget at one or there was
 
01:40:18.750 --> 01:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
some other large thing I forget anyway
 
01:40:21.189 --> 01:40:21.199 align:start position:0%
so we amended that but the thing is
 
01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
there's still all these references to
 
01:40:26.109 --> 01:40:26.119 align:start position:0%
the C capital budget in here and so I
 
01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
talked to chis Shay and I just um wanted
 
01:40:32.709 --> 01:40:32.719 align:start position:0%
to look once more at the use of the
 
01:40:34.589 --> 01:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
phrase capital budget in here and
 
01:40:37.229 --> 01:40:37.239 align:start position:0%
whether we should just also be deleting
 
01:40:39.950 --> 01:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
the words budget otherwise I think it's
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
fine I just was trying to figure out if
 
01:40:45.109 --> 01:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
we want to clean it up a little more Mr
 
01:40:49.310 --> 01:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
chair I see so what you're saying is
 
01:40:52.229 --> 01:40:52.239 align:start position:0%
um capital projects rather than capital
 
01:40:54.629 --> 01:40:54.639 align:start position:0%
budget projects right because the
 
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
capital budget implies it came through
 
01:40:59.229 --> 01:40:59.239 align:start position:0%
the capital budget but when you have a
 
01:41:01.709 --> 01:41:01.719 align:start position:0%
capital project that comes through the
 
01:41:04.589 --> 01:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
operating budget it should be still
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the this committee I but I I
 
01:41:10.910 --> 01:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
know but I want I just I wanted to
 
01:41:14.109 --> 01:41:14.119 align:start position:0%
double check it once more with Chris
 
01:41:16.990 --> 01:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
because I told him I would okay all
 
01:41:19.510 --> 01:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
right all right thank you okay so we'll
 
01:41:21.270 --> 01:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
come back to this one but that does
 
01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
sound reasonable yeah okay and the rest
 
01:41:25.790 --> 01:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
of the stuff is just changing timing
 
01:41:27.790 --> 01:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I mean otherwise it's changing
 
01:41:30.589 --> 01:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
quarterly to annually yeah otherwise
 
01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's pretty much fine but I'm going
 
01:41:35.790 --> 01:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
to let me look at it once more okay okay
 
01:41:38.709 --> 01:41:38.719 align:start position:0%
all very good are you a member of this
 
01:41:41.109 --> 01:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
committee I am okay very good and I also
 
01:41:42.910 --> 01:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
have like you know because of my Public
 
01:41:44.870 --> 01:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
Works background I have an interest in
 
01:41:47.070 --> 01:41:47.080 align:start position:0%
it in this particular one okay so we
 
01:41:50.589 --> 01:41:50.599 align:start position:0%
will wait for representative eil on this
 
01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:01.470 --> 01:42:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
71 okay all right so why I just interrup
 
01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
go ahead Melissa you might want to talk
 
01:42:10.350 --> 01:42:10.360 align:start position:0%
to chish because I feel like we talked
 
01:42:12.229 --> 01:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
about this in the capital project
 
01:42:14.589 --> 01:42:14.599 align:start position:0%
overview committee and they weren't that
 
01:42:18.589 --> 01:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
excited about going to an annual report
 
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
yes I trying to remember what that was
 
01:42:26.070 --> 01:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so
 
01:42:30.589 --> 01:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:40.390 --> 01:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
Mountain but they said something about
 
01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:42.830 align:start position:0%
Mountain but they said something about
this

01:42:42.830 --> 01:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:42:45.950 --> 01:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
right $18
 
01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:47.910 align:start position:0%
right $18
million

01:42:47.910 --> 01:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
um yeah what the what I thought she said
 
01:42:54.149 --> 01:42:54.159 align:start position:0%
was that it was um being lapsing was
 
01:42:56.510 --> 01:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
being lapsed back to the general fund
 
01:42:58.189 --> 01:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
but when I'm reading this it looks like
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
they can use some of it for um
 
01:43:05.589 --> 01:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
maintenance yeah so it wasn't but maybe
 
01:43:08.870 --> 01:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
Melissa and Jack have a thought on this
 
01:43:10.589 --> 01:43:10.599 align:start position:0%
because if it's just lapsing back it's
 
01:43:14.510 --> 01:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:16.990 --> 01:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
thing well I thought we wanted to keep
 
01:43:21.070 --> 01:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
it for the project right
 
01:43:23.470 --> 01:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
um actually they they did did some
 
01:43:25.709 --> 01:43:25.719 align:start position:0%
switching around and there's also the
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
thing is there's $20 million in the
 
01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
capital budget for the
 
01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
tram I'm trying to remember what she
 
01:43:36.030 --> 01:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
said right so we need to see what the
 
01:43:38.910 --> 01:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
original language is that's being
 
01:43:43.310 --> 01:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:46.669 --> 01:43:46.679 align:start position:0%
the so this is from houseu 2 two years
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
ago right correct so how I'm reading
 
01:43:53.709 --> 01:43:53.719 align:start position:0%
this is that the 18 million whatever is
 
01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
not spent will just go back to the
 
01:43:58.270 --> 01:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
general fund right except she could use
 
01:44:00.709 --> 01:44:00.719 align:start position:0%
part of it for maintenance no I think
 
01:44:02.510 --> 01:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
they didn't they didn't do the project
 
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
this is when she was talking about
 
01:44:06.070 --> 01:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
learning from
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
the I don't know how many how many
 
01:44:11.310 --> 01:44:11.320 align:start position:0%
concrete peers they would need and I
 
01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
don't know she was saying all kinds of
 
01:44:15.310 --> 01:44:15.320 align:start position:0%
stuff my my notes my notes from her
 
01:44:18.510 --> 01:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
testimony were that the um the 18
 
01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
million will revert back to the general
 
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
fund in 2425
 
01:44:25.870 --> 01:44:25.880 align:start position:0%
right and that 20 million for the
 
01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
Tramway would be included in the capital
 
01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
budget for 26
 
01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:32.070 align:start position:0%
budget for 26
27

01:44:32.070 --> 01:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
27
 
01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
okay all right so
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
then I I I I mean can you see anything
 
01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:42.719 align:start position:0%
that would be clarifying Melissa because
 
01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise I'd be happy to make a
 
01:44:47.950 --> 01:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
motion I'm just want to look it up right
 
01:44:49.669 --> 01:44:49.679 align:start position:0%
now just to make sure let's find out
 
01:44:51.310 --> 01:44:51.320 align:start position:0%
what what the
 
01:44:55.629 --> 01:44:55.639 align:start position:0%
original um what are we changing from it
 
01:44:58.629 --> 01:44:58.639 align:start position:0%
was 18 million yeah but the amount was
 
01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
right I just was looking at I'm it's
 
01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
probably the last sentence is new I'm
 
01:45:05.709 --> 01:45:05.719 align:start position:0%
guessing right yeah that's that's
 
01:45:08.189 --> 01:45:08.199 align:start position:0%
correct right I'm looking at it right
 
01:45:10.390 --> 01:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
now so it was the 18 million it's the
 
01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:11.830 align:start position:0%
now so it was the 18 million it's the
lapse

01:45:11.830 --> 01:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
lapse
 
01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
amount any remaining funds hereby
 
01:45:15.470 --> 01:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
appropriated shall lapse to the general
 
01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
fund on July 1 2025 yeah I think I think
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
she's giving it back and replacing the
 
01:45:24.109 --> 01:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
money with the capital bud appropriation
 
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
correct so the original 18 million was
 
01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
um non-lps so that money would just sit
 
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
in their fund Forever This is allowing
 
01:45:34.910 --> 01:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
that money to lapse back to the general
 
01:45:36.709 --> 01:45:36.719 align:start position:0%
fund so they can use it for the capital
 
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
appropriation or whatever I remember you
 
01:45:41.550 --> 01:45:41.560 align:start position:0%
saying I wonder if Ways and Means knew
 
01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
about this remember when we talked about
 
01:45:46.750 --> 01:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
it yeah is that so with that $ 18
 
01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
million be captured in hb1 Melissa no
 
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
it's not an H so this would add it in so
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
this will give the general fund an extra
 
01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
18 million well that's good news right
 
01:45:58.270 --> 01:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
it is good news but I'm wondering
 
01:46:00.669 --> 01:46:00.679 align:start position:0%
whether we ought to do it
 
01:46:03.430 --> 01:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
earlier so that we don't take as much
 
01:46:05.790 --> 01:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
from the rainy day
 
01:46:08.669 --> 01:46:08.679 align:start position:0%
fund right because right
 
01:46:12.149 --> 01:46:12.159 align:start position:0%
now uh we've got 160 million coming from
 
01:46:14.030 --> 01:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund so you could change
 
01:46:16.510 --> 01:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
that to June 30
 
01:46:19.950 --> 01:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
2020 five yes so that would hit fiscal
 
01:46:23.589 --> 01:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
year 25 how about that
 
01:46:26.430 --> 01:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
there's a good Mr chair all right so
 
01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:29.149 align:start position:0%
there's a good Mr chair all right so
June

01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:29.159 --> 01:46:30.950 align:start position:0%
 
30

01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
30
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
yeah um okay so I'll I'll move that we
 
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
accept this provision with the amendment
 
01:46:41.109 --> 01:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
to change July 1st 2025 to June 30
 
01:46:44.430 --> 01:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
2025 okay all right you happy about that
 
01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
yeah okay all those in favor yes okay
 
01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
all right so amend all right
 
01:46:59.270 --> 01:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
so and we'll get um we'll get Surplus
 
01:47:03.229 --> 01:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
statements when when Mr Kane can do that
 
01:47:06.669 --> 01:47:06.679 align:start position:0%
so does that does that mean that um the
 
01:47:10.270 --> 01:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
revenue estimate for 26 goes up by$ 18
 
01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
million we think so we hope so yes well
 
01:47:16.709 --> 01:47:16.719 align:start position:0%
not for 26
 
01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
for 25 25 so we have little oh okay I
 
01:47:23.589 --> 01:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
see what yeah so I I don't know if you
 
01:47:29.830 --> 01:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
got um there's a piece of paper I got
 
01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:33.510 align:start position:0%
got um there's a piece of paper I got
recently

01:47:33.510 --> 01:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:37.950 --> 01:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
um yes um Melissa can do you have copies
 
01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:42.310 align:start position:0%
um yes um Melissa can do you have copies
of

01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:44.110 --> 01:47:44.120 align:start position:0%
this this is
 
01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:45.589 align:start position:0%
this this is
[Music]

01:47:45.589 --> 01:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:47:48.589 --> 01:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
um uh General and education trust funds
 
01:47:50.109 --> 01:47:50.119 align:start position:0%
budget tracking
 
01:47:53.390 --> 01:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
sheet um
 
01:47:56.270 --> 01:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
so what this shows we don't just worry
 
01:47:59.310 --> 01:47:59.320 align:start position:0%
about 26 and 27 we also worry about the
 
01:48:03.629 --> 01:48:03.639 align:start position:0%
end of this year right and so because
 
01:48:06.430 --> 01:48:06.440 align:start position:0%
the governor assumed revenues were
 
01:48:08.990 --> 01:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
higher this year than house Ways and
 
01:48:13.229 --> 01:48:13.239 align:start position:0%
Means did or will or something like that
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
her bottom line was taking 81 million
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
from the Gen from the rainy day fund
 
01:48:23.229 --> 01:48:23.239 align:start position:0%
this page says 160 million
 
01:48:28.390 --> 01:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
right or if you so so that's a big deal
 
01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:29.430 align:start position:0%
right or if you so so that's a big deal
right

01:48:29.430 --> 01:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:48:34.990 --> 01:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
cuz I think this 142 yeah so I think I
 
01:48:38.950 --> 01:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
think I like doing that so okay so do we
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
vote Yes are we going to yeah I thought
 
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
okay we voted okay
 
01:48:48.910 --> 01:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
okay so back
 
01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
to anybody else want to say something no
 
01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
oh okay go ahead yeah
 
01:48:57.040 --> 01:48:58.950 align:start position:0%
oh okay go ahead yeah
yeah

01:48:58.950 --> 01:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:10.910 --> 01:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
so so this is keep with June 30th
 
01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:12.669 align:start position:0%
so so this is keep with June 30th
okay

01:49:12.669 --> 01:49:12.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
great all right so the next one um
 
01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:19.470 align:start position:0%
great all right so the next one um
section

01:49:19.470 --> 01:49:19.480 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
186 do we know how that's different than
 
01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
existing law because it seems to me what
 
01:49:28.430 --> 01:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
this says is what we actually do but
 
01:49:32.990 --> 01:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:36.070 --> 01:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
that 18
 
01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:37.709 align:start position:0%
that 18
186

01:49:37.709 --> 01:49:37.719 align:start position:0%
186
 
01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
page for some reason 185 is not on my
 
01:49:46.030 --> 01:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
list 185 is division three okay um 186
 
01:49:47.910 --> 01:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
we have an email out to the governor's
 
01:49:50.030 --> 01:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
office uh Mike Kan Mike Kane was
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
concerned about this one a little bit
 
01:49:53.310 --> 01:49:53.320 align:start position:0%
and wanted some background admin
 
01:49:55.589 --> 01:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
Services said ask the governor's office
 
01:49:58.830 --> 01:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
so we are we are waiting for a response
 
01:50:03.669 --> 01:50:03.679 align:start position:0%
from them yeah yeah I think it's
 
01:50:06.149 --> 01:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
um it seems strange because I would have
 
01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
thought that that's sort of what already
 
01:50:14.030 --> 01:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:24.589 --> 01:50:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:27.790 --> 01:50:27.800 align:start position:0%
yeah the sale so I don't like
 
01:50:30.910 --> 01:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
187 because I don't like program
 
01:50:34.270 --> 01:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
spending you know do this and then spend
 
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
it over over there I I'd rather you do
 
01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
this and it affects the general fund and
 
01:50:41.589 --> 01:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
over there you decide to spend and it
 
01:50:43.470 --> 01:50:43.480 align:start position:0%
affects the general fund
 
01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:45.270 align:start position:0%
affects the general fund
so

01:50:45.270 --> 01:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:50.310 --> 01:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:55.109 --> 01:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
187 um Melissa and Jack what was the
 
01:50:57.270 --> 01:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
weren't there funds from the sale of the
 
01:51:00.229 --> 01:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
lonia state school designated for some
 
01:51:03.069 --> 01:51:03.079 align:start position:0%
other purpose or or
 
01:51:05.310 --> 01:51:05.320 align:start position:0%
what uh there's been a couple of bills
 
01:51:06.589 --> 01:51:06.599 align:start position:0%
that have come through I think that's
 
01:51:07.830 --> 01:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
what you're remembering but they didn't
 
01:51:09.470 --> 01:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
end up passing there was one that was
 
01:51:11.350 --> 01:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
giving money back to Laconia for some
 
01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure from the sale oh that's
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
what I'm remembering that's yeah and
 
01:51:18.550 --> 01:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
house do we have any idea how much money
 
01:51:24.149 --> 01:51:24.159 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here
 
01:51:26.990 --> 01:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
I can look into it I knew it would going
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:35.069 --> 01:51:35.079 align:start position:0%
curious yes represent thank you the
 
01:51:37.750 --> 01:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
other issue I have with that too is um
 
01:51:39.950 --> 01:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
the last sent and such building shall be
 
01:51:42.790 --> 01:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
used for state government office
 
01:51:45.350 --> 01:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
space I think we would want to have that
 
01:51:47.310 --> 01:51:47.320 align:start position:0%
a little more broad what if there's a
 
01:51:49.470 --> 01:51:49.480 align:start position:0%
vendor that wants to come in and have a
 
01:51:52.830 --> 01:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
cafeteria or some other thing you know
 
01:51:54.430 --> 01:51:54.440 align:start position:0%
if that's not being used for state
 
01:51:57.390 --> 01:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
government space it would be excluded I
 
01:51:59.870 --> 01:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
think the probably the only so notice
 
01:52:03.669 --> 01:52:03.679 align:start position:0%
this is 2023 law being changed right
 
01:52:06.990 --> 01:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
this is last year's House Bill too so I
 
01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
have a feeling the only thing being
 
01:52:11.709 --> 01:52:11.719 align:start position:0%
changed is is the laps
 
01:52:14.109 --> 01:52:14.119 align:start position:0%
sentence right the last sentence of this
 
01:52:17.470 --> 01:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
oh we can just look at
 
01:52:20.709 --> 01:52:20.719 align:start position:0%
okay oh so it may be already be in
 
01:52:23.069 --> 01:52:23.079 align:start position:0%
law yeah that that that would be my
 
01:52:23.079 --> 01:52:26.270 align:start position:0%
law yeah that that that would be my
guess

01:52:26.270 --> 01:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:28.950 --> 01:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
but but if it's already in statute and
 
01:52:30.149 --> 01:52:30.159 align:start position:0%
that's the only change wouldn't have
 
01:52:30.159 --> 01:52:31.669 align:start position:0%
that's the only change wouldn't have
been

01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:31.679 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:52:34.430 --> 01:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
bolded or crossed out no because the way
 
01:52:37.149 --> 01:52:37.159 align:start position:0%
it's written is repealed and reenacted
 
01:52:39.510 --> 01:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
as follows right so you could have done
 
01:52:41.830 --> 01:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
it that way right yeah it would be
 
01:52:44.830 --> 01:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
interesting to have to read the original
 
01:52:47.310 --> 01:52:47.320 align:start position:0%
statute I can make a note so
 
01:52:49.270 --> 01:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
representative evil is looking at them
 
01:52:51.629 --> 01:52:51.639 align:start position:0%
okay so it's it's changed quite
 
01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
significantly oh is it okay
 
01:52:57.830 --> 01:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay okay well we'll hang it's an
 
01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
so maybe you'll print a difference or
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
something is it so so would that have
 
01:53:09.910 --> 01:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
come through Das though or or that's
 
01:53:11.870 --> 01:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
just the
 
01:53:13.950 --> 01:53:13.960 align:start position:0%
governor I don't know who we can even
 
01:53:16.629 --> 01:53:16.639 align:start position:0%
ask about it we could we'll ask Das
 
01:53:18.310 --> 01:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
about it okay they were the ones that
 
01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
gave us the information and before it
 
01:53:25.109 --> 01:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
allocated 13 million um out or
 
01:53:26.310 --> 01:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
acquisition land Building and
 
01:53:29.669 --> 01:53:29.679 align:start position:0%
improvements to Granite one it it gave 2
 
01:53:33.310 --> 01:53:33.320 align:start position:0%
million for necessary mechanical
 
01:53:35.870 --> 01:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
upgrades so it's making it
 
01:53:38.830 --> 01:53:38.840 align:start position:0%
vague because they don't know how yeah
 
01:53:41.709 --> 01:53:41.719 align:start position:0%
yeah and the laps amount was in there
 
01:53:44.149 --> 01:53:44.159 align:start position:0%
that laps language was in there so but
 
01:53:46.830 --> 01:53:46.840 align:start position:0%
once again I I don't like connecting
 
01:53:49.229 --> 01:53:49.239 align:start position:0%
this project be you know depends on that
 
01:53:56.470 --> 01:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:59.229 --> 01:53:59.239 align:start position:0%
all right 10 million oh here's a here's
 
01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
another 10
 
01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
million this is this is a RAID here yeah
 
01:54:08.030 --> 01:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
well I we just hold off on that you want
 
01:54:11.669 --> 01:54:11.679 align:start position:0%
to hold off on please I mean don't you
 
01:54:14.589 --> 01:54:14.599 align:start position:0%
have other raids in
 
01:54:18.709 --> 01:54:18.719 align:start position:0%
M here it shows the laps right here on
 
01:54:18.719 --> 01:54:20.830 align:start position:0%
M here it shows the laps right here on
Canon

01:54:20.830 --> 01:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
Canon
 
01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
Mountain oh there you go did they did
 
01:54:25.550 --> 01:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
put it in here so now we can bump it
 
01:54:31.390 --> 01:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:33.950 --> 01:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
interesting so that's that's interesting
 
01:54:36.830 --> 01:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
where oh here yeah so she does have it
 
01:54:38.910 --> 01:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking on the sheet for Canon
 
01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
Mountain so all we're doing is sliding
 
01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
that 18 over to the left a little that's
 
01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
going to make but that's going to make
 
01:54:49.310 --> 01:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
26 27 of course true anyway but yeah
 
01:54:51.830 --> 01:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
whatever six of one half a dozen on the
 
01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:53.189 align:start position:0%
whatever six of one half a dozen on the
other

01:54:53.189 --> 01:54:53.199 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:54:55.390 --> 01:54:55.400 align:start position:0%
right I just don't I have a feeling the
 
01:54:57.910 --> 01:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
treasurer is not going to be happy with
 
01:54:59.950 --> 01:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund all of a sudden
 
01:55:14.310 --> 01:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:17.310 --> 01:55:17.320 align:start position:0%
haon that's true we we were thinking it
 
01:55:19.510 --> 01:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't really accounted
 
01:55:23.589 --> 01:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
for it wasn't right because
 
01:55:27.510 --> 01:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
um wherever house wayer means revenues
 
01:55:30.030 --> 01:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
see what I mean yeah so it's not in
 
01:55:34.709 --> 01:55:34.719 align:start position:0%
there so it's down here yeah so yes yes
 
01:55:37.510 --> 01:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
the money part the bill the money is in
 
01:55:40.189 --> 01:55:40.199 align:start position:0%
18 as in fiscal year 26 we moved it to
 
01:55:40.199 --> 01:55:41.910 align:start position:0%
18 as in fiscal year 26 we moved it to
25

01:55:41.910 --> 01:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
25
 
01:55:46.750 --> 01:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
yes yes yeah okay we can we can I mean
 
01:55:49.750 --> 01:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
we can reconsider at some later Point
 
01:55:52.510 --> 01:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
want if we need to but but again you
 
01:55:55.910 --> 01:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
know it's anyway it all flows to the
 
01:55:57.870 --> 01:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
back to the bottom would you like us to
 
01:56:01.270 --> 01:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
still prepare an amendment for that yes
 
01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
you yes since we we I don't want to go
 
01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
backwards all right um are we done with
 
01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
this page all right so we're I guess we
 
01:56:16.350 --> 01:56:16.360 align:start position:0%
we can we can break at this point um so
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
we're coming back at 1:15 to do
 
01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:20.669 align:start position:0%
we're coming back at 1:15 to do
bills

01:56:20.669 --> 01:56:20.679 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719 align:start position:0%
and one is it 1:00 yes it's
 
01:56:27.550 --> 01:56:27.560 align:start position:0%
1:00 okay we're coming back at 1:00 to
 
01:56:29.550 --> 01:56:29.560 align:start position:0%
do bills I I also wanted to talk about
 
01:56:31.069 --> 01:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
scheduling next
 
01:56:35.709 --> 01:56:35.719 align:start position:0%
week so next week um I want to schedule
 
01:56:37.030 --> 01:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
us for
 
01:56:41.310 --> 01:56:41.320 align:start position:0%
Tuesday because um Wednesday is our
 
01:56:43.709 --> 01:56:43.719 align:start position:0%
public hearing day right so we're going
 
01:56:45.589 --> 01:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
to have house bill one and House Bill
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
two public hearing on
 
01:56:52.470 --> 01:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
Wednesday um so I'd like
 
01:56:54.149 --> 01:56:54.159 align:start position:0%
so that means we we don't have division
 
01:56:57.069 --> 01:56:57.079 align:start position:0%
one and what happened to me on Wednesday
 
01:57:01.709 --> 01:57:01.719 align:start position:0%
is that um education funding is meeting
 
01:57:03.870 --> 01:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
the morning of Wednesday to finish our
 
01:57:06.629 --> 01:57:06.639 align:start position:0%
bills so I won't be able to be here
 
01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
Wednesday morning from 10 to two so
 
01:57:13.629 --> 01:57:13.639 align:start position:0%
therefore what I'd like to do is have us
 
01:57:18.510 --> 01:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
have our regular meeting uh 10 to 4 or
 
01:57:19.870 --> 01:57:19.880 align:start position:0%
whatever on
 
01:57:22.430 --> 01:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
Tuesday even though that's P that's town
 
01:57:26.910 --> 01:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:29.350 --> 01:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
problem okay I I'm guessing it's
 
01:57:30.870 --> 01:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
probably a problem for representative
 
01:57:33.229 --> 01:57:33.239 align:start position:0%
Sweeny who hasn't been here much but
 
01:57:37.430 --> 01:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
because he's a selectman but other than
 
01:57:40.750 --> 01:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
that so we would have our regular
 
01:57:42.390 --> 01:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
meeting doing what we're doing now from
 
01:57:44.510 --> 01:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
10: to 4: on
 
01:57:48.310 --> 01:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
Tuesday um okay I I have a couple
 
01:57:51.069 --> 01:57:51.079 align:start position:0%
meetings I have to move but that's okay
 
01:57:53.229 --> 01:57:53.239 align:start position:0%
that okay yeah
 
01:57:55.910 --> 01:57:55.920 align:start position:0%

01:57:57.589 --> 01:57:57.599 align:start position:0%

01:58:07.790 --> 01:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
so for Tuesday for Tuesday yes I I've
 
01:58:09.589 --> 01:58:09.599 align:start position:0%

afternoon in the afternoon 2: p.m. to
 
01:58:37.470 --> 01:58:37.480 align:start position:0%
yeah and it can go late you know it
 
01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
depends on how many people show up and
 
01:58:41.510 --> 01:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that's town meeting
 
01:58:43.790 --> 01:58:43.800 align:start position:0%
day so I mean some of us will have to
 
01:58:47.430 --> 01:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
leave that but the way it is it's the
 
01:58:48.629 --> 01:58:48.639 align:start position:0%
way it is
 
01:58:48.639 --> 01:58:50.149 align:start position:0%
way it is
yeah

01:58:50.149 --> 01:58:50.159 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:58:52.430 --> 01:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
okay representative McGuire can I just
 
01:58:54.430 --> 01:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
make one clarification just for the
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
record the audit fund set aside is
 
01:59:00.430 --> 01:59:00.440 align:start position:0%
0.001% not
 
01:59:03.030 --> 01:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
1% well that makes more I want to make I
 
01:59:04.229 --> 01:59:04.239 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that's on it's about
 
01:59:05.870 --> 01:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
two and a half million a year it's not
 
01:59:07.720 --> 01:59:07.730 align:start position:0%
very thorough audits is that what you're
 
01:59:07.730 --> 01:59:11.470 align:start position:0%
very thorough audits is that what you're
[Laughter]

01:59:11.470 --> 01:59:11.480 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:59:15.830 --> 01:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
saying okay um and then this Friday
 
01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
right we're not meeting we we have
 
01:59:20.870 --> 01:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
County right so three yeah the three of
 
01:59:24.310 --> 01:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
us here of County so we are meeting
 
01:59:29.669 --> 01:59:29.679 align:start position:0%
starting at 1:15 1:5 on this Friday yeah
 
01:59:32.990 --> 01:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
right de so we have scheduled yes at
 
01:59:35.790 --> 01:59:35.800 align:start position:0%
1:15 Dees to come in but we've also
 
01:59:38.910 --> 01:59:38.920 align:start position:0%
invited dncr and fishing game and dncr
 
01:59:41.109 --> 01:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
has already confirmed so we'll start out
 
01:59:43.350 --> 01:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
with the permanent for all those earlier
 
01:59:46.109 --> 01:59:46.119 align:start position:0%
and that that permitting stuff which is
 
01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
a big section for us perfect and so this
 
01:59:51.709 --> 01:59:51.719 align:start position:0%
afternoon I'm assuming there's going to
 
01:59:54.629 --> 01:59:54.639 align:start position:0%
be spaces here and there between bills I
 
01:59:56.510 --> 01:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
mean the bills aren't that big so
 
01:59:59.350 --> 01:59:59.360 align:start position:0%
therefore we can go back to this house
 
02:00:00.550 --> 02:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
actually the way we schedule that
 
02:00:02.669 --> 02:00:02.679 align:start position:0%
there's no Gap so we can just go one to
 
02:00:04.430 --> 02:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
the other to the other to the other so
 
02:00:06.109 --> 02:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
there's no Gap this afternoon there's no
 
02:00:06.119 --> 02:00:07.189 align:start position:0%
there's no Gap this afternoon there's no
times

02:00:07.189 --> 02:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
times
 
02:00:11.390 --> 02:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
for one running right but I'm saying you
 
02:00:12.910 --> 02:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
know representative Lynn's going to be
 
02:00:15.470 --> 02:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
here for his two bills at 3 o' and
 
02:00:17.350 --> 02:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
representative somebody else is going to
 
02:00:19.870 --> 02:00:19.880 align:start position:0%
be here at some other time so I'm I'm
 
02:00:21.990 --> 02:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
guessing there's going to be gaps right
 
02:00:24.750 --> 02:00:24.760 align:start position:0%
and so therefore we can we can continue
 
02:00:25.950 --> 02:00:25.960 align:start position:0%
with house building I don't think you're
 
02:00:27.430 --> 02:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
going to have many
 
02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
gaps there's too many bills
 
02:00:35.350 --> 02:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
be why they're pretty they're mostly
 
02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:37.109 align:start position:0%
be why they're pretty they're mostly
very

02:00:37.109 --> 02:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:00:39.430 --> 02:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
minor I think what you're saying though
 
02:00:41.750 --> 02:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
is you want to wait I mean there's no
 
02:00:43.390 --> 02:00:43.400 align:start position:0%
requirement you wait for the prime
 
02:00:45.270 --> 02:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor to work on the bill they don't
 
02:00:49.189 --> 02:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
show up maybe at the
 
02:00:53.830 --> 02:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
end well yeah
 
02:00:55.510 --> 02:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
all right I I wasn't necessarily going
 
02:00:59.830 --> 02:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
to take them in this order right
 
02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
so that's my my thing
 
02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
okay I'm stuck taking them in that order
 
02:01:09.350 --> 02:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I think you I think you are that's
 
02:01:11.270 --> 02:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
how you posted it they're all posted at
 
02:01:14.229 --> 02:01:14.239 align:start position:0%
1:00 I can't do them all at 1:00 no but
 
02:01:16.470 --> 02:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
you have to do them in the order that
 
02:01:18.510 --> 02:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
you have them listed the only one that
 
02:01:20.550 --> 02:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
technically is the one at one o00 the
 
02:01:22.589 --> 02:01:22.599 align:start position:0%
rest of them you can change there's no
 
02:01:26.510 --> 02:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
time on the rest of well I will say de
 
02:01:28.750 --> 02:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
assuming that it's going to be second
 
02:01:32.069 --> 02:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
mine and they will be here for that for
 
02:01:35.430 --> 02:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
your bill for 619 so i' would like to
 
02:01:39.069 --> 02:01:39.079 align:start position:0%
keep that at least second position
 
02:01:41.910 --> 02:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
okay that's fine I also want to note
 
02:01:45.550 --> 02:01:45.560 align:start position:0%
that um HB 619 is is a first committee
 
02:01:48.390 --> 02:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
bill so that one um has a tighter
 
02:01:50.510 --> 02:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
deadline than the rest of the bills okay
 
02:01:53.669 --> 02:01:53.679 align:start position:0%
so that one and so that means we we have
 
02:01:56.950 --> 02:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
to have a full committee something for
 
02:02:00.709 --> 02:02:00.719 align:start position:0%
that one right so maybe can we do that
 
02:02:03.310 --> 02:02:03.320 align:start position:0%
on Wednesday we were kind of hoping
 
02:02:05.430 --> 02:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
maybe we might be able to sneak it in
 
02:02:07.550 --> 02:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
depending on what the committee votes
 
02:02:08.750 --> 02:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
for the status of it I don't know if
 
02:02:10.669 --> 02:02:10.679 align:start position:0%
we're planning on retaining it doing an
 
02:02:12.589 --> 02:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
amendment or whatnot yeah because we
 
02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
could also vote on all of them do we
 
02:02:17.350 --> 02:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
have any other first committee bills
 
02:02:19.950 --> 02:02:19.960 align:start position:0%
this is the only Bill it's the other and
 
02:02:22.149 --> 02:02:22.159 align:start position:0%
we're going to retain it right yeah yes
 
02:02:24.229 --> 02:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
that would be my recomend but I would
 
02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
just say all those other ones whatever
 
02:02:28.589 --> 02:02:28.599 align:start position:0%
we recommend today we could vote on the
 
02:02:31.470 --> 02:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
same day so we wouldn't just be voting
 
02:02:34.510 --> 02:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
online oh you see what I'm saying so if
 
02:02:38.030 --> 02:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
we do if you are intending to um retain
 
02:02:40.589 --> 02:02:40.599 align:start position:0%
HB 619 that does push our date out to
 
02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
April 3rd so they will all fall into the
 
02:02:46.750 --> 02:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
same if you vote on doing OTP and itl
 
02:02:49.550 --> 02:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
otpa that we need to have out by March
 
02:02:51.950 --> 02:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
20th the full committee does so then
 
02:02:53.870 --> 02:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
would need to speak it in on Wednesday
 
02:02:55.790 --> 02:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
if we could yeah so right at the
 
02:02:59.069 --> 02:02:59.079 align:start position:0%
beginning of the public hearing we could
 
02:03:03.229 --> 02:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
have a real quick exact for this 619
 
02:03:05.069 --> 02:03:05.079 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah to just but if well if you
 
02:03:06.510 --> 02:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
chose to retain it you don't need to fit
 
02:03:09.709 --> 02:03:09.719 align:start position:0%
that in on Wednesday okay oh we don't
 
02:03:12.510 --> 02:03:12.520 align:start position:0%
have to no because all retained bills is
 
02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:14.350 align:start position:0%
have to no because all retained bills is
April

02:03:14.350 --> 02:03:14.360 align:start position:0%
April
 
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
3D oh even if it's first committee but
 
02:03:18.310 --> 02:03:18.320 align:start position:0%
we don't know that it's going to be
 
02:03:20.790 --> 02:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
retained until the full committee
 
02:03:24.589 --> 02:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
decides to right that's a fair statement
 
02:03:30.310 --> 02:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
okay all right so um let's tell Janet to
 
02:03:33.310 --> 02:03:33.320 align:start position:0%
schedule an exec session on
 
02:03:36.629 --> 02:03:36.639 align:start position:0%
6:19 for Wednesday okay okay you want to
 
02:03:40.069 --> 02:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
do like half hour 15 minutes 20 minutes

03:03:06.269 --> 03:03:06.279 align:start position:0%
work session on House Bill 650
 
03:03:09.790 --> 03:03:09.800 align:start position:0%
FN uh which is about removing references
 
03:03:12.550 --> 03:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
to repeal funds and relative to State
 
03:03:15.269 --> 03:03:15.279 align:start position:0%
Park and Robotics education
 
03:03:17.870 --> 03:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
funds um
 
03:03:21.150 --> 03:03:21.160 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire is the co main
 
03:03:24.670 --> 03:03:24.680 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill and uh he had asked
 
03:03:27.870 --> 03:03:27.880 align:start position:0%
me to convey to the committee that this
 
03:03:36.710 --> 03:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:40.070 --> 03:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
Bill representative cell yes this is
 
03:03:42.110 --> 03:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
just sort of everybody has a packet of
 
03:03:44.030 --> 03:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
the bills on their desk they also have a
 
03:03:46.630 --> 03:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
packet of revised fiscal notes as well
 
03:03:47.790 --> 03:03:47.800 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure everybody's
 
03:03:50.150 --> 03:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
looking at the most upto-date
 
03:03:52.990 --> 03:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
information for the revised fiscal notes
 
03:03:54.630 --> 03:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
there's revised fiscal note packet on
 
03:03:58.110 --> 03:03:58.120 align:start position:0%
your desk and the packet of
 
03:04:00.790 --> 03:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
bills so this the fiscal note that you
 
03:04:05.870 --> 03:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:07.670 --> 03:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
2525 so just want to make sure
 
03:04:08.910 --> 03:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
everyone's looking at the right
 
03:04:10.550 --> 03:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
information I'm sorry could you could
 
03:04:12.590 --> 03:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
you repeat that sure the fisal note was
 
03:04:15.710 --> 03:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
revised on February 25th 2025 so I just
 
03:04:17.469 --> 03:04:17.479 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that's the one that
 
03:04:20.870 --> 03:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
you're looking at okay and if it's not
 
03:04:22.229 --> 03:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
in the bill that you have in front of
 
03:04:24.910 --> 03:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
you it is in your revised fiscal note
 
03:04:27.990 --> 03:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
packet so you'll have two two
 
03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:37.550 align:start position:0%
packet so you'll have two two
packets

03:04:37.550 --> 03:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:40.790 --> 03:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
okay so basically the main things that
 
03:04:44.150 --> 03:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh as I stated um there's just some
 
03:04:49.630 --> 03:04:49.640 align:start position:0%
housekeeping that's uh uh fix ing this
 
03:04:54.429 --> 03:04:54.439 align:start position:0%
this current RSA uh the main thing is uh
 
03:04:56.269 --> 03:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
down on line
 
03:04:59.790 --> 03:04:59.800 align:start position:0%
19 the for the uh unencumbered balances
 
03:05:02.269 --> 03:05:02.279 align:start position:0%
of the robotics fun education
 
03:05:05.190 --> 03:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
fund the uh there's a change to
 
03:05:07.150 --> 03:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
currently they get
 
03:05:10.630 --> 03:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
$750,000 a year the change is to cap it
 
03:05:14.870 --> 03:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
at 1 million so that any money that uh
 
03:05:16.670 --> 03:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
that goes above 1 million will lapse
 
03:05:18.229 --> 03:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
into the general
 
03:05:18.239 --> 03:05:20.150 align:start position:0%
into the general
general

03:05:20.150 --> 03:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
general
 
03:05:42.670 --> 03:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:48.229 --> 03:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:50.510 --> 03:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
so basically no discussion this will be
 
03:05:52.190 --> 03:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
something that we're going to we're not
 
03:05:55.309 --> 03:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
going to execute uh today but we will be
 
03:05:57.590 --> 03:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
most likely making an OTP motion on this
 
03:06:00.830 --> 03:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
one and when when we get everybody gets
 
03:06:00.840 --> 03:06:03.429 align:start position:0%
one and when when we get everybody gets
back

03:06:03.429 --> 03:06:03.439 align:start position:0%
back
 
03:06:07.110 --> 03:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative eil um so this
 
03:06:09.229 --> 03:06:09.239 align:start position:0%
went through sorry I think everybody's
 
03:06:11.030 --> 03:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
just catching up here this went through
 
03:06:13.790 --> 03:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
ways and means right and then it came
 
03:06:16.429 --> 03:06:16.439 align:start position:0%
through on the house floor I just
 
03:06:19.550 --> 03:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
wondered so remember um last term when
 
03:06:21.510 --> 03:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
we had bills that had
 
03:06:24.190 --> 03:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
been second committee bills coming to
 
03:06:27.429 --> 03:06:27.439 align:start position:0%
finance we generally we asked what the
 
03:06:29.309 --> 03:06:29.319 align:start position:0%
status was coming off the
 
03:06:32.389 --> 03:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
floor if it was consent calendar or what
 
03:06:32.399 --> 03:06:41.510 align:start position:0%
floor if it was consent calendar or what
it

03:06:41.510 --> 03:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:46.229 --> 03:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
was sure okay um so it came out of
 
03:06:46.239 --> 03:06:47.910 align:start position:0%
was sure okay um so it came out of
committee

03:06:47.910 --> 03:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:06:49.710 --> 03:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
came out of ways and means ought to pass
 
03:06:53.550 --> 03:06:53.560 align:start position:0%
16 to zero um and then it went to the
 
03:06:56.229 --> 03:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
house floor it was ought to pass um
 
03:06:58.550 --> 03:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
majority accepted by a Voice vote on
 
03:07:00.550 --> 03:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
February 20th and then referred to
 
03:07:05.110 --> 03:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:09.190 --> 03:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
right so just on these bills uh Mr Vice
 
03:07:11.229 --> 03:07:11.239 align:start position:0%
chair then we're going to be deciding
 
03:07:13.389 --> 03:07:13.399 align:start position:0%
whether to retain or just to make a
 
03:07:15.469 --> 03:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
motion ought to pass and let them fly
 
03:07:19.389 --> 03:07:19.399 align:start position:0%
off on their own is that the idea yes
 
03:07:21.269 --> 03:07:21.279 align:start position:0%
okay but we should wait till the prime
 
03:07:23.550 --> 03:07:23.560 align:start position:0%
is here is that yes I would like to do
 
03:07:27.229 --> 03:07:27.239 align:start position:0%
that plus we're missing two two of our
 
03:07:29.710 --> 03:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
people so
 
03:07:32.630 --> 03:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
okay any further
 
03:07:35.630 --> 03:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
discussion okay we close that work
 
03:07:40.349 --> 03:07:40.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:40.359 --> 03:07:44.070 align:start position:0%
 
650

03:07:44.070 --> 03:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:47.550 --> 03:07:47.560 align:start position:0%
and me
 
03:07:49.870 --> 03:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
we open up a session work session on
 
03:07:52.910 --> 03:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 619
 
03:07:55.910 --> 03:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
FNA um would the sponsor like to speak
 
03:08:00.110 --> 03:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
to this so I can just go down there that
 
03:08:43.510 --> 03:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:47.670 --> 03:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
very much um so unlike the other my name
 
03:08:51.389 --> 03:08:51.399 align:start position:0%
is Karen Eble uh marac district 7 unlike
 
03:08:53.190 --> 03:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
the other bills that we're dealing with
 
03:08:55.710 --> 03:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
this Finance is a first committee bill
 
03:08:57.990 --> 03:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
in this case it didn't so it came
 
03:09:01.389 --> 03:09:01.399 align:start position:0%
directly to us um it didn't go through a
 
03:09:05.349 --> 03:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
a committee previously so you may recall
 
03:09:10.229 --> 03:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
um at the hearing um what the upshot of
 
03:09:13.990 --> 03:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is um in the last budget we
 
03:09:16.190 --> 03:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
put a couple of million dollars into the
 
03:09:19.590 --> 03:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
solid waste management fund which is a
 
03:09:24.150 --> 03:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
fund that is a um is a grant program for
 
03:09:29.469 --> 03:09:29.479 align:start position:0%
municipalities and for businesses um to
 
03:09:33.150 --> 03:09:33.160 align:start position:0%
use for Waste diversion efforts and also
 
03:09:35.110 --> 03:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
there's an emphasis in here that we
 
03:09:38.190 --> 03:09:38.200 align:start position:0%
actually we did this as part of hb2 last
 
03:09:43.030 --> 03:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
time have a 50% priority for food waste
 
03:09:44.950 --> 03:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
diversion and you may remember from the
 
03:09:46.870 --> 03:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
hearing we talked a lot about the
 
03:09:46.880 --> 03:09:48.190 align:start position:0%
hearing we talked a lot about the
benefit

03:09:48.190 --> 03:09:48.200 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
03:09:52.070 --> 03:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
of food waste aversion and how we can um
 
03:09:54.229 --> 03:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
how we it can help save money in the
 
03:09:58.550 --> 03:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
long run and it also helps with landfill
 
03:10:02.229 --> 03:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
capacity um the bill does call for a
 
03:10:06.150 --> 03:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
million dollars in general funds but you
 
03:10:10.110 --> 03:10:10.120 align:start position:0%
may also recall that at the last um at
 
03:10:12.870 --> 03:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
the original hearing the conversation on
 
03:10:15.990 --> 03:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
the bill talked rather quickly because
 
03:10:18.150 --> 03:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
of the revenue situation ation we're in
 
03:10:21.150 --> 03:10:21.160 align:start position:0%
into um alternative sources of income
 
03:10:24.910 --> 03:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
for something like this so the main
 
03:10:27.990 --> 03:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
point of my presentation to you today
 
03:10:29.910 --> 03:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
and to the and the materials that I
 
03:10:34.030 --> 03:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
brought you um is to talk a little bit
 
03:10:38.469 --> 03:10:38.479 align:start position:0%
about what um like 30 to 35 states in
 
03:10:42.750 --> 03:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
the United States do um in the uh with
 
03:10:46.349 --> 03:10:46.359 align:start position:0%
respect to funding when it comes to um a
 
03:10:49.550 --> 03:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
management fund like this and that is
 
03:10:52.710 --> 03:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
that what they what a lot of states do
 
03:10:55.990 --> 03:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
is they have the The Tipping fee is the
 
03:10:58.950 --> 03:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
fee that you pay per ton when your trash
 
03:11:00.990 --> 03:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
goes to the landfill right or waste to
 
03:11:04.550 --> 03:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
energy plant and so in many many cases
 
03:11:07.590 --> 03:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
what most people do is they have a rate
 
03:11:10.510 --> 03:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
that they contract for you know like
 
03:11:12.710 --> 03:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities like in my case in New
 
03:11:17.750 --> 03:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
London it's $66 a ton um so
 
03:11:21.150 --> 03:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
what a huge number of states do is on
 
03:11:24.309 --> 03:11:24.319 align:start position:0%
top of the Tipping fee there's also what
 
03:11:27.190 --> 03:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
they call a waste disposal search charge
 
03:11:29.670 --> 03:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
and when we were talking about that in
 
03:11:33.429 --> 03:11:33.439 align:start position:0%
the hearing uh representative Maguire
 
03:11:37.510 --> 03:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
asked for more information on that
 
03:11:40.750 --> 03:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
option um as a way of replacing general
 
03:11:44.790 --> 03:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
fund Revenue so what I did in the packet
 
03:11:47.349 --> 03:11:47.359 align:start position:0%
I I did reprint my testimony which you
 
03:11:49.670 --> 03:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
guys would have had from before the
 
03:11:52.349 --> 03:11:52.359 align:start position:0%
second thing in the packet um is an
 
03:11:55.429 --> 03:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
email that was sent to us by Mike gorc
 
03:11:57.870 --> 03:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
um responding to rep representative
 
03:12:01.389 --> 03:12:01.399 align:start position:0%
Maguire's inquiry because um he was
 
03:12:05.110 --> 03:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
asking what the fund what the fees were
 
03:12:09.469 --> 03:12:09.479 align:start position:0%
in other states in the in the area so um
 
03:12:12.030 --> 03:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
in Connecticut you can see it's a
 
03:12:17.229 --> 03:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
$150 main um the second the page after
 
03:12:19.630 --> 03:12:19.640 align:start position:0%
Mike's email I printed out the statute
 
03:12:21.950 --> 03:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
Maine has a variety of SE charges
 
03:12:24.190 --> 03:12:24.200 align:start position:0%
depending on the thing that's going into
 
03:12:24.200 --> 03:12:24.910 align:start position:0%
depending on the thing that's going into
the

03:12:24.910 --> 03:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:12:28.349 --> 03:12:28.359 align:start position:0%
landfill um Massachusetts doesn't have a
 
03:12:30.670 --> 03:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
sear charge but it works through
 
03:12:32.990 --> 03:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credits I wouldn't say
 
03:12:34.710 --> 03:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
that was a model that we were going to
 
03:12:38.910 --> 03:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
use New Jersey is $3 a ton uh
 
03:12:38.920 --> 03:12:40.590 align:start position:0%
use New Jersey is $3 a ton uh
Pennsylvania

03:12:40.590 --> 03:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania
 
03:12:43.110 --> 03:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
625 Vermont is
 
03:12:47.190 --> 03:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
$6 um the other document that I Prov
 
03:12:49.550 --> 03:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
provided to you later on in the packet I
 
03:12:51.910 --> 03:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
actually went to ncsl and I asked them
 
03:12:55.309 --> 03:12:55.319 align:start position:0%
to do a 50 state survey of uh waste
 
03:12:58.229 --> 03:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
disposal SE charges and I just got this
 
03:13:01.710 --> 03:13:01.720 align:start position:0%
like two days ago so you can see all the
 
03:13:03.269 --> 03:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
states that do
 
03:13:03.279 --> 03:13:05.429 align:start position:0%
states that do
this

03:13:05.429 --> 03:13:05.439 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:13:10.229 --> 03:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
um so that is that I just for context as
 
03:13:12.630 --> 03:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the as as we're looking
 
03:13:17.150 --> 03:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
at this um fee discussion I just want to
 
03:13:20.670 --> 03:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
describe what the regional situation is
 
03:13:24.070 --> 03:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
with landfills so I think just as a
 
03:13:25.950 --> 03:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
starting point we all know that the
 
03:13:28.510 --> 03:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce clause doesn't allow
 
03:13:32.229 --> 03:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
us to ban outof State waste coming into
 
03:13:34.670 --> 03:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
our state so if you have a private
 
03:13:38.429 --> 03:13:38.439 align:start position:0%
landfill um you're allowed by the law
 
03:13:41.110 --> 03:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
under certain State restrictions to have
 
03:13:44.590 --> 03:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
out of state waste so that's and that's
 
03:13:46.630 --> 03:13:46.640 align:start position:0%
sort of the situation in New Hampshire
 
03:13:48.349 --> 03:13:48.359 align:start position:0%
that's why about half of the waste that
 
03:13:50.389 --> 03:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
comes into New Hampshire goes into these
 
03:13:53.269 --> 03:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
large landfills and it is outof State
 
03:13:56.590 --> 03:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
waste when you're looking at Maine for
 
03:13:59.389 --> 03:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
instance if we're thinking about uh the
 
03:14:01.190 --> 03:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
fees that they charge you have to
 
03:14:03.870 --> 03:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
remember that Maine is a state owned
 
03:14:08.110 --> 03:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
landfill they own their own landfill so
 
03:14:10.550 --> 03:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
um this whole issue of the interstate
 
03:14:12.429 --> 03:14:12.439 align:start position:0%
commerce clause or whatever just really
 
03:14:14.990 --> 03:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't even come up nobody is going to
 
03:14:17.670 --> 03:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
be raising the issue because
 
03:14:20.750 --> 03:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
if you own if a state or a municipality
 
03:14:23.670 --> 03:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
owns the landfill they just take what
 
03:14:26.830 --> 03:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
they want right so any fees that they're
 
03:14:28.830 --> 03:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
charging they're kind of charging
 
03:14:31.469 --> 03:14:31.479 align:start position:0%
themselves in a way so so that's one
 
03:14:34.469 --> 03:14:34.479 align:start position:0%
thing about Maine in Vermont they only
 
03:14:37.309 --> 03:14:37.319 align:start position:0%
have one f one landfill it's a private
 
03:14:40.349 --> 03:14:40.359 align:start position:0%
landfill it's run by cassella it's way
 
03:14:44.349 --> 03:14:44.359 align:start position:0%
up in the Northeast Kingdom um so the
 
03:14:47.070 --> 03:14:47.080 align:start position:0%
whole idea of trucking from out of state
 
03:14:50.229 --> 03:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
to Vermont isn't as much of an is kind
 
03:14:52.070 --> 03:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
of an issue and the other thing is
 
03:14:55.590 --> 03:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
Vermont has very tight regulations on
 
03:14:58.950 --> 03:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
what is allowed to go into a landfill so
 
03:15:01.429 --> 03:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
you have Maine which has a state-owned
 
03:15:03.550 --> 03:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
landfill and isn't really taking out of
 
03:15:07.349 --> 03:15:07.359 align:start position:0%
state waste you have Vermont which has
 
03:15:10.469 --> 03:15:10.479 align:start position:0%
one landfill severe restrictions way up
 
03:15:12.870 --> 03:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
North you have Massachusetts I think at
 
03:15:14.950 --> 03:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
this point they only have one operating
 
03:15:17.349 --> 03:15:17.359 align:start position:0%
landfill and maybe a couple of waste to
 
03:15:20.910 --> 03:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
energy plants and the very large
 
03:15:23.870 --> 03:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
percentage of their waste is e either
 
03:15:25.990 --> 03:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
being trucked out to Ohio or
 
03:15:28.590 --> 03:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania or it's coming to New
 
03:15:32.710 --> 03:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so um and in Connecticut
 
03:15:34.990 --> 03:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
they've lost a vast amount of their
 
03:15:37.229 --> 03:15:37.239 align:start position:0%
disposal capacity because their waste to
 
03:15:40.269 --> 03:15:40.279 align:start position:0%
energy plants are decreasing so I just I
 
03:15:42.389 --> 03:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
just say that to give sort of the
 
03:15:45.590 --> 03:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
regional context of what we're looking
 
03:15:48.990 --> 03:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
at here and why I won't say there's a
 
03:15:51.990 --> 03:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
bullseye but there's really a big option
 
03:15:53.910 --> 03:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
for out of state waste in the state of
 
03:15:56.870 --> 03:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:16:01.110 --> 03:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
so then when you're talking about waste
 
03:16:04.790 --> 03:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
disposal sech charges you have to charge
 
03:16:08.070 --> 03:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
the same um search charge under the
 
03:16:10.309 --> 03:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce clause on everything
 
03:16:12.670 --> 03:16:12.680 align:start position:0%
that's coming into the state so out of
 
03:16:14.710 --> 03:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
state and instate
 
03:16:19.110 --> 03:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
waste but when we so the proposal would
 
03:16:22.150 --> 03:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
be that you take the waste disposal
 
03:16:25.269 --> 03:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
search charge money and you put it all
 
03:16:28.710 --> 03:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
into the solid waste management fund
 
03:16:29.750 --> 03:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
that we
 
03:16:34.229 --> 03:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
created but the concept here is that in
 
03:16:36.710 --> 03:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
addition to using the solid waste
 
03:16:40.590 --> 03:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
management fund just as a grant program
 
03:16:46.950 --> 03:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
you use the fee money to basically fund
 
03:16:50.990 --> 03:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
the solid waste Bureau at the depart at
 
03:16:54.990 --> 03:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
at Dees so you're using the dispo this
 
03:16:58.870 --> 03:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
the searge money instead of General
 
03:17:03.830 --> 03:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
funds to fund your Solid Waste work and
 
03:17:05.830 --> 03:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of what they do is oversee
 
03:17:07.469 --> 03:17:07.479 align:start position:0%
disposal and we're talking about
 
03:17:11.550 --> 03:17:11.560 align:start position:0%
disposal right so in looking through the
 
03:17:14.269 --> 03:17:14.279 align:start position:0%
ncsl materials and looking what
 
03:17:16.550 --> 03:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
regionally what they do with it a lot of
 
03:17:19.110 --> 03:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
this is is what a lot of states do they
 
03:17:22.110 --> 03:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
fund within their agency their Solid
 
03:17:24.630 --> 03:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
Waste work with these disposal search
 
03:17:28.309 --> 03:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
charges and they also use them to fund
 
03:17:33.469 --> 03:17:33.479 align:start position:0%
grants and so um I think you know since
 
03:17:36.950 --> 03:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
we're doing a lot of exploration of fees
 
03:17:39.990 --> 03:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
and and how long ago they were set and
 
03:17:42.269 --> 03:17:42.279 align:start position:0%
all that and and trying to find ways to
 
03:17:44.309 --> 03:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
replace the general fund money that has
 
03:17:48.110 --> 03:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
been lost this is an option that is not
 
03:17:50.910 --> 03:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
unusual at all in fact it's common I
 
03:17:52.990 --> 03:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
don't really understand why we haven't
 
03:17:55.630 --> 03:17:55.640 align:start position:0%
been doing it um it would replace
 
03:17:58.750 --> 03:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
general fund money it would help out I
 
03:18:01.229 --> 03:18:01.239 align:start position:0%
think the solid waste Bureau within the
 
03:18:03.550 --> 03:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
waste division at Dees because it would
 
03:18:07.030 --> 03:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
be more of a sustainable um line of
 
03:18:10.910 --> 03:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
funding and it also supports the long
 
03:18:13.429 --> 03:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
range Solid Waste Management plan
 
03:18:16.269 --> 03:18:16.279 align:start position:0%
because there's something in there about
 
03:18:18.389 --> 03:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
trying to find more sustainable funding
 
03:18:22.189 --> 03:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
or alternatives to general fund so
 
03:18:26.030 --> 03:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's the idea um there's a lot
 
03:18:28.870 --> 03:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
of ways to work this out
 
03:18:31.790 --> 03:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if director whims is
 
03:18:35.830 --> 03:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
here but I did I okay I did uh talk to
 
03:18:38.550 --> 03:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
him about putting together some some
 
03:18:40.469 --> 03:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
language that was based on a bill that
 
03:18:43.349 --> 03:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
we did before the numbers that we were
 
03:18:46.070 --> 03:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
talking about what I said to him why
 
03:18:48.870 --> 03:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
don't we start the discussion at 350 we
 
03:18:52.030 --> 03:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
can go up we can go down uh we can
 
03:18:53.830 --> 03:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
estimate the funds that would come out
 
03:18:56.269 --> 03:18:56.279 align:start position:0%
of that amount of money the thing to
 
03:18:59.590 --> 03:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
know about it is
 
03:19:02.870 --> 03:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
that we can once the money is in the
 
03:19:06.189 --> 03:19:06.199 align:start position:0%
solid waste management fund if we want
 
03:19:09.309 --> 03:19:09.319 align:start position:0%
to and this is what how we had conceived
 
03:19:12.269 --> 03:19:12.279 align:start position:0%
of it you can actually refund the money
 
03:19:15.150 --> 03:19:15.160 align:start position:0%
that municipalities paid back to the
 
03:19:15.160 --> 03:19:17.309 align:start position:0%
that municipalities paid back to the
municipalities

03:19:17.309 --> 03:19:17.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
03:19:20.389 --> 03:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
and you can keep the money that you got
 
03:19:24.150 --> 03:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
from out of state within the fund for us
 
03:19:27.510 --> 03:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
to use for our agency purposes that
 
03:19:29.830 --> 03:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't violate the interstate commerce
 
03:19:32.790 --> 03:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
clause so we have once we would get the
 
03:19:34.950 --> 03:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
money and put it in the solid waste
 
03:19:37.750 --> 03:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
management fund we have flexibility on
 
03:19:41.150 --> 03:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
how it could be used
 
03:19:44.670 --> 03:19:44.680 align:start position:0%
so I actually you know it it's obviously
 
03:19:47.030 --> 03:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
up to the committee and I think we'll
 
03:19:48.830 --> 03:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
have to talk about it further but I
 
03:19:51.429 --> 03:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
think it's a really good option for us
 
03:19:55.550 --> 03:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
to consider as a way of um replacing
 
03:19:57.910 --> 03:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
general fund dollars with this sort of
 
03:20:01.750 --> 03:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
money um to help out the um with the
 
03:20:03.229 --> 03:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
whole budget
 
03:20:06.269 --> 03:20:06.279 align:start position:0%
situation okay so we presumably going to
 
03:20:08.750 --> 03:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
be retaining this bill however in light
 
03:20:11.389 --> 03:20:11.399 align:start position:0%
of what You' stated we will wait to see
 
03:20:14.150 --> 03:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
if there's an amendment uh would would
 
03:20:15.870 --> 03:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
there be one forthcoming yeah there were
 
03:20:18.510 --> 03:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
well I think this was what I thank you
 
03:20:21.630 --> 03:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
um Mr Vice chair I would urge the
 
03:20:23.269 --> 03:20:23.279 align:start position:0%
committee I mean I think we could even
 
03:20:25.710 --> 03:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
vote today to retain the to retain the
 
03:20:27.790 --> 03:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
bill and it's a first committee bill so
 
03:20:30.510 --> 03:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
maybe we should um I do have some
 
03:20:32.790 --> 03:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
language I didn't make multiple copies
 
03:20:34.830 --> 03:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
that I could share with you guys but I
 
03:20:38.229 --> 03:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
didn't prepare an amendment that's like
 
03:20:39.910 --> 03:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment because I think we have
 
03:20:41.510 --> 03:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
some more discussion we should have
 
03:20:43.870 --> 03:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
about how we want the money used and
 
03:20:46.189 --> 03:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
what we want the fee to be and that sort
 
03:20:49.269 --> 03:20:49.279 align:start position:0%
of thing representative Ms if we do
 
03:20:50.910 --> 03:20:50.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:20:53.590 --> 03:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
my question do you do you have any idea
 
03:20:55.830 --> 03:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
or any sense of what the total
 
03:20:58.590 --> 03:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
tonnage coming into landfalls is think
 
03:21:01.150 --> 03:21:01.160 align:start position:0%
it would be really great if if uh
 
03:21:03.790 --> 03:21:03.800 align:start position:0%
director whimet could come up here and
 
03:21:06.710 --> 03:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit more about the money
 
03:21:09.469 --> 03:21:09.479 align:start position:0%
and I I want to make sure that I've
 
03:21:14.670 --> 03:21:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:16.910 --> 03:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
sure yes uh good afternoon members of
 
03:21:18.150 --> 03:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
03:21:19.950 --> 03:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
Mike wisat I serve as director of the
 
03:21:21.150 --> 03:21:21.160 align:start position:0%
waste management division for New
 
03:21:23.870 --> 03:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees and representative M
 
03:21:26.349 --> 03:21:26.359 align:start position:0%
asked your question um over the last
 
03:21:28.750 --> 03:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
several years the um total amount of
 
03:21:30.870 --> 03:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
waste disposed of whether from instate
 
03:21:33.030 --> 03:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
both instate and out ofate waste has
 
03:21:36.790 --> 03:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
hovered around 2 million ton and um last
 
03:21:38.550 --> 03:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
year we had a little bit of a drop off
 
03:21:41.630 --> 03:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
in that it was around 1.75 or 1.78
 
03:21:44.550 --> 03:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
million tons so if you you know look in
 
03:21:45.990 --> 03:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
round numbers if you look at the 2
 
03:21:50.910 --> 03:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
million ton figure a a $3.50 fee would
 
03:21:53.070 --> 03:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
be expected to collect about $7
 
03:21:55.630 --> 03:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
million and if you want to break it down
 
03:21:57.429 --> 03:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
based on the description that
 
03:22:00.910 --> 03:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
representative eel has presented um the
 
03:22:04.349 --> 03:22:04.359 align:start position:0%
the right now the hp1 uh you know
 
03:22:06.590 --> 03:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
proposed budgets for the solid waste
 
03:22:08.670 --> 03:22:08.680 align:start position:0%
program in full all positions fully
 
03:22:11.110 --> 03:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
loaded you know all all overhead the
 
03:22:12.870 --> 03:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
solid waste landfill grant program that
 
03:22:15.790 --> 03:22:15.800 align:start position:0%
we make payments to municipalities on um
 
03:22:18.990 --> 03:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
that is um hovering just under just
 
03:22:21.910 --> 03:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
about $3 million per year so if you were
 
03:22:24.510 --> 03:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
to raise $7 million in in funds you
 
03:22:26.229 --> 03:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
would be able to take that entire
 
03:22:28.710 --> 03:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
program off of General funds you would
 
03:22:30.830 --> 03:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
also be we would expect and this these
 
03:22:33.070 --> 03:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
are numbers I just recently gotten from
 
03:22:35.030 --> 03:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
my staff it's a little bit hard for us
 
03:22:37.750 --> 03:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
to estimate how much money would go back
 
03:22:37.760 --> 03:22:38.710 align:start position:0%
to estimate how much money would go back
to

03:22:38.710 --> 03:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:22:40.670 --> 03:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities because we don't really
 
03:22:42.750 --> 03:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
have hard numbers on that but based on
 
03:22:44.630 --> 03:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
work we've done if we look really
 
03:22:47.349 --> 03:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
conservatively at it it might be out of
 
03:22:49.309 --> 03:22:49.319 align:start position:0%
that $7 million figure it might be
 
03:22:50.870 --> 03:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
somewhere on the order of between 1 and
 
03:22:53.269 --> 03:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
2 million so let's say it's the worst
 
03:22:54.870 --> 03:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
not the worst case it's a good case if
 
03:22:56.189 --> 03:22:56.199 align:start position:0%
it's 2 million going back to
 
03:22:57.910 --> 03:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities I think it's less than
 
03:22:59.910 --> 03:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
that but if it were that'd be about 5
 
03:23:02.750 --> 03:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
million and that would leave 2 million
 
03:23:06.189 --> 03:23:06.199 align:start position:0%
um for U making grants to uh
 
03:23:08.229 --> 03:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities to nonprofits to
 
03:23:09.990 --> 03:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
businesses to anybody who's going to
 
03:23:12.309 --> 03:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
advance a technology and a facility
 
03:23:13.990 --> 03:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
that's going to help divert waste and
 
03:23:16.189 --> 03:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
and invent increase our recycling rates
 
03:23:17.870 --> 03:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
so so it's a it's you know
 
03:23:20.110 --> 03:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
comprehensively it really addresses a
 
03:23:22.309 --> 03:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
lot of the needs that the program and
 
03:23:24.189 --> 03:23:24.199 align:start position:0%
and our and our state's management of
 
03:23:27.550 --> 03:23:27.560 align:start position:0%
solid waste has been lacking in over the
 
03:23:30.309 --> 03:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
years yes follow up just follow up so so
 
03:23:32.030 --> 03:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
just to make sure I'm clear so what
 
03:23:34.710 --> 03:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
you're saying is if we did this all the
 
03:23:37.110 --> 03:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
expenses of your division would be fully
 
03:23:39.309 --> 03:23:39.319 align:start position:0%
funded by this fee that's correct we
 
03:23:40.630 --> 03:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
believe it would do that it would it
 
03:23:42.910 --> 03:23:42.920 align:start position:0%
would completely fund that budget and it
 
03:23:44.990 --> 03:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
would take 19 positions off of General
 
03:23:45.000 --> 03:23:47.389 align:start position:0%
would take 19 positions off of General
funds

03:23:47.389 --> 03:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
funds
 
03:23:49.990 --> 03:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative Rong thank you Mr
 
03:23:53.189 --> 03:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
chair so um have you seen in the
 
03:23:54.950 --> 03:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
experience of other states that have
 
03:23:58.030 --> 03:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
this type of search charge that there is
 
03:24:00.590 --> 03:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
more waste diversion maybe to re
 
03:24:03.870 --> 03:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
recycling or or like reduction with food
 
03:24:07.750 --> 03:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
waste so over time you would kind of see
 
03:24:10.910 --> 03:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
the amount of money raised would be
 
03:24:13.469 --> 03:24:13.479 align:start position:0%
lowering because there's less waste
 
03:24:16.229 --> 03:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
being in because municipalities are out
 
03:24:18.189 --> 03:24:18.199 align:start position:0%
of state or businesses want to reduce
 
03:24:20.950 --> 03:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
that the amount that they're paying for
 
03:24:23.950 --> 03:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
Waste Disposal yes so that would
 
03:24:25.670 --> 03:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
actually even though it would result in
 
03:24:28.429 --> 03:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
less revenues would you also say it it
 
03:24:31.030 --> 03:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
would help us reduce the whole issue
 
03:24:33.670 --> 03:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
with you know a chunk of issue with
 
03:24:35.630 --> 03:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
solid waste sure the the way that the
 
03:24:37.830 --> 03:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
fund is designed is to you know kind of
 
03:24:39.830 --> 03:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
work work that fee downward if you will
 
03:24:41.950 --> 03:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
because the all of the monies that are
 
03:24:44.670 --> 03:24:44.680 align:start position:0%
used are in many respects either
 
03:24:46.750 --> 03:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
directly or indirectly focused on
 
03:24:48.110 --> 03:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
reducing the amount of waste that we
 
03:24:50.229 --> 03:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
dispose of and increasing the amount of
 
03:24:52.269 --> 03:24:52.279 align:start position:0%
waste that is managed through more
 
03:24:54.349 --> 03:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
sustainable methods like composting or
 
03:24:57.790 --> 03:24:57.800 align:start position:0%
recycling or waste reduction that's a
 
03:25:00.790 --> 03:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
followup Mr chair yes thank you and
 
03:25:02.670 --> 03:25:02.680 align:start position:0%
representative eel as far as the
 
03:25:05.830 --> 03:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
amendment goes that would delineate the
 
03:25:08.030 --> 03:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh sir charge and I would assume there'
 
03:25:09.590 --> 03:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
probably be some administrative Ru
 
03:25:12.269 --> 03:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
making that would be required by Dees
 
03:25:13.550 --> 03:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
that would be incorporated in the
 
03:25:17.469 --> 03:25:17.479 align:start position:0%
amendment right I mean so I just it's
 
03:25:19.710 --> 03:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
not quite at a point I we need to pass
 
03:25:21.910 --> 03:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
it all out but basically what it says is
 
03:25:26.910 --> 03:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
the it it authorizes the fund um to be
 
03:25:30.590 --> 03:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
used in a way to help the department as
 
03:25:32.950 --> 03:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
we talked about to replace general fund
 
03:25:36.630 --> 03:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
dollars um it talks about the grant uh
 
03:25:39.309 --> 03:25:39.319 align:start position:0%
program it talks about the refund to the
 
03:25:43.189 --> 03:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities the mechanism for that um
 
03:25:46.510 --> 03:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
and it establishes the search charge by
 
03:25:50.550 --> 03:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
statute I mean we could allow increases
 
03:25:54.189 --> 03:25:54.199 align:start position:0%
at the you know if the if the if the
 
03:25:56.189 --> 03:25:56.199 align:start position:0%
agency wanted to do it I mean that's
 
03:25:58.830 --> 03:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
within our power it and it also just
 
03:26:02.309 --> 03:26:02.319 align:start position:0%
sort of sets up how the how the um money
 
03:26:04.269 --> 03:26:04.279 align:start position:0%
is paid how it's
 
03:26:07.830 --> 03:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
refunded um and and that's basically the
 
03:26:11.229 --> 03:26:11.239 align:start position:0%
upshot it's a pretty comprehensive um
 
03:26:14.150 --> 03:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
look at the thing I think I think you're
 
03:26:17.750 --> 03:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
right if it works over time the amount
 
03:26:19.469 --> 03:26:19.479 align:start position:0%
of money that would be raised through
 
03:26:22.429 --> 03:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
the sear charge would start to decrease
 
03:26:24.189 --> 03:26:24.199 align:start position:0%
but that would also mean that we're
 
03:26:27.750 --> 03:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
accomplishing our goals right and it
 
03:26:30.150 --> 03:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
also maybe there'll be less out of state
 
03:26:33.950 --> 03:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
waste here I mean it's just kind of I
 
03:26:36.150 --> 03:26:36.160 align:start position:0%
mean I I like it because I think it's
 
03:26:39.150 --> 03:26:39.160 align:start position:0%
just a really Common Sense alternative
 
03:26:41.830 --> 03:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
to what we're doing right now it's a
 
03:26:44.389 --> 03:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
commonly used alternative that other
 
03:26:48.550 --> 03:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
states use um and you know let's face it
 
03:26:50.469 --> 03:26:50.479 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes to out of state
 
03:26:52.550 --> 03:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
waste New Hampshire continues to Bear
 
03:26:56.389 --> 03:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
the burden of the landfills that are
 
03:26:58.389 --> 03:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
here and yes they're bonded if they're
 
03:27:00.229 --> 03:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
leaking or something like that but
 
03:27:02.830 --> 03:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
they're with us for perpetuity so it
 
03:27:06.630 --> 03:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
seems to me that it's fair to have outof
 
03:27:09.469 --> 03:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
state waste be paying this you know
 
03:27:11.630 --> 03:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
people like Somerville or whatever if
 
03:27:13.790 --> 03:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
they're sending their trash here that
 
03:27:15.710 --> 03:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
they give a little bit of a sech charge
 
03:27:17.990 --> 03:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
to us I mean otherwise all they're doing
 
03:27:21.469 --> 03:27:21.479 align:start position:0%
is paying the Tipping fee yeah um I mean
 
03:27:23.389 --> 03:27:23.399 align:start position:0%
I think it's a very New Hampshire
 
03:27:25.830 --> 03:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
approach to the situation one more
 
03:27:27.950 --> 03:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
followup followup and I just want to
 
03:27:31.030 --> 03:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
make note and see if you agree with me
 
03:27:34.150 --> 03:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
that this would also help address leech
 
03:27:38.070 --> 03:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
a treatment so the lower our Solid Waste
 
03:27:40.469 --> 03:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
costs go the lower our costs for
 
03:27:43.670 --> 03:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
lee8 and there's there's a you know a
 
03:27:45.429 --> 03:27:45.439 align:start position:0%
domino effect because then you're saving
 
03:27:48.229 --> 03:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
on transport ation costs of the hauling
 
03:27:50.389 --> 03:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
so okay well thank you very much yeah I
 
03:27:52.349 --> 03:27:52.359 align:start position:0%
mean we talked a little bit about this I
 
03:27:55.110 --> 03:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
mean for municipalities as they divert
 
03:27:56.910 --> 03:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
their waste as they decrease what's
 
03:27:59.790 --> 03:27:59.800 align:start position:0%
going into the landfills it's not just
 
03:28:01.870 --> 03:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
the Tipping fee money in some ways
 
03:28:04.510 --> 03:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
that's the smaller part of it it's the
 
03:28:08.830 --> 03:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
trucking so for New London we pay almost
 
03:28:13.429 --> 03:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
$700 a hopper load to go to the dump to
 
03:28:15.870 --> 03:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
to the landfill and that adds up really
 
03:28:18.070 --> 03:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
really really quickly and I think I told
 
03:28:21.670 --> 03:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
you guys because we have a food waste
 
03:28:24.070 --> 03:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
program that only some of our family
 
03:28:26.910 --> 03:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
like 170 families participate in and the
 
03:28:31.630 --> 03:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
last year we diverted 36 tons or 32 tons
 
03:28:34.550 --> 03:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
of food waste and our Public Works guy
 
03:28:37.910 --> 03:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
said that that ended up at least once or
 
03:28:41.990 --> 03:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
twice a month we had like one or two
 
03:28:44.830 --> 03:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
fewer um Hoppers that had to get trucked
 
03:28:48.830 --> 03:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
up to mount harur that right there is
 
03:28:54.269 --> 03:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
$1,400 um anyway um I I hope I look
 
03:28:56.710 --> 03:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
forward to talking uh to the committee
 
03:28:59.070 --> 03:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
about it um it's certainly something
 
03:29:00.590 --> 03:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
that we've been talking about at the
 
03:29:02.389 --> 03:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group for really
 
03:29:05.670 --> 03:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
long time um it does support our goals
 
03:29:07.910 --> 03:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
here in the state of New Hampshire and
 
03:29:10.790 --> 03:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
it has the benefit at a benefit of
 
03:29:12.830 --> 03:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
replacing general fund dollars which are
 
03:29:16.269 --> 03:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
hard to come by representative MS thank
 
03:29:18.469 --> 03:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
you thanks for taking my question is
 
03:29:20.269 --> 03:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
there is there anything in current
 
03:29:24.150 --> 03:29:24.160 align:start position:0%
statute that limits how these uh how
 
03:29:27.030 --> 03:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
funds from this um or monies from this
 
03:29:29.710 --> 03:29:29.720 align:start position:0%
fund can be utilized and and and to be
 
03:29:31.510 --> 03:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
more specific I mean what I'm I'm
 
03:29:33.189 --> 03:29:33.199 align:start position:0%
specifically interested in is there any
 
03:29:37.150 --> 03:29:37.160 align:start position:0%
limitation on funds being used
 
03:29:41.670 --> 03:29:41.680 align:start position:0%
to um you know maybe address problems
 
03:29:43.590 --> 03:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
associated with landfills that have that
 
03:29:46.710 --> 03:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
have been closed for a while no so very
 
03:29:48.830 --> 03:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
specifically the way the fund is
 
03:29:51.030 --> 03:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
currently structured it's a grant
 
03:29:54.030 --> 03:29:54.040 align:start position:0%
program for municipality for New
 
03:29:57.349 --> 03:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire municipalities and businesses
 
03:29:59.550 --> 03:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
there's no authorization for this money
 
03:30:02.309 --> 03:30:02.319 align:start position:0%
to be used by the department or in any
 
03:30:04.990 --> 03:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
other way because it's a dedicated fund
 
03:30:07.110 --> 03:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
that's the thing with dedicated funds
 
03:30:09.630 --> 03:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
right you limit how they can be used but
 
03:30:12.349 --> 03:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
in this case the fund last time we we
 
03:30:16.189 --> 03:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
funded it with general fund dollars so
 
03:30:18.630 --> 03:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
that's what started my bill I wanted to
 
03:30:20.790 --> 03:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
put more general fund dollars into the
 
03:30:24.189 --> 03:30:24.199 align:start position:0%
management fund but the way the
 
03:30:26.550 --> 03:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
conversation went in finance a couple of
 
03:30:28.830 --> 03:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
weeks ago we started talking about
 
03:30:31.830 --> 03:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
alternative ways of funding and this
 
03:30:34.910 --> 03:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
helps fund the grant program but it has
 
03:30:38.870 --> 03:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
the extra huge benefit of helping to
 
03:30:43.030 --> 03:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
fund um agency work the solid waste the
 
03:30:45.269 --> 03:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
the solid waste Bureau which all the
 
03:30:47.110 --> 03:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
solid waste which much of the solid
 
03:30:53.110 --> 03:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
waste work takes place in um and again I
 
03:30:56.229 --> 03:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
I got all this research from NS ncsl
 
03:30:59.030 --> 03:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
because I wanted to show you guys that
 
03:31:02.189 --> 03:31:02.199 align:start position:0%
this isn't unusual in fact we're the
 
03:31:05.189 --> 03:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
outliers that because we don't do
 
03:31:09.389 --> 03:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
this um and Vermont mat and a lot of
 
03:31:11.510 --> 03:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
them they they really have made great
 
03:31:13.309 --> 03:31:13.319 align:start position:0%
strides in their waste diversion through
 
03:31:16.070 --> 03:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
their Grant programs and I was like like
 
03:31:18.030 --> 03:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
bulbs going off when I realized it was
 
03:31:20.030 --> 03:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
all coming out of this sear charge money
 
03:31:22.830 --> 03:31:22.840 align:start position:0%

03:33:23.150 --> 03:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
talked to him about the likelihood of us
 
03:33:24.870 --> 03:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
retaining this bill and trying to figure
 
03:33:26.830 --> 03:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
out if we can work it out in the budget
 
03:33:28.870 --> 03:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh but I know the uh deputy secretary
 
03:33:30.389 --> 03:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
state is here to speak to it as well and
 
03:33:38.309 --> 03:33:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:43.189 --> 03:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:45.429 --> 03:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
welcome good afternoon everyone my name
 
03:33:47.950 --> 03:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
is Hennessy I am the deputy secretary of
 
03:33:52.790 --> 03:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
state and I am here to speak on HB 164
 
03:33:55.590 --> 03:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
which relates to my office um within the
 
03:33:57.229 --> 03:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office we have the
 
03:33:58.950 --> 03:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
division of archives and Records
 
03:34:01.309 --> 03:34:01.319 align:start position:0%
management and what this bill would do
 
03:34:04.150 --> 03:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
would be to fund a position that we
 
03:34:06.950 --> 03:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
already have created the um local
 
03:34:10.670 --> 03:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
records manager position and what that
 
03:34:12.990 --> 03:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
position would be responsible for is
 
03:34:15.950 --> 03:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
helping um municipalities
 
03:34:20.309 --> 03:34:20.319 align:start position:0%
um with how to properly post uh right to
 
03:34:23.229 --> 03:34:23.239 align:start position:0%
knowable documents on their website um
 
03:34:24.950 --> 03:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
in addition this person would be able to
 
03:34:28.910 --> 03:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
help with um clerks or other people that
 
03:34:32.429 --> 03:34:32.439 align:start position:0%
are using their Town websites be able to
 
03:34:36.189 --> 03:34:36.199 align:start position:0%
um put them in accessible format um next
 
03:34:38.830 --> 03:34:38.840 align:start position:0%
year is a big deadline for ensuring that
 
03:34:41.630 --> 03:34:41.640 align:start position:0%
all websites have accessible information
 
03:34:44.510 --> 03:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
or any information on websites is an
 
03:34:46.269 --> 03:34:46.279 align:start position:0%
accessible format so
 
03:34:48.349 --> 03:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
um that is what this position would do
 
03:34:51.309 --> 03:34:51.319 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions it did
 
03:34:55.229 --> 03:34:55.239 align:start position:0%
um overwhelmingly pass the um Judiciary
 
03:34:57.389 --> 03:34:57.399 align:start position:0%
Committee um I believe it passed last
 
03:34:59.830 --> 03:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
year in judiciary as well so there was a
 
03:35:02.070 --> 03:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
lot of support
 
03:35:06.550 --> 03:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:08.389 --> 03:35:08.399 align:start position:0%
questions and I can talk to the
 
03:35:10.269 --> 03:35:10.279 align:start position:0%
amendment too that would be great thank
 
03:35:13.710 --> 03:35:13.720 align:start position:0%
you it it shifts the cost to um the year
 
03:35:16.429 --> 03:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
um that they would take place the the
 
03:35:19.750 --> 03:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year so um it just aligns when
 
03:35:21.550 --> 03:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
the position would be
 
03:35:25.590 --> 03:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
funded um to when the enactment of the
 
03:35:40.590 --> 03:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:44.189 --> 03:35:44.199 align:start position:0%

03:35:45.870 --> 03:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know how you want to do do
 
03:35:49.469 --> 03:35:49.479 align:start position:0%
this procedurally but I'd be willing to
 
03:35:52.189 --> 03:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
make a motion to retain this bill for
 
03:35:54.510 --> 03:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
future discussion or were you thinking
 
03:35:57.229 --> 03:35:57.239 align:start position:0%
you would wait on those motions um we're
 
03:35:59.750 --> 03:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
going to wait on the motions and when
 
03:36:01.750 --> 03:36:01.760 align:start position:0%

03:36:09.309 --> 03:36:09.319 align:start position:0%
we want to retain will probably execute
 
03:36:10.710 --> 03:36:10.720 align:start position:0%

before you is a bill that provides for
 
03:37:52.990 --> 03:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
um direct cities and towns to enable
 
03:37:55.030 --> 03:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
access to voting for individuals with
 
03:37:57.790 --> 03:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
disabilities during elections it has to
 
03:38:01.550 --> 03:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
do with accessible voting machines um I
 
03:38:03.990 --> 03:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
have discussed this with the prime
 
03:38:06.189 --> 03:38:06.199 align:start position:0%

03:38:08.630 --> 03:38:08.640 align:start position:0%

$100,000

03:38:17.469 --> 03:38:17.479 align:start position:0%
$100,000
 
03:38:19.870 --> 03:38:19.880 align:start position:0%
appropriation um I don't want to speak
 
03:38:22.950 --> 03:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
for her but my understanding is that the
 
03:38:26.550 --> 03:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
appropriation could be removed and they
 
03:38:28.790 --> 03:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
would still be able to do the job that
 
03:38:31.550 --> 03:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
they need to do with respect to the uh
 
03:38:34.429 --> 03:38:34.439 align:start position:0%
voting machines and the only other thing
 
03:38:37.790 --> 03:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
and I don't have an amendment um with me
 
03:38:40.349 --> 03:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
but I know the prime sponsor in
 
03:38:44.030 --> 03:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
communication with um Miss Hennessy
 
03:38:46.750 --> 03:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to move the effective date of the

uh of the bill out to December
 
03:38:51.830 --> 03:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
31st right
 
03:38:55.790 --> 03:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
2025 um and I think if there are
 
03:38:58.189 --> 03:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
additional questions she'd be the best
 
03:39:00.630 --> 03:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
person to talk to about
 
03:39:09.510 --> 03:39:09.520 align:start position:0%

name is Aaron Hennessy and before us is
 
03:39:23.950 --> 03:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
hb67 and it deals with accessible voting
 
03:39:26.150 --> 03:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
in local elections last year the
 
03:39:28.389 --> 03:39:28.399 align:start position:0%
legislature passed a bill I believe it
 
03:39:28.399 --> 03:39:29.389 align:start position:0%
legislature passed a bill I believe it
was

03:39:29.389 --> 03:39:29.399 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:39:32.870 --> 03:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
1264 that um required the use of
 
03:39:35.070 --> 03:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
accessible voting systems in local
 
03:39:38.070 --> 03:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
elections we've used them in state and
 
03:39:41.269 --> 03:39:41.279 align:start position:0%
federal elections for years now um we
 
03:39:43.150 --> 03:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
our version is called the oneforall
 
03:39:44.710 --> 03:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
device you may have seen it in a white
 
03:39:47.269 --> 03:39:47.279 align:start position:0%
tent in your polling location um and
 
03:39:50.870 --> 03:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
this allows anyone um anyone to use it
 
03:39:52.950 --> 03:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
but also anyone with a disability who
 
03:39:57.590 --> 03:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
may um be um seeing impaired or have a
 
03:40:02.349 --> 03:40:02.359 align:start position:0%
shake in their hand or um be um have um
 
03:40:04.189 --> 03:40:04.199 align:start position:0%
limbs that are missing that do not allow
 
03:40:07.950 --> 03:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
them to use um a pen or pencil to fill
 
03:40:10.790 --> 03:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
in their ballot when they're voting um
 
03:40:12.670 --> 03:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
we fully support the premise of the
 
03:40:15.349 --> 03:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
legislation uh the way the appropriation
 
03:40:17.630 --> 03:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
is worded um we would never see that
 
03:40:19.590 --> 03:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
$100,000 so I'm going to tell you we
 
03:40:22.550 --> 03:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
don't need it our Hava fund um requires
 
03:40:26.309 --> 03:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
us to have 12 years of um operating
 
03:40:28.990 --> 03:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
expenses in the balance to ensure that
 
03:40:31.309 --> 03:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
um the mandates of the help America vote
 
03:40:33.269 --> 03:40:33.279 align:start position:0%
act are fully funded for the State of
 
03:40:35.269 --> 03:40:35.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire going forward without the
 
03:40:37.269 --> 03:40:37.279 align:start position:0%
Reliance on any additional Federal
 
03:40:39.429 --> 03:40:39.439 align:start position:0%
funding Appropriations and we support
 
03:40:42.150 --> 03:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
that as well um within that fund we have
 
03:40:44.750 --> 03:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
enough money to purchase the new um
 
03:40:46.910 --> 03:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
accessible voting equipment which we
 
03:40:49.309 --> 03:40:49.319 align:start position:0%
will share with cities and towns for
 
03:40:51.469 --> 03:40:51.479 align:start position:0%
their local elections they will be
 
03:40:53.349 --> 03:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
responsible for paying the programming
 
03:40:56.030 --> 03:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
cost for local elections um and we would
 
03:40:57.349 --> 03:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
be responsible for paying the
 
03:40:59.269 --> 03:40:59.279 align:start position:0%
programming cost for state and federal
 
03:41:01.429 --> 03:41:01.439 align:start position:0%
elections so again we do not need the
 
03:41:03.429 --> 03:41:03.439 align:start position:0%
$100,000 appropriation we would be
 
03:41:05.710 --> 03:41:05.720 align:start position:0%
paying um for the this equipment with
 
03:41:05.720 --> 03:41:06.990 align:start position:0%
paying um for the this equipment with
Hava

03:41:06.990 --> 03:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
Hava
 
03:41:10.229 --> 03:41:10.239 align:start position:0%
funds I'm sorry could you say which fund
 
03:41:12.630 --> 03:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
again um it's technically it's the
 
03:41:15.510 --> 03:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
election fund um but people refer to as
 
03:41:15.520 --> 03:41:18.710 align:start position:0%
election fund um but people refer to as
Hobbit

03:41:18.710 --> 03:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:22.030 --> 03:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
funds any questions for the
 
03:41:24.710 --> 03:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
secretary yes thank you Mr chair and
 
03:41:26.590 --> 03:41:26.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um for taking my question
 
03:41:28.389 --> 03:41:28.399 align:start position:0%
what's the balance in the El the
 
03:41:30.510 --> 03:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
election fund presently I don't know off
 
03:41:33.870 --> 03:41:33.880 align:start position:0%
the top of my head I think um
 
03:41:36.670 --> 03:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
unencumbered funds is probably about 12
 
03:41:39.429 --> 03:41:39.439 align:start position:0%
or 13 million oh okay thank and it cost
 
03:41:42.469 --> 03:41:42.479 align:start position:0%
about a million plus dollars to run the
 
03:41:43.910 --> 03:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
Hava office a
 
03:41:47.269 --> 03:41:47.279 align:start position:0%
year okay thank you so that that's a
 
03:41:50.349 --> 03:41:50.359 align:start position:0%
non-aps fund then it just y okay thank
 
03:41:52.590 --> 03:41:52.600 align:start position:0%
you and it's has audits by the federal
 
03:41:55.229 --> 03:41:55.239 align:start position:0%
government okay thank you representative
 
03:41:59.110 --> 03:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
Ms thank you and thanks for coming in um
 
03:42:01.349 --> 03:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
I think you said that the U the cost of
 
03:42:04.389 --> 03:42:04.399 align:start position:0%
program the machines for federal and
 
03:42:06.149 --> 03:42:06.159 align:start position:0%
state elections would be paid for out of
 
03:42:09.710 --> 03:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
this state fund correct
 
03:42:13.030 --> 03:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
um I believe they're either I believe
 
03:42:14.790 --> 03:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
they're paid for by Hava funds I have to
 
03:42:16.590 --> 03:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
check on the state would be respons the
 
03:42:18.389 --> 03:42:18.399 align:start position:0%
state has always paid for the
 
03:42:21.349 --> 03:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
programming of the um of the accessible
 
03:42:23.189 --> 03:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
voting equipment in state and federal
 
03:42:25.590 --> 03:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
elections and then the locals uh uh
 
03:42:28.349 --> 03:42:28.359 align:start position:0%
folks are responsible for for that at
 
03:42:30.870 --> 03:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
the for Town elections correct the
 
03:42:33.149 --> 03:42:33.159 align:start position:0%
what's the approximate cost of that
 
03:42:35.790 --> 03:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question um so the
 
03:42:37.990 --> 03:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
legislation last year set up a pilot
 
03:42:39.710 --> 03:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
program so right now we're loaning our
 
03:42:41.870 --> 03:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
equipment to the locals they are using
 
03:42:45.309 --> 03:42:45.319 align:start position:0%
our current vendor um with our equipment
 
03:42:48.110 --> 03:42:48.120 align:start position:0%
that's about 10 years old now and they
 
03:42:52.269 --> 03:42:52.279 align:start position:0%
are paying approximately $600 per ballot
 
03:42:54.149 --> 03:42:54.159 align:start position:0%
um so it's not per ballot page it's
 
03:42:56.309 --> 03:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
about so if you have a town ballot that
 
03:42:58.750 --> 03:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
has three pages it would be $600 if you
 
03:43:00.630 --> 03:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
have a school ballot that has another
 
03:43:03.469 --> 03:43:03.479 align:start position:0%
three pages that's another $600 if you
 
03:43:05.070 --> 03:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
have another school ballot that has
 
03:43:08.229 --> 03:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
another three pages that's another $600
 
03:43:11.710 --> 03:43:11.720 align:start position:0%
so some of the towns are seeing um a
 
03:43:13.630 --> 03:43:13.640 align:start position:0%
little bit High expenses to program
 
03:43:16.110 --> 03:43:16.120 align:start position:0%
local elections so we are when we um
 
03:43:18.189 --> 03:43:18.199 align:start position:0%
we're working on our RFP now for the new
 
03:43:21.469 --> 03:43:21.479 align:start position:0%
equipment and our hope is is that the
 
03:43:26.309 --> 03:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
responses we get would have lower costs
 
03:43:29.309 --> 03:43:29.319 align:start position:0%
to program the elections because we do
 
03:43:31.790 --> 03:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
recognize that it's could be excessive
 
03:43:36.389 --> 03:43:36.399 align:start position:0%
for a lot of locations followup um given
 
03:43:40.070 --> 03:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
that cost which is not
 
03:43:45.110 --> 03:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
inconsequential um why not expand the um
 
03:43:46.910 --> 03:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
rules around absentee ballots so that
 
03:43:52.429 --> 03:43:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:54.710 --> 03:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
absentee you you would have to ask
 
03:43:57.910 --> 03:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
yourself that question as a legislator
 
03:43:59.710 --> 03:43:59.720 align:start position:0%
um I don't have the authority to do that
 
03:44:01.510 --> 03:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's in our constitution who is allowed
 
03:44:06.110 --> 03:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:08.990 --> 03:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
absentee any further questions
 
03:44:11.830 --> 03:44:11.840 align:start position:0%

agreements with towns for equipment that
 
03:44:45.590 --> 03:44:45.600 align:start position:0%

right yeah so Carol's here for for 216
 
03:48:09.750 --> 03:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire
 
03:48:15.429 --> 03:48:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:18.670 --> 03:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
okay uh I'm representing Carol Maguire
 
03:48:20.229 --> 03:48:20.239 align:start position:0%
mayac District
 
03:48:24.550 --> 03:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:27.950 --> 03:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
216 despite its very ominous fiscal note
 
03:48:30.229 --> 03:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
actually passed the house on consent
 
03:48:33.550 --> 03:48:33.560 align:start position:0%
because the Edna committee said we don't
 
03:48:35.469 --> 03:48:35.479 align:start position:0%
believe the fiscal
 
03:48:39.269 --> 03:48:39.279 align:start position:0%
note uh since then I have
 
03:48:43.309 --> 03:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
investigated and had um legislative
 
03:48:45.710 --> 03:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
research look into
 
03:48:48.990 --> 03:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
what how many individuals actually are
 
03:48:52.189 --> 03:48:52.199 align:start position:0%
out on workers comp for more than a year
 
03:48:54.590 --> 03:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
because what this bill does is
 
03:48:59.510 --> 03:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
it repeals the current and practically
 
03:49:03.830 --> 03:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
since forever limit of one year of time
 
03:49:05.710 --> 03:49:05.720 align:start position:0%
on workers
 
03:49:07.910 --> 03:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
compensation that applies towards your
 
03:49:07.920 --> 03:49:09.309 align:start position:0%
compensation that applies towards your
pension

03:49:09.309 --> 03:49:09.319 align:start position:0%
pension
 
03:49:09.319 --> 03:49:12.229 align:start position:0%
pension
service

03:49:12.229 --> 03:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
service
 
03:49:15.070 --> 03:49:15.080 align:start position:0%
um because
 
03:49:17.870 --> 03:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
let's see it's it started a couple of La
 
03:49:21.229 --> 03:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
last year when we had a bill about two
 
03:49:23.469 --> 03:49:23.479 align:start position:0%
individuals who were grievously injured
 
03:49:26.070 --> 03:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
on the job two policemen who were shot
 
03:49:28.790 --> 03:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
in the line of duty and
 
03:49:31.790 --> 03:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
survived but
 
03:49:35.349 --> 03:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
had uh you know like a dozen operations
 
03:49:38.149 --> 03:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
before they had to retire on disability
 
03:49:41.429 --> 03:49:41.439 align:start position:0%
and one of them was concerned because he
 
03:49:44.309 --> 03:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
had something like nine nine years and
 
03:49:47.309 --> 03:49:47.319 align:start position:0%
some months of
 
03:49:47.319 --> 03:49:49.710 align:start position:0%
some months of
seniority

03:49:49.710 --> 03:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
seniority
 
03:49:53.510 --> 03:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
but and then he had you know enough time
 
03:49:56.189 --> 03:49:56.199 align:start position:0%
out on dis ability in addition to that
 
03:49:59.110 --> 03:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
to add up to 10 years but it didn't
 
03:50:03.070 --> 03:50:03.080 align:start position:0%
count for him and so the Edna committee
 
03:50:06.030 --> 03:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
said that appears to be an arbitrary
 
03:50:09.670 --> 03:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
limit because our feeling was that
 
03:50:12.149 --> 03:50:12.159 align:start position:0%
hardly anybody is going to be spend a
 
03:50:16.510 --> 03:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
year out on workers compensation
 
03:50:18.670 --> 03:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
but it turns out that's the kind of data
 
03:50:23.070 --> 03:50:23.080 align:start position:0%
that nobody actually records the data
 
03:50:26.030 --> 03:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
that I was able to get was from one
 
03:50:29.590 --> 03:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
insurance company that reported to the
 
03:50:32.389 --> 03:50:32.399 align:start position:0%
uh insurance department that more than
 
03:50:37.429 --> 03:50:37.439 align:start position:0%
10% of some group of people were
 
03:50:39.550 --> 03:50:39.560 align:start position:0%
receiving benefits a year after the
 
03:50:41.309 --> 03:50:41.319 align:start position:0%
incident that caused them to be out on
 
03:50:44.149 --> 03:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
workers comp and I don't know if that's
 
03:50:46.510 --> 03:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
because they were out on their second or
 
03:50:48.510 --> 03:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
third operation or whatever but it
 
03:50:51.149 --> 03:50:51.159 align:start position:0%
struck me as an extraordinarily High
 
03:50:53.790 --> 03:50:53.800 align:start position:0%
number um that's the number that the
 
03:50:55.469 --> 03:50:55.479 align:start position:0%
retirement system used because they
 
03:50:58.030 --> 03:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
don't keep track of it either uh the
 
03:50:59.910 --> 03:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
only thing I'm sure of is that we pass
 
03:51:04.110 --> 03:51:04.120 align:start position:0%
this bill the re the 100,000 or so for
 
03:51:06.229 --> 03:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
reprogramming will come into effect
 
03:51:08.990 --> 03:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
that's for sure uh how many people this
 
03:51:13.309 --> 03:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
would affect I don't know my personal
 
03:51:15.750 --> 03:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
feeling is that it's a very tiny number
 
03:51:19.349 --> 03:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
but I have no data to back that up so
 
03:51:21.750 --> 03:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that this might be a pig
 
03:51:26.149 --> 03:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
and a poke and while we like the concept
 
03:51:28.950 --> 03:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
of saying that somebody who is
 
03:51:31.750 --> 03:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
recovering from an on the job
 
03:51:35.309 --> 03:51:35.319 align:start position:0%
injury should not be penalized for
 
03:51:39.790 --> 03:51:39.800 align:start position:0%
their um for having suffered this
 
03:51:42.990 --> 03:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
injury I also don't want to say that if
 
03:51:46.030 --> 03:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of them the rest of the
 
03:51:48.110 --> 03:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in the state who will be
 
03:51:50.910 --> 03:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
paying into the retirement fund to cover
 
03:51:53.269 --> 03:51:53.279 align:start position:0%
them because they're not contributing
 
03:51:56.590 --> 03:51:56.600 align:start position:0%
while they're on workers comp um I don't
 
03:51:59.830 --> 03:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
know how how much this would tax all of
 
03:52:04.189 --> 03:52:04.199 align:start position:0%
us in order to support it and so I'm I
 
03:52:07.030 --> 03:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
like the concept but I can't really
 
03:52:09.750 --> 03:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
right now recommend that you you pass it
 
03:52:12.550 --> 03:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
immediately because we don't really know
 
03:52:15.349 --> 03:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
what it's going to cost thank you
 
03:52:19.349 --> 03:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee no have did
 
03:52:21.510 --> 03:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
you consider instead of just crossing
 
03:52:24.710 --> 03:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
out not an excess of year make it not an
 
03:52:27.590 --> 03:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
excess of 18 months two years we have no
 
03:52:30.830 --> 03:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
data if I had information that the
 
03:52:32.389 --> 03:52:32.399 align:start position:0%
people who are out for a year are all
 
03:52:34.349 --> 03:52:34.359 align:start position:0%
back to work in a year and a half I do
 
03:52:37.110 --> 03:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
it but right now I have no information
 
03:52:39.429 --> 03:52:39.439 align:start position:0%
right but we could sort of if we did it
 
03:52:41.590 --> 03:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
incrementally then we could see what the
 
03:52:44.469 --> 03:52:44.479 align:start position:0%
change was right and you would pay the
 
03:52:47.910 --> 03:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
$100,000 reprogramming cost every time
 
03:52:51.149 --> 03:52:51.159 align:start position:0%
wow all right Melissa if if if we were
 
03:52:54.429 --> 03:52:54.439 align:start position:0%
to accept this bill into house bill two
 
03:52:56.269 --> 03:52:56.279 align:start position:0%
do you know how because some of these
 
03:52:58.590 --> 03:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
numbers are kind of scary right is that
 
03:53:00.870 --> 03:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
going to yeah so because this
 
03:53:02.469 --> 03:53:02.479 align:start position:0%
expenditures and I do want to know in
 
03:53:05.469 --> 03:53:05.479 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note it does say scalable so
 
03:53:08.910 --> 03:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
this was just retirement giving us a uh
 
03:53:11.349 --> 03:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
a parameter if 10% had retired within
 
03:53:13.670 --> 03:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
the six months it's definitely could go
 
03:53:15.910 --> 03:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
way down could go way up probably not
 
03:53:17.110 --> 03:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
way up but it could go way down
 
03:53:19.030 --> 03:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
depending on the people to your question
 
03:53:20.950 --> 03:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire this is just an
 
03:53:23.830 --> 03:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
expenditure there's no appropriation for
 
03:53:26.469 --> 03:53:26.479 align:start position:0%
this um so there it will not right
 
03:53:29.110 --> 03:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
impact the budget at all the the
 
03:53:31.389 --> 03:53:31.399 align:start position:0%
information well as I said when we
 
03:53:34.389 --> 03:53:34.399 align:start position:0%
considered it need DNA we looked at it
 
03:53:36.910 --> 03:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
and said this number is
 
03:53:40.110 --> 03:53:40.120 align:start position:0%
ridiculous all all of our intuition said
 
03:53:41.670 --> 03:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
it should be very much
 
03:53:43.870 --> 03:53:43.880 align:start position:0%
smaller but there would not be any
 
03:53:46.910 --> 03:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate ations would all be folded
 
03:53:50.790 --> 03:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
down to the um employers of people in
 
03:53:53.510 --> 03:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
the retirement system but but we pay for
 
03:53:57.630 --> 03:53:57.640 align:start position:0%
benefits so if if the benefits of every
 
03:54:01.030 --> 03:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
employee went up this you know 0.1% or
 
03:54:03.110 --> 03:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
whatever the number is that's that's a
 
03:54:04.550 --> 03:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
big number the impact would happen in
 
03:54:07.590 --> 03:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 28 so it's outside the
 
03:54:11.389 --> 03:54:11.399 align:start position:0%
budget yes the um the retirement system
 
03:54:14.189 --> 03:54:14.199 align:start position:0%
calculates theirs every two years and
 
03:54:16.469 --> 03:54:16.479 align:start position:0%
that and this would be folded into the
 
03:54:20.830 --> 03:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
rate that every town school district and
 
03:54:23.510 --> 03:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
the state pays I see so effectively
 
03:54:26.149 --> 03:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
would affect the the unfunded
 
03:54:28.750 --> 03:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
ECT the what affect the
 
03:54:34.189 --> 03:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
um um contribution rate the UAA yes yes
 
03:54:37.910 --> 03:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
it would affect the UA that
 
03:54:41.030 --> 03:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
end and if it if we knew what it was no
 
03:54:42.830 --> 03:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
matter how large we could argue about
 
03:54:45.550 --> 03:54:45.560 align:start position:0%
whether that was appropriate but I'm I'm
 
03:54:48.309 --> 03:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
very concerned that it's a total unknown
 
03:54:50.030 --> 03:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
we don't know how many people would be
 
03:54:54.189 --> 03:54:54.199 align:start position:0%
affected we don't know for how long and
 
03:54:56.349 --> 03:54:56.359 align:start position:0%
I have been unable to find any better
 
03:54:58.670 --> 03:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
data so I'm sorry about that I
 
03:55:00.990 --> 03:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
understand all right representative
 
03:55:04.550 --> 03:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
Ms than thank you um for taking my
 
03:55:07.670 --> 03:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
question um what if we limited this to
 
03:55:11.469 --> 03:55:11.479 align:start position:0%
just group two in place no it would
 
03:55:15.870 --> 03:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
equally well apply to some at do who was
 
03:55:18.590 --> 03:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
mangled in an in an industrial accident
 
03:55:21.189 --> 03:55:21.199 align:start position:0%
or Run Over By by a truck or whatever
 
03:55:24.670 --> 03:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
okay it would it in our opinion it would
 
03:55:27.389 --> 03:55:27.399 align:start position:0%
only apply to people who were grievously
 
03:55:30.550 --> 03:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
injured on the job and we certainly hope
 
03:55:33.269 --> 03:55:33.279 align:start position:0%
that's a very tiny number but I can't
 
03:55:33.279 --> 03:55:34.229 align:start position:0%
that's a very tiny number but I can't
prove

03:55:34.229 --> 03:55:34.239 align:start position:0%
prove
 
03:55:37.630 --> 03:55:37.640 align:start position:0%
it represent evil so um thank you for
 
03:55:40.429 --> 03:55:40.439 align:start position:0%
being here so if I understand what
 
03:55:42.149 --> 03:55:42.159 align:start position:0%
you're saying are you recommending that
 
03:55:45.389 --> 03:55:45.399 align:start position:0%
we itl the bill or retain it which is
 
03:55:48.389 --> 03:55:48.399 align:start position:0%
your recommendation uh retain in case we
 
03:55:50.510 --> 03:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
find find out what it's worth because
 
03:55:52.110 --> 03:55:52.120 align:start position:0%
it's certainly not going to cause any
 
03:55:53.750 --> 03:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
cost anything this
 
03:55:56.349 --> 03:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
year Lord willing and there's nobody
 
03:56:00.750 --> 03:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
that gets so injured but um
 
03:56:04.110 --> 03:56:04.120 align:start position:0%
um but if we find out how big it is then
 
03:56:06.510 --> 03:56:06.520 align:start position:0%
we can have a more sensible
 
03:56:09.309 --> 03:56:09.319 align:start position:0%
discussion all right representative R
 
03:56:12.830 --> 03:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so would this apply
 
03:56:15.149 --> 03:56:15.159 align:start position:0%
retroactively do we have any situation
 
03:56:17.429 --> 03:56:17.439 align:start position:0%
let's say there was no once a person
 
03:56:19.710 --> 03:56:19.720 align:start position:0%
retires for any reason their pension is
 
03:56:22.750 --> 03:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
set okay it would apply to someone who
 
03:56:25.710 --> 03:56:25.720 align:start position:0%
is who was injured previously and is
 
03:56:28.030 --> 03:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
still out on disability or coming back
 
03:56:28.040 --> 03:56:29.110 align:start position:0%
still out on disability or coming back
from

03:56:29.110 --> 03:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:56:32.149 --> 03:56:32.159 align:start position:0%
disability um if somebody who was
 
03:56:34.590 --> 03:56:34.600 align:start position:0%
injured five years ago and spent a year
 
03:56:37.590 --> 03:56:37.600 align:start position:0%
and a half on disability retired after
 
03:56:39.469 --> 03:56:39.479 align:start position:0%
this goes into effect it would apply to
 
03:56:42.590 --> 03:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
them it would okay thank you it it the
 
03:56:45.309 --> 03:56:45.319 align:start position:0%
the effective date is essentially the
 
03:56:48.309 --> 03:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
date you actually retire okay thank you
 
03:56:52.229 --> 03:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative does anyone
 
03:56:55.710 --> 03:56:55.720 align:start position:0%
else here have information on this bill
 
03:56:57.750 --> 03:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
that they would like to share with
 
03:57:03.189 --> 03:57:03.199 align:start position:0%
us no all right see oh yes I see a hand
 
03:57:07.070 --> 03:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:14.469 --> 03:57:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:17.189 --> 03:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
nice to see you all again so soon so so
 
03:57:20.269 --> 03:57:20.279 align:start position:0%
are you like the new Marty or we don't
 
03:57:21.910 --> 03:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
have such a person the new Marty starts
 
03:57:23.469 --> 03:57:23.479 align:start position:0%
on Monday oh
 
03:57:27.229 --> 03:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
terrific so um Diana and I have been
 
03:57:29.469 --> 03:57:29.479 align:start position:0%
filling in okay uh and we'll probably
 
03:57:30.990 --> 03:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
continue to have a role through the end
 
03:57:33.630 --> 03:57:33.640 align:start position:0%
of this session as things transition
 
03:57:37.990 --> 03:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
over to the new guy okay um for the
 
03:57:40.189 --> 03:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
record I'm Mark Kavanaugh Deputy counsel
 
03:57:41.670 --> 03:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
and compliance office of the New
 
03:57:45.830 --> 03:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system and uh as we
 
03:57:50.510 --> 03:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
testified in Edna and
 
03:57:54.750 --> 03:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
as chairman McGuire indicated just now
 
03:57:56.630 --> 03:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
there are no statistics we had reached
 
03:57:59.070 --> 03:57:59.080 align:start position:0%
out to labor and specifically the
 
03:58:02.229 --> 03:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
workers comp section they said we don't
 
03:58:06.229 --> 03:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
collect the data that way um I confirmed
 
03:58:07.269 --> 03:58:07.279 align:start position:0%
that with the
 
03:58:09.070 --> 03:58:09.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner of of the Department of
 
03:58:10.910 --> 03:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
Labor who is on our
 
03:58:13.349 --> 03:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
board I think if the data was available
 
03:58:15.910 --> 03:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
they would have given it to us and he
 
03:58:17.830 --> 03:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
made a good point which is whatever data
 
03:58:19.429 --> 03:58:19.439 align:start position:0%
they have they don't distinguish between
 
03:58:21.429 --> 03:58:21.439 align:start position:0%
government and non-government workers
 
03:58:23.590 --> 03:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
it's everyone is covered by workers con
 
03:58:25.710 --> 03:58:25.720 align:start position:0%
so their data is not going to be just
 
03:58:27.670 --> 03:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
government workers so you can't if they
 
03:58:29.590 --> 03:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
have data I'm not even sure how
 
03:58:31.189 --> 03:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
representative it was because of the
 
03:58:32.950 --> 03:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
unique nature of public employment
 
03:58:35.550 --> 03:58:35.560 align:start position:0%
Workforce as opposed to the the vast
 
03:58:39.990 --> 03:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
private in uh record um with respect to
 
03:58:43.070 --> 03:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
our cost estimate it was as Melissa
 
03:58:45.389 --> 03:58:45.399 align:start position:0%
described let's just pick a number
 
03:58:47.429 --> 03:58:47.439 align:start position:0%
that's easily scalable you can you can
 
03:58:50.590 --> 03:58:50.600 align:start position:0%
take 10% and you move the decimal either
 
03:58:52.590 --> 03:58:52.600 align:start position:0%
way as many places as you want to get to
 
03:58:55.870 --> 03:58:55.880 align:start position:0%
where you feel is is is accurate for the
 
03:58:58.429 --> 03:58:58.439 align:start position:0%
number um but that was just a starting
 
03:59:02.389 --> 03:59:02.399 align:start position:0%
point it no no predictive value and no
 
03:59:05.750 --> 03:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
opinion about what the the true size or
 
03:59:08.830 --> 03:59:08.840 align:start position:0%
number of people would extend beyond a
 
03:59:13.110 --> 03:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
year I would say that um for people who
 
03:59:16.550 --> 03:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
are just shy of 10 years well if their
 
03:59:18.269 --> 03:59:18.279 align:start position:0%
workers's comp leads to a permanent
 
03:59:19.790 --> 03:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
disability that doesn't matter because
 
03:59:21.950 --> 03:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
there's no years of service requirement
 
03:59:24.110 --> 03:59:24.120 align:start position:0%
to get an accidental disability
 
03:59:27.950 --> 03:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
retirement from us so uh it might have
 
03:59:29.710 --> 03:59:29.720 align:start position:0%
helped someone who's had a long Illness
 
03:59:33.429 --> 03:59:33.439 align:start position:0%
but is not going to qualify them for
 
03:59:35.429 --> 03:59:35.439 align:start position:0%
accidental disability retirement because
 
03:59:37.870 --> 03:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
it's not permanent that extra service
 
03:59:39.630 --> 03:59:39.640 align:start position:0%
credit might get them to the 10-year
 
03:59:41.630 --> 03:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
vesting that they could stop working and
 
03:59:43.469 --> 03:59:43.479 align:start position:0%
then collect a vested deferred benefit
 
03:59:45.469 --> 03:59:45.479 align:start position:0%
later on when when they reach the age
 
03:59:47.910 --> 03:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
that's necessary uh but a lot of I think
 
03:59:50.630 --> 03:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of our cases do go to ADR and
 
03:59:52.269 --> 03:59:52.279 align:start position:0%
that's why they don't extend beyond a
 
03:59:54.550 --> 03:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
year as much as that you might see
 
03:59:56.870 --> 03:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
elsewhere where there isn't a disability
 
03:59:59.389 --> 03:59:59.399 align:start position:0%
permanent disability benefit uh
 
04:00:02.550 --> 04:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
available to say in Private
 
04:00:05.269 --> 04:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
Industry current law says there's this
 
04:00:08.750 --> 04:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
cut off after a year correct so don't
 
04:00:10.630 --> 04:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
you have data because you got to know
 
04:00:14.630 --> 04:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
when to cut somebody off oh no what they
 
04:00:14.640 --> 04:00:16.670 align:start position:0%
when to cut somebody off oh no what they
do

04:00:16.670 --> 04:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:00:19.229 --> 04:00:19.239 align:start position:0%
is we receive the information but I
 
04:00:21.830 --> 04:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't call it data in in respect
 
04:00:24.910 --> 04:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
that as part of the application process
 
04:00:27.110 --> 04:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
they must provide a memo of payment
 
04:00:30.510 --> 04:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
stating when their workers comp began
 
04:00:32.630 --> 04:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
and when it ended and if it's more than
 
04:00:34.910 --> 04:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
a year we say okay here's your 12 years
 
04:00:36.990 --> 04:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
of 12 months of service but we don't
 
04:00:38.630 --> 04:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
write down somewhere else how many other
 
04:00:40.189 --> 04:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
months they were on because it's not
 
04:00:42.630 --> 04:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
related to us doing anything with it so
 
04:00:44.349 --> 04:00:44.359 align:start position:0%
I suppose you go to every one of these
 
04:00:47.030 --> 04:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
people go in their file find that memo
 
04:00:49.870 --> 04:00:49.880 align:start position:0%
and compile that data I uh but it's not
 
04:00:52.429 --> 04:00:52.439 align:start position:0%
something that was regularly captured or
 
04:00:56.309 --> 04:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
or does that come from Das uh it comes
 
04:00:57.710 --> 04:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
from the workers comp
 
04:01:00.189 --> 04:01:00.199 align:start position:0%
carrier oh it's a standard thing and you
 
04:01:01.790 --> 04:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
you might have a series of them as they
 
04:01:05.149 --> 04:01:05.159 align:start position:0%
keep extending your benefit so initially
 
04:01:06.670 --> 04:01:06.680 align:start position:0%
you'll come in and say okay you're in
 
04:01:09.269 --> 04:01:09.279 align:start position:0%
date of injury you benefits start 3 days
 
04:01:11.750 --> 04:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
later you're approved for four weeks
 
04:01:14.149 --> 04:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
here's the amount you get after four
 
04:01:16.469 --> 04:01:16.479 align:start position:0%
weeks they extend it they give you
 
04:01:19.429 --> 04:01:19.439 align:start position:0%
another memo we just look at the all we
 
04:01:21.229 --> 04:01:21.239 align:start position:0%
need is one memo of a weekly
 
04:01:24.110 --> 04:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
indemnification benefit as opposed to a
 
04:01:27.349 --> 04:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
lump sum settlement
 
04:01:27.359 --> 04:01:29.030 align:start position:0%
lump sum settlement
to

04:01:29.030 --> 04:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:01:31.590 --> 04:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
qualify or meet the requirement that the
 
04:01:35.990 --> 04:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
injury be work related so we rely on and
 
04:01:38.030 --> 04:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
and defer to the Judgment of labor on
 
04:01:39.510 --> 04:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
whether something's work related if we
 
04:01:42.670 --> 04:01:42.680 align:start position:0%
see that memo of compensation if a
 
04:01:45.149 --> 04:01:45.159 align:start position:0%
member doesn't has been denied a claim
 
04:01:47.189 --> 04:01:47.199 align:start position:0%
by the carrier or the
 
04:01:49.189 --> 04:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
employer appeals
 
04:01:52.229 --> 04:01:52.239 align:start position:0%
it enters into a lump some settlement
 
04:01:53.870 --> 04:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
without ever having received a weekly
 
04:01:56.189 --> 04:01:56.199 align:start position:0%
benefit the burden of proof that it was
 
04:01:58.269 --> 04:01:58.279 align:start position:0%
work rated shifts to the individual
 
04:02:01.110 --> 04:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
member and we don't get and we don't the
 
04:02:02.950 --> 04:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
lump sum is not proof of work
 
04:02:06.550 --> 04:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
relatedness because a work work com
 
04:02:07.590 --> 04:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
Carri is going to settle something for
 
04:02:09.790 --> 04:02:09.800 align:start position:0%
100 bucks just to get away from it and
 
04:02:14.590 --> 04:02:14.600 align:start position:0%
not have to litigate it uh and we had
 
04:02:16.149 --> 04:02:16.159 align:start position:0%
quite a few years ago certain attorneys
 
04:02:18.830 --> 04:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
that took advantage of that and and knew
 
04:02:21.429 --> 04:02:21.439 align:start position:0%
that if they could just get a a lump sum
 
04:02:23.189 --> 04:02:23.199 align:start position:0%
that carriers were more than happy to
 
04:02:25.630 --> 04:02:25.640 align:start position:0%
give and get out from under a long
 
04:02:28.229 --> 04:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
prolonged appeal process and then coming
 
04:02:30.510 --> 04:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
to us and claiming hey we've got proof
 
04:02:33.269 --> 04:02:33.279 align:start position:0%
of compensation therefore it's work
 
04:02:35.710 --> 04:02:35.720 align:start position:0%
rated uh so we went and got the statute
 
04:02:39.550 --> 04:02:39.560 align:start position:0%
changed at that point uh so doesn't the
 
04:02:41.990 --> 04:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
state only use one particular workman's
 
04:02:47.429 --> 04:02:47.439 align:start position:0%
comp carrier or no I I believe they do
 
04:02:49.229 --> 04:02:49.239 align:start position:0%
but I don't want to speak to that I
 
04:02:52.469 --> 04:02:52.479 align:start position:0%
don't work at Das okay but they may be
 
04:02:52.479 --> 04:02:54.149 align:start position:0%
don't work at Das okay but they may be
even

04:02:54.149 --> 04:02:54.159 align:start position:0%
even
 
04:02:56.349 --> 04:02:56.359 align:start position:0%
self-insured yeah oh and this is for
 
04:02:59.590 --> 04:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
everybody right right so municipalities
 
04:03:03.510 --> 04:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
have primx and uh and the like primex is
 
04:03:05.229 --> 04:03:05.239 align:start position:0%
the biggest one that I'm familiar with I
 
04:03:07.070 --> 04:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
think the state might
 
04:03:09.910 --> 04:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
self-insure okay yeah all right so we
 
04:03:12.590 --> 04:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
might be able to get data just for state
 
04:03:18.189 --> 04:03:18.199 align:start position:0%
employees uh um it might be Poss well no
 
04:03:20.870 --> 04:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
this is workers comp so I mean self
 
04:03:23.070 --> 04:03:23.080 align:start position:0%
self-insured would be you're carrying
 
04:03:25.590 --> 04:03:25.600 align:start position:0%

premature okay my pen is running out of
 
04:04:45.070 --> 04:04:45.080 align:start position:0%

04:04:49.550 --> 04:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
cooperation with Federal immigrant
 
04:04:51.790 --> 04:04:51.800 align:start position:0%
authorities and we represent recognize
 
04:04:53.790 --> 04:04:53.800 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeny uh thank you Mr
 
04:04:55.309 --> 04:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
chair and members of division one for
 
04:04:56.710 --> 04:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
the record representative Joe Sweeney
 
04:04:59.670 --> 04:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
from Rockingham 25 uh this is House Bill
 
04:05:01.950 --> 04:05:01.960 align:start position:0%
511 that I'm introducing uh relative to
 
04:05:03.389 --> 04:05:03.399 align:start position:0%
cooperation with Federal immigration
 
04:05:05.550 --> 04:05:05.560 align:start position:0%
authorities this came out of the
 
04:05:07.149 --> 04:05:07.159 align:start position:0%
criminal justice and Public Safety
 
04:05:09.830 --> 04:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
Committee unanimously um I believe the
 
04:05:12.389 --> 04:05:12.399 align:start position:0%
floor vote only had six detractors in
 
04:05:14.670 --> 04:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
the house with the rest of us voting for
 
04:05:17.030 --> 04:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
it uh they worked out the policy side of
 
04:05:20.070 --> 04:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
it on our front for here today uh on the
 
04:05:23.710 --> 04:05:23.720 align:start position:0%
finance side there's a I guess I'd say a
 
04:05:26.309 --> 04:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
speculative fiscal note where if there
 
04:05:28.990 --> 04:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
was a a high threshold number of
 
04:05:31.349 --> 04:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions it would lead to the
 
04:05:33.389 --> 04:05:33.399 align:start position:0%
potential need for an additional staffer
 
04:05:34.830 --> 04:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
in the Department of
 
04:05:37.910 --> 04:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
Justice I don't I don't foresee a high
 
04:05:39.630 --> 04:05:39.640 align:start position:0%
level of enforcement actions taken from
 
04:05:41.870 --> 04:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
this and I also know uh since we passed
 
04:05:44.070 --> 04:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
the bill originally the state police are
 
04:05:45.429 --> 04:05:45.439 align:start position:0%
entering into the
 
04:05:47.630 --> 04:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
287g uh which opens up to Federal
 
04:05:50.389 --> 04:05:50.399 align:start position:0%
funding for for those sorts of programs
 
04:05:52.429 --> 04:05:52.439 align:start position:0%
uh so I not to say that I don't think
 
04:05:54.110 --> 04:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a real fiscal note but I
 
04:05:55.830 --> 04:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
think there's there's not a lot of meat
 
04:05:58.870 --> 04:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
on the bone for spending in this so I
 
04:06:00.269 --> 04:06:00.279 align:start position:0%
think we would be comfortable moving
 
04:06:03.070 --> 04:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
ought to pass uh as is I I don't think
 
04:06:05.389 --> 04:06:05.399 align:start position:0%
this actually has to be in the budget
 
04:06:07.510 --> 04:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
conversation okay I'll take any
 
04:06:09.469 --> 04:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any so Melissa
 
04:06:11.269 --> 04:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't affect the budget we think
 
04:06:14.389 --> 04:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
or we don't know um I with repres what
 
04:06:17.030 --> 04:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney said um one there
 
04:06:19.670 --> 04:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
is no authorization of positions in this
 
04:06:21.590 --> 04:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
bill nor are there is there an
 
04:06:23.950 --> 04:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
appropriation for positions if um the
 
04:06:26.590 --> 04:06:26.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice did need the
 
04:06:28.349 --> 04:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
position they speak of but two they do
 
04:06:30.269 --> 04:06:30.279 align:start position:0%
qualify that statement with that only if
 
04:06:31.950 --> 04:06:31.960 align:start position:0%
the cases get to a certain level would
 
04:06:34.189 --> 04:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
they need that position so as of the way
 
04:06:36.790 --> 04:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
the bill is right now um this would not
 
04:06:39.309 --> 04:06:39.319 align:start position:0%
impact the budget
 
04:06:42.550 --> 04:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
okay any questions for representative
 
04:06:42.560 --> 04:06:44.309 align:start position:0%
okay any questions for representative
swen

04:06:44.309 --> 04:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
swen
 
04:06:46.830 --> 04:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
don't see any all right and anybody else
 
04:06:49.469 --> 04:06:49.479 align:start position:0%
here wanted to join in the conversation
 
04:06:57.630 --> 04:06:57.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:59.870 --> 04:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chair members of
 
04:07:01.870 --> 04:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Kate Horan
 
04:07:02.910 --> 04:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire
 
04:07:04.990 --> 04:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
Association of counties I do want to
 
04:07:07.349 --> 04:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
point out this will have a fiscal impact
 
04:07:11.510 --> 04:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
on the counties County jails um couple
 
04:07:13.870 --> 04:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
of things right now counties are only
 
04:07:17.710 --> 04:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
allowed to hold for two reasons one if
 
04:07:20.710 --> 04:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
someone is facing State charges or two
 
04:07:23.510 --> 04:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
if there is a contract right now only
 
04:07:26.790 --> 04:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
two Counties have contracts to hold ice
 
04:07:30.269 --> 04:07:30.279 align:start position:0%
detainees that's marac marac has a rider
 
04:07:33.630 --> 04:07:33.640 align:start position:0%
on their Marshall contract to hold and
 
04:07:36.590 --> 04:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
straford has the ice Detention Facility
 
04:07:39.710 --> 04:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
they contract directly with ice the rest
 
04:07:41.109 --> 04:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
of the counties do not have the
 
04:07:45.870 --> 04:07:45.880 align:start position:0%
authority to hold and this likely if we
 
04:07:47.630 --> 04:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
were to hold someone after the
 
04:07:49.870 --> 04:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
resolution of their state charges would
 
04:07:52.790 --> 04:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
lead to litigation in addition if we are
 
04:07:55.710 --> 04:07:55.720 align:start position:0%
holding these folks it's about $140 a
 
04:07:58.550 --> 04:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
day to hold somebody we also have to pay
 
04:08:00.469 --> 04:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
their medical expenses which you all
 
04:08:02.149 --> 04:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
know can get very expensive you're all
 
04:08:03.750 --> 04:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
members of your
 
04:08:06.269 --> 04:08:06.279 align:start position:0%
delegation and there's no time limit in
 
04:08:09.269 --> 04:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
here on how long we're holding them
 
04:08:12.030 --> 04:08:12.040 align:start position:0%
right now the process for an ice detain
 
04:08:13.510 --> 04:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to use Hillsboro as an examp
 
04:08:15.710 --> 04:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
example cuz they don't have a contract
 
04:08:16.950 --> 04:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
someone comes
 
04:08:20.990 --> 04:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
in um they are detained they see a bail
 
04:08:23.710 --> 04:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner and they're released as
 
04:08:25.510 --> 04:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
soon as we know that person is going to
 
04:08:27.790 --> 04:08:27.800 align:start position:0%
be released Hillsboro County calls ice
 
04:08:31.030 --> 04:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
and says hey this person has a detainer
 
04:08:32.990 --> 04:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
are you going to come and get them I
 
04:08:35.870 --> 04:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
will point out ice in Manchester is 2
 
04:08:36.910 --> 04:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
minutes away from the County
 
04:08:36.920 --> 04:08:38.269 align:start position:0%
minutes away from the County
Correctional

04:08:38.269 --> 04:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
Correctional
 
04:08:40.750 --> 04:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
Facility a lot of the times they will
 
04:08:43.109 --> 04:08:43.119 align:start position:0%
say no we're not coming to get them we
 
04:08:45.309 --> 04:08:45.319 align:start position:0%
don't want to come and get them so then
 
04:08:47.670 --> 04:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
this bill puts us in a position of so
 
04:08:49.790 --> 04:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
are we holding them are we not holding
 
04:08:52.590 --> 04:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
them which and then also if we are
 
04:08:56.309 --> 04:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
holding them but RSA 30b has not changed
 
04:08:58.790 --> 04:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
are we then facing litigation so this
 
04:09:01.030 --> 04:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
will cost the County's money it may not
 
04:09:02.950 --> 04:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
affect the state or the state budget but
 
04:09:05.550 --> 04:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
this will cost County's
 
04:09:09.590 --> 04:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
money um so what does an RSA 30b it is
 
04:09:12.070 --> 04:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
the two reasons why we are allowed to
 
04:09:13.910 --> 04:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
hold an individual
 
04:09:15.550 --> 04:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
oh I see at a County Correctional
 
04:09:17.510 --> 04:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
Facility this would it be a third thing
 
04:09:19.149 --> 04:09:19.159 align:start position:0%
this would be a third thing that is not
 
04:09:21.349 --> 04:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
addressed in this bill that issue is not
 
04:09:24.429 --> 04:09:24.439 align:start position:0%
addressed I see and if we were to change
 
04:09:27.790 --> 04:09:27.800 align:start position:0%
RSA 30b presumably you'd want uh some
 
04:09:29.830 --> 04:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
money for this purpose correct all right
 
04:09:29.840 --> 04:09:31.070 align:start position:0%
money for this purpose correct all right
representative

04:09:31.070 --> 04:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:09:33.830 --> 04:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
wer yeah Rockingham County has had
 
04:09:35.750 --> 04:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
federal prisoners before we've made
 
04:09:38.269 --> 04:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
money out of it and my recollection is
 
04:09:40.590 --> 04:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
that the feds would also pay for their
 
04:09:43.550 --> 04:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
meals and their any medical work why Is
 
04:09:47.950 --> 04:09:47.960 align:start position:0%
this different um a detain a detainer is
 
04:09:50.389 --> 04:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
different than a warrant we are only
 
04:09:53.149 --> 04:09:53.159 align:start position:0%
allowed to so um the reason we can hold
 
04:09:55.469 --> 04:09:55.479 align:start position:0%
someone who let's say has a warrant out
 
04:09:59.269 --> 04:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
in Cal California is because of
 
04:10:01.670 --> 04:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
agreements with the governors across the
 
04:10:04.429 --> 04:10:04.439 align:start position:0%
states to hold someone that agreement
 
04:10:07.149 --> 04:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
does not exist in Rockingham County now
 
04:10:09.070 --> 04:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
right now your superintendent is working
 
04:10:12.550 --> 04:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
on a contract but that may or may not
 
04:10:14.550 --> 04:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
happen with in the next 6 to eight
 
04:10:16.670 --> 04:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
months we don't know it's not something
 
04:10:18.950 --> 04:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
that we can ask for well we can ask for
 
04:10:21.750 --> 04:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
it but it's not up to the county as to
 
04:10:23.590 --> 04:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
whether or not they get that contract
 
04:10:25.630 --> 04:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
right that's that's a decision for the
 
04:10:28.149 --> 04:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
feds I guess the difference is that
 
04:10:30.550 --> 04:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
those were people who were arrested
 
04:10:32.910 --> 04:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
correct feds these people have not yet
 
04:10:35.830 --> 04:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
been arrested correct thank you
 
04:10:38.229 --> 04:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
representative Ms thank you Mr chair and
 
04:10:41.830 --> 04:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming in and um you know
 
04:10:44.309 --> 04:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
explaining this um was this brought up
 
04:10:46.670 --> 04:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
during the hearing in criminal justice
 
04:10:48.990 --> 04:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately the way the association
 
04:10:50.750 --> 04:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
works we need to vote as a full
 
04:10:52.670 --> 04:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
executive committee before we can take
 
04:10:54.550 --> 04:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
positions on the bills and this bill was
 
04:10:56.389 --> 04:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
scheduled before we were able to meet as
 
04:10:58.510 --> 04:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
an executive committee but I did speak
 
04:11:00.550 --> 04:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
to representative Sweeney in the hallway
 
04:11:03.269 --> 04:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
afterwards and we did send a letter to
 
04:11:04.830 --> 04:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice committee before
 
04:11:07.429 --> 04:11:07.439 align:start position:0%
they exec the bill and we sent out an a
 
04:11:10.109 --> 04:11:10.119 align:start position:0%
letter to the entire house pointing out
 
04:11:14.269 --> 04:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:16.510 --> 04:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
representative evil well could we have
 
04:11:18.910 --> 04:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
that letter again as a reminder I'm
 
04:11:21.469 --> 04:11:21.479 align:start position:0%
happy to uh I've also spoken to
 
04:11:23.189 --> 04:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
representative Roy because the Senate
 
04:11:25.830 --> 04:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
has a companion bill and the correction
 
04:11:27.870 --> 04:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
superintendents have come up with
 
04:11:29.950 --> 04:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
language that they think works I'm happy
 
04:11:32.710 --> 04:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
to provide that to the committee as well
 
04:11:34.990 --> 04:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
um that you could add an amendment on to
 
04:11:38.429 --> 04:11:38.439 align:start position:0%
here thank you so is the is the Senate
 
04:11:41.269 --> 04:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
Bill otherwise the same or no there is
 
04:11:43.389 --> 04:11:43.399 align:start position:0%
one slight
 
04:11:46.750 --> 04:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
difference in the language but the
 
04:11:50.590 --> 04:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
concept is the same gotcha okay all
 
04:11:52.910 --> 04:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
right rep representative Sweeny I guess
 
04:11:55.030 --> 04:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh when can we get
 
04:11:56.950 --> 04:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
the amendment language I can send it to
 
04:11:58.790 --> 04:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
you as soon as I get back to my computer
 
04:12:00.870 --> 04:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cambrell did
 
04:12:03.990 --> 04:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
you have no okay all right so I guess we
 
04:12:06.550 --> 04:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
will hold off on this one because it's
 
04:12:10.229 --> 04:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
somewhat unclear whether um there's
 
04:12:12.670 --> 04:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
still some open issues right so so this
 
04:12:15.990 --> 04:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
might want to be amended and it might
 
04:12:18.950 --> 04:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
want to be a bill ought to pass with
 
04:12:20.349 --> 04:12:20.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment or it might want to be part of
 
04:12:23.630 --> 04:12:23.640 align:start position:0%
house bill to right so um so maybe we'll
 
04:12:25.429 --> 04:12:25.439 align:start position:0%
we'll wait on the rest of this one thank
 
04:12:28.429 --> 04:12:28.439 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
04:12:32.469 --> 04:12:32.479 align:start position:0%
okay so we're going to wait on this
 
04:12:36.189 --> 04:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
one all right now you've
 
04:12:41.070 --> 04:12:41.080 align:start position:0%
done did we retain 619 if you want to um
 
04:12:42.910 --> 04:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
the bills that we did we didn't execute
 
04:12:45.149 --> 04:12:45.159 align:start position:0%
on any of them if you want to okay if
 
04:12:47.750 --> 04:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
you want to go back and consider some
 
04:12:50.149 --> 04:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
motions on those it's up to you yeah why
 
04:12:51.189 --> 04:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
don't we do
 
04:12:53.990 --> 04:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
that um so on my
 
04:12:56.710 --> 04:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
bill as long as we're here can I make a
 
04:13:00.149 --> 04:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
motion about to pass on House Bill
 
04:13:03.630 --> 04:13:03.640 align:start position:0%
650 and I'll second that
 
04:13:07.990 --> 04:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
motion oh and our oh is the housekeeping
 
04:13:16.950 --> 04:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:19.349 --> 04:13:19.359 align:start position:0%
yes so I assume you talked about this
 
04:13:22.149 --> 04:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
this is really just a housekeeping minor
 
04:13:22.159 --> 04:13:27.070 align:start position:0%
this is really just a housekeeping minor
thing

04:13:27.070 --> 04:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:29.429 --> 04:13:29.439 align:start position:0%

the blur right so
 
04:13:42.189 --> 04:13:42.199 align:start position:0%

they're going to be doing an amendment
 
04:15:50.030 --> 04:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
to uh remove the cost because they have
 
04:15:52.630 --> 04:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
a fund that's going to cover that no
 
04:15:56.349 --> 04:15:56.359 align:start position:0%
that's a different one oh okay sorry I
 
04:16:00.030 --> 04:16:00.040 align:start position:0%

04:16:01.279 --> 04:16:02.950 align:start position:0%
on that
one

04:16:02.950 --> 04:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:16:06.750 --> 04:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
HB HB 164 there's um an amendment from
 
04:16:09.149 --> 04:16:09.159 align:start position:0%
the sponsor in front of you that's
 
04:16:11.590 --> 04:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
aligning the position request and the
 
04:16:13.269 --> 04:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
funding but it does have an
 
04:16:16.109 --> 04:16:16.119 align:start position:0%
appropriation so it's just a regular
 
04:16:18.389 --> 04:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate something to do so maybe we
 
04:16:21.030 --> 04:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
should retain this and consider for I
 
04:16:23.510 --> 04:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
mean I'll I'll make the motion to retain
 
04:16:27.950 --> 04:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
HB 164 okay all right and second by
 
04:16:29.870 --> 04:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
represent all right motion by
 
04:16:31.950 --> 04:16:31.960 align:start position:0%
representative evil to retain House Bill
 
04:16:34.990 --> 04:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
164 seconded by representative rung any
 
04:16:38.590 --> 04:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
questions any debate okay all those in
 
04:16:43.030 --> 04:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
payer yes unanimous okay great okay
 
04:16:45.149 --> 04:16:45.159 align:start position:0%
retain and we can consider the amendment
 
04:16:48.269 --> 04:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
and so on but all this new spending is
 
04:16:49.990 --> 04:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
not good all
 
04:16:54.510 --> 04:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
right house bill 67 that's the one where
 
04:16:57.149 --> 04:16:57.159 align:start position:0%
is an amendment coming so okay so we
 
04:16:59.429 --> 04:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
should just wait that so represent
 
04:17:01.830 --> 04:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
regard the amendment um may come but we
 
04:17:04.630 --> 04:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
could also do it here LBA can do it just
 
04:17:06.149 --> 04:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
because it's deleting section three
 
04:17:07.590 --> 04:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
which is the appropriation and changing
 
04:17:09.950 --> 04:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
the effective date for section 4 so if
 
04:17:11.229 --> 04:17:11.239 align:start position:0%
it's something you were looking to take
 
04:17:15.670 --> 04:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
action on we can vote um on the bill as
 
04:17:18.109 --> 04:17:18.119 align:start position:0%
amended oh I see we can just sort of say
 
04:17:19.469 --> 04:17:19.479 align:start position:0%
what we wanted in the amend yes that's
 
04:17:20.790 --> 04:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
what we we've done and then when we get
 
04:17:23.030 --> 04:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
to the full committee will'll have it
 
04:17:24.550 --> 04:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
ready and correct it's a very straight
 
04:17:26.550 --> 04:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
board Amendment he said something about
 
04:17:29.189 --> 04:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
extending the pilot program through the
 
04:17:30.990 --> 04:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
so he was just extending the effective
 
04:17:33.469 --> 04:17:33.479 align:start position:0%
date yeah okay um which is section 4 to
 
04:17:36.990 --> 04:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
1231 2025 and then deleting Section 3
 
04:17:39.990 --> 04:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
which was the appropriation so I'll I'll
 
04:17:42.830 --> 04:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
make a motion um or I'm recommend
 
04:17:45.550 --> 04:17:45.560 align:start position:0%
mending ought to pass as amended and the
 
04:17:48.870 --> 04:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
amendment would remove the $100,000
 
04:17:51.429 --> 04:17:51.439 align:start position:0%
appropriation in the original Bill and
 
04:17:53.550 --> 04:17:53.560 align:start position:0%
it would extend the effective date to
 
04:17:56.510 --> 04:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
December 31st of
 
04:17:59.670 --> 04:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
2025 I'll second that and and why are we
 
04:18:02.309 --> 04:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
doing the extension because the
 
04:18:05.269 --> 04:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State asked us to no but
 
04:18:09.309 --> 04:18:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:13.429 --> 04:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
something for programming gotcha okay
 
04:18:16.550 --> 04:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
all right so the motion is uh ought to
 
04:18:18.790 --> 04:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
pass with Amendment the amendment would
 
04:18:20.510 --> 04:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
remove section three from the bill and
 
04:18:22.790 --> 04:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
change the effective date to December
 
04:18:22.800 --> 04:18:24.389 align:start position:0%
change the effective date to December
31st

04:18:24.389 --> 04:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
31st

04:19:29.389 --> 04:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:36.990 --> 04:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:41.309 --> 04:19:41.319 align:start position:0%

here is there anyone here to talk about
 
04:19:46.830 --> 04:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:19:50.790 --> 04:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:50.800 --> 04:19:52.309 align:start position:0%
 
Pearson

04:19:52.309 --> 04:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
Pearson
 
04:19:54.670 --> 04:19:54.680 align:start position:0%
yes you like
 
04:19:58.229 --> 04:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
to I don't see it in my
 
04:20:02.389 --> 04:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
list there it is there it
 
04:20:02.399 --> 04:20:04.189 align:start position:0%
list there it is there it
is

04:20:04.189 --> 04:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:20:07.870 --> 04:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
okay you are a co-sponsor okay so tell
 
04:20:10.030 --> 04:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
us what this does sure thank you for the
 
04:20:11.910 --> 04:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
record Representative Steve Pearson
 
04:20:13.950 --> 04:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District 13 which encompasses
 
04:20:18.349 --> 04:20:18.359 align:start position:0%
Dairy I am a co-sponsor of House Bill
 
04:20:21.670 --> 04:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
282 so what 282 basically does is
 
04:20:25.269 --> 04:20:25.279 align:start position:0%
there's a pool of money that exists it's
 
04:20:27.990 --> 04:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
currently half a million in the event
 
04:20:32.429 --> 04:20:32.439 align:start position:0%
that we have a critical injury situation
 
04:20:35.189 --> 04:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
and it pays
 
04:20:39.429 --> 04:20:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:41.990 --> 04:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
situation as time progresses and as I
 
04:20:43.550 --> 04:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
certainly don't have to tell Finance the
 
04:20:46.790 --> 04:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
cost of things go up
 
04:20:49.910 --> 04:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
and what happens is the 500,000 isn't
 
04:20:53.109 --> 04:20:53.119 align:start position:0%
what it used to be right
 
04:20:53.119 --> 04:20:55.109 align:start position:0%
what it used to be right
so

04:20:55.109 --> 04:20:55.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:20:57.149 --> 04:20:57.159 align:start position:0%
historically that fund has never
 
04:21:01.109 --> 04:21:01.119 align:start position:0%
expended in in a given period more than
 
04:21:03.830 --> 04:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
$375,000 so but let me give you a little
 
04:21:07.189 --> 04:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
a little piece of reality so and I'll do
 
04:21:08.830 --> 04:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
it on a on
 
04:21:12.550 --> 04:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
a in a way that we all we all can apply
 
04:21:15.469 --> 04:21:15.479 align:start position:0%
app to uh Interstate 93 you get a car
 
04:21:17.910 --> 04:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
wreck we get two two fire engines which
 
04:21:19.950 --> 04:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
is required there's a federal statute
 
04:21:22.389 --> 04:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
now for that in an ambulance that will
 
04:21:25.149 --> 04:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
put between eight and 10 people on the
 
04:21:27.469 --> 04:21:27.479 align:start position:0%
highway unfortunately as we've all seen
 
04:21:30.510 --> 04:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
on the news and in other videos um on
 
04:21:33.710 --> 04:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
occasion drivers have plowed into those
 
04:21:33.720 --> 04:21:35.830 align:start position:0%
occasion drivers have plowed into those
events

04:21:35.830 --> 04:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
events
 
04:21:38.950 --> 04:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
so just
 
04:21:42.149 --> 04:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
simply one event that was catastrophic
 
04:21:46.429 --> 04:21:46.439 align:start position:0%
that 500 is gone like one event so the
 
04:21:48.309 --> 04:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
concept here is that it takes that pool
 
04:21:49.790 --> 04:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
of money that doesn't have to be
 
04:21:52.229 --> 04:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
expended but is there and it puts it at
 
04:21:54.830 --> 04:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
$1 million that that's the purpose of
 
04:21:56.389 --> 04:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
that so that in the event of a
 
04:22:00.030 --> 04:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
catastrophic event God forbid um it it's
 
04:22:02.990 --> 04:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
there now again it's not I want to be
 
04:22:04.030 --> 04:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
clear on something because I think there
 
04:22:07.149 --> 04:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
was a little bit of confusion
 
04:22:09.630 --> 04:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
um during the testimony on the floor of
 
04:22:11.229 --> 04:22:11.239 align:start position:0%
the house this does not increase the
 
04:22:13.389 --> 04:22:13.399 align:start position:0%
benefit to anyone specifically the
 
04:22:16.710 --> 04:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
benefit ceiling stays exactly what it is
 
04:22:20.149 --> 04:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
it this is just making the potential
 
04:22:24.109 --> 04:22:24.119 align:start position:0%
pool of money available there in the
 
04:22:26.349 --> 04:22:26.359 align:start position:0%
event that we have a more catastrophic
 
04:22:30.229 --> 04:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
event that is the gist of this so I I I
 
04:22:31.710 --> 04:22:31.720 align:start position:0%
know there seem to be some confusion
 
04:22:34.349 --> 04:22:34.359 align:start position:0%
with some folks as to are we you know is
 
04:22:35.510 --> 04:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
this is this a benefit that an
 
04:22:37.750 --> 04:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
individual person is getting absolutely
 
04:22:39.990 --> 04:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
not those limits all stay right where
 
04:22:41.950 --> 04:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
they are it's just that we we're in
 
04:22:44.750 --> 04:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
situation now where like I said
 
04:22:46.990 --> 04:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
something simple on the highway and you
 
04:22:49.910 --> 04:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
wiped out five people and here we are we
 
04:22:52.550 --> 04:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
already exhausted it so um that that's
 
04:22:55.710 --> 04:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
the ask that's the gist of it and um I
 
04:22:58.710 --> 04:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
hope we never ever have to expend a
 
04:23:00.750 --> 04:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
dollar out of it but
 
04:23:02.870 --> 04:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's the premise of the bill
 
04:23:04.269 --> 04:23:04.279 align:start position:0%
seems inevitable all right
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
representative Ms thank you Mr chair and
 
04:23:09.710 --> 04:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my questions um and
 
04:23:11.590 --> 04:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
it it does seem re re relatively
 
04:23:13.269 --> 04:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
straightforward particularly the way you
 
04:23:14.990 --> 04:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
explained it the question I have for you
 
04:23:17.389 --> 04:23:17.399 align:start position:0%
is when was the when's the last time
 
04:23:19.790 --> 04:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
that the 125,000 per claim it was
 
04:23:21.870 --> 04:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
adjusted that I cannot tell you I have
 
04:23:25.229 --> 04:23:25.239 align:start position:0%
no idea and my I guess my point is that
 
04:23:27.349 --> 04:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
you know as you mentioned $500,000 isn't
 
04:23:29.910 --> 04:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
what it used to be neither is 125,000
 
04:23:32.229 --> 04:23:32.239 align:start position:0%
did you consider sure raising that
 
04:23:34.750 --> 04:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
amount per claimant I I think that
 
04:23:38.229 --> 04:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
realistically um I would rather be able
 
04:23:41.870 --> 04:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
to cover more people within the within
 
04:23:45.469 --> 04:23:45.479 align:start position:0%
the pool of money than give an
 
04:23:48.030 --> 04:23:48.040 align:start position:0%
individual a greater benefit because at
 
04:23:50.710 --> 04:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
that point you're going to have to it
 
04:23:52.030 --> 04:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
like I said if you've got a truck that
 
04:23:54.389 --> 04:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
goes through an accident scene and and
 
04:23:57.349 --> 04:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
by the way and I forgive forgive my my
 
04:23:59.189 --> 04:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
colleagues that that wear the gun behind
 
04:24:01.429 --> 04:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
me um I didn't even you know tally the
 
04:24:02.910 --> 04:24:02.920 align:start position:0%
cops that that show up to this too I
 
04:24:05.149 --> 04:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
just mentioned you fire an EMS Personnel
 
04:24:06.590 --> 04:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a slew of Troopers
 
04:24:09.030 --> 04:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
and um especially on the highway that
 
04:24:12.109 --> 04:24:12.119 align:start position:0%
that may may or may not be involved um
 
04:24:14.109 --> 04:24:14.119 align:start position:0%
or early on but definitely involved for
 
04:24:17.910 --> 04:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
100% in the process so um you know
 
04:24:20.469 --> 04:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
we're I would rather see six people
 
04:24:23.510 --> 04:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
covered than four people covered better
 
04:24:25.189 --> 04:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense I mean you know and
 
04:24:26.590 --> 04:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
we can that's something that can be
 
04:24:29.149 --> 04:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
looked at later on I I we didn't really
 
04:24:31.070 --> 04:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
dive into that that part of it it was
 
04:24:33.469 --> 04:24:33.479 align:start position:0%
just a matter of of sheer numbers and
 
04:24:35.550 --> 04:24:35.560 align:start position:0%
and the unfortunate realities that are
 
04:24:36.590 --> 04:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
going on
 
04:24:39.070 --> 04:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
lately other questions representative
 
04:24:41.349 --> 04:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
cell thank you Mr chair uh help me
 
04:24:43.910 --> 04:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
understand the fund so why if somebody's
 
04:24:45.630 --> 04:24:45.640 align:start position:0%
critically injured on the job I'm
 
04:24:48.349 --> 04:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
assuming they all have insurance or uh
 
04:24:50.109 --> 04:24:50.119 align:start position:0%
is this fund intended to like if they
 
04:24:51.790 --> 04:24:51.800 align:start position:0%
didn't have insurance or didn't have
 
04:24:54.389 --> 04:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
enough coverage why why wouldn't
 
04:24:59.269 --> 04:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
insurances uh cover the this situation
 
04:25:02.189 --> 04:25:02.199 align:start position:0%
so the yes if you're if you're in in
 
04:25:03.870 --> 04:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
emergency response mode you are not a
 
04:25:07.670 --> 04:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
freelance uh first responder so you are
 
04:25:10.309 --> 04:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
working for an agency a municipality
 
04:25:11.870 --> 04:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
either private or public most likely in
 
04:25:13.429 --> 04:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it's public but we do have
 
04:25:17.349 --> 04:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
some private EMS um the workers comp
 
04:25:19.630 --> 04:25:19.640 align:start position:0%
part of that if anybody here has ever
 
04:25:21.790 --> 04:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
gone through that is a very long
 
04:25:24.950 --> 04:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
complicated drawn out
 
04:25:29.269 --> 04:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
arduous legal unfortunately battle that
 
04:25:33.070 --> 04:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
occurs where you can have a someone who
 
04:25:36.510 --> 04:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
basically is in in a state of limbo for
 
04:25:40.030 --> 04:25:40.040 align:start position:0%
quite some time um you know I i' I've
 
04:25:41.670 --> 04:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
sat for three terms on the PTSD
 
04:25:44.269 --> 04:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
Commission we have
 
04:25:48.870 --> 04:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
addressed um issues with that just the
 
04:25:52.950 --> 04:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
the process you know and and I know it's
 
04:25:55.149 --> 04:25:55.159 align:start position:0%
like well okay you're you're in uniform
 
04:25:56.149 --> 04:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
you're on the highway you get hit by a
 
04:25:58.070 --> 04:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
truck should be open and shut case with
 
04:26:01.670 --> 04:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
workers comp and yet the initial letter
 
04:26:04.149 --> 04:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
you'll receive from them is a denial and
 
04:26:06.349 --> 04:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
that is some of that is a procedural
 
04:26:07.710 --> 04:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
thing some of it has to do with just
 
04:26:11.030 --> 04:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
timelines that exist but nothing in that
 
04:26:14.429 --> 04:26:14.439 align:start position:0%
world moves quickly so these funds
 
04:26:18.229 --> 04:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
assist with that um so that folks can
 
04:26:21.550 --> 04:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
get moving forward I mean depending on
 
04:26:22.990 --> 04:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
you might have to modify your house you
 
04:26:24.349 --> 04:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
might have to put a ramp in you may not
 
04:26:25.870 --> 04:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
have use of your legs you might I mean
 
04:26:27.830 --> 04:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
there's there's some things that that
 
04:26:30.189 --> 04:26:30.199 align:start position:0%
that goes to that
 
04:26:32.670 --> 04:26:32.680 align:start position:0%
um that workers cop will eventually
 
04:26:36.109 --> 04:26:36.119 align:start position:0%
catch up to but it takes time follow up
 
04:26:39.070 --> 04:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
yeah follow up thank you um so I I
 
04:26:42.269 --> 04:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
understand that um eventually when the
 
04:26:43.630 --> 04:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
workers comp catches up and the
 
04:26:45.750 --> 04:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
insurance catches up will the fund be
 
04:26:48.590 --> 04:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
replenished I don't I am not aware of
 
04:26:50.830 --> 04:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
that mechanism
 
04:26:54.670 --> 04:26:54.680 align:start position:0%
existing why I why does that not happen
 
04:26:57.630 --> 04:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
there's it's it's just another one of a
 
04:26:59.429 --> 04:26:59.439 align:start position:0%
hundred questions that I ask about
 
04:27:02.189 --> 04:27:02.199 align:start position:0%
workers comp that I do not understand
 
04:27:05.550 --> 04:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
the logic um that
 
04:27:09.790 --> 04:27:09.800 align:start position:0%
exists in their minds um because we have
 
04:27:14.070 --> 04:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
we have situations where um workers comp
 
04:27:14.080 --> 04:27:15.189 align:start position:0%
we have situations where um workers comp
has

04:27:15.189 --> 04:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
has
 
04:27:17.910 --> 04:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
paid for something when a person was on
 
04:27:21.109 --> 04:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
sick leave and the complexities actually
 
04:27:22.510 --> 04:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
a matter of fact in the last PTSD
 
04:27:24.070 --> 04:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
commission three weeks
 
04:27:26.790 --> 04:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
ago we were told that the insurance
 
04:27:28.590 --> 04:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
companies because they the question was
 
04:27:30.429 --> 04:27:30.439 align:start position:0%
asked well if they're getting if that's
 
04:27:32.389 --> 04:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
getting straightened out will that money
 
04:27:33.870 --> 04:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
be returned to the insurance company and
 
04:27:35.189 --> 04:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
we were told the insurance companies
 
04:27:38.750 --> 04:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
have no mechanism to accept money which
 
04:27:40.750 --> 04:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
I think is was the most shocking thing
 
04:27:41.910 --> 04:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
I've ever heard that insurance company
 
04:27:46.590 --> 04:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
has way of of being paid back so um
 
04:27:49.670 --> 04:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
that that just as of right now
 
04:27:51.630 --> 04:27:51.640 align:start position:0%
apparently doesn't
 
04:27:55.189 --> 04:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
exist so so that basically lets them off
 
04:27:57.469 --> 04:27:57.479 align:start position:0%
the hook the I I don't think it lefts
 
04:27:58.990 --> 04:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
them off the hook we're talking about a
 
04:28:01.469 --> 04:28:01.479 align:start position:0%
catastrophic injury who which claims are
 
04:28:02.590 --> 04:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:28:05.630 --> 04:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
millions this by no means is bailing out
 
04:28:09.070 --> 04:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
an insurance carrier or or anything like
 
04:28:11.309 --> 04:28:11.319 align:start position:0%
that we're these are sub these are this
 
04:28:13.590 --> 04:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
isn't just minor events that occur this
 
04:28:15.550 --> 04:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
this fund is dedicated for catastrophic
 
04:28:17.510 --> 04:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
events so yeah but yet it has occurred
 
04:28:20.149 --> 04:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
so all those as you just stated all that
 
04:28:22.309 --> 04:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
money that they should have paid back
 
04:28:24.070 --> 04:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
has not been paid back we you don't know
 
04:28:26.510 --> 04:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
the reason why but that's something we I
 
04:28:28.710 --> 04:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
think we need to investigate so I don't
 
04:28:30.389 --> 04:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
and I you know and if there's if there's
 
04:28:32.830 --> 04:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
legislation in the future to address the
 
04:28:35.550 --> 04:28:35.560 align:start position:0%
how that works I I would love to be uh
 
04:28:38.429 --> 04:28:38.439 align:start position:0%
involved in it certainly because I it we
 
04:28:40.830 --> 04:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
we scratch our heads on that you know it
 
04:28:43.510 --> 04:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
just there's some there a disconnect
 
04:28:46.710 --> 04:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
somewhere there no no doubt so Melissa
 
04:28:49.189 --> 04:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming there's no dedicated fund
 
04:28:52.750 --> 04:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
here that's holding $500,000 ready to
 
04:28:55.349 --> 04:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
pay this it's just a source is the
 
04:29:00.429 --> 04:29:00.439 align:start position:0%
general fund yeah yeah okay so and it
 
04:29:03.429 --> 04:29:03.439 align:start position:0%
only come taken when when such an
 
04:29:05.870 --> 04:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
incident happens so were we to pass this
 
04:29:08.830 --> 04:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
bill there's probably no effect on on
 
04:29:13.670 --> 04:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:15.790 --> 04:29:15.800 align:start position:0%
right unless it's utilized um I have a
 
04:29:17.910 --> 04:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
message out right now trying to figure
 
04:29:19.750 --> 04:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
out how that would work where that would
 
04:29:22.349 --> 04:29:22.359 align:start position:0%
be recorded if there is an increase so
 
04:29:23.750 --> 04:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
if that if there is an additional
 
04:29:26.269 --> 04:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
$500,000 you say someone is injured
 
04:29:29.070 --> 04:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
where does that show up in the line item
 
04:29:30.950 --> 04:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be on the Surplus statement
 
04:29:32.229 --> 04:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
because not an appropriation but I do
 
04:29:33.790 --> 04:29:33.800 align:start position:0%
want to just get clarification of how
 
04:29:37.469 --> 04:29:37.479 align:start position:0%
that does impact I mean this is like we
 
04:29:39.189 --> 04:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
have some other benefit of somebody
 
04:29:43.109 --> 04:29:43.119 align:start position:0%
killed right and and we raised that
 
04:29:45.670 --> 04:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh a while back but I don't know that we
 
04:29:47.870 --> 04:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
added anything to the Surplus statement
 
04:29:50.030 --> 04:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
because of we definitely would not add
 
04:29:52.149 --> 04:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
anything to the Surplus statement yeah
 
04:29:55.269 --> 04:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
yeah so yes rep representative Griffin
 
04:29:58.510 --> 04:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I I just like I have many years
 
04:30:01.670 --> 04:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
experience in Industry admittedly it
 
04:30:04.910 --> 04:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't in the state it was in another
 
04:30:08.349 --> 04:30:08.359 align:start position:0%
state but uh as a Chief Financial
 
04:30:10.910 --> 04:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
Officer I got heavily involved in
 
04:30:14.550 --> 04:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
workman comp claims and I found that the
 
04:30:16.910 --> 04:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
insurance companies were very very
 
04:30:20.750 --> 04:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
responsive to claims that were clearly
 
04:30:23.590 --> 04:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
claims it's true if someone had a back
 
04:30:26.590 --> 04:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
injury or something it got more drawn
 
04:30:29.830 --> 04:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
out but we had cases where a truck
 
04:30:32.389 --> 04:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
driver got on top of his truck fell down
 
04:30:35.429 --> 04:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
between the load and the cab and managed
 
04:30:39.550 --> 04:30:39.560 align:start position:0%
to expire trying to get out and um the
 
04:30:44.469 --> 04:30:44.479 align:start position:0%
settlements were were very very fast we
 
04:30:47.870 --> 04:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
had other cases where someone was badly
 
04:30:50.389 --> 04:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
hurt on a job clearly in the hospital
 
04:30:53.590 --> 04:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
with broken bones and things and the
 
04:30:57.349 --> 04:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
response was very very fast it's true
 
04:31:00.750 --> 04:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
when this cases someone says they strain
 
04:31:00.760 --> 04:31:01.870 align:start position:0%
when this cases someone says they strain
their

04:31:01.870 --> 04:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:31:05.030 --> 04:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
back they're a little slower but but I
 
04:31:06.910 --> 04:31:06.920 align:start position:0%
think that's to be understood I just
 
04:31:09.469 --> 04:31:09.479 align:start position:0%
want to I want to defend the companies a
 
04:31:09.479 --> 04:31:10.590 align:start position:0%
want to I want to defend the companies a
little

04:31:10.590 --> 04:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
little
 
04:31:13.790 --> 04:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
bit very good good other questions for
 
04:31:16.750 --> 04:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson no is there
 
04:31:18.830 --> 04:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
anyone else here who would like oh did I
 
04:31:22.109 --> 04:31:22.119 align:start position:0%
see one meliss okay I did get an answer
 
04:31:23.429 --> 04:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
um so in the
 
04:31:25.510 --> 04:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
statute a warrant would be drawn from
 
04:31:27.870 --> 04:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
the governor If This Were to apply so we
 
04:31:28.910 --> 04:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
don't need to worry about it in the
 
04:31:30.910 --> 04:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
budget but that's that's how the money
 
04:31:33.309 --> 04:31:33.319 align:start position:0%
transferred over I I would assume thank
 
04:31:35.269 --> 04:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
you very much I do have one question for
 
04:31:38.429 --> 04:31:38.439 align:start position:0%
you for you Mr chair um would it in the
 
04:31:41.590 --> 04:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
future would it make sense I mean we
 
04:31:41.600 --> 04:31:42.670 align:start position:0%
future would it make sense I mean we
have

04:31:42.670 --> 04:31:42.680 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:31:44.830 --> 04:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds that that hold and I
 
04:31:46.990 --> 04:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
know we don't there's a reluctance to to
 
04:31:48.510 --> 04:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
just hold money for the sake of holding
 
04:31:51.309 --> 04:31:51.319 align:start position:0%
money right I I know that um but if
 
04:31:53.510 --> 04:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
there's concern about the ability to
 
04:31:56.269 --> 04:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
draw this off
 
04:31:59.149 --> 04:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
of general fund money would it make
 
04:32:02.750 --> 04:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
sense to at some point create a fund
 
04:32:04.950 --> 04:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
where a couple of these various items
 
04:32:07.830 --> 04:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned have some money just
 
04:32:10.109 --> 04:32:10.119 align:start position:0%
set aside well effectively that's what
 
04:32:13.670 --> 04:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
the rainy day is for right and that has
 
04:32:17.710 --> 04:32:17.720 align:start position:0%
at the moment that has 292 million but
 
04:32:19.429 --> 04:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
okay so this would be eligible to be
 
04:32:20.830 --> 04:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
drawn from the rainy day fund
 
04:32:22.269 --> 04:32:22.279 align:start position:0%
essentially yes it would be okay all
 
04:32:24.229 --> 04:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
right so we have it excellent thank you
 
04:32:26.510 --> 04:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
okay very good anyone else here who
 
04:32:28.309 --> 04:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak I see a hand in the back
 
04:32:35.870 --> 04:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:37.590 --> 04:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
up thank
 
04:32:40.189 --> 04:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon I'm Danielle Albert
 
04:32:41.389 --> 04:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
I'm the Deputy Commissioner of the New
 
04:32:43.030 --> 04:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Labor I promise
 
04:32:44.510 --> 04:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
I will be brief I just thought I might
 
04:32:46.149 --> 04:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
be able to answer some of the questions
 
04:32:47.750 --> 04:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
that were raised relative to the workers
 
04:32:50.070 --> 04:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
compensation system and how these
 
04:32:52.389 --> 04:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
petitions um sort of funnel through and
 
04:32:54.710 --> 04:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
and when the benefit applies um in the
 
04:32:56.229 --> 04:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
first instance there had been a question
 
04:32:57.030 --> 04:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
about the
 
04:32:59.389 --> 04:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
$125,000 cap as representative Pearson
 
04:33:02.070 --> 04:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
had noted um there there's no change in
 
04:33:03.790 --> 04:33:03.800 align:start position:0%
this proposed language relative to that
 
04:33:05.390 --> 04:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
cap I believe the question was whether
 
04:33:07.150 --> 04:33:07.160 align:start position:0%
or not the cap had ever been adjusted it
 
04:33:09.709 --> 04:33:09.719 align:start position:0%
has not the bill or the original um
 
04:33:11.869 --> 04:33:11.879 align:start position:0%
version of this statute went into effect
 
04:33:14.949 --> 04:33:14.959 align:start position:0%
back in 2014 and it's been at 125,000
 
04:33:17.070 --> 04:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
since then um just sort of by way of
 
04:33:18.629 --> 04:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
mechanism in the workers compensation
 
04:33:20.150 --> 04:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
system itself this is an additional
 
04:33:22.590 --> 04:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
benefit that gets paid to um First
 
04:33:24.789 --> 04:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
Responders who have critical injuries
 
04:33:26.150 --> 04:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
those petitions are filed through the
 
04:33:27.830 --> 04:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor and on vetting of
 
04:33:29.709 --> 04:33:29.719 align:start position:0%
certain criteria through the department
 
04:33:31.629 --> 04:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
um a warrant can be drawn through the
 
04:33:33.910 --> 04:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
governor's office for payout uh from
 
04:33:35.429 --> 04:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
this particular fund and it's paid in
 
04:33:37.629 --> 04:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
addition to other workers compensation
 
04:33:39.070 --> 04:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
benefits so in order for a first
 
04:33:40.910 --> 04:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
responder to be eligible for it they do
 
04:33:42.869 --> 04:33:42.879 align:start position:0%
have to have a compens ible claim so
 
04:33:44.310 --> 04:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
there's been some determination either
 
04:33:45.670 --> 04:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
by the insurance carrier through the
 
04:33:47.590 --> 04:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor that this is a work
 
04:33:49.230 --> 04:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
injury that meets the stated standards
 
04:33:51.310 --> 04:33:51.320 align:start position:0%
under the workers compensation law um
 
04:33:53.869 --> 04:33:53.879 align:start position:0%
and it's paid in addition to um other
 
04:33:56.470 --> 04:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
benefits cash benefits medical benefits
 
04:33:58.150 --> 04:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
all of the other pieces um that come
 
04:33:59.269 --> 04:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
along with having a workers's
 
04:34:01.349 --> 04:34:01.359 align:start position:0%
compensation claim so I just thought I
 
04:34:03.189 --> 04:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
would clarify the the process and the
 
04:34:05.990 --> 04:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
procedure so we're probably not seeing
 
04:34:08.789 --> 04:34:08.799 align:start position:0%
the whole law inside this bill but it
 
04:34:10.750 --> 04:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
says that the payment to an individual
 
04:34:13.470 --> 04:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
shall not exceed exed
 
04:34:16.310 --> 04:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
$125,000 correct how is the payment
 
04:34:18.349 --> 04:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
determined what the what the level is is
 
04:34:20.310 --> 04:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
it based on the severity of the injury
 
04:34:22.429 --> 04:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
or is it an excellent question so the
 
04:34:24.429 --> 04:34:24.439 align:start position:0%
language that you're not seeing uh
 
04:34:27.949 --> 04:34:27.959 align:start position:0%
included in the uh the proposed change
 
04:34:29.910 --> 04:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
above that is a section where there is a
 
04:34:32.510 --> 04:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
like I call it a statutory table so for
 
04:34:35.349 --> 04:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
certain types of injury to um smell or
 
04:34:37.590 --> 04:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
sensation or to soft uh certain types of
 
04:34:39.590 --> 04:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
soft tissue organs there are a
 
04:34:42.789 --> 04:34:42.799 align:start position:0%
prescribed number of weeks that are paid
 
04:34:44.830 --> 04:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
for injuries of that nature for a
 
04:34:47.590 --> 04:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
qualifying injury and that number of
 
04:34:50.990 --> 04:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
weeks is um based on your compensation
 
04:34:53.150 --> 04:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
rate so if I am the injured worker and
 
04:34:57.230 --> 04:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
my compensation rate is uh $1,200 a week
 
04:34:59.510 --> 04:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
and I have an injury that per that table
 
04:35:02.029 --> 04:35:02.039 align:start position:0%
entitles me to 206 weeks it would be the
 
04:35:05.029 --> 04:35:05.039 align:start position:0%
206 weeks times my compensation rate to
 
04:35:06.629 --> 04:35:06.639 align:start position:0%
determine the amount of the benefit
 
04:35:08.789 --> 04:35:08.799 align:start position:0%
that's paid if it ex if the amount of
 
04:35:10.910 --> 04:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
the benefit on that calculation exceeds
 
04:35:14.349 --> 04:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
the10 $5,000 the cap applies if it's
 
04:35:16.789 --> 04:35:16.799 align:start position:0%
underneath it then it's the total
 
04:35:21.470 --> 04:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
calculation gotcha okay very good so any
 
04:35:25.629 --> 04:35:25.639 align:start position:0%
other questions no so I I tend to think
 
04:35:30.310 --> 04:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
that this is is a just an not to pass um
 
04:35:33.109 --> 04:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
Everybody sort of agreeing with that
 
04:35:35.551 --> 04:35:35.561 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so who would like to make a
 
04:35:41.869 --> 04:35:41.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:44.670 --> 04:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
okay I'll second that motion second okay
 
04:35:48.349 --> 04:35:48.359 align:start position:0%

new changes why we're doing it this way
 
04:38:34.230 --> 04:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
instead of the way we did it
 
04:38:36.869 --> 04:38:36.879 align:start position:0%
before yes represent run thank you Mr
 
04:38:40.869 --> 04:38:40.879 align:start position:0%
chair um so the amendment is essentially
 
04:38:40.879 --> 04:38:42.390 align:start position:0%
chair um so the amendment is essentially
strike

04:38:42.390 --> 04:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
strike
 
04:38:44.750 --> 04:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
or it's replacing all after section one
 
04:38:47.310 --> 04:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
but if you look at line
 
04:38:51.390 --> 04:38:51.400 align:start position:0%
14 um it's there there's the the bill
 
04:38:54.670 --> 04:38:54.680 align:start position:0%
makes it it deletes the words a pilot
 
04:38:57.551 --> 04:38:57.561 align:start position:0%
program but would that language would
 
04:39:00.150 --> 04:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
that that that wording still be struck
 
04:39:02.789 --> 04:39:02.799 align:start position:0%
no that's part of section one section
 
04:39:06.269 --> 04:39:06.279 align:start position:0%
one goes from line one I see line 19 all
 
04:39:08.189 --> 04:39:08.199 align:start position:0%
right I was looking at Roman numeral
 
04:39:10.390 --> 04:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you I always have
 
04:39:11.949 --> 04:39:11.959 align:start position:0%
trouble okay
 
04:39:15.349 --> 04:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
discussion no okay so all those in favor
 
04:39:18.910 --> 04:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
of ought to pass with Amendment
 
04:39:22.429 --> 04:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
0788 all right that's unanimous very

04:39:35.670 --> 04:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
back okay so this is
 
04:39:39.070 --> 04:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
octopus Amendment
 
04:39:42.948 --> 04:39:42.958 align:start position:0%
0781 h
 
04:39:42.958 --> 04:39:45.030 align:start position:0%

04:40:25.200 --> 04:40:26.868 align:start position:0%
five minute break yes did we take action
on

04:40:26.868 --> 04:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:40:30.788 --> 04:40:30.798 align:start position:0%
216 216 we retained it I believe is that
 
04:40:35.948 --> 04:40:35.958 align:start position:0%
right or did we yeah we voted on okay
 
04:40:40.628 --> 04:40:40.638 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so so we'll take a break until
 
04:41:10.230 --> 04:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:10.240 --> 04:41:40.230 align:start position:0%

04:46:39.830 --> 04:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:39.840 --> 04:47:09.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:47:09.830 --> 04:47:09.840 align:start position:0%

04:48:39.708 --> 04:48:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:39.718 --> 04:49:09.708 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:49:09.708 --> 04:49:09.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:49.430 --> 04:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:52.110 --> 04:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
oh because of the money because of the
 
04:49:54.788 --> 04:49:54.798 align:start position:0%
money right let it
 
04:49:57.230 --> 04:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
lapse right well anyways what what are
 
04:49:58.590 --> 04:49:58.600 align:start position:0%
we talking about let's let's turn to
 
04:49:58.600 --> 04:49:59.350 align:start position:0%
we talking about let's let's turn to
page

04:49:59.350 --> 04:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
page
 
04:50:01.750 --> 04:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
43 of house bu
 
04:50:08.670 --> 04:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:13.190 --> 04:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:17.390 --> 04:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
um so I guess Melissa do or Jack do we
 
04:50:19.708 --> 04:50:19.718 align:start position:0%
know if any of this money has been spent
 
04:50:21.430 --> 04:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
so far or
 
04:50:24.510 --> 04:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
no on housing Champion designation and
 
04:50:25.910 --> 04:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
grant program
 
04:50:30.830 --> 04:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
fund so I believe when Bea came in um I
 
04:50:32.310 --> 04:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
don't think they they were finishing up
 
04:50:34.190 --> 04:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
the rules they were in the application
 
04:50:37.990 --> 04:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
process they had some of it earmarked
 
04:50:41.430 --> 04:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
for um for some of the grants to be paid
 
04:50:43.430 --> 04:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
out but they hadn't officially been paid
 
04:50:45.150 --> 04:50:45.160 align:start position:0%
out yet
 
04:50:48.830 --> 04:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
M so so this is extending it right
 
04:50:50.750 --> 04:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
another year with the assumption that
 
04:50:53.390 --> 04:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
they were going to use the full
 
04:50:56.190 --> 04:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
amount we're talking about on House Bill
 
04:50:59.990 --> 04:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:02.230 --> 04:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
43 line
 
04:51:07.150 --> 04:51:07.160 align:start position:0%
12 okay item number 72 section
 
04:51:11.670 --> 04:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
72 so this is we we appropriated $5
 
04:51:16.030 --> 04:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
million from a uh in the budget last
 
04:51:20.590 --> 04:51:20.600 align:start position:0%
year two years ago and um we we gave
 
04:51:23.788 --> 04:51:23.798 align:start position:0%
them until June 30th the end of the bium
 
04:51:27.070 --> 04:51:27.080 align:start position:0%
to spend the money afterwards it would
 
04:51:30.310 --> 04:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
lapse well here we are the money's not
 
04:51:33.230 --> 04:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
been spent so the governor wants to give
 
04:51:34.788 --> 04:51:34.798 align:start position:0%
them an extra
 
04:51:36.910 --> 04:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
year but I'm
 
04:51:40.150 --> 04:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
thinking I'm thinking no right I mean
 
04:51:41.270 --> 04:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:51:44.470 --> 04:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
um we need the money
 
04:51:48.628 --> 04:51:48.638 align:start position:0%
so this is big bucks but you know they
 
04:51:50.590 --> 04:51:50.600 align:start position:0%
or it lights a fire under them and they
 
04:51:53.548 --> 04:51:53.558 align:start position:0%
spend it by June 30th right so that's
 
04:51:57.430 --> 04:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
the the other possibility I I mean I'd
 
04:51:59.430 --> 04:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
be disinclined just because I think
 
04:52:01.350 --> 04:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
there's an awful lot of people counting
 
04:52:02.670 --> 04:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
on housing
 
04:52:09.150 --> 04:52:09.160 align:start position:0%
money um but inec system yeah well we
 
04:52:14.788 --> 04:52:14.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:16.390 --> 04:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's probably why they still
 
04:52:18.548 --> 04:52:18.558 align:start position:0%
have the money because they're still
 
04:52:20.868 --> 04:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
well they said they were making rules
 
04:52:23.590 --> 04:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
and they were doing this having rules
 
04:52:27.190 --> 04:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
so I don't know Mista have they spent
 
04:52:29.548 --> 04:52:29.558 align:start position:0%
any of the money just for administrative
 
04:52:32.470 --> 04:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
and all that I can I can check with them
 
04:52:33.910 --> 04:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
again I think when they came in they
 
04:52:37.990 --> 04:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
said they hadn't at that point um the
 
04:52:40.510 --> 04:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
the program was created in hb2 in 2020
 
04:52:44.430 --> 04:52:44.440 align:start position:0%
23 so the program was created the uh the
 
04:52:46.670 --> 04:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
expenditure I mean the appropriation was
 
04:52:48.150 --> 04:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
also put in there and then just because
 
04:52:50.190 --> 04:52:50.200 align:start position:0%
of that delay but I can that's a fair
 
04:52:51.548 --> 04:52:51.558 align:start position:0%
question and I can follow up with them
 
04:52:53.910 --> 04:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
just to make sure
 
04:52:56.150 --> 04:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
um we'd have to get the money anyways
 
04:52:57.510 --> 04:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
for the Surplus statement to see what's
 
04:52:58.990 --> 04:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
been what will lapse and what hasn't
 
04:53:00.430 --> 04:53:00.440 align:start position:0%
been lapsed because the only thing that
 
04:53:02.708 --> 04:53:02.718 align:start position:0%
will lapse is what uh hasn't already
 
04:53:04.788 --> 04:53:04.798 align:start position:0%
been expended has already been spent
 
04:53:06.990 --> 04:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
spended or incumbered yeah right and
 
04:53:08.430 --> 04:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
that can happen before the end of the
 
04:53:11.150 --> 04:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
year thank that's accurate so in any
 
04:53:14.788 --> 04:53:14.798 align:start position:0%
case I mean we put in a date before you
 
04:53:18.270 --> 04:53:18.280 align:start position:0%
know just cuz they haven't spent it
 
04:53:20.708 --> 04:53:20.718 align:start position:0%
that's on them I think all right but we
 
04:53:25.590 --> 04:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
can we can move on for now let's see um
 
04:53:27.788 --> 04:53:27.798 align:start position:0%
are there any easy ones
 
04:53:32.230 --> 04:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
here um page 25 how about the ohrv
 
04:53:34.708 --> 04:53:34.718 align:start position:0%
trails do we know anything about that is
 
04:53:37.270 --> 04:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
that the Connecticut River I think
 
04:53:38.948 --> 04:53:38.958 align:start position:0%
that's division
 
04:53:41.030 --> 04:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
two it's on my
 
04:53:41.040 --> 04:53:48.868 align:start position:0%
two it's on my
oh

04:53:48.868 --> 04:53:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:55.470 --> 04:53:55.480 align:start position:0%
really page 25 sections 23 and
 
04:53:57.670 --> 04:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
24 if they took over the trails they
 
04:54:00.270 --> 04:54:00.280 align:start position:0%
would be able to keep it over few more
 
04:54:02.590 --> 04:54:02.600 align:start position:0%
weeks which would bring more Revenue to
 
04:54:02.600 --> 04:54:06.110 align:start position:0%
weeks which would bring more Revenue to
the

04:54:06.110 --> 04:54:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:10.510 --> 04:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
area right so this is um
 
04:54:12.430 --> 04:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
moving the the closure date of the
 
04:54:14.628 --> 04:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
trails a little longer I have sworn we
 
04:54:18.510 --> 04:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
had a bill on this did yeah in the past
 
04:54:18.520 --> 04:54:21.270 align:start position:0%
had a bill on this did yeah in the past
right

04:54:21.270 --> 04:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:54:24.830 --> 04:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
County delegation saying have Sheriff
 
04:54:28.868 --> 04:54:28.878 align:start position:0%
take it over fish game cling a of It
 
04:54:43.350 --> 04:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:47.868 --> 04:54:47.878 align:start position:0%
so off the already fixed oh I see so
 
04:54:49.270 --> 04:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
maybe we can take this out because it's
 
04:54:51.868 --> 04:54:51.878 align:start position:0%
already in a bill do we know the bill I
 
04:54:55.830 --> 04:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
know she's she she's madly looking
 
04:55:07.590 --> 04:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:14.110 --> 04:55:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:16.750 --> 04:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's it's the same bill
 
04:55:19.510 --> 04:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what I thought it look it's
 
04:55:21.788 --> 04:55:21.798 align:start position:0%
the same
 
04:55:24.590 --> 04:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
yeah yes okay and the bill passed and
 
04:55:31.830 --> 04:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:31.840 --> 04:55:37.708 align:start position:0%
 
just

04:55:37.708 --> 04:55:37.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:43.350 --> 04:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:50.868 --> 04:55:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:55.868 --> 04:55:55.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:58.708 --> 04:55:58.718 align:start position:0%
then it did it was it like on the
 
04:56:01.030 --> 04:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
consent calendar or something or uh so
 
04:56:04.070 --> 04:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
it was ought to pass
 
04:56:07.870 --> 04:56:07.880 align:start position:0%
um 198 to 180
 
04:56:07.880 --> 04:56:11.868 align:start position:0%
um 198 to 180
[Music]

04:56:11.868 --> 04:56:11.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:11.878 --> 04:56:15.548 align:start position:0%
 
it's

04:56:15.548 --> 04:56:15.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:18.110 --> 04:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
controversial yes it it has that ring to
 
04:56:21.350 --> 04:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
it but it's already but it already pass
 
04:56:22.548 --> 04:56:22.558 align:start position:0%
but if you don't like it then we don't
 
04:56:24.270 --> 04:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
want it in house built too right that's
 
04:56:27.110 --> 04:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
what I was thinking I mean it's already
 
04:56:29.510 --> 04:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
passed so either way we might as well
 
04:56:34.470 --> 04:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
take it out I mean we might the guy from
 
04:56:36.030 --> 04:56:36.040 align:start position:0%
county and
 
04:56:39.110 --> 04:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
say take care of the same problem well
 
04:56:41.350 --> 04:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
you looked at you just looked at it it's
 
04:56:44.310 --> 04:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
the same language yes yeah okay all
 
04:56:46.590 --> 04:56:46.600 align:start position:0%
right so so let's take it out so who
 
04:56:48.270 --> 04:56:48.280 align:start position:0%
wants to make a motion to remove

okay page 64 is it right at the bottom
 
04:59:00.190 --> 04:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
oh I see section section
 
04:59:03.750 --> 04:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
153 Benjamin yes trust fund yeah so this
 
04:59:07.788 --> 04:59:07.798 align:start position:0%
is a fund that's being moved to um it's
 
04:59:10.190 --> 04:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
all it does is benefit UNH and the the
 
04:59:13.390 --> 04:59:13.400 align:start position:0%
university system and so what we're
 
04:59:16.270 --> 04:59:16.280 align:start position:0%
going to do here is is move the the
 
04:59:19.510 --> 04:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
funds to their endowment and let them
 
04:59:22.390 --> 04:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
handle it directly because otherwise
 
04:59:23.990 --> 04:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
it's just been building up and building
 
04:59:26.350 --> 04:59:26.360 align:start position:0%
up and
 
04:59:28.868 --> 04:59:28.878 align:start position:0%
um uh they're not getting as much money
 
04:59:32.110 --> 04:59:32.120 align:start position:0%
as they could uh if you know without the
 
04:59:35.470 --> 04:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
middleman aspect of it so yes
 
04:59:39.070 --> 04:59:39.080 align:start position:0%
representative R thank you so Mr chair a
 
04:59:40.708 --> 04:59:40.718 align:start position:0%
question I have is
 
04:59:42.990 --> 04:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's relative to the Benjamin
 
04:59:45.070 --> 04:59:45.080 align:start position:0%
Thompson trust fund are repealed but
 
04:59:47.230 --> 04:59:47.240 align:start position:0%
does that the other statues will that
 
04:59:49.310 --> 04:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
then direct it to be under the
 
04:59:51.750 --> 04:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
University Foundation no what what's
 
04:59:55.788 --> 04:59:55.798 align:start position:0%
happening is the because it's a it's a a
 
04:59:59.708 --> 04:59:59.718 align:start position:0%
trust um the AG has to go to to probate
 
05:00:03.628 --> 05:00:03.638 align:start position:0%
court and get the money moved and so
 
05:00:05.708 --> 05:00:05.718 align:start position:0%
that's part of this whole process all
 
05:00:07.628 --> 05:00:07.638 align:start position:0%
right so it's not going to that's that
 
05:00:10.150 --> 05:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
piece isn't covered under legislation
 
05:00:13.150 --> 05:00:13.160 align:start position:0%
then apparently not okay thank you yeah
 
05:00:16.030 --> 05:00:16.040 align:start position:0%
I make a motion to keep this one in yeah
 
05:00:19.190 --> 05:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
hp2 okay I'll second it okay I'll second
 
05:00:21.910 --> 05:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
it all right good so um motion by
 
05:00:23.990 --> 05:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative cambrell to keep section
 
05:00:26.430 --> 05:00:26.440 align:start position:0%

05:00:29.270 --> 05:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative eel all those all those
 
05:00:32.990 --> 05:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
in favor yeah okay good so we will keep
 
05:00:35.430 --> 05:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
that one I think let's let's look at the
 
05:00:37.708 --> 05:00:37.718 align:start position:0%
next one so budget and Appropriations
 
05:00:42.030 --> 05:00:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:45.708 --> 05:00:45.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:48.750 --> 05:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
classes death service shall not lapse
 
05:00:51.510 --> 05:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
that sounds like a good idea yeah I
 
05:00:54.310 --> 05:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
think she was just putting in law what
 
05:00:58.750 --> 05:00:58.760 align:start position:0%
should be what she does yeah okay all
 
05:01:01.830 --> 05:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
right I'll make I'll make the motion to
 
05:01:05.990 --> 05:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
retain or to keep in hb2 section
 
05:01:09.948 --> 05:01:09.958 align:start position:0%
154 okay um motion by representative eil
 
05:01:12.190 --> 05:01:12.200 align:start position:0%

seconded by representative rung all
 
05:01:18.390 --> 05:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
those in favor yeah unanimous good uh
 
05:01:21.628 --> 05:01:21.638 align:start position:0%
with represent a Ms missing so we
 
05:01:24.150 --> 05:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
keeping that
 
05:01:24.160 --> 05:01:25.708 align:start position:0%
keeping that
one

05:01:25.708 --> 05:01:25.718 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:01:29.230 --> 05:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
okay uh Revenue
 
05:01:32.628 --> 05:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
sharing oh no this one I want to look at
 
05:01:35.788 --> 05:01:35.798 align:start position:0%
actually yeah we put this in every year
 
05:01:38.628 --> 05:01:38.638 align:start position:0%
this 31a hasn't been paid out for
 
05:01:41.708 --> 05:01:41.718 align:start position:0%
decades mhm that's true I've tracked it
 
05:01:44.548 --> 05:01:44.558 align:start position:0%
but we always put it in here because
 
05:01:47.948 --> 05:01:47.958 align:start position:0%
what we ought to do is maybe just repeal
 
05:01:53.390 --> 05:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
that of suspending yeah repal RSA 31
 
05:01:55.670 --> 05:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I want to I'd actually
 
05:01:58.430 --> 05:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
like to spend a little time reading this
 
05:02:01.750 --> 05:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
because I have the I have in mind that
 
05:02:04.230 --> 05:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
this might be a better way to return
 
05:02:06.628 --> 05:02:06.638 align:start position:0%
rooms of meals money to towns than the
 
05:02:10.350 --> 05:02:10.360 align:start position:0%
one we do now so what we do now is is
 
05:02:15.670 --> 05:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
strictly based on population so um like
 
05:02:17.910 --> 05:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
the town of success which has two people
 
05:02:22.070 --> 05:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:24.868 --> 05:02:24.878 align:start position:0%
property2 and the mount carbury landfill
 
05:02:27.708 --> 05:02:27.718 align:start position:0%
yeah right what right the property is
 
05:02:30.990 --> 05:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
this landfill right and so in Success
 
05:02:32.990 --> 05:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in Success New Hampshire
 
05:02:35.548 --> 05:02:35.558 align:start position:0%
yeah but because they have that anyways
 
05:02:37.670 --> 05:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
the point is we we send them
 
05:02:41.948 --> 05:02:41.958 align:start position:0%
$200 from the rooms of meals tax when
 
05:02:43.708 --> 05:02:43.718 align:start position:0%
they got all the property in the world
 
05:02:46.070 --> 05:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
right so so this might be a better way
 
05:02:48.708 --> 05:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
of doing it I think and and since it's
 
05:02:51.910 --> 05:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
already exists do you know what this me
 
05:02:54.190 --> 05:02:54.200 align:start position:0%
I think it has something to do with
 
05:02:56.030 --> 05:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
property value per
 
05:02:59.628 --> 05:02:59.638 align:start position:0%
person okay as opposed to just number of
 
05:03:01.948 --> 05:03:01.958 align:start position:0%
people do you know but I I I haven't
 
05:03:05.110 --> 05:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
read it so let let's wait on this one
 
05:03:07.430 --> 05:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
she's I can't tell if she know if she
 
05:03:10.070 --> 05:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
knows the answer or not it's a
 
05:03:11.670 --> 05:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
complicated formula but representative
 
05:03:13.750 --> 05:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
Maguire is correct in in the premise
 
05:03:16.750 --> 05:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
that it is based on um Equalization of
 
05:03:18.628 --> 05:03:18.638 align:start position:0%
the property and how many people live in
 
05:03:21.510 --> 05:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
the town yeah so it and it's you know
 
05:03:24.030 --> 05:03:24.040 align:start position:0%
it's already there in law
 
05:03:24.040 --> 05:03:27.230 align:start position:0%
it's already there in law
so

05:03:27.230 --> 05:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:27.240 --> 05:03:30.070 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:03:30.070 --> 05:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:03:30.080 --> 05:03:32.070 align:start position:0%
yeah
everybody

05:03:32.070 --> 05:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
05:03:34.150 --> 05:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
people that's
 
05:03:37.590 --> 05:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
right yeah so let me let me um take a
 
05:03:40.470 --> 05:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
look okay so this is RSA
 
05:03:43.590 --> 05:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
we will wait on this one
 
05:03:48.070 --> 05:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
31a so um he's still not here Mr still
 
05:03:49.548 --> 05:03:49.558 align:start position:0%
here yes could I just I don't know where
 
05:03:51.470 --> 05:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
you are in your list but what is the
 
05:03:55.110 --> 05:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
effect of section 156 regarding it was
 
05:03:59.868 --> 05:03:59.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:02.708 --> 05:04:02.718 align:start position:0%
grants because we there there's a whole
 
05:04:02.718 --> 05:04:03.750 align:start position:0%
grants because we there there's a whole
bunch

05:04:03.750 --> 05:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
bunch
 
05:04:07.628 --> 05:04:07.638 align:start position:0%
of water related stuff
 
05:04:10.470 --> 05:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
here right but this particular one has
 
05:04:13.110 --> 05:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
to do with the it's I thought it had to
 
05:04:16.590 --> 05:04:16.600 align:start position:0%
do with the Buco Buck thing so I don't
 
05:04:18.910 --> 05:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
are they repealing are they getting rid
 
05:04:21.110 --> 05:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
of the money I I don't understand what
 
05:04:24.230 --> 05:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
the import of that is it's very short
 
05:04:27.230 --> 05:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
but are you talking doesn't carry a big
 
05:04:31.510 --> 05:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
stick 156 is it section 156 so 156 is
 
05:04:33.948 --> 05:04:33.958 align:start position:0%
what you termed I'm going to do quotes
 
05:04:37.708 --> 05:04:37.718 align:start position:0%
uh termed Buco bucks uh the Senate put
 
05:04:39.948 --> 05:04:39.958 align:start position:0%
that 15 million that's requested each
 
05:04:43.230 --> 05:04:43.240 align:start position:0%
year 15 million um for the BM the Senate
 
05:04:46.230 --> 05:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
put it in their budget last year um last
 
05:04:49.548 --> 05:04:49.558 align:start position:0%
budget so they pre-funded the program we
 
05:04:51.150 --> 05:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
typically we have never pre-funded the
 
05:04:52.670 --> 05:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
program the bill comes up which is why
 
05:04:54.590 --> 05:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
it's termed Buco buck as representative
 
05:04:57.110 --> 05:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
Buco typically sponsors the bill uh
 
05:04:59.270 --> 05:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
again the Senate last budget put the
 
05:05:02.910 --> 05:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
money in the governor um has chose to
 
05:05:05.150 --> 05:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
remove those dollars and repeal that
 
05:05:06.948 --> 05:05:06.958 align:start position:0%
statute I I thought it looked short and
 
05:05:10.470 --> 05:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
carried a big stick so that's basically
 
05:05:13.990 --> 05:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
putting how much money back into 15 uh
 
05:05:17.590 --> 05:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
15 million yeah do you remember
 
05:05:21.470 --> 05:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
when oh I I remember but I mean I I also
 
05:05:24.070 --> 05:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
remember when they were sitting here
 
05:05:26.030 --> 05:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
talking about this how important the
 
05:05:28.350 --> 05:05:28.360 align:start position:0%
money was to them well but yes but what
 
05:05:30.310 --> 05:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
I'm saying is when when Dees was here
 
05:05:32.070 --> 05:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
they gave us that little spreadsheet
 
05:05:34.350 --> 05:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
that said we had so much this year and
 
05:05:36.910 --> 05:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
so much next year and and and we're
 
05:05:39.070 --> 05:05:39.080 align:start position:0%
subtracting this and this is what's left
 
05:05:39.080 --> 05:05:40.670 align:start position:0%
subtracting this and this is what's left
over

05:05:40.670 --> 05:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
over
 
05:05:43.470 --> 05:05:43.480 align:start position:0%
that's this one yes so let's see what's
 
05:05:45.708 --> 05:05:45.718 align:start position:0%
left 15 million per year so 30 million
 
05:05:48.628 --> 05:05:48.638 align:start position:0%
over theum we'll go back to the looking
 
05:05:51.390 --> 05:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
because they pre-funded it so it's not
 
05:05:55.590 --> 05:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
got a bunch of anyway
 
05:05:58.948 --> 05:05:58.958 align:start position:0%
I this is we'll think about it it's a
 
05:05:58.958 --> 05:06:06.590 align:start position:0%
I this is we'll think about it it's a
big

05:06:06.590 --> 05:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:09.350 --> 05:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
deal oh yeah and you had to repl Y I
 
05:06:25.948 --> 05:06:25.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:28.750 --> 05:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
built all right well let's Melissa let's
 
05:06:31.910 --> 05:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
make a note to ask them about this on
 
05:06:35.590 --> 05:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
Friday and uh figure out how much uh
 
05:06:39.670 --> 05:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
money is in this line in this section
 
05:06:43.030 --> 05:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
it's 15 it's 15 million for the bium
 
05:06:44.948 --> 05:06:44.958 align:start position:0%
it's 15 million per year it's 30 million
 
05:06:46.430 --> 05:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
for the bium it's a straight
 
05:06:50.590 --> 05:06:50.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation that was in hb2 in 2023 so
 
05:06:52.510 --> 05:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
it's a straight General none of it has
 
05:06:55.230 --> 05:06:55.240 align:start position:0%
been correct right they don't get they
 
05:06:58.670 --> 05:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
don't get it until um July 1 2026 so
 
05:07:01.110 --> 05:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
they're basically defunding the state
 
05:07:03.510 --> 05:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
aid grant but
 
05:07:06.310 --> 05:07:06.320 align:start position:0%
we6 we've retained this similar bill as
 
05:07:08.948 --> 05:07:08.958 align:start position:0%
well in in the division but that's the
 
05:07:10.430 --> 05:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
but that's the the upshot of this
 
05:07:13.788 --> 05:07:13.798 align:start position:0%
provision yeah right that's it so it's
 
05:07:16.030 --> 05:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
30 m no wonder the governor had so much
 
05:07:19.270 --> 05:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
revenue so well this I think I I
 
05:07:21.548 --> 05:07:21.558 align:start position:0%
actually hadn't seen this before I think
 
05:07:23.590 --> 05:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
this is a new
 
05:07:26.470 --> 05:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
addition I don't know this was in this
 
05:07:28.590 --> 05:07:28.600 align:start position:0%
was also in the trailer bill I didn't
 
05:07:31.628 --> 05:07:31.638 align:start position:0%
see it before yeah so small said it's
 
05:07:34.350 --> 05:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
small and carries a big stick yes yeah
 
05:07:36.590 --> 05:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
so this would be for for new funding
 
05:07:38.350 --> 05:07:38.360 align:start position:0%
going forward they do have in their
 
05:07:40.948 --> 05:07:40.958 align:start position:0%
budget they've already budgeted for the
 
05:07:44.310 --> 05:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
the payments that they've already um
 
05:07:46.510 --> 05:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
committed to the municipality so this is
 
05:07:48.750 --> 05:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
above and beyond for new for new
 
05:07:51.110 --> 05:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
projects okay we'll have to talk to them
 
05:07:55.030 --> 05:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
about that yeah so is there should we go
 
05:07:57.948 --> 05:07:57.958 align:start position:0%
down this list or is it whatever want to
 
05:08:02.150 --> 05:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
do Mr chair yeah uh monitoring Wells I
 
05:08:03.230 --> 05:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
mean these are things I was going to
 
05:08:06.150 --> 05:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
wait to talk to thees about right
 
05:08:07.548 --> 05:08:07.558 align:start position:0%
because these are all their things right
 
05:08:09.470 --> 05:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
that's fine I I just didn't understand
 
05:08:10.868 --> 05:08:10.878 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure I understood the
 
05:08:12.910 --> 05:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
import of that I'm sorry if I went out
 
05:08:16.430 --> 05:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
of order yeah well that's okay um oh
 
05:08:19.030 --> 05:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
here's something for a dollar a
 
05:08:23.270 --> 05:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
dollar oh yeah well oh Mr chair yes
 
05:08:25.868 --> 05:08:25.878 align:start position:0%
represent um thank you in
 
05:08:28.590 --> 05:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
157 I read that as just saying they've
 
05:08:30.788 --> 05:08:30.798 align:start position:0%
gotten more precise in their measurement
 
05:08:33.910 --> 05:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
and to provide consistent International
 
05:08:37.190 --> 05:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
terminology on the metrics so rather
 
05:08:40.750 --> 05:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
than using de um decimal minutes going
 
05:08:43.350 --> 05:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
to decimal degrees before it was degrees
 
05:08:45.830 --> 05:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
and decimal minutes I don't think you I
 
05:08:48.788 --> 05:08:48.798 align:start position:0%
think internationally the accepted
 
05:08:51.628 --> 05:08:51.638 align:start position:0%
measurement for GPS coordinates is under
 
05:08:53.948 --> 05:08:53.958 align:start position:0%
decimal degrees and I'm excited they can
 
05:08:55.830 --> 05:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
bring it out to five decimal places
 
05:08:59.470 --> 05:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
that's pretty good all right I'm
 
05:09:00.868 --> 05:09:00.878 align:start position:0%
concerned that it shouldn't be that it
 
05:09:04.150 --> 05:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
should be six okay all right so
 
05:09:06.350 --> 05:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
representative rung moves to accept
 
05:09:06.360 --> 05:09:08.070 align:start position:0%
representative rung moves to accept
Section

05:09:08.070 --> 05:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
Section
 
05:09:11.150 --> 05:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
157 want want to second that I'll second
 
05:09:14.310 --> 05:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
it seconded by representative evil any
 
05:09:14.320 --> 05:09:15.948 align:start position:0%
it seconded by representative evil any
further

05:09:15.948 --> 05:09:15.958 align:start position:0%
further
 
05:09:21.910 --> 05:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
discussion no okay all in favor yes
 
05:09:25.948 --> 05:09:25.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:29.430 --> 05:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
unanimous okay unanimous very good so
 
05:09:32.270 --> 05:09:32.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep section 157
 
05:09:32.280 --> 05:09:33.330 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep section 157

[Music]

05:09:34.548 --> 05:09:34.558 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:09:38.270 --> 05:09:38.280 align:start position:0%
um okay I wanted to there was another
 
05:09:42.430 --> 05:09:42.440 align:start position:0%
one that looked it might be easy here
 
05:09:47.030 --> 05:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
162 16 how about I go backwards to um
 
05:09:49.510 --> 05:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
here's one we wanted to raise fees right
 
05:09:54.110 --> 05:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:57.270 --> 05:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
137 page I'm sorry page
 
05:10:00.670 --> 05:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
61 we didn't get the
 
05:10:02.948 --> 05:10:02.958 align:start position:0%
number what's that weren't we going to
 
05:10:05.628 --> 05:10:05.638 align:start position:0%
get input from them on that
 
05:10:11.030 --> 05:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:13.470 --> 05:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
I don't think I don't
 
05:10:13.480 --> 05:10:15.788 align:start position:0%
I don't think I don't
know

05:10:15.788 --> 05:10:15.798 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:10:21.830 --> 05:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
um so um so this is the the elevator
 
05:10:26.868 --> 05:10:26.878 align:start position:0%
fee and um what this says they're
 
05:10:28.670 --> 05:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
changing it so they'll actually collect
 
05:10:28.680 --> 05:10:29.510 align:start position:0%
changing it so they'll actually collect
the

05:10:29.510 --> 05:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:10:32.628 --> 05:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
fee because you know how every elevator
 
05:10:35.910 --> 05:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
has a certificate in it right so so what
 
05:10:37.708 --> 05:10:37.718 align:start position:0%
this says is current the current
 
05:10:40.830 --> 05:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
practice is uh they inspect the elevator
 
05:10:43.750 --> 05:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
they give you the certificate you owe
 
05:10:46.430 --> 05:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
$50 and if you don't pay your
 
05:10:49.030 --> 05:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
certificate is now invalid well guess
 
05:10:51.590 --> 05:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
what you already got
 
05:10:55.948 --> 05:10:55.958 align:start position:0%
it right so now what this says is
 
05:10:57.470 --> 05:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
they'll inspect the elevator they'll
 
05:10:59.670 --> 05:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
give you an invoice for $50 you pay the
 
05:11:01.830 --> 05:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
$50 and then they'll send you the
 
05:11:04.230 --> 05:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
certificate right which makes
 
05:11:07.110 --> 05:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
sense so the question is the only
 
05:11:09.548 --> 05:11:09.558 align:start position:0%
question here is do we want to changed
 
05:11:12.948 --> 05:11:12.958 align:start position:0%
the $50 to $100 or something some other
 
05:11:16.670 --> 05:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
number right that was so the one we
 
05:11:20.830 --> 05:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
heard needed yes yeah they had broken
 
05:11:23.628 --> 05:11:23.638 align:start position:0%
broken back I mean I I thought they were
 
05:11:25.510 --> 05:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
going to give us a recommendation on the
 
05:11:27.830 --> 05:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
fee change all right so you want to wait
 
05:11:30.150 --> 05:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
okay we have we asked the Department of
 
05:11:33.350 --> 05:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
Labor for possibilities of more fees in
 
05:11:37.948 --> 05:11:37.958 align:start position:0%
this I thought we did we should I think
 
05:11:39.948 --> 05:11:39.958 align:start position:0%
we did but I'll I'll follow up with them
 
05:11:42.070 --> 05:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
follow up and see CU tell them we're
 
05:11:44.270 --> 05:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
thinking of making it $100 the other
 
05:11:46.510 --> 05:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
thing is I would rewrite this so that
 
05:11:49.030 --> 05:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
the the the fee is only in the sentence
 
05:11:49.040 --> 05:11:49.910 align:start position:0%
the the the fee is only in the sentence
one

05:11:49.910 --> 05:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:11:53.270 --> 05:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
time right so not that it's the same fee
 
05:11:55.350 --> 05:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
repeated three times because that that
 
05:11:58.310 --> 05:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense okay now how often
 
05:12:00.868 --> 05:12:00.878 align:start position:0%
they how often do they inspect I think
 
05:12:03.880 --> 05:12:03.890 align:start position:0%
it's annual it says here right
 
05:12:03.890 --> 05:12:06.548 align:start position:0%
it's annual it says here right
[Music]

05:12:06.548 --> 05:12:06.558 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:12:10.948 --> 05:12:10.958 align:start position:0%
um is it um that's when they lug the 50
 
05:12:13.470 --> 05:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
pound weights yeah it's it's I believe
 
05:12:15.990 --> 05:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
it's annual
 
05:12:19.350 --> 05:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
um but uh I think I read that elsewhere
 
05:12:20.670 --> 05:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
in the
 
05:12:25.628 --> 05:12:25.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:30.948 --> 05:12:30.958 align:start position:0%
years you want to raise the fee oh I see
 
05:12:34.350 --> 05:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
be right and so yeah I mean if it it's
 
05:12:36.750 --> 05:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
if it's an annual inspection and and you
 
05:12:39.750 --> 05:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
change it to buy to buy anual then you
 
05:12:43.150 --> 05:12:43.160 align:start position:0%
need half as many inspectors right so
 
05:12:46.310 --> 05:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
well we'll see and charge twice as much
 
05:12:47.948 --> 05:12:47.958 align:start position:0%
it's it's pretty bad though if an
 
05:12:50.510 --> 05:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
elevator goes crashing to the ground so
 
05:12:52.390 --> 05:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
we'll have to see what they think about
 
05:12:54.548 --> 05:12:54.558 align:start position:0%
the inspection
 
05:12:58.110 --> 05:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
rate cost of the truck drag
 
05:13:01.310 --> 05:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
2000 and and and physical therapy for
 
05:13:03.590 --> 05:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
people's backs that have lug the we I
 
05:13:06.270 --> 05:13:06.280 align:start position:0%
mean so this is the right answer right
 
05:13:08.390 --> 05:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
we should figure out how much are the
 
05:13:10.910 --> 05:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
inspectors costing us how much are they
 
05:13:14.430 --> 05:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
raising in fees and match the two
 
05:13:17.190 --> 05:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
right to pay for the truck and all that
 
05:13:19.470 --> 05:13:19.480 align:start position:0%
stuff okay representative Sweeney had
 
05:13:21.910 --> 05:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
suggested that my notes here that before
 
05:13:23.910 --> 05:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
we just arbitrarily set fees we really
 
05:13:27.070 --> 05:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
ought to know how much it cost yeah yeah
 
05:13:28.910 --> 05:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
okay very good all right now we're going
 
05:13:30.910 --> 05:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
to go back to bills since I I see
 
05:13:32.670 --> 05:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn
 
05:13:32.680 --> 05:13:34.430 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn
here

05:13:34.430 --> 05:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:13:39.590 --> 05:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
so let's go to House Bill 66
 
05:13:42.830 --> 05:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
does that make sense the first
 
05:13:45.110 --> 05:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
one uh representative Lynn would you
 
05:13:48.708 --> 05:13:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:51.548 --> 05:13:51.558 align:start position:0%
66 and if you need a copy
 
05:14:21.788 --> 05:14:21.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:26.390 --> 05:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:29.030 --> 05:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
um I guess
 
05:14:32.270 --> 05:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry I put the I guess I'm I'm
 
05:14:34.070 --> 05:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that you
 
05:14:36.190 --> 05:14:36.200 align:start position:0%
may have I
 
05:14:40.830 --> 05:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
think my my sense is that
 
05:14:45.470 --> 05:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
the the majority of the things that
 
05:14:48.788 --> 05:14:48.798 align:start position:0%
the um that this bill does you know the
 
05:14:52.030 --> 05:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
I mean the main reasons why I I I think
 
05:14:55.190 --> 05:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
it was enacted or I mean it was it was
 
05:14:58.190 --> 05:14:58.200 align:start position:0%
proposed and then passed you know the
 
05:15:02.310 --> 05:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
house on the policy side was was just to
 
05:15:08.350 --> 05:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
um to to uh more closely comply with the
 
05:15:08.360 --> 05:15:09.868 align:start position:0%
um to to uh more closely comply with the
uh

05:15:09.868 --> 05:15:09.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:15:11.948 --> 05:15:11.958 align:start position:0%
with with the idea of of O government
 
05:15:13.948 --> 05:15:13.958 align:start position:0%
being open and to so for example it
 
05:15:16.110 --> 05:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
changes citizen to person that's one
 
05:15:18.350 --> 05:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
that's probably one of the big uh one of
 
05:15:21.830 --> 05:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
the big uh uh things that this bill
 
05:15:24.548 --> 05:15:24.558 align:start position:0%
accomplishes um it has a
 
05:15:27.230 --> 05:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
provision um that
 
05:15:27.240 --> 05:15:29.830 align:start position:0%
provision um that
allows

05:15:29.830 --> 05:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
allows
 
05:15:33.150 --> 05:15:33.160 align:start position:0%
um uh with regard to
 
05:15:36.070 --> 05:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
um with regard to somebody who has a
 
05:15:39.310 --> 05:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
connection with New Hampshire uh either
 
05:15:41.350 --> 05:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
as a taxpayer or owns property or
 
05:15:45.310 --> 05:15:45.320 align:start position:0%
whatever um that they're allowed to get
 
05:15:48.430 --> 05:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
um uh information under the right to no
 
05:15:50.390 --> 05:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
law they like they're allowed to request
 
05:15:52.590 --> 05:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
it electronically and to and to have it
 
05:15:54.310 --> 05:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
provided electronically and they can
 
05:15:56.830 --> 05:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
basically request the format that it's
 
05:15:59.150 --> 05:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
provided in and as long as the town you
 
05:16:00.430 --> 05:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
know as long as it's reasonable for the
 
05:16:04.470 --> 05:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
town to provide that it won't cost uh uh
 
05:16:06.150 --> 05:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
it won't interfere with their
 
05:16:08.230 --> 05:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
recordkeeping system or cause some
 
05:16:10.548 --> 05:16:10.558 align:start position:0%
security problem s for their system they
 
05:16:12.150 --> 05:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
have to they have to provide it in that
 
05:16:14.230 --> 05:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
format and then if it's somebody that
 
05:16:17.190 --> 05:16:17.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a New Hampshire connection
 
05:16:20.590 --> 05:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
or is not a member of the media then the
 
05:16:23.310 --> 05:16:23.320 align:start position:0%
law sort of Remains the Same as it was
 
05:16:25.830 --> 05:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
you can come to the town you can come to
 
05:16:28.470 --> 05:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
the town and ask for the in I mean you
 
05:16:30.310 --> 05:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
can ask for the information and the T if
 
05:16:31.910 --> 05:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
you come to the town's officers and
 
05:16:35.670 --> 05:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
candidly as I think I I I know I we
 
05:16:36.948 --> 05:16:36.958 align:start position:0%
discussed this during the hearing that
 
05:16:39.868 --> 05:16:39.878 align:start position:0%
was that was sort of a compromis because
 
05:16:42.190 --> 05:16:42.200 align:start position:0%
there were I think legitimate concerns
 
05:16:45.990 --> 05:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
by municipalities that if we didn't draw
 
05:16:49.070 --> 05:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
that distinction you know theoretically
 
05:16:52.470 --> 05:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh somebody Jammy somebody from Beijing
 
05:16:55.430 --> 05:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
Jammy surfing uh you know and bored
 
05:16:57.030 --> 05:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
about what to do at night could say GE I
 
05:16:58.310 --> 05:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
wonder if I could get all the email
 
05:17:00.910 --> 05:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
Communications from uh the town of
 
05:17:03.750 --> 05:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
Brentwood and uh and they'd have to
 
05:17:05.190 --> 05:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
provide they'd have to provide it
 
05:17:07.548 --> 05:17:07.558 align:start position:0%
whereas if you say to that person sure
 
05:17:09.670 --> 05:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
come on you know come on in our offices
 
05:17:12.750 --> 05:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
are open from whatever to whatever uh
 
05:17:14.868 --> 05:17:14.878 align:start position:0%
and I'll I'll I'll be happy to give the
 
05:17:16.830 --> 05:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
flight information from getting from
 
05:17:20.310 --> 05:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
Beijing to uh to Brentwood that may tend
 
05:17:24.670 --> 05:17:24.680 align:start position:0%
to discourage people I see okay um so
 
05:17:25.948 --> 05:17:25.958 align:start position:0%
that's you're talking about stuff on
 
05:17:28.070 --> 05:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
page two where it says shall not be
 
05:17:30.990 --> 05:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
required to Pro provide electronically
 
05:17:35.510 --> 05:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:38.430 --> 05:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
yeah it looks like there's some concern
 
05:17:42.590 --> 05:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:47.548 --> 05:17:47.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:52.750 --> 05:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
note yeah hang on just expanding the
 
05:17:55.190 --> 05:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
right so so did you get a sense that
 
05:17:58.110 --> 05:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
that people are who are currently not
 
05:17:59.990 --> 05:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
served are sort of beating down the door
 
05:18:03.030 --> 05:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
here or is this kind of a Dem Minimus I
 
05:18:07.510 --> 05:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
sort of thing my you know the what we
 
05:18:10.470 --> 05:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
heard during the during the during the
 
05:18:12.948 --> 05:18:12.958 align:start position:0%
he the hearings before the Judiciary
 
05:18:16.708 --> 05:18:16.718 align:start position:0%
Committee I think was
 
05:18:20.948 --> 05:18:20.958 align:start position:0%
largely um you know
 
05:18:23.708 --> 05:18:23.718 align:start position:0%
uh concerns about like what could have
 
05:18:25.750 --> 05:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
was this somehow going to be too broad
 
05:18:29.110 --> 05:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
what could happen that kind of thing
 
05:18:34.070 --> 05:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
um I I I know I remember um someone from
 
05:18:36.470 --> 05:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
the school administrators uh Association
 
05:18:38.910 --> 05:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
saying that you know they they could
 
05:18:41.470 --> 05:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
recall a couple of instances where for
 
05:18:44.070 --> 05:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
example some company in California
 
05:18:47.548 --> 05:18:47.558 align:start position:0%
wanted to get some records uh and I
 
05:18:48.990 --> 05:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
don't even remember frankly off hand
 
05:18:50.270 --> 05:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
what the records were but some records
 
05:18:52.670 --> 05:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
from a school district that would be
 
05:18:54.110 --> 05:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
that that would give them information
 
05:18:55.510 --> 05:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
that they could use for marketing
 
05:18:57.310 --> 05:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
purposes I don't I don't remember
 
05:18:59.590 --> 05:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
exactly what it was but it was some
 
05:19:01.628 --> 05:19:01.638 align:start position:0%
information and the you know the guy
 
05:19:04.868 --> 05:19:04.878 align:start position:0%
from the uh uh the representative from
 
05:19:07.110 --> 05:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
the school uh School Board Association
 
05:19:09.110 --> 05:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
said you know typically what a school
 
05:19:10.910 --> 05:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
district would would would do in that
 
05:19:12.948 --> 05:19:12.958 align:start position:0%
situation is say you know those records
 
05:19:14.788 --> 05:19:14.798 align:start position:0%
are available just come to our offices
 
05:19:16.788 --> 05:19:16.798 align:start position:0%
and you can get it and his response was
 
05:19:18.868 --> 05:19:18.878 align:start position:0%
most of the time the people who have
 
05:19:20.230 --> 05:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
made that request don't want it that
 
05:19:22.350 --> 05:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
badly that they're willing to do that um
 
05:19:24.470 --> 05:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
and so it's not you know it's not a big
 
05:19:26.548 --> 05:19:26.558 align:start position:0%
issue I just I should just say on that
 
05:19:29.628 --> 05:19:29.638 align:start position:0%
point an earlier version of this bill
 
05:19:31.430 --> 05:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
would have allow would not have drawn
 
05:19:33.590 --> 05:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
the distinction between the you know do
 
05:19:34.868 --> 05:19:34.878 align:start position:0%
you have a New Hampshire connection or
 
05:19:36.670 --> 05:19:36.680 align:start position:0%
not it would it would have allowed
 
05:19:38.708 --> 05:19:38.718 align:start position:0%
somebody in California or China as I
 
05:19:40.750 --> 05:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
said to just ask for the records and
 
05:19:43.030 --> 05:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
have have them have to be provided
 
05:19:45.868 --> 05:19:45.878 align:start position:0%
electronically gotcha Melissa wanted to
 
05:19:47.708 --> 05:19:47.718 align:start position:0%
say something or so there was a revised
 
05:19:50.510 --> 05:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that you should have for 228
 
05:19:53.948 --> 05:19:53.958 align:start position:0%
since the introduced Bill expanded the
 
05:19:56.948 --> 05:19:56.958 align:start position:0%
scope the judicial branch anticipated
 
05:19:58.910 --> 05:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
there could be more cases but since the
 
05:20:00.708 --> 05:20:00.718 align:start position:0%
amended bill just keeps it within New
 
05:20:03.990 --> 05:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that changes okay so it it
 
05:20:08.788 --> 05:20:08.798 align:start position:0%
made it smaller yeah right okay
 
05:20:11.070 --> 05:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I see him okay he might like to say
 
05:20:13.310 --> 05:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
something in a minute okay now the other
 
05:20:15.510 --> 05:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
the only change I like I wanted to make
 
05:20:20.670 --> 05:20:20.680 align:start position:0%
to this bill is on page two line
 
05:20:24.708 --> 05:20:24.718 align:start position:0%
17 so there's a sentence which is now
 
05:20:28.868 --> 05:20:28.878 align:start position:0%
says um citizen initi initiated appeal
 
05:20:30.750 --> 05:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
shall have no filing fee or sear charge
 
05:20:33.430 --> 05:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
you're changing that to all appeals have
 
05:20:35.548 --> 05:20:35.558 align:start position:0%
no filing fear or sir charge what if we
 
05:20:38.830 --> 05:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
take that out because we're asking uh
 
05:20:43.868 --> 05:20:43.878 align:start position:0%
the courts to um to increase fees and
 
05:20:46.470 --> 05:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
and fines and and sort of generate more
 
05:20:49.510 --> 05:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
money um and so this this thing about
 
05:20:53.830 --> 05:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
being able to appeal with no appeal the
 
05:20:56.708 --> 05:20:56.718 align:start position:0%
ombudsman's ruling with no
 
05:21:00.390 --> 05:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
cost um doesn't doesn't make sense to me
 
05:21:05.150 --> 05:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:11.190 --> 05:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:14.270 --> 05:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
um so in words you go back to you you
 
05:21:16.910 --> 05:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
want to go back to Citizen initiated is
 
05:21:18.270 --> 05:21:18.280 align:start position:0%
that there or you just want to take that
 
05:21:20.470 --> 05:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
out make it make the citizen and
 
05:21:22.190 --> 05:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
everybody else have to pay have to pay
 
05:21:23.510 --> 05:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
the filing fee just like anybody who
 
05:21:27.430 --> 05:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
wants to go to the superior right um so
 
05:21:29.628 --> 05:21:29.638 align:start position:0%
here's what I here's here would be my
 
05:21:31.310 --> 05:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
response to that first of all as I think
 
05:21:33.310 --> 05:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
I as I mentioned to you Mr chair when in
 
05:21:36.230 --> 05:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
our conversation earlier this
 
05:21:40.548 --> 05:21:40.558 align:start position:0%
morning I I I completely understand that
 
05:21:43.190 --> 05:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
the budget is we have a very difficult
 
05:21:44.910 --> 05:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
situation with the budget and and
 
05:21:47.628 --> 05:21:47.638 align:start position:0%
frankly I am in complete agreement with
 
05:21:49.150 --> 05:21:49.160 align:start position:0%
with you and I hope the committee that
 
05:21:51.670 --> 05:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
that's got to be the first priority is
 
05:21:54.910 --> 05:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
you know having a a fiscally responsible
 
05:21:56.868 --> 05:21:56.878 align:start position:0%
budget and if that means Cuts then that
 
05:21:58.670 --> 05:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
means cuts and if that means pain then
 
05:22:00.548 --> 05:22:00.558 align:start position:0%
that means pain I completely agree with
 
05:22:04.628 --> 05:22:04.638 align:start position:0%
that um so I I you know I um from that
 
05:22:07.868 --> 05:22:07.878 align:start position:0%
perspective I if if the if the committee
 
05:22:09.910 --> 05:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
feels that that's what we need what
 
05:22:12.670 --> 05:22:12.680 align:start position:0%
needs to be done um that's fine I can I
 
05:22:14.628 --> 05:22:14.638 align:start position:0%
certainly can live with that what i' say
 
05:22:17.750 --> 05:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
is the idea I think the idea of this was
 
05:22:19.830 --> 05:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
as you may recall last year and then
 
05:22:21.708 --> 05:22:21.718 align:start position:0%
really again this year there was this
 
05:22:24.390 --> 05:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
huge fight and it was a bipartisan fight
 
05:22:25.948 --> 05:22:25.958 align:start position:0%
there we had you know Republicans and
 
05:22:29.310 --> 05:22:29.320 align:start position:0%
Democrats on both sides of it how much
 
05:22:31.510 --> 05:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
should municipalities or you know other
 
05:22:34.270 --> 05:22:34.280 align:start position:0%
people that get other bodies that get
 
05:22:36.070 --> 05:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
records request should they be able to
 
05:22:37.830 --> 05:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
charge for it how much should they be
 
05:22:41.230 --> 05:22:41.240 align:start position:0%
able to charge for it um you know that
 
05:22:45.070 --> 05:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
whole thing and as part of the sort of
 
05:22:48.350 --> 05:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
there was a compromise worked out um
 
05:22:52.110 --> 05:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
that you know that limited the the the
 
05:22:54.590 --> 05:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
situations in which municipalities could
 
05:22:57.750 --> 05:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
charge um and there was some language
 
05:23:00.190 --> 05:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
ated about being able to get an estimate
 
05:23:04.230 --> 05:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
and have the the Ombudsman uh review
 
05:23:07.510 --> 05:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
that and then appeal and I think the
 
05:23:09.910 --> 05:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
whole this
 
05:23:12.750 --> 05:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
this language that provides no filing
 
05:23:14.948 --> 05:23:14.958 align:start position:0%
fee or or search charge for the appeal
 
05:23:18.708 --> 05:23:18.718 align:start position:0%
was part of the sort of compromise that
 
05:23:22.350 --> 05:23:22.360 align:start position:0%
we would make it easier for people to be
 
05:23:26.270 --> 05:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
able to get review of the decisions I on
 
05:23:30.030 --> 05:23:30.040 align:start position:0%
you know I think it's do I think that's
 
05:23:32.470 --> 05:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
a good idea as a you know in the in the
 
05:23:35.430 --> 05:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
abstract sure is it worth it if you if
 
05:23:37.230 --> 05:23:37.240 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost money that the this
 
05:23:38.788 --> 05:23:38.798 align:start position:0%
committee thinks you shouldn't have no
 
05:23:40.070 --> 05:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
you should you should do what you think
 
05:23:42.230 --> 05:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
is right representative
 
05:23:45.830 --> 05:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
Griffin yeah it it seems to me if if we
 
05:23:48.430 --> 05:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
uh put a fee in there people are going
 
05:23:51.868 --> 05:23:51.878 align:start position:0%
to say well if I lose to the Omnibus
 
05:23:53.390 --> 05:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
then I'm going to have to pay a fee to
 
05:23:54.750 --> 05:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
go to the court and then I'm going to
 
05:23:57.788 --> 05:23:57.798 align:start position:0%
have to pay a fee at the court and uh it
 
05:24:00.708 --> 05:24:00.718 align:start position:0%
seems to me the you're creating a
 
05:24:03.628 --> 05:24:03.638 align:start position:0%
motivation not to go the easy route not
 
05:24:06.390 --> 05:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
to go to the Omni buzzman but to go
 
05:24:09.910 --> 05:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
directly to court
 
05:24:11.230 --> 05:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
no I mean there there's something to
 
05:24:12.708 --> 05:24:12.718 align:start position:0%
that I think you I think that's a that's
 
05:24:14.670 --> 05:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
a valid that's a valid point I agree
 
05:24:18.190 --> 05:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
with that all right represent Ms then
 
05:24:20.030 --> 05:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank thanks for
 
05:24:22.788 --> 05:24:22.798 align:start position:0%
coming in the the other change that you
 
05:24:26.868 --> 05:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
that's made in this bill is on page one
 
05:24:29.590 --> 05:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh line 17 where we include preliminary
 
05:24:35.070 --> 05:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
drafts right um in um you know in in the
 
05:24:36.628 --> 05:24:36.638 align:start position:0%
the list of things that they have a
 
05:24:38.670 --> 05:24:38.680 align:start position:0%
right to request what's the back ground
 
05:24:41.230 --> 05:24:41.240 align:start position:0%
in that have there been issues and you
 
05:24:44.590 --> 05:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
know I I you my first reaction is oh my
 
05:24:47.070 --> 05:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
God that's going to create the an
 
05:24:48.990 --> 05:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
enormous recordkeeping challenge no you
 
05:24:52.628 --> 05:24:52.638 align:start position:0%
know what actually the that although
 
05:24:54.910 --> 05:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
it's new putting the language in there
 
05:24:58.110 --> 05:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
is new it's not that's not a change of
 
05:25:01.030 --> 05:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
existing law existing law in another
 
05:25:02.628 --> 05:25:02.638 align:start position:0%
section I it's another section of the
 
05:25:05.750 --> 05:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
rights to no law covers preliminary
 
05:25:07.830 --> 05:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
drafts that are circulated to a major to
 
05:25:10.150 --> 05:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
a you know a majority or a quorum of a
 
05:25:13.190 --> 05:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
of a body are already under existing law
 
05:25:16.750 --> 05:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
subject to being uh subject to the right
 
05:25:18.390 --> 05:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
of no law so you might say well okay if
 
05:25:20.628 --> 05:25:20.638 align:start position:0%
that's true why'd you put it in here
 
05:25:22.548 --> 05:25:22.558 align:start position:0%
that was that was representative
 
05:25:25.310 --> 05:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
Edward's recommendation because he
 
05:25:28.270 --> 05:25:28.280 align:start position:0%
thought that it by by sort of repeating
 
05:25:31.948 --> 05:25:31.958 align:start position:0%
it right here um it would emphasize that
 
05:25:35.708 --> 05:25:35.718 align:start position:0%
point and make it uh you know M put it
 
05:25:38.670 --> 05:25:38.680 align:start position:0%
in a in a place where it was even more
 
05:25:40.310 --> 05:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
obvious than where it is in because I it
 
05:25:43.470 --> 05:25:43.480 align:start position:0%
is it is wherever it is in the other
 
05:25:45.548 --> 05:25:45.558 align:start position:0%
section right now it's not quite as
 
05:25:48.750 --> 05:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
obvious so um he thought it was
 
05:25:52.548 --> 05:25:52.558 align:start position:0%
important I said Hey listen may it it it
 
05:25:54.590 --> 05:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
I I see your point and that's what we
 
05:25:57.310 --> 05:25:57.320 align:start position:0%
did I you know the analogy he drew is
 
05:26:01.110 --> 05:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
you may you may recall when we passed
 
05:26:05.150 --> 05:26:05.160 align:start position:0%
the uh uh the fetal Life protection act
 
05:26:07.470 --> 05:26:07.480 align:start position:0%
the original version didn't have a
 
05:26:11.430 --> 05:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
certain certain language about uh in one
 
05:26:13.910 --> 05:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
section uh but it had it in another and
 
05:26:15.830 --> 05:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
we and there was a big fight about that
 
05:26:18.110 --> 05:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
we moved it so it's in both sections and
 
05:26:20.110 --> 05:26:20.120 align:start position:0%
that seemed to address that issue so I
 
05:26:22.350 --> 05:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
think that's what he was thinking about
 
05:26:25.750 --> 05:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
gotta uh represent rung thank you Mr
 
05:26:29.070 --> 05:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah I'm tagging on that line
 
05:26:32.270 --> 05:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
17 on page one preliminary drafts
 
05:26:34.270 --> 05:26:34.280 align:start position:0%
circulated to a quorum or a majority of
 
05:26:36.750 --> 05:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
the public party I mean I I I hear what
 
05:26:38.230 --> 05:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
you're saying that it's already in stat
 
05:26:40.868 --> 05:26:40.878 align:start position:0%
statute someplace else but and I know
 
05:26:42.590 --> 05:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
we're really just dealing with fiscal
 
05:26:45.190 --> 05:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
impacts but first of all preliminary
 
05:26:47.310 --> 05:26:47.320 align:start position:0%
drafts is that defined somewhere it
 
05:26:49.070 --> 05:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
almost seems redundant like wouldn't a
 
05:26:50.548 --> 05:26:50.558 align:start position:0%
draft be
 
05:26:54.310 --> 05:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
preliminary um and a drafts of what like
 
05:26:57.470 --> 05:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
drafts of anything schedules well
 
05:26:59.110 --> 05:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
reports schedules something like that I
 
05:27:01.230 --> 05:27:01.240 align:start position:0%
mean I think you know my understanding
 
05:27:03.190 --> 05:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
is I I I think the people that are
 
05:27:05.270 --> 05:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
heavily involved in you know in you know
 
05:27:06.548 --> 05:27:06.558 align:start position:0%
municipalities and stuff I mean they
 
05:27:09.510 --> 05:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
sort of know if you don't want if you
 
05:27:10.910 --> 05:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
don't want something to be subject to
 
05:27:12.390 --> 05:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
disclosure under the rights of no law
 
05:27:15.270 --> 05:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
don't circulate it to a quorum of the
 
05:27:18.310 --> 05:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
committee you know have a have a have a
 
05:27:20.750 --> 05:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
discussion uh you know among less than a
 
05:27:22.470 --> 05:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
quorum but once you circulate it to the
 
05:27:25.628 --> 05:27:25.638 align:start position:0%
Quorum it's really it's now covered by
 
05:27:27.548 --> 05:27:27.558 align:start position:0%
the right to
 
05:27:29.788 --> 05:27:29.798 align:start position:0%
NOA okay so it would really be any
 
05:27:31.510 --> 05:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
document circulated oh yeah no I think
 
05:27:33.750 --> 05:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
it could be right I could if a documents
 
05:27:35.708 --> 05:27:35.718 align:start position:0%
get circulated I mean you know unless
 
05:27:37.750 --> 05:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
it's confidential under some other
 
05:27:40.310 --> 05:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
provision of the law um if it's if it
 
05:27:42.510 --> 05:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
gets circulated it's subject to
 
05:27:45.628 --> 05:27:45.638 align:start position:0%
disclosure okay other questions
 
05:27:47.868 --> 05:27:47.878 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeny thank you and I I
 
05:27:49.150 --> 05:27:49.160 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't want to really weit
 
05:27:52.830 --> 05:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
into policy here but just based off of
 
05:27:54.948 --> 05:27:54.958 align:start position:0%
what we were just discussing I know in
 
05:27:56.788 --> 05:27:56.798 align:start position:0%
the legislature we have caucus
 
05:28:00.430 --> 05:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
protections for 91a so even if you had a
 
05:28:02.830 --> 05:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
majority of the body is in one caucus
 
05:28:05.390 --> 05:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
that communication is protected right
 
05:28:07.628 --> 05:28:07.638 align:start position:0%
there there's no such thing locally not
 
05:28:09.310 --> 05:28:09.320 align:start position:0%
at the no because because mostly you
 
05:28:11.430 --> 05:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
know there's not it's there's not in
 
05:28:12.830 --> 05:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
most place they're not elected as
 
05:28:14.830 --> 05:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
Republicans Or democrats and so yeah
 
05:28:17.190 --> 05:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's right that's right all
 
05:28:19.390 --> 05:28:19.400 align:start position:0%
right all right so um I guess you're G
 
05:28:24.510 --> 05:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
to wait for 111 in a moment one house

no

05:29:02.590 --> 05:29:02.600 align:start position:0%

sorry thanks please introduce yourself
 
05:29:07.150 --> 05:29:07.160 align:start position:0%
well first thanks for having me uh
 
05:29:08.948 --> 05:29:08.958 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant Jared y Manchester Police
 
05:29:10.548 --> 05:29:10.558 align:start position:0%
Department I'm in charge of the uh legal
 
05:29:12.390 --> 05:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
and Professional Standards division I'm
 
05:29:14.070 --> 05:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
here uh to speak on behalf of my agency
 
05:29:16.270 --> 05:29:16.280 align:start position:0%
and the chiefs of police uh first and
 
05:29:17.948 --> 05:29:17.958 align:start position:0%
foremost without without a doubt we
 
05:29:18.670 --> 05:29:18.680 align:start position:0%
understand the importance of
 
05:29:20.350 --> 05:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
transparency in law enforcement right
 
05:29:22.150 --> 05:29:22.160 align:start position:0%
and building the trust of the public and
 
05:29:25.628 --> 05:29:25.638 align:start position:0%
working hand inand with them um but the
 
05:29:28.548 --> 05:29:28.558 align:start position:0%
fiscal uh the financial uh issues that
 
05:29:30.390 --> 05:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
come up just simply with the to start
 
05:29:32.310 --> 05:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
with with 91a and right to know alone is
 
05:29:34.990 --> 05:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
crippling to municipalities specifically
 
05:29:37.190 --> 05:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agencies because I would
 
05:29:38.470 --> 05:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
probably guess that we probably get more
 
05:29:40.628 --> 05:29:40.638 align:start position:0%
91a requests than most other agencies
 
05:29:42.510 --> 05:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
because we do things that are often
 
05:29:44.230 --> 05:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
interesting right we're involved in
 
05:29:45.590 --> 05:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
critical incidents that people want to
 
05:29:48.990 --> 05:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
know about uh so you know just to give
 
05:29:51.590 --> 05:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
you some context last year alone in 2024
 
05:29:53.830 --> 05:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
my agency handled over 1400 right to
 
05:29:55.628 --> 05:29:55.638 align:start position:0%
know requests right now this is an
 
05:29:58.830 --> 05:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate uh placed on our agency
 
05:30:00.990 --> 05:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
so its task is a collateral duty to
 
05:30:03.430 --> 05:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
myself uh but due to the large influx of
 
05:30:05.708 --> 05:30:05.718 align:start position:0%
numbers of requests you can see I also
 
05:30:08.310 --> 05:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
have it tked out to 10 other records per
 
05:30:11.150 --> 05:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
in my agency we have the luxury luxury
 
05:30:13.310 --> 05:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
in my agency to have large numbers right
 
05:30:15.070 --> 05:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
it's absolutely crippling though to
 
05:30:16.910 --> 05:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
these smaller agencies that don't have
 
05:30:18.510 --> 05:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
the luxury of these numbers the reason
 
05:30:20.310 --> 05:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
being is you know obviously the current
 
05:30:22.070 --> 05:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
climate with hiring it's difficult to
 
05:30:24.110 --> 05:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
get Personnel it's realistic to believe
 
05:30:25.750 --> 05:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
that these guys are pulling individuals
 
05:30:27.628 --> 05:30:27.638 align:start position:0%
off the road officers off the road in
 
05:30:29.510 --> 05:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
order to handle the influx of these
 
05:30:30.830 --> 05:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
requests right and when we're doing that
 
05:30:32.990 --> 05:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
we're taking officers off the road right
 
05:30:35.390 --> 05:30:35.400 align:start position:0%
and when we take officers off the road
 
05:30:38.270 --> 05:30:38.280 align:start position:0%
we lose that police presence right that
 
05:30:41.788 --> 05:30:41.798 align:start position:0%
presence that deters crime and uh so
 
05:30:44.190 --> 05:30:44.200 align:start position:0%
when we look at currently some of the
 
05:30:46.910 --> 05:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
issues that are going to arise with the
 
05:30:51.430 --> 05:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
um Amendment here uh is you I'll start
 
05:30:54.548 --> 05:30:54.558 align:start position:0%
with the uh the electronic uh
 
05:30:56.628 --> 05:30:56.638 align:start position:0%
dissemination of these right and we look
 
05:30:58.470 --> 05:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
at the fact that we're probably going to
 
05:30:59.948 --> 05:30:59.958 align:start position:0%
open ourselves up to a significant
 
05:31:01.948 --> 05:31:01.958 align:start position:0%
number of more requests from out uh
 
05:31:04.070 --> 05:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
outside the state
 
05:31:04.080 --> 05:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
outside the state
um

05:31:05.080 --> 05:31:05.090 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:05.090 --> 05:31:06.390 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

05:31:06.390 --> 05:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:31:09.070 --> 05:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
the issues that we'll see here is in the
 
05:31:11.590 --> 05:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
second page here in paragraph uh four
 
05:31:15.190 --> 05:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
where it talks about um you know doile
 
05:31:17.110 --> 05:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
have a domiciled in New Hampshire owns
 
05:31:19.030 --> 05:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
property uh in New Hampshire pays New
 
05:31:21.510 --> 05:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxes right um as law
 
05:31:23.150 --> 05:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement say how are we vetting this
 
05:31:25.430 --> 05:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
information how are we proving that you
 
05:31:27.310 --> 05:31:27.320 align:start position:0%
have a business here in the state right
 
05:31:28.510 --> 05:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
if we're going to do that that's going
 
05:31:30.708 --> 05:31:30.718 align:start position:0%
to continue to tax us right there right
 
05:31:32.310 --> 05:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
because now I'm going to have to utilize
 
05:31:34.070 --> 05:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
some type of personnal to look into this
 
05:31:38.030 --> 05:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
and say is John Doe an actual taxpayer
 
05:31:39.708 --> 05:31:39.718 align:start position:0%
are you know do they actually have a
 
05:31:41.628 --> 05:31:41.638 align:start position:0%
business in this state right and second
 
05:31:43.830 --> 05:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
off when we're doing this right there is
 
05:31:45.470 --> 05:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
anonymity that some people do like to
 
05:31:47.310 --> 05:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
request under for this you know when
 
05:31:48.548 --> 05:31:48.558 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with law enforcement
 
05:31:51.110 --> 05:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
which is understandable right um so we
 
05:31:53.628 --> 05:31:53.638 align:start position:0%
have to look at those factors
 
05:31:55.788 --> 05:31:55.798 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to take up too much of
 
05:31:58.110 --> 05:31:58.120 align:start position:0%
your time right
 
05:32:00.788 --> 05:32:00.798 align:start position:0%
um the other thing we got to look at too
 
05:32:03.868 --> 05:32:03.878 align:start position:0%
is with um records not all our records
 
05:32:06.190 --> 05:32:06.200 align:start position:0%
are uh electronic right so if you're
 
05:32:07.990 --> 05:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
going to have to disseminate these
 
05:32:09.310 --> 05:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
rically these records are going to have
 
05:32:10.590 --> 05:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
to be located they're going to have to
 
05:32:13.350 --> 05:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
be scanned in not everything is kept uh
 
05:32:15.270 --> 05:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
in digital format and Records Management
 
05:32:17.548 --> 05:32:17.558 align:start position:0%
Systems um we're still only in its
 
05:32:20.350 --> 05:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
infancy in law enforcement uh with
 
05:32:21.868 --> 05:32:21.878 align:start position:0%
implementing technology that's the
 
05:32:25.830 --> 05:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
reality of it um and lastly some of my
 
05:32:28.150 --> 05:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
other concerns are is just these blanket
 
05:32:30.510 --> 05:32:30.520 align:start position:0%
requests that we do receive and proving
 
05:32:32.150 --> 05:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
that they are an actual person right we
 
05:32:33.708 --> 05:32:33.718 align:start position:0%
do have to deal with Technologies such
 
05:32:35.868 --> 05:32:35.878 align:start position:0%
as Ai and Bots where we will see blanket
 
05:32:37.030 --> 05:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
requests that go out throughout the
 
05:32:39.030 --> 05:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
state where they asking for information
 
05:32:40.510 --> 05:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
and realistically what they're trying to
 
05:32:42.788 --> 05:32:42.798 align:start position:0%
do is hope that they get that agency
 
05:32:45.230 --> 05:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
that didn't take the time to review that
 
05:32:46.990 --> 05:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
paperwork and they go and release
 
05:32:48.948 --> 05:32:48.958 align:start position:0%
someone's private information right and
 
05:32:50.548 --> 05:32:50.558 align:start position:0%
every single request that does come in
 
05:32:53.390 --> 05:32:53.400 align:start position:0%
through our agency we treat uh with this
 
05:32:54.670 --> 05:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
you know the same amount of interest
 
05:32:57.628 --> 05:32:57.638 align:start position:0%
because we do have an uh duty to protect
 
05:33:00.270 --> 05:33:00.280 align:start position:0%
the privacy of uh individuals right we
 
05:33:02.350 --> 05:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
understand that there's a duty for uh
 
05:33:04.350 --> 05:33:04.360 align:start position:0%
you know provide public interest but we
 
05:33:07.070 --> 05:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
also have to protect privacy um and
 
05:33:08.670 --> 05:33:08.680 align:start position:0%
again that
 
05:33:10.470 --> 05:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
leads to again a significant amount of
 
05:33:13.830 --> 05:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
Manpower and ours um that's really all I
 
05:33:16.230 --> 05:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
have right now on that okay representive
 
05:33:18.788 --> 05:33:18.798 align:start position:0%
L thank thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:33:20.270 --> 05:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
coming in and thanking thank you for
 
05:33:22.830 --> 05:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
your service to our community
 
05:33:26.510 --> 05:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
um so the existing the existing law says
 
05:33:29.270 --> 05:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
every citizen and and the proposal is to
 
05:33:32.310 --> 05:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
change it to any person I'm assuming
 
05:33:34.990 --> 05:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
that citizen is easier for you to verify
 
05:33:38.350 --> 05:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
is that one of is that fair to say so
 
05:33:41.670 --> 05:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
the guidance that we utilize is that um
 
05:33:43.350 --> 05:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
our agency will ask you come and
 
05:33:45.030 --> 05:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
retrieve those documents in person and
 
05:33:47.270 --> 05:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
by simply you showing up in person we
 
05:33:49.628 --> 05:33:49.638 align:start position:0%
treat that as a citizen we don't pull
 
05:33:51.628 --> 05:33:51.638 align:start position:0%
your ask for your ID we don't ask for
 
05:33:54.590 --> 05:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
anything to that effect um part of that
 
05:33:57.670 --> 05:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
is um almost a survival mechanism that
 
05:33:59.750 --> 05:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
agencies are utilizing right now so that
 
05:34:02.070 --> 05:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
they can cut down on the number of uh
 
05:34:03.548 --> 05:34:03.558 align:start position:0%
Records that they have to disseminate
 
05:34:05.590 --> 05:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
because they can't keep up um when it
 
05:34:07.830 --> 05:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
comes to how other agencies are checking
 
05:34:09.510 --> 05:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
to confirm if they're a citizen I'm
 
05:34:11.910 --> 05:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
unsure but we my agency does not check
 
05:34:13.948 --> 05:34:13.958 align:start position:0%
anything simply you being president in
 
05:34:16.310 --> 05:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
person we treat you as
 
05:34:18.910 --> 05:34:18.920 align:start position:0%
citizen represent of evil all I was
 
05:34:21.390 --> 05:34:21.400 align:start position:0%
going to say is that the word person in
 
05:34:24.150 --> 05:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law has a very
 
05:34:27.830 --> 05:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
broad it's not just people it's it can
 
05:34:30.030 --> 05:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
be entities it could be all sorts of
 
05:34:32.708 --> 05:34:32.718 align:start position:0%
things it's not just a person so it's
 
05:34:34.910 --> 05:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
quite an
 
05:34:38.750 --> 05:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
expansion other questions no did you um
 
05:34:40.708 --> 05:34:40.718 align:start position:0%
take your concerns to the Judiciary
 
05:34:42.990 --> 05:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
Committee on this bill I did not I was
 
05:34:45.548 --> 05:34:45.558 align:start position:0%
not present for that I'm sorry okay all
 
05:34:47.788 --> 05:34:47.798 align:start position:0%
right very good and um so you said
 
05:34:52.030 --> 05:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
you're doing uh 1,400 requests a year so
 
05:34:55.390 --> 05:34:55.400 align:start position:0%
that's like six a day roughly I guess is
 
05:34:58.030 --> 05:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
yes yeah okay and how much time does it
 
05:35:00.910 --> 05:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
take to process a typical request or do
 
05:35:03.230 --> 05:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
you have a sort of an hours man hours
 
05:35:06.150 --> 05:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
per year kind of no and that will vary
 
05:35:07.750 --> 05:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
depending on requests and who's
 
05:35:10.390 --> 05:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
requesting it and uh uh for instance I
 
05:35:12.430 --> 05:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
have requests that I've been working on
 
05:35:15.868 --> 05:35:15.878 align:start position:0%
for uh four or five months now um simply
 
05:35:17.390 --> 05:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
because the sheer volume of those
 
05:35:18.628 --> 05:35:18.638 align:start position:0%
requests where other ones are pretty
 
05:35:21.110 --> 05:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
simple hey I need this document um okay
 
05:35:22.708 --> 05:35:22.718 align:start position:0%
I pull the document I'm able to redact
 
05:35:24.510 --> 05:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
it it's easily found and I can get it
 
05:35:27.190 --> 05:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
back to them within 15 20 minutes but uh
 
05:35:31.350 --> 05:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
on average there I would say um you know
 
05:35:34.030 --> 05:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
you're looking at anywhere from an hour
 
05:35:36.230 --> 05:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
to two hours handling minimum some of
 
05:35:39.110 --> 05:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
these um and again the sheer volume and
 
05:35:41.070 --> 05:35:41.080 align:start position:0%
size of some of the requests uh that we
 
05:35:45.830 --> 05:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
see are just astronomical gotcha okay
 
05:35:48.390 --> 05:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much other questions
 
05:35:51.030 --> 05:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
don't see any thank you for coming um
 
05:35:52.868 --> 05:35:52.878 align:start position:0%
and we do see the utsman here would you
 
05:35:57.190 --> 05:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
like to weigh in on House Bill
 
05:36:00.110 --> 05:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
66 maybe on the other one thank you
 
05:36:04.830 --> 05:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:08.390 --> 05:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
officer absolutely
 
05:36:10.590 --> 05:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
to the extent that the officer come up
 
05:36:12.670 --> 05:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
come up so you turn on the microphone
 
05:36:15.110 --> 05:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
and all that stuff sorry representative
 
05:36:16.910 --> 05:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
Lyn again to the extent that the officer
 
05:36:18.670 --> 05:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
was concerned about like if they don't
 
05:36:19.990 --> 05:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
have records
 
05:36:22.590 --> 05:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
electronically but the request is made
 
05:36:25.030 --> 05:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
for them to be provided electronically I
 
05:36:26.430 --> 05:36:26.440 align:start position:0%
think the bill says they don't have to
 
05:36:28.830 --> 05:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
do that if the if the records don't ex
 
05:36:30.390 --> 05:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
if there's only hard copies of the
 
05:36:32.990 --> 05:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
records then the then the the town can
 
05:36:35.548 --> 05:36:35.558 align:start position:0%
say can say you know we're not going to
 
05:36:36.708 --> 05:36:36.718 align:start position:0%
we're not going to convert them to
 
05:36:38.788 --> 05:36:38.798 align:start position:0%
electronic it's only if they exist in
 
05:36:40.390 --> 05:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
electronic form that then you have to
 
05:36:42.510 --> 05:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
provide them that way now does this bill
 
05:36:44.948 --> 05:36:44.958 align:start position:0%
change the fact that a person would have
 
05:36:48.190 --> 05:36:48.200 align:start position:0%
to request in person and and now they
 
05:36:51.150 --> 05:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
will be able to request online yes in
 
05:36:53.948 --> 05:36:53.958 align:start position:0%
other words right now now right now the
 
05:36:56.270 --> 05:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
town can say you got to come in and
 
05:36:59.948 --> 05:36:59.958 align:start position:0%
request in person this would say if you
 
05:37:02.070 --> 05:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
have a New Hampshire connection or
 
05:37:04.350 --> 05:37:04.360 align:start position:0%
you're a member of the media you don't
 
05:37:06.350 --> 05:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
have to come in you can ask remote you
 
05:37:08.868 --> 05:37:08.878 align:start position:0%
can request remotely and the town had
 
05:37:11.270 --> 05:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
and you and if you know and you can say
 
05:37:12.750 --> 05:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to get the records
 
05:37:14.708 --> 05:37:14.718 align:start position:0%
electronically and if the town has it
 
05:37:16.670 --> 05:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
electronically they have to respond
 
05:37:18.548 --> 05:37:18.558 align:start position:0%
electronic and so presumably your
 
05:37:21.310 --> 05:37:21.320 align:start position:0%
committee talked about this and decided
 
05:37:24.190 --> 05:37:24.200 align:start position:0%
that that that wasn't unreason I mean
 
05:37:26.868 --> 05:37:26.878 align:start position:0%
the the the openness aspect outweighed
 
05:37:28.830 --> 05:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
whatever that right that that was I mean
 
05:37:31.110 --> 05:37:31.120 align:start position:0%
we you know we were
 
05:37:31.120 --> 05:37:32.990 align:start position:0%
we you know we were
not

05:37:32.990 --> 05:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:37:35.390 --> 05:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
considering um to the extent that you're
 
05:37:37.910 --> 05:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
going to consider the the financial
 
05:37:39.470 --> 05:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
aspect of this I mean we I'm not saying
 
05:37:41.230 --> 05:37:41.240 align:start position:0%
we we didn't have that you know we
 
05:37:42.990 --> 05:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
weren't considering it at all but but
 
05:37:45.270 --> 05:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
not to the same extent that you are okay
 
05:37:47.150 --> 05:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
very good representative evil and then
 
05:37:49.150 --> 05:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
representative thank you am I not
 
05:37:51.110 --> 05:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
correct that the word person is much
 
05:37:53.150 --> 05:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
broader in New Hampshire law than the
 
05:37:55.948 --> 05:37:55.958 align:start position:0%
word citizen I I think you're right I
 
05:37:57.990 --> 05:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
think you know yeah no no I think you're
 
05:38:00.990 --> 05:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
right I I guess UND but I don't know if
 
05:38:03.868 --> 05:38:03.878 align:start position:0%
you're aware of the where what the
 
05:38:08.510 --> 05:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
impetus for this change was that well
 
05:38:11.868 --> 05:38:11.878 align:start position:0%
there was a case in uh involving a
 
05:38:14.310 --> 05:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
request for information
 
05:38:17.708 --> 05:38:17.718 align:start position:0%
by uh in uh from to the town of
 
05:38:21.708 --> 05:38:21.718 align:start position:0%
Rochester and it was made by a
 
05:38:25.270 --> 05:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
recognized uh media person who who
 
05:38:28.708 --> 05:38:28.718 align:start position:0%
provides you know media in provides
 
05:38:31.670 --> 05:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
media U I think it's a maybe a podcast
 
05:38:34.030 --> 05:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
or it might even be a newspaper in
 
05:38:36.230 --> 05:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
Rochester to the citizens of Rochester
 
05:38:38.350 --> 05:38:38.360 align:start position:0%
but the person lives in
 
05:38:40.868 --> 05:38:40.878 align:start position:0%
so he made a me he made a 91a request
 
05:38:43.030 --> 05:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
for information from Rochester they
 
05:38:45.788 --> 05:38:45.798 align:start position:0%
refused to give it to him saying he's uh
 
05:38:47.990 --> 05:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
he's he's not a citizen and we don't
 
05:38:49.590 --> 05:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
have to give it and in fact I think
 
05:38:51.030 --> 05:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
there if I recall correctly their
 
05:38:52.990 --> 05:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
position was you had to be a citizen of
 
05:38:55.350 --> 05:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
the M of whatever the jurisdiction was
 
05:38:57.310 --> 05:38:57.320 align:start position:0%
so he had to be a citizen of Rochester
 
05:38:59.990 --> 05:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
so the media guy couldn't get his stuff
 
05:39:01.948 --> 05:39:01.958 align:start position:0%
if that went to the Superior Court super
 
05:39:04.430 --> 05:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
Court said that's baloney I mean which
 
05:39:06.070 --> 05:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
correctly in my view that is just
 
05:39:09.628 --> 05:39:09.638 align:start position:0%
complete baloney and pointed out that
 
05:39:11.590 --> 05:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
there has as far and the court did a
 
05:39:13.510 --> 05:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
pretty good job of research on this
 
05:39:16.110 --> 05:39:16.120 align:start position:0%
apparently there had never been a case
 
05:39:18.708 --> 05:39:18.718 align:start position:0%
before this in which the issue of you
 
05:39:20.910 --> 05:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
know of somebody denying a request on
 
05:39:23.510 --> 05:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
the basis of citizenship was ever made
 
05:39:26.030 --> 05:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
was not just never was done um but
 
05:39:28.230 --> 05:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
nonetheless that was enough of an alarm
 
05:39:29.750 --> 05:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
I mean particularly where it was a media
 
05:39:31.948 --> 05:39:31.958 align:start position:0%
person it was enough of an alarm that I
 
05:39:33.788 --> 05:39:33.798 align:start position:0%
think we thought you know we we ought to
 
05:39:35.830 --> 05:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
change this but that's still a human
 
05:39:39.190 --> 05:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
being I I I think in New Hampshire law
 
05:39:42.190 --> 05:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
person has a broader meaning and we can
 
05:39:44.230 --> 05:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
look into that a little bit more but
 
05:39:47.350 --> 05:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
there are many statutes where this term
 
05:39:49.708 --> 05:39:49.718 align:start position:0%
where the word person is used and it's
 
05:39:52.468 --> 05:39:52.478 align:start position:0%
not just human beings there oh I no I
 
05:39:54.070 --> 05:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
agree completely so I mean I guess so
 
05:39:57.110 --> 05:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
that's a broadening Beyond right because
 
05:39:59.628 --> 05:39:59.638 align:start position:0%
here it just says
 
05:40:02.750 --> 05:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
citizen yeah although I'm not sure that
 
05:40:05.708 --> 05:40:05.718 align:start position:0%
you know C I mean I'm I'm not sure that
 
05:40:07.590 --> 05:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
that would be limited to human being
 
05:40:12.110 --> 05:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
either I mean is a a corporation I if a
 
05:40:14.750 --> 05:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
corporation is is New Hampshire
 
05:40:16.430 --> 05:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
Corporation is that a citizen of New
 
05:40:18.430 --> 05:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire certainly not for voting
 
05:40:20.430 --> 05:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
certainly not for voting but I mean for
 
05:40:22.948 --> 05:40:22.958 align:start position:0%
other purposes uh that's a good it's a
 
05:40:24.350 --> 05:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
it's a question though because it's
 
05:40:27.350 --> 05:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
definitely a a oh no it is sure it is a
 
05:40:29.430 --> 05:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
question clearly if some person who
 
05:40:32.788 --> 05:40:32.798 align:start position:0%
worked for a company wanted you know if
 
05:40:34.590 --> 05:40:34.600 align:start position:0%
if we somehow disallowed the company
 
05:40:37.430 --> 05:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
from from making a request any person
 
05:40:38.830 --> 05:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
that that company could come in and make
 
05:40:40.910 --> 05:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
the request right so what difference do
 
05:40:42.510 --> 05:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
that make all right so I think
 
05:40:43.910 --> 05:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative Rong and then
 
05:40:45.990 --> 05:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative cell thank you Mr
 
05:40:49.708 --> 05:40:49.718 align:start position:0%
chairman so I'm looking on uh page two
 
05:40:52.990 --> 05:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
line nine it says that the public body
 
05:40:54.990 --> 05:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
or agency shall not be required to
 
05:40:56.708 --> 05:40:56.718 align:start position:0%
provide records electronically if it
 
05:40:59.270 --> 05:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
lacks the technological capability to do
 
05:41:01.670 --> 05:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
so if doing so would be unduly
 
05:41:03.230 --> 05:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
burdensome or if doing so would
 
05:41:04.708 --> 05:41:04.718 align:start position:0%
compromise the security of its
 
05:41:07.548 --> 05:41:07.558 align:start position:0%
recordkeeping system after listening to
 
05:41:10.548 --> 05:41:10.558 align:start position:0%
the officer's testimony my concern um I
 
05:41:14.670 --> 05:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
get my my question is if let's say a a
 
05:41:17.548 --> 05:41:17.558 align:start position:0%
police officer has to go back and redact
 
05:41:20.628 --> 05:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
information that's on an electronic
 
05:41:23.590 --> 05:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
document would that be then considered
 
05:41:25.628 --> 05:41:25.638 align:start position:0%
unduly burdensome so they wouldn't have
 
05:41:28.190 --> 05:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
the requirement of having to provide
 
05:41:30.510 --> 05:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
that electronically because I could see
 
05:41:33.270 --> 05:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
where they may have a a scan of a police
 
05:41:36.190 --> 05:41:36.200 align:start position:0%
report or some type of investigation
 
05:41:39.750 --> 05:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
document and they want to keep um some
 
05:41:43.548 --> 05:41:43.558 align:start position:0%
identities confidential if they if that
 
05:41:45.510 --> 05:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
document's being requested and they have
 
05:41:47.990 --> 05:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
to go back and redact the electronic
 
05:41:50.430 --> 05:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
version would would you consider that to
 
05:41:53.548 --> 05:41:53.558 align:start position:0%
be defined as a burdensome to provide
 
05:41:55.670 --> 05:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
that do that document no I would say I
 
05:41:57.948 --> 05:41:57.958 align:start position:0%
would say I mean no un I mean unless if
 
05:42:00.510 --> 05:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
it was a request for you know I want I
 
05:42:03.510 --> 05:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
want like every uh I want every police
 
05:42:04.948 --> 05:42:04.958 align:start position:0%
report that was issued by the city of
 
05:42:08.030 --> 05:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester in the last six months
 
05:42:10.070 --> 05:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
sure I think that would be burdensome
 
05:42:12.750 --> 05:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
but if it was just you know I want to I
 
05:42:14.830 --> 05:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
want a some particular police report and
 
05:42:16.910 --> 05:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
the police have to go through and redact
 
05:42:19.948 --> 05:42:19.958 align:start position:0%
it to you know to uh exclude
 
05:42:21.468 --> 05:42:21.478 align:start position:0%
confidential information no I would
 
05:42:23.670 --> 05:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
think I think that kind of thing happens
 
05:42:25.548 --> 05:42:25.558 align:start position:0%
really all the time that they you know
 
05:42:27.548 --> 05:42:27.558 align:start position:0%
that police or not just police
 
05:42:29.030 --> 05:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
particularly police maybe but other
 
05:42:31.390 --> 05:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
agencies have to make redactions before
 
05:42:32.948 --> 05:42:32.958 align:start position:0%
they provide information I think that
 
05:42:35.110 --> 05:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
happens all the time okay thank you
 
05:42:36.830 --> 05:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
representative cambrell thank you Mr
 
05:42:36.840 --> 05:42:37.628 align:start position:0%
representative cambrell thank you Mr
chair

05:42:37.628 --> 05:42:37.638 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:42:40.430 --> 05:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
if a uh person makes a request for an
 
05:42:42.590 --> 05:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
electronic record and the electronic
 
05:42:44.030 --> 05:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
record cannot be provided because they
 
05:42:46.070 --> 05:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
don't have it electronically does the
 
05:42:48.430 --> 05:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
person then have to pay for hard copies
 
05:42:52.510 --> 05:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
to be generated the yeah well they have
 
05:42:56.190 --> 05:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
yes they can be charged um the I uh I
 
05:42:57.590 --> 05:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
think there's somewhere else in the
 
05:43:00.110 --> 05:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
statute I believe that says you know
 
05:43:01.350 --> 05:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
that it's not subject to this amendment
 
05:43:02.708 --> 05:43:02.718 align:start position:0%
I believe it but I believe they can be
 
05:43:07.350 --> 05:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
charged for the copying costs to to uh
 
05:43:09.310 --> 05:43:09.320 align:start position:0%
you know to per page or whatever to copy
 
05:43:10.590 --> 05:43:10.600 align:start position:0%
the records and then they can also be
 
05:43:12.270 --> 05:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
charged if they have whatever the it
 
05:43:15.350 --> 05:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
costs to mail it to the person uh who
 
05:43:17.708 --> 05:43:17.718 align:start position:0%
who requested it okay so even though
 
05:43:19.708 --> 05:43:19.718 align:start position:0%
they had requested an electronic copy
 
05:43:21.868 --> 05:43:21.878 align:start position:0%
which should be free they still have to
 
05:43:23.628 --> 05:43:23.638 align:start position:0%
pay for the copying cost because it's
 
05:43:25.990 --> 05:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
not available that way right if in other
 
05:43:27.868 --> 05:43:27.878 align:start position:0%
words if it is if it is they can't you
 
05:43:29.868 --> 05:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
know they can't sort of if it is
 
05:43:31.468 --> 05:43:31.478 align:start position:0%
available electronically then they have
 
05:43:33.708 --> 05:43:33.718 align:start position:0%
to provide it electronic but if it's not
 
05:43:35.670 --> 05:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
they don't have to then they they can
 
05:43:37.230 --> 05:43:37.240 align:start position:0%
say no we don't have it you have to it's
 
05:43:38.788 --> 05:43:38.798 align:start position:0%
only hard copy and you have to pay for
 
05:43:41.830 --> 05:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
the hard copy thank you represent Ms did
 
05:43:44.628 --> 05:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
you have a question um yes uh thank you
 
05:43:49.190 --> 05:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh on on page um I guess it's page one
 
05:43:53.190 --> 05:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh lines 29 and 30 it it reads at the
 
05:43:55.628 --> 05:43:55.638 align:start position:0%
election of such person requesting the
 
05:43:58.390 --> 05:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
records the public body or agency shall
 
05:44:00.548 --> 05:44:00.558 align:start position:0%
provide such electon such records
 
05:44:02.910 --> 05:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
electronically or by
 
05:44:07.150 --> 05:44:07.160 align:start position:0%
mail does that does that give the agenc
 
05:44:09.670 --> 05:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
see in the case of the officer's example
 
05:44:11.708 --> 05:44:11.718 align:start position:0%
the Manchester Police Department the
 
05:44:13.510 --> 05:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
option to decide that they do not want
 
05:44:15.590 --> 05:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
to provide it
 
05:44:18.230 --> 05:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
electronically or if or if the if the
 
05:44:20.030 --> 05:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
person coming in says they want it
 
05:44:21.670 --> 05:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
electronically are they required to do
 
05:44:23.910 --> 05:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
it electronically no I think they're you
 
05:44:25.670 --> 05:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
know what I think they are required to
 
05:44:28.990 --> 05:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
provide it um electronically
 
05:44:31.430 --> 05:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh oh where is it I I thought there was
 
05:44:35.788 --> 05:44:35.798 align:start position:0%
something else in here that says that
 
05:44:42.310 --> 05:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:45.430 --> 05:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
chronically the election it does seem a
 
05:44:47.468 --> 05:44:47.478 align:start position:0%
little confusing oh no so I'm sorry but
 
05:44:49.390 --> 05:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
you know what it says at the election
 
05:44:53.468 --> 05:44:53.478 align:start position:0%
the important thing is uh on line 24 any
 
05:44:55.430 --> 05:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
person may request governmental records
 
05:44:57.990 --> 05:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
electronically or by mail without
 
05:45:00.110 --> 05:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
physically appearing then B I think the
 
05:45:01.788 --> 05:45:01.798 align:start position:0%
important language there is at the
 
05:45:04.190 --> 05:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
election of the person requesting the
 
05:45:06.390 --> 05:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
records but then it goes on to say the
 
05:45:08.708 --> 05:45:08.718 align:start position:0%
public body or agency shall provide such
 
05:45:11.750 --> 05:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
records electronically or by mail right
 
05:45:13.270 --> 05:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
but in other words that but it's but
 
05:45:15.510 --> 05:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's at the they they can provide it one
 
05:45:18.070 --> 05:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
way or the other at the election okay of
 
05:45:19.788 --> 05:45:19.798 align:start position:0%
the person that's making the request so
 
05:45:21.270 --> 05:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
if the person making the request says I
 
05:45:23.270 --> 05:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
want it electronically and you have it
 
05:45:24.590 --> 05:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
electronically you then you have to
 
05:45:26.190 --> 05:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
provide it that way okay thank you
 
05:45:29.670 --> 05:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
represent W did you have usually on this
 
05:45:32.070 --> 05:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
subject the complaint we hear is from
 
05:45:34.830 --> 05:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
the Town Clerk and the local Crank that
 
05:45:36.590 --> 05:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
comes in almost every week and demands
 
05:45:40.030 --> 05:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
hundreds of pages and and uh you know
 
05:45:41.670 --> 05:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to pay for them and just
 
05:45:43.868 --> 05:45:43.878 align:start position:0%
keeps coming back and asking for more
 
05:45:45.708 --> 05:45:45.718 align:start position:0%
I'll ask if anybody else and I thought
 
05:45:47.788 --> 05:45:47.798 align:start position:0%
that was going to change this by saying
 
05:45:51.430 --> 05:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
you know people are too frequent or or
 
05:45:54.830 --> 05:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
too burdensome representative wild i i
 
05:45:56.430 --> 05:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
as you may recall from last year we had
 
05:45:58.310 --> 05:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
a huge fight on this and I have to say
 
05:46:00.590 --> 05:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
I'm on your side I would I was one of
 
05:46:03.510 --> 05:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
those saying they should have more the
 
05:46:05.990 --> 05:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
town should have more ability to charge
 
05:46:08.628 --> 05:46:08.638 align:start position:0%
but there was a hug huge you know view
 
05:46:10.230 --> 05:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
on the other side and as I say it was
 
05:46:12.270 --> 05:46:12.280 align:start position:0%
bipartisan it wasn't Republican Democrat
 
05:46:13.910 --> 05:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
there were people on both
 
05:46:17.310 --> 05:46:17.320 align:start position:0%
sides there was a compromise reached and
 
05:46:20.750 --> 05:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
you know it was I so that's kind of
 
05:46:22.590 --> 05:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
where we are all right thank you
 
05:46:24.830 --> 05:46:24.840 align:start position:0%

05:46:40.070 --> 05:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay well let's let's all right let's
 
05:46:45.510 --> 05:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:48.070 --> 05:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon I'm Margaret burns
 
05:46:49.548 --> 05:46:49.558 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the New
 
05:46:51.468 --> 05:46:51.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association and I
 
05:46:54.510 --> 05:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
wish just to mention that we provided to
 
05:46:56.590 --> 05:46:56.600 align:start position:0%
members of the house finance committee a
 
05:46:58.430 --> 05:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
packet of information that we sent to
 
05:47:00.510 --> 05:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
house Judiciary this packet of
 
05:47:02.990 --> 05:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
information showed that our concern
 
05:47:06.150 --> 05:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
about ballooning out of state requests
 
05:47:08.190 --> 05:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
going to local governments are not
 
05:47:11.310 --> 05:47:11.320 align:start position:0%
hypothetical they're not theoretical and
 
05:47:13.430 --> 05:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
that is one of our major concerns with
 
05:47:15.430 --> 05:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
the significant overhaul that house bill
 
05:47:18.628 --> 05:47:18.638 align:start position:0%
66 does to current law so you do have
 
05:47:20.548 --> 05:47:20.558 align:start position:0%
that information and we continue to
 
05:47:24.708 --> 05:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
receive in examples of large outof state
 
05:47:26.030 --> 05:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
right to know requests that
 
05:47:27.990 --> 05:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities have received and we
 
05:47:29.990 --> 05:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that we provide that
 
05:47:32.070 --> 05:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
information to you I would also just
 
05:47:35.548 --> 05:47:35.558 align:start position:0%
like to Echo um the comments made by the
 
05:47:37.390 --> 05:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
officer earlier we agreed age with all
 
05:47:39.310 --> 05:47:39.320 align:start position:0%
of the concerns raised and we have heard
 
05:47:41.510 --> 05:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
similar concerns from police departments
 
05:47:44.350 --> 05:47:44.360 align:start position:0%
around the state thank you thank you all
 
05:47:46.708 --> 05:47:46.718 align:start position:0%
right so officer you wanted to come back
 
05:47:49.190 --> 05:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
and have a second shot you thought of
 
05:47:54.590 --> 05:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:57.230 --> 05:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
to but only last thing I wanted to touch
 
05:47:59.110 --> 05:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
on here is in that paragraph where it
 
05:48:00.670 --> 05:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
does state that a member of the media
 
05:48:02.468 --> 05:48:02.478 align:start position:0%
regardless of where located May request
 
05:48:04.468 --> 05:48:04.478 align:start position:0%
government records electronically one of
 
05:48:06.430 --> 05:48:06.440 align:start position:0%
the things that we see is that media is
 
05:48:08.150 --> 05:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
very Loosely defined at this point in
 
05:48:09.430 --> 05:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
this day and age whether you have a
 
05:48:12.270 --> 05:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
podcast a Blog uh and we see any
 
05:48:14.510 --> 05:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
critical event that we have I will
 
05:48:17.708 --> 05:48:17.718 align:start position:0%
receive tens of 20 requests from these
 
05:48:20.030 --> 05:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
media Outlets or impromptu media Outlets
 
05:48:22.910 --> 05:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
so the the problem is is say you are in
 
05:48:24.468 --> 05:48:24.478 align:start position:0%
the state of Massachusetts and you want
 
05:48:26.628 --> 05:48:26.638 align:start position:0%
to request something I can just become a
 
05:48:28.150 --> 05:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
member of the media by creating a
 
05:48:30.030 --> 05:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
podcast today and so that's something I
 
05:48:31.548 --> 05:48:31.558 align:start position:0%
just wanted to raise a concern about
 
05:48:34.230 --> 05:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's hard to police if you
 
05:48:36.948 --> 05:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
will okay thank you
 
05:48:39.628 --> 05:48:39.638 align:start position:0%
all right so um I think we're going to
 
05:48:43.430 --> 05:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
have to digest this all the all the what
 
05:48:44.948 --> 05:48:44.958 align:start position:0%
we've heard I don't think we're quite
 
05:48:47.390 --> 05:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
ready to act here so let's go on to
 
05:48:51.708 --> 05:48:51.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:54.788 --> 05:48:54.798 align:start position:0%
111 um extending the position of the
 
05:48:57.430 --> 05:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
right no no Ombudsman for two
 
05:49:01.948 --> 05:49:01.958 align:start position:0%
years and recognize representative
 
05:49:06.510 --> 05:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
Lynn so um I I guess what I would say on
 
05:49:10.150 --> 05:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
that is um that
 
05:49:13.548 --> 05:49:13.558 align:start position:0%
we the Judiciary Committee did what um
 
05:49:18.548 --> 05:49:18.558 align:start position:0%
we did on that um and again from from a
 
05:49:21.750 --> 05:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
policy perspective I think and and I I
 
05:49:23.110 --> 05:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
want to say that I mean we had we had
 
05:49:24.990 --> 05:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
significant debate on this bill because
 
05:49:28.868 --> 05:49:28.878 align:start position:0%
there were different views um within the
 
05:49:31.590 --> 05:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee I but I think
 
05:49:35.510 --> 05:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately we concluded that the the
 
05:49:37.868 --> 05:49:37.878 align:start position:0%
right to no EMB budsman is very new I
 
05:49:39.750 --> 05:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
mean it's just got passed a couple of
 
05:49:45.750 --> 05:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
years ago it in the context of the whole
 
05:49:50.510 --> 05:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
fight over what costs should be able to
 
05:49:52.110 --> 05:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
be imposed on somebody who makes a
 
05:49:53.310 --> 05:49:53.320 align:start position:0%
request for
 
05:49:58.150 --> 05:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
information um the the office of the
 
05:50:01.070 --> 05:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman was part of that bill that was
 
05:50:03.910 --> 05:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
passed last year it C it calls for you
 
05:50:07.948 --> 05:50:07.958 align:start position:0%
know the uh the an appeal to be made to
 
05:50:10.708 --> 05:50:10.718 align:start position:0%
the Ombudsman over the estimate for the
 
05:50:12.670 --> 05:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
costs or or the costs that are actually
 
05:50:15.510 --> 05:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
imposed when costs are allowed to be
 
05:50:20.030 --> 05:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
imposed and so um we ended up concluding
 
05:50:22.990 --> 05:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
that you know we should that maybe it
 
05:50:25.030 --> 05:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
was too soon to do something about
 
05:50:27.788 --> 05:50:27.798 align:start position:0%
changing the udman with it with all due
 
05:50:29.788 --> 05:50:29.798 align:start position:0%
respect to the udman who I've met the
 
05:50:31.390 --> 05:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
number of times he seems like a nice guy
 
05:50:33.270 --> 05:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
I think he does a good he said he does a
 
05:50:37.190 --> 05:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
good job um I again
 
05:50:40.788 --> 05:50:40.798 align:start position:0%
this is you know the the money thing in
 
05:50:43.350 --> 05:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
my view is is like the number one
 
05:50:47.628 --> 05:50:47.638 align:start position:0%
consideration and so with you know I
 
05:50:48.948 --> 05:50:48.958 align:start position:0%
you're going to do what you have to do
 
05:50:50.468 --> 05:50:50.478 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to respect whatever you
 
05:50:52.350 --> 05:50:52.360 align:start position:0%
decide to do because I think that the
 
05:50:54.430 --> 05:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
that the budget is the number one
 
05:50:58.430 --> 05:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
priority okay thank you
 
05:51:01.990 --> 05:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
questions do we see any no no okay thank
 
05:51:05.868 --> 05:51:05.878 align:start position:0%
you representative blind um so Mr udman
 
05:51:07.990 --> 05:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
would you like to talk about this
 
05:51:15.750 --> 05:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:18.868 --> 05:51:18.878 align:start position:0%
sure very basically for the part of the
 
05:51:21.190 --> 05:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
bill that continues my agency please
 
05:51:23.670 --> 05:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
turn on your microphone on I said that
 
05:51:25.670 --> 05:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
I'll make it brief I basically I'm for
 
05:51:26.910 --> 05:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
the part of the bill that will continue
 
05:51:29.468 --> 05:51:29.478 align:start position:0%
my agency Beyond July 1st 2025 because
 
05:51:30.868 --> 05:51:30.878 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know what to do because if I
 
05:51:31.830 --> 05:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
know the agency is going to get
 
05:51:33.270 --> 05:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
continued I got to go back and find out
 
05:51:35.350 --> 05:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
whether I'm going to get recommissioned
 
05:51:37.190 --> 05:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
so I would uh
 
05:51:40.350 --> 05:51:40.360 align:start position:0%
it's been two years uh I've given you my
 
05:51:42.270 --> 05:51:42.280 align:start position:0%
uh annual report the last time around
 
05:51:44.510 --> 05:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
you've seen that obviously whether or
 
05:51:47.830 --> 05:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
not you wish to continue it is up to the
 
05:51:50.868 --> 05:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
legislature yeah thank you so and the
 
05:51:52.628 --> 05:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
other portions of the bill I that's up
 
05:51:57.190 --> 05:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
to you any questions let me let me just
 
05:51:59.190 --> 05:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
tell you what I'm thinking about in
 
05:52:01.390 --> 05:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
regards to this bill and sketch your
 
05:52:04.910 --> 05:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
reaction and that is that um I think
 
05:52:06.830 --> 05:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
that $170,000
 
05:52:09.628 --> 05:52:09.638 align:start position:0%
a year when you're doing three cases a
 
05:52:15.788 --> 05:52:15.798 align:start position:0%
month is not um is not reasonable so um
 
05:52:18.030 --> 05:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
we have some other boards where they're
 
05:52:22.468 --> 05:52:22.478 align:start position:0%
paid on a per case basis plus some
 
05:52:25.430 --> 05:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
stipend for you know for the for the
 
05:52:29.270 --> 05:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
answering the phone type of stuff and um
 
05:52:31.110 --> 05:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
in particular one of our
 
05:52:35.270 --> 05:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
boards um they're paid I think it's $200
 
05:52:37.190 --> 05:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
every two weeks
 
05:52:41.230 --> 05:52:41.240 align:start position:0%
plus $400 a case when they have a case
 
05:52:44.590 --> 05:52:44.600 align:start position:0%
and so in in your case with with that
 
05:52:47.468 --> 05:52:47.478 align:start position:0%
would end up being a much smaller amount
 
05:52:50.670 --> 05:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
of money um and it would be a part-time
 
05:52:52.868 --> 05:52:52.878 align:start position:0%
job not a full-time job no benefits all
 
05:52:57.230 --> 05:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
the sort of thing so I don't know if if
 
05:53:00.628 --> 05:53:00.638 align:start position:0%
we do that which is my my in inclination
 
05:53:02.948 --> 05:53:02.958 align:start position:0%
you may or may not be appointed May or
 
05:53:05.750 --> 05:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
not want such a job Etc but what's your
 
05:53:08.350 --> 05:53:08.360 align:start position:0%
reaction to to doing that my reaction to
 
05:53:11.270 --> 05:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
that is that those people have a support
 
05:53:13.350 --> 05:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
I do not I am doing three or four
 
05:53:15.788 --> 05:53:15.798 align:start position:0%
people's jobs to support me as the guy
 
05:53:17.670 --> 05:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
that would get the pum if all I did was
 
05:53:21.468 --> 05:53:21.478 align:start position:0%
hidle cases I'm not just deciding cases
 
05:53:24.150 --> 05:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
and hearing cases and having my support
 
05:53:26.628 --> 05:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
network reschedule a case uh do
 
05:53:29.590 --> 05:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
expedited proceedings and Etc add your
 
05:53:31.350 --> 05:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
own purchasing and moving and Etc the
 
05:53:34.190 --> 05:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
things I mentioned in my report um
 
05:53:36.670 --> 05:53:36.680 align:start position:0%
frankly I'm doing several people's jobs
 
05:53:39.030 --> 05:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
and uh if you want to do it on a case-by
 
05:53:40.750 --> 05:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
casee basis I think that you're going to
 
05:53:42.230 --> 05:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
put a strain on anybody I'm
 
05:53:43.948 --> 05:53:43.958 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to because
 
05:53:45.270 --> 05:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
they would need to provide the support
 
05:53:48.070 --> 05:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
that I'm currently providing myself and
 
05:53:49.990 --> 05:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that's going to be any
 
05:53:54.628 --> 05:53:54.638 align:start position:0%
cheaper thank you okay all right other
 
05:53:56.830 --> 05:53:56.840 align:start position:0%
any other questions no thank you very
 
05:53:59.270 --> 05:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
much you're welcome so to me this one
 
05:54:01.708 --> 05:54:01.718 align:start position:0%
feels like a retain because it's it's
 
05:54:03.990 --> 05:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
spending money just like everything else
 
05:54:07.390 --> 05:54:07.400 align:start position:0%
so do we that seem right to people yes
 
05:54:10.548 --> 05:54:10.558 align:start position:0%
okay representative evil recommended I
 
05:54:13.708 --> 05:54:13.718 align:start position:0%

05:54:50.990 --> 05:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
and maybe we ought to maybe maybe we
 
05:54:52.708 --> 05:54:52.718 align:start position:0%
want to think about it maybe come up
 
05:54:54.788 --> 05:54:54.798 align:start position:0%

05:56:16.750 --> 05:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
hours excluding Saturdays Sundays and
 
05:56:19.750 --> 05:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
holidays to ensure that our costs are
 
05:56:21.830 --> 05:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
covered and that agreement can be with
 
05:56:24.190 --> 05:56:24.200 align:start position:0%
anyone the feds if the state wants to
 
05:56:26.430 --> 05:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
contract with us so that we hold someone
 
05:56:29.110 --> 05:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
great um if a county does not have a
 
05:56:31.910 --> 05:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
contract because some counties are just
 
05:56:34.390 --> 05:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
never going to get a contract Sullivan
 
05:56:36.030 --> 05:56:36.040 align:start position:0%
County probably is never going to get a
 
05:56:36.040 --> 05:56:37.430 align:start position:0%
County probably is never going to get a
contct

05:56:37.430 --> 05:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
contct
 
05:56:39.990 --> 05:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
contract we will not hold them we don't
 
05:56:41.150 --> 05:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
have to hold them because they don't
 
05:56:42.750 --> 05:56:42.760 align:start position:0%
have space because they don't have space
 
05:56:44.628 --> 05:56:44.638 align:start position:0%
they don't meet the requirements things
 
05:56:47.708 --> 05:56:47.718 align:start position:0%
like that there's also
 
05:56:49.990 --> 05:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding obligation language in
 
05:56:52.990 --> 05:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
here to protect the anyone who does have
 
05:56:54.548 --> 05:56:54.558 align:start position:0%
a contract so the contract that
 
05:56:56.270 --> 05:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
Strafford County has with ice and the
 
05:56:59.230 --> 05:56:59.240 align:start position:0%
rider on the Marat County contract and
 
05:57:02.510 --> 05:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
if Rockingham Coos is in talks with
 
05:57:04.390 --> 05:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
border control about a contract right
 
05:57:06.750 --> 05:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
now those contracts would be protected
 
05:57:08.750 --> 05:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
and we could hold them beyond the 48
 
05:57:10.670 --> 05:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
hours so I think it's a fairly simple
 
05:57:13.070 --> 05:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment it handles the money piece it
 
05:57:15.190 --> 05:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
handles the litigation piece and if you
 
05:57:16.590 --> 05:57:16.600 align:start position:0%
do this the counties will be very
 
05:57:18.670 --> 05:57:18.680 align:start position:0%
appreciative and I'm happy to take any
 
05:57:21.548 --> 05:57:21.558 align:start position:0%
questions okay um any questions
 
05:57:21.558 --> 05:57:22.868 align:start position:0%
questions okay um any questions
representa

05:57:22.868 --> 05:57:22.878 align:start position:0%
representa
 
05:57:26.788 --> 05:57:26.798 align:start position:0%
M thank you and um just bear with me
 
05:57:28.350 --> 05:57:28.360 align:start position:0%
here sure
 
05:57:31.030 --> 05:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
um is there any reason that this has to
 
05:57:33.150 --> 05:57:33.160 align:start position:0%
be specifically limited to Immigration
 
05:57:34.990 --> 05:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
and Customs Enforcement I mean would it
 
05:57:37.070 --> 05:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
be better to give you
 
05:57:41.030 --> 05:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
have it be broader so um my
 
05:57:43.750 --> 05:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
understanding is that detainers are only
 
05:57:47.548 --> 05:57:47.558 align:start position:0%
an ice World thing they don't exist
 
05:57:49.110 --> 05:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
anywhere else we're already covered
 
05:57:51.628 --> 05:57:51.638 align:start position:0%
under warrants if you have state charges
 
05:57:54.590 --> 05:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
pending um things like that so I think
 
05:57:57.270 --> 05:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
we're covered on those other pieces
 
05:58:01.510 --> 05:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
detainers are not criminal they're civil
 
05:58:04.390 --> 05:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
and so I think that's the
 
05:58:07.110 --> 05:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
difference yes go so that raises an
 
05:58:08.910 --> 05:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
interesting question we're holding we're
 
05:58:11.788 --> 05:58:11.798 align:start position:0%
going to hold people accused of a civil
 
05:58:13.990 --> 05:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
crime in a criminal
 
05:58:16.548 --> 05:58:16.558 align:start position:0%
jail 48
 
05:58:19.708 --> 05:58:19.718 align:start position:0%
hours we we don't have we don't want to
 
05:58:21.750 --> 05:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
debate the policy that is not our
 
05:58:24.350 --> 05:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
intention Our intention is to just make
 
05:58:27.910 --> 05:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
it legal so we don't get sued okay very
 
05:58:30.708 --> 05:58:30.718 align:start position:0%
good other questions represent swing
 
05:58:32.430 --> 05:58:32.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I not a question I
 
05:58:34.708 --> 05:58:34.718 align:start position:0%
just to clarify on the policy side of it
 
05:58:37.628 --> 05:58:37.638 align:start position:0%
not to get too weight into it the bill
 
05:58:40.468 --> 05:58:40.478 align:start position:0%
as amended by criminal justice only
 
05:58:43.750 --> 05:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
applies to inmates in New Hampshire so
 
05:58:45.548 --> 05:58:45.558 align:start position:0%
it's only those inmates with ice
 
05:58:47.430 --> 05:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
detainers that will then fall under this
 
05:58:49.788 --> 05:58:49.798 align:start position:0%
provision so it's not nobody's going to
 
05:58:52.110 --> 05:58:52.120 align:start position:0%
be going out and arresting people for
 
05:58:54.910 --> 05:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
civil detainers it's only those inmates
 
05:58:59.750 --> 05:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
in the system but the but go ahead but
 
05:59:03.190 --> 05:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
theoretically if somebody is in for a
 
05:59:08.310 --> 05:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:11.390 --> 05:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
then they and they are still
 
05:59:15.548 --> 05:59:15.558 align:start position:0%
retained they're they're they're not a
 
05:59:17.390 --> 05:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
criminal anymore or they're not an
 
05:59:17.400 --> 05:59:20.150 align:start position:0%
criminal anymore or they're not an
inmate

05:59:20.150 --> 05:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:23.390 --> 05:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
anymore and I don't know I I will I will
 
05:59:27.628 --> 05:59:27.638 align:start position:0%
say counties are pre-trial and 80 to 90%
 
05:59:29.468 --> 05:59:29.478 align:start position:0%
of the people that counties are holding
 
05:59:34.788 --> 05:59:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:36.590 --> 05:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
convicted okay
 
05:59:38.628 --> 05:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
all right thank you so all right we will
 
05:59:40.948 --> 05:59:40.958 align:start position:0%
