rule

00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
rule
 
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
i've reviewed the department's objection
 
00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:03.759 align:start position:0%
response and you have my comments
 
00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:05.110 align:start position:0%
response and you have my comments
already

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
our office received written testimony
 
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
for this objection response yesterday
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
and i reviewed that testimony and i
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
think it's important to point out that
 
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
the written testimony conflates the
 
00:08:17.749 --> 00:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
medicaid state plan with the ihs waiver
 
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
and in doing so the testimony confuses
 
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
the requirements needed to comply with
 
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
the federal law after my review i do not
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
believe that there are any further bases
 
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
for objection
 
00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:34.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
move to approve
 
00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
would it be possible to hear i know we
 
00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:46.959 align:start position:0%
did receive some testimony would it be
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
possible to hear from those folks who
 
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:53.829 --> 00:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
for what purpose
 
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh to inform the committee on those
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
we normally follow the advice of the
 
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.230 align:start position:0%

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
and it is the
 
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.550 align:start position:0%
and it is the
um

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
decision of the chair whether he wants
 
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:15.519 align:start position:0%

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to hear from the public
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%

what was in writing
 
00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:58.710 align:start position:0%
what was in writing
or

00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.160 align:start position:0%

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%

senator whitley thank you um
 
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
i i think so we have the uh the what was
 
00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:13.519 align:start position:0%
provided by the department but i
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
understand there are members of the
 
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
public who wanted to provide input on
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
that so that maybe we could start with
 
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
that and then the department could
 
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:25.670 align:start position:0%
that and then the department could
respond

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
your response
 
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
the department agrees with the
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
testimony that where they
 
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
the staff attorney's comments um and
 
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
can address the written testimony if
 
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
necessary but do not feel that it
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
changes substantively in any way the
 
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
department's previous response to this
 
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.150 align:start position:0%
department's previous response to this
matter

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
no i i would like to hear from the
 
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
member of the public and then the
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
department could respond to that
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's particularly because this this
 
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
committee did have so many you know
 
00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
objected to it i feel like we need to
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
have this a broader discussion so i know
 
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
there are members of the public who want
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
to provide additional input and i think
 
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
we should give them the opportunity to
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
just to hear it we don't do this just to
 
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
hear people talk
 
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
i understand that
 
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
who is here that wants to speak again
 
00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:39.519 align:start position:0%
about the same thing that we already
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
objected to
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.720 align:start position:0%

case management issue that i raised
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
previously has been resolved in that the
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
department has admitted in writing that

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
about in this rule is case management

00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
services in this rule
 
00:13:14.399 --> 00:13:15.269 align:start position:0%
services in this rule
is

00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
serves only
 
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:17.990 align:start position:0%
serves only
to

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
circumvent that guidance that is in
 
00:13:21.279 --> 00:13:24.069 align:start position:0%
circumvent that guidance that is in
statute

00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:24.079 --> 00:13:24.949 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
i think it's great
 
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
that the attorneys are now going
 
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
to the delcar attorneys are now going to
 
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.069 align:start position:0%
to the delcar attorneys are now going to
opine

00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
opine
 
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
on the rules before this committee at
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
length i would caution you however that
 
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
they are not
 
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
subject experts
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
the waiver that that was was read has
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
has many subject experts available
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
i don't believe they were contacted and
 
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
more importantly nor were the providers
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
that this rule will govern and the
 
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
citizens that will be impacted
 
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
by it so to rely solely
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
department's testimony
 
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.030 align:start position:0%
department's testimony
and

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.629 align:start position:0%
and
information

00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
i believe is misguided with the
 
00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
underlying principles that the committee
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
is charged with enforcing
 
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.230 align:start position:0%
is charged with enforcing
um

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
this is a short step to going back to
 
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
the days of
 
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
you know dark rooms and suitcases of
 
00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.110 align:start position:0%
you know dark rooms and suitcases of
cash

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
cash
 
00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
and i'll leave it at
 
00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
that um i think it's important to
 
00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
explain the purpose of committee staff
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
we are not cert subject experts that is
 
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
correct our job is to inform the
 
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
committee if there are possible bases of
 
00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.629 align:start position:0%
committee if there are possible bases of
objection

00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
objection
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
based on whether or not the um
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
rule complies with federal and state
 
00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.629 align:start position:0%
rule complies with federal and state
statute

00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
and that is what i did i did review the
 
00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
waiver and all of the testimony and
 
00:15:10.639 --> 00:15:11.670 align:start position:0%
waiver and all of the testimony and
um

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
i do not see
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
a basis for objection based on the rule
 
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
not complying with federal statute or
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
the waiver because the rule does comply
 
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
with federal statute and the waiver as i
 
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
have seen it if you can point out a
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
point in which it doesn't comply with
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
the federal statute in the waiver then i
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
will absolutely take that into
 
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
consideration but i have not
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
after my lengthy review found any point
 
00:15:39.749 --> 00:15:39.759 align:start position:0%
in which this rule does not comply with
 
00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
the federal law and the stat in the
 
00:15:41.199 --> 00:15:43.030 align:start position:0%
the federal law and the stat in the
waiver

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
waiver
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
mr chairman committee staff's job to
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
seek out public testimony on the rules
 
00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:50.959 align:start position:0%
under the statute my question for the
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
witness is
 
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
is your claim there was no public
 
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.350 align:start position:0%
is your claim there was no public
hearing

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
no sir i was at the public hearing may
 
00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:01.759 align:start position:0%
may i
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
respond to the question that was asked
 
00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
um it seems that right now we're in a
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
back and forth between uh that's why we
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
didn't want a department
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:23.519 --> 00:16:24.310 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:25.759 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.069 align:start position:0%
my question
so

00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:28.079 --> 00:16:28.870 align:start position:0%
so
you

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you're well aware that that gel
 
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
car you know can only object to the
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
rules based on the statutory you know
 
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
the statutory um
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
reasons under 541a so is there do you
 
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
believe that there is there is a basis
 
00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
for objection at this point
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
i um i believe that there is a basis for
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
objection in that
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
uh the remote services which are
 
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
telehealth do not reference the
 
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839 align:start position:0%
telehealth statutes
 
00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
so the rule is not consistent with
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
statute additionally
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
in the waiver the services that the rule
 
00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
is being written about is referred to
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
as telehealth in the waiver
 
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
and i've provided
 
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
those references
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
in my
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
testimony of a couple of days ago that i
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
i would be very interested to learn
 
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.830 align:start position:0%
i would be very interested to learn
why

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
environmental mental modifications
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
vehicle modifications
 
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
and emergency response buttons are going
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
um the department may be able to answer
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
that question better
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
after my review i believe that the the
 
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.390 align:start position:0%
after my review i believe that the the
waiver

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
waiver
 
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
does not restrict the
 
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
department from using the term remote
 
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
versus telehealth the telehealth
 
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
statutes apply to specific providers and
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
those providers are not
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
the same as the ones that are are
 
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
providing services under the ihs waiver
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
um so they're they're again they're two
 
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
they're two separate
 
00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.590 align:start position:0%
they're two separate
things

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
representing choir yes if the remote
 
00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
services included something that would
 
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
qualify as telehealth would that be
 
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
covered by the statutes that we already
 
00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.270 align:start position:0%
covered by the statutes that we already
have

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:45.039 align:start position:0%
uh yes especially if those were the
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
providers under that statute
 
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
senator whitley are you satisfied at
 
00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
sir you have a motion by maguire a
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
second by gray i believe it was a move
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
to approve okay
 
00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
you've heard the motion any discussion
 
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
by the committee
 
00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.510 align:start position:0%
by the committee
yeah

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
if possible i would love to hear the
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
department respond to the issues raised
 
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak today
 
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
again for the record my name is melissa
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
nemeth i am an attorney for the bureau
 
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
of developmental services
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
and to speak to the point of the remote
 
00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.630 align:start position:0%
and to speak to the point of the remote
services

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
the reason that the as attorney immune
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
is pointed out the statute that is
 
00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
referenced in the testimony just it does
 
00:19:59.909 --> 00:19:59.919 align:start position:0%
not apply to the providers in the waiver
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
that is for providers of medicaid state
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
plan services and we are talking about a
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
medicaid waiver so it cannot be the same
 
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
services that are on the state plan
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
otherwise we wouldn't need a waiver
 
00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:14.630 align:start position:0%
otherwise we wouldn't need a waiver
so

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
in the providers additionally the
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
providers under the in-home support
 
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
waiver are not regulated by that same
 
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
statute so they do not need to comply
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
with the telehealth components there i
 
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
would also point out that in the rule
 
00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:32.559 align:start position:0%
in the section it's 524.16
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
that lays out these services it does lay
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
out all of the parameters that would be
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
necessary for this service for the the
 
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
identified services to be provided in
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
the remote modality
 
00:20:44.799 --> 00:20:45.909 align:start position:0%
the remote modality
including

00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
including
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
it has to be deemed appropriate for that
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
individual it has to be in their service
 
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
plan there has to be oversight so all of
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
those elements remain but the the fact
 
00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
is that the statute that has been
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
referenced does not apply
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
in the waiver agreement with cms it is
 
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
not identified that those that that
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
statute applies it's laid out in the
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
waiver what all of the qualifications
 
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
are and how that will be provided
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
and that's totally permissible by cms
 
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.870 align:start position:0%
and that's totally permissible by cms
standards

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.039 align:start position:0%
and to address the point of certain
 
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
services that were asked about in acute
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
care hospitals
 
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
the purpose for that for example
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
environmental modifications it wouldn't
 
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
be that the room in the hospital is
 
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
being modified but if the individual is
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
in the hospital and needs modifications
 
00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:36.799 align:start position:0%
to their home prior to being discharged
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
while they are in the hospital this
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
allows that service to be provided and
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
billed rather than waiting for the
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
individual to go back to their home to
 
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
let that service be billed
 
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
and the personal emergency response
 
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
services that can include something that
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
for example has an app on a phone or has
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
an other monthly charge and the waiver
 
00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
provides that
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
while someone that we will pay that the
 
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
waiver will pay for that monthly
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
maintenance fee so if that if someone
 
00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:07.039 align:start position:0%
went into the hospital and this service
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
was not allowed to be provided in the
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
hospital they would lose
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
that maintenance of that service that's
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
important to them for that time period
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
with that i'm also happy to take any
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
you've heard the motion in the second
 
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
and the extended discussion
 
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
 
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.310 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:51.029 --> 00:22:51.039 align:start position:0%
we have a no from senator whitley and
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
and are you here for criminal records
 
00:23:03.919 --> 00:23:04.950 align:start position:0%
and are you here for criminal records
and

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:09.919 align:start position:0%
okay yes sir this proposal makes changes
 
00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:12.559 align:start position:0%
to no longer allow licensed exempt child
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
care providers
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
to receive reimbursement prior to the
 
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
results of their staff members criminal
 
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
records check
 
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
in order to be in compliance with
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
and it requires that facilities ensure
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
that these staff members are also so
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
supervised during that time
 
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
in its request for a fiscal impact
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
statement to the lba the department
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
didn't talk about any potential cost to
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
the providers for these new requirements
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
however it does sound like that the
 
00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
providers can be reimbursed
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
retroactively if that staff member's
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
background check comes back clean
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
the department asked the lba for revised
 
00:23:50.799 --> 00:23:52.070 align:start position:0%
the department asked the lba for revised
fists

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
fists
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
since it did need to cure this defect in
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
the fists
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
and since an amended fist can only be
 
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
sought in the case where changes
 
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
are resulting as a result of
 
00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.590 align:start position:0%
are resulting as a result of
of

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
notice and hearing they couldn't really
 
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
get an amended fist so they've gotten a
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
revised fist but
 
00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
that's actually not a type of fist that
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
can be sought underneath 541a
 
00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
so that's the remaining issue and the
 
00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
committee may need to consider amending
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
541a to allow
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
getting a
 
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
fist in the case of a defect
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
initial office but you may have
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
questions for the agency about this
 
00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is nicole burke i'm
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules coordinator for
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
the rules unit at department of health
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
and human services and happy to answer
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
um so initially the fist was the request
 
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
for fist was drafted um it's actually
 
00:24:59.909 --> 00:24:59.919 align:start position:0%
most likely a revenue neutral situation
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
however reflecting upon there could be
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
an extra staff person in a facility
 
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
based program most likely they're just
 
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
in two two people together in one room
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
versus two separate rooms however due to
 
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
it being potentially indeterminable we
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
did revisit that submitted it to the lba
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
could not do an amended fists per
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
attorney reeves statements
 
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
and have completed what lba referred to
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
as a revised fist
 
00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:24.799 align:start position:0%
and did submit that with our conditional
 
00:25:24.799 --> 00:25:26.230 align:start position:0%
and did submit that with our conditional
approval

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
approval
 
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
and i should state that the lba did
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
identify that the the costs were
 
00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:33.029 align:start position:0%
identify that the the costs were
indeterminable

00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
indeterminable
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:39.919 --> 00:25:46.549 align:start position:0%

motion by mcguire second by lang
 
00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039 align:start position:0%
any further discussion from the

peter

00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
peter
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman well it was
 
00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
referenced that uh the committee wanted
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
might want to consider amending 541a
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
and i think we
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
are at least have a word about that
 
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
it's in process now yeah it's it is not
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
something we can do well it's i i
 
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
understand there's nothing we can do
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
about it at this point the question is
 
00:26:20.159 --> 00:26:21.669 align:start position:0%
about it at this point the question is
whether

00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
the amendment is in works and i'm i've
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
just heard it is yes it's uh we have a
 
00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
list of 541a amendments that we're
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
working on that will you'll see in
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
probably the next couple months terrific
 
00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:36.799 align:start position:0%
okay mr chair yes yeah i'd like to
 
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
express my concern that we're getting
 
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
creeping cost growth to our businesses
 
00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:45.039 align:start position:0%
by federal regulations
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
and therefore i'm i object to that
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
principle even if this specific rule
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't cause a
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
major impact it's still
 
00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
a new cost to our businesses that the
 
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
federal government is imposing on them
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
we have a motion in a second all those
 
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
in favor aye
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:32.559 align:start position:0%
now the next rule is uh 2021-126
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
it's on home visiting for prenatal child
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
and family support services um this was
 
00:27:37.919 --> 00:27:38.789 align:start position:0%
and family support services um this was
actually

00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
the i have no comment on the rule tax
 
00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:43.039 align:start position:0%
this is consent in terms of the rule tax
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
um it is on your agenda however because
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
um if you open up the rule
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
and scroll past the notice you'll see
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact statement and there is
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
a rather significant fiscal impact um it
 
00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
does appear that
 
00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:00.559 align:start position:0%
that fiscal impact is due to
 
00:28:00.559 --> 00:28:01.669 align:start position:0%
that fiscal impact is due to
the

00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
the statute change
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
um the the cost essentially per unit has
 
00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
not changed it's just the people that
 
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
would be eligible and the amount of time
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
they would be eligible for has changed
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
but since it is a rather significant
 
00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:16.559 align:start position:0%
impact we thought you may have questions
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%

seeing none all those in favor aye
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%

okay yes sir um this proposal will adopt
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
rules um basically to set up an rfp
 
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
process for the distributions out of
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
this trust fund account
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
the agency has filed an amended of
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
after our discussions with them this
 
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
monday around the need to have some
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
broad scoring criteria in the rule
 
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:37.669 align:start position:0%
broad scoring criteria in the rule
for

00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
scoring these
 
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
rfp applications
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
there's just one issue remaining and
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
that is on the the first page of the
 
00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
rule and that is that the originated
 
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
statute was effective in 2020 and so the
 
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
committee may have some questions about
 
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
the delay in bringing forward of these
 
00:29:55.520 --> 00:30:00.310 align:start position:0%
the delay in bringing forward of these
rules

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
good morning allison zeno administrator
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
of the administrative rules unit for the
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%

rsa 126 a 83 through 86 became effective
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
uh 7-1 20-20
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
at that time the department of justice
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
had to form the commission
 
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
to start working on these rules
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
which in turn
 
00:30:26.549 --> 00:30:26.559 align:start position:0%
a work group was formed between doj and
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
where they started drafting
 
00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.510 align:start position:0%
where they started drafting
crafting

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
crafting
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
and editing these rules
 
00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:34.149 align:start position:0%
and editing these rules
and

00:30:34.149 --> 00:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
met multiple times and really just have
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%

mr chair
yes

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
so question
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
senate bill 275 passed with deals with
 
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
this fund as well and the commission and
 
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
my question is to these rules or are
 
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
they in any way in conflict with the
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
current law that was signed by the
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
so senate bill 275 passed the house
 
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
passed the senate was signed by the
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
governor just recently regarding this
 
00:31:30.549 --> 00:31:30.559 align:start position:0%
exact topic the the fund and the
 
00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:32.559 align:start position:0%
commission my question is are the
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
changes in that bill
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
now law
 
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
in conflict in any way with the current
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:59.509 --> 00:31:59.519 align:start position:0%
i've also been uh heading up the uh the
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
opioid litigation i don't think that the
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
change in that statute will uh will
 
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
conflict with these rules the changes
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
were fairly minor
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
to to change the census numbers the
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
original legislation had the 2010 census
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
numbers for distribution to those 23
 
00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
subdivisions who had filed lawsuits uh
 
00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:23.919 align:start position:0%
so it changes it so that we use the most
 
00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:26.799 align:start position:0%
current census figures it also adds a
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
member to the commission
 
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:30.870 align:start position:0%
member to the commission
and

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
and expands
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
very slightly the types of approved
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
uses for opioid abatement funds that can
 
00:32:41.909 --> 00:32:41.919 align:start position:0%
be can be authorized under the statute
 
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
so i don't think that it it changes that
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
in any significant way
 
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:53.679 align:start position:0%

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
agency did submit a conditional approval
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
that did address a number of the
 
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
staff's comments but there were still a
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
couple that need to be worked on
 
00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
so the agency has requested that this be
 
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
postponed to the next meeting in order
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
to file an amended conditional approval
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
any discussion all those in favor
 
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
all right the next rule is uh 2022-18 of
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
the insurance department
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
um this
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
rule is based on the naic model
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
so it's going to look a little different
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
than some you know
 
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
rules you normally see
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
that is a statutory exemption in 541a my
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
only comment is on page 44 of the rules
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
um it appears to
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
the conflicts with other laws section of
 
00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
the rule
 
00:34:54.399 --> 00:34:56.389 align:start position:0%
the rule
um

00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
the department may have a lack of
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
authority here because it appears that
 
00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:00.630 align:start position:0%
authority here because it appears that
the

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
the rule is allowing
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
the rule to supersede state statute
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
um i also want to note though this is
 
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
the exact same language that came
 
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:10.710 align:start position:0%
the exact same language that came
through

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
in 2012 and we did not have a comment on
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
it then so this this has been the rule
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
i think for 10 years now
 
00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.710 align:start position:0%
i think for 10 years now
um

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
but yeah you may have questions i think
 
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
the department may be able to explain
 
00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.349 align:start position:0%
the department may be able to explain
better

00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:35.119 --> 00:35:36.710 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
how about now there you go there we go
 
00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:39.990 align:start position:0%
how about now there you go there we go
okay

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:35:43.829 --> 00:35:43.839 align:start position:0%
uh good morning yes so yep so um my name
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
is heather silverstein i'm general
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
counsel for the insurance department
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh this rule is based off a model
 
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.390 align:start position:0%
uh this rule is based off a model
regulation

00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
it's a long-term care regulation from
 
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
the national association of insurance
 
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
commissioners with standing ic
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
and the reason that the regulation is
 
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
written in this way and that we also
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
write our regulation this way is because
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
long-term care
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
uh products insurance products are
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
different than major medical insurance
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
products and so all this rules
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
is stating is that the the
 
00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
statutes and rules that apply to major
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
medical products do not apply to this
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
particular long-term care uh product and
 
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
how they review um benefit determination
 
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
so let's say a a company denied the
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
benefit there's a procedure that you can
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
appeal internally and externally related
 
00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
to those decisions and for long-term
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
care you go it's related to 415d which
 
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
are statute and this rule 3601 now if
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
you were in major med the way that you
 
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
would appeal would be through
 
00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.310 align:start position:0%
would appeal would be through
um

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
the external review process which is a
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
different rule ins 2700 so that's all
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
this rule does is it's just saying these
 
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
these statutes and rules that wouldn't
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:01.119 --> 00:37:02.950 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
in that case i think that you should
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
more clearly reword that section so that
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
instead of saying
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
the provisions of this section supersede
 
00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:13.750 align:start position:0%
the provisions of this section supersede
the

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.190 align:start position:0%
the
statutes

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
the the statutes do not apply
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
which if you're correct
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
is a more
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to say it you can't
 
00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
override a statute in a rule
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
true and like i said we just follow the
 
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
model language and so that's all it's
 
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:35.599 align:start position:0%
just saying if the clear it's clarifying
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
that this is not we're not in a major
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
med product so we don't apply those
 
00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.270 align:start position:0%
med product so we don't apply those
rules

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
fine yeah um i
 
00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
i'd like to move to make a conditional
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
approval request
 
00:37:48.839 --> 00:37:50.790 align:start position:0%
approval request
okay

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
um would you
 
00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
prefer the sentence be changed around so
 
00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
it has you know rsa 420 and the
 
00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.589 align:start position:0%
it has you know rsa 420 and the
citations

00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
citations
 
00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
um do not apply to
 
00:38:01.359 --> 00:38:03.190 align:start position:0%
um do not apply to
yes

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
you can't you can't say in a rule that
 
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
you're superseding a statute you can say
 
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
that the statute does not apply
 
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
which i would agree with but you can't
 
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
did that work for the department um the
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
only thing that i would just have
 
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
concerns about is that the change in the
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to i want to make sure
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
that it's clear that this that the
 
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
provisions for review are in ins 3601
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
and that practitioners and other people
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
looking at the rule would understand
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
that these major medical
 
00:38:47.109 --> 00:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
statutes and rules do not apply so
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
that's my concern i guess i would have
 
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
to look at the the how you would say
 
00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
that they do not apply i think that
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that i think do not apply i
 
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:00.710 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that i think do not apply i
would

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
feel more comfortable with
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to do it that way
 
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
i do
 
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
um so i'm just going to read this whole
 
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:15.670 align:start position:0%

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.349 align:start position:0%
 
do

00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
not apply
 
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
for external review requirements to
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
these rules
 
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
yes okay okay it's not too much sorry
 
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
to this this to a long-term care
 
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
insurance policy
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
is what it really is
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
right those are statutes that are not
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
which is what the rule is about senator
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
gray oh that was what i was going to say
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
is that thank you that provision should
 
00:39:59.829 --> 00:39:59.839 align:start position:0%
be added in there that they don't apply
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
too long care
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
and that makes it clear which is what
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
the attorney said at the beginning of
 
00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:08.829 align:start position:0%

sorry it would be rsa420j5a

2703

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
2703
 
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
shall not apply for the purposes of
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
external review requirements for
 
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
long-term care
 
00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
insurance yes and that would be the that
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
would be what would exist in this
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
particular provision in i under conflict
 
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
with other laws yes that would replace
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
it that's what you're saying right yes
 
00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:49.839 --> 00:40:50.790 align:start position:0%
 
unfortunately

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
do not apply or shall not apply
 
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
you think shell if we say do not apply
 
00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
you no longer have a rule there is no
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
requirement in place so it needs to say
 
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
it shall not apply or shall not be
 
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
applicable shall not be applicable
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
motion is for conditional approval
 
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
 
00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.390 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
aye

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
aye
 
00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
and i'll send the department a letter
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
with all of that written out so you can
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
we also have an emergency rule from the
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:51.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
let's do this
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
let the safety people okay
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
this is an emergency rule put forward by
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy
 
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:00.870 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy
board

00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
as some of you may have read in the news
 
00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839 align:start position:0%
there is a severe shortage will
 
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
worldwide for contrast media for ct
 
00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.390 align:start position:0%
worldwide for contrast media for ct
scans

00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
scans
 
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:13.589 align:start position:0%
scans
the

00:42:13.589 --> 00:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:19.589 --> 00:42:19.599 align:start position:0%
the medicine that's used to
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
intravenously to create a contrast so
 
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
the ct will work
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
is in very short supply
 
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
what the pharmacy board would like to do
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
in these rules is to allow for
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
single dose vials to be used for more
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
than one patient because there's more
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
medicine in the vial
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
than is necessary for a single patient
 
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
this way they can use that towards a
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
second patient and
 
00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.950 align:start position:0%
second patient and
eventually

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
eventually
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
lower the amount
 
00:42:51.359 --> 00:42:52.630 align:start position:0%
lower the amount
or

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry to
 
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
okay that's an emergency rule
 
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
and there does seem to be a basis for
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
the emergency
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
good luck
 
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
now department of safety
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
okay yes sir um
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
this proposal makes changes to the rules
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
covering the installation and use of
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
ignition interlock devices
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
the agency has late filed a conditional
 
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
approval request and so first the
 
00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
committee needs to vote to accept that
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
before we can discuss the um the issues
 
00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
that remain
 
00:43:41.359 --> 00:43:42.870 align:start position:0%
that remain
hello

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
hello
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%

00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
 
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
okay so there are five items to bring to
 
00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
your attention the first one is on page
 
00:43:59.109 --> 00:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
two at the bottom of the page
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
here the rule says that the form can be
 
00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
found on the referenced website but it's
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
not there yet in discussion with the
 
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
department the department states that
 
00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:07.589 align:start position:0%
department the department states that
the

00:44:07.589 --> 00:44:07.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
form will be posted after gel car
 
00:44:09.839 --> 00:44:11.589 align:start position:0%
form will be posted after gel car
approval

00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
approval
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
the next item is on page six
 
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
and there's a similar comment also on
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
page seven
 
00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:21.670 align:start position:0%
page seven
so

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
here the rule requires that the device
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
be set at point zero two zero
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh testimony has been submitted stating
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
that this is a violation of a
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
legislative intent because rsa 265 a 37
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
roman 3 a
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
but that statute actually says that
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
there will be penalties for a person
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
if their breath alcohol concentration is
 
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
over .025
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
it doesn't require that the device be
 
00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
set at .025
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
so it would seem to be a policy decision
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
whether or not to set that device lower
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
since i didn't find anything in the
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
statute that would affirmatively require
 
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
it to be set at a specific
 
00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:10.870 align:start position:0%
you know
level

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
so you may have some questions for the
 
00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:38.309 --> 00:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
my name's marta moziani i'm representing
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
the department of safety i'm an attorney
 
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
in the legal unit and the
 
00:45:49.109 --> 00:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
rulemaking allows the commissioner to
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
set forth the model the the
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
specifications for the devices and in
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
the rules the department has
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
incorporated by reference the nitsa
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
model specs for the device which sets
 
00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
forth a alcohol set point of 0.020
 
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
for and that does not ring up the user
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
as a violation but it just stops the
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
vehicle from starting so
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
at point the alcohol set point is 0.020
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
but the violation set point is 0.025 so
 
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
if they blow in the device and it it
 
00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
reads 0.025 or more the user has failed
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
what happens if they
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
blow up
 
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.710 align:start position:0%
blow up
0.21

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
0.21
 
00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
it records and it sends that data and it
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
just stops the vehicle from running
 
00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
until they're they're able
 
00:46:47.839 --> 00:46:48.790 align:start position:0%
until they're they're able
to

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
it's not a penalty just doesn't start
 
00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
the car it tells the the person who they
 
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:12.069 --> 00:47:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:12.079 --> 00:47:14.309 align:start position:0%
 
next

00:47:14.309 --> 00:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
next
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
okay so um the next comment is on page
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
nine and um we received testimony uh
 
00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
suggesting that the rule language uh
 
00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
should be amended
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
and it says that the device
 
00:47:27.359 --> 00:47:28.630 align:start position:0%
and it says that the device
because

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
it was a little confusing but i think
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
that the testimony seemed to be saying
 
00:47:34.549 --> 00:47:34.559 align:start position:0%
that at this point in time the device
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
would already be installed however this
 
00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:39.839 align:start position:0%
section is about ins
 
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
initial installation of the device
 
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
so when looking at that testimony it
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
didn't seem that the um the changes that
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
were suggested would be appropriate
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
since the device this is about initial
 
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
i didn't know if you had any comments
 
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
you know for the or any questions for
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
the department about that but it really
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
did seem like that this whole section is
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
about initial installation
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
it is about the initial installation and
 
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
it is um
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
in order to ensure that the person who
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
is having the device installed has
 
00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
demonstrated proficiency by blowing
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
three times and passing
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you it
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
i agree that it the sequence seems wrong
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
that this is obviously to check out
 
00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
after the device is installed and you're
 
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
demonstrating this proficiency which is
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
which is fine but that does this mean
 
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
interlock service provider will then
 
00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
immediately remove the device if they
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
fail that the test if they can't blow
 
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't they
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
if they can't pass it yes i believe
 
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's the case but i've got the dmv
 
00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:11.670 align:start position:0%
that's the case but i've got the dmv
here

00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:13.109 align:start position:0%
here
um

00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:13.119 --> 00:49:19.190 align:start position:0%
um
would

00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
this is uh bob keller who's currently
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
the acting administrator of the um
 
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
bureau of financial responsibility in
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
the acting direct i'm sorry the
 
00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
so at the initial installation uh
 
00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:40.790 align:start position:0%
so at the initial installation uh
sorry

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
sorry the initial installation
 
00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
we're looking for that proficiency
 
00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:47.839 align:start position:0%
nothing states that it needs to be
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
installed in their vehicle at that time
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
to pass those tests
 
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
we're just saying that we want to show
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
them proficiency so i know that the
 
00:49:58.549 --> 00:49:58.559 align:start position:0%
providers do have some test models and
 
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
other devices that they can use to have
 
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
the operator demonstrate that
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
proficiency so that they can show that
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
they can safely operate the vehicle
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
before they leave that appointment that
 
00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:15.750 align:start position:0%
before they leave that appointment that
garage

00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
so this is a this is a test of the
 
00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:19.030 align:start position:0%
so this is a this is a test of the
equipment

00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:23.359 --> 00:50:24.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
right to ensure the the operator knows
 
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
how to use the device and be able to
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:40.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
okay so the next issue is on page 11 and
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
here the rule says that a person's
 
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
driving privileges can be suspended
 
00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
when there's a
 
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
consistent pattern of failures to pass a
 
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
breath test
 
00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.270 align:start position:0%
breath test
and

00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
you'll see my comment i'm agreeing
 
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
initially with the testimony that was
 
00:51:02.319 --> 00:51:03.349 align:start position:0%
initially with the testimony that was
submitted

00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
that perhaps the rule needed to have a
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
bit more firm language but after talking
 
00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:09.589 align:start position:0%
bit more firm language but after talking
with

00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
a staff from the department
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
i think it probably should stay as it is
 
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
because it was explained that this
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
language is meant to capture a pattern
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
of behavior
 
00:51:23.109 --> 00:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
so say if a person
 
00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
is can't pass a breath test every friday
 
00:51:26.079 --> 00:51:27.030 align:start position:0%
is can't pass a breath test every friday
night

00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
night
 
00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
then that would be a pattern that the
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
hearing officer would need to know about
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
and would be a pattern that
 
00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
that they would need to take in
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
consideration for violations but i'm
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
sure that the department can't explain
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
exactly what is
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
contemplated by that language
 
00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
safc6512 sets forth the
 
00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
violations whether a person who has
 
00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
violated the laws the rules
 
00:51:59.430 --> 00:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
would incur an extension of the ignition
 
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
interlock device
 
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
or a actual suspension of the driver's
 
00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559 align:start position:0%
license and it also is escalates in
 
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
terms of the number of violations that
 
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:52:13.829 --> 00:52:13.839 align:start position:0%
increases the the extension and or the
 
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
penalties this rule so so
 
00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
that rule already addresses the failures
 
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
of the breath test whether it's one or
 
00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:22.710 align:start position:0%
of the breath test whether it's one or
two

00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
this talks about the actual pattern and
 
00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
that is taken straight from the statute
 
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
takes 265 a 38
 
00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
roman numeral two
 
00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:33.829 align:start position:0%
roman numeral two
um

00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
talks about being able to
 
00:52:36.079 --> 00:52:37.109 align:start position:0%
talks about being able to
um

00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
bring someone in for a hearing for uh
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
showing a consistent pattern
 
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
and i think that in speaking and i don't
 
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
want to speak for
 
00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:49.839 align:start position:0%
mr blaisdell here but um in speaking i
 
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
think there was some concern that this
 
00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:52.549 align:start position:0%
think there was some concern that this
was

00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
vendors as opposed to the user
 
00:53:07.109 --> 00:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
okay what else do you have okay so i'm
 
00:53:12.069 --> 00:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
finally on page 16 there's a note
 
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
just an informational note regarding the
 
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
use of the rules citing to rsa 541
 
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
rather than 541a for appeals and
 
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
normally individuals must avail
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
themselves of the appeal process in 541a
 
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
unless the statute specifically states
 
00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise and in this case the safety
 
00:53:36.069 --> 00:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
statute does state otherwise so that is
 
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:44.069 --> 00:53:44.079 align:start position:0%
okay so we have testimony from
 
00:53:59.829 --> 00:53:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
you support the bill
 
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
with changes
 
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
correct good morning mr chairman members
 
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
is robert blaisdell
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
and i represent consumer safety
 
00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:12.559 align:start position:0%
technology out of des moines iowa they
 
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
are one of the registered vendors with
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
the state for the ignition interlock
 
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
by way of background
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
i've been involved with this issue since
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
the early 2000s i've been a part of
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
every single legislative hearing
 
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
as these statutes have been changed over
 
00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
the years
 
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
i have a pretty good idea what the
 
00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
legislative intent has been
 
00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
and after talking with the department
 
00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
earlier this morning um i'm going to
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
just focus on just one section of our
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
comments i believe
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
my first section in my third section
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
we've essentially worked out
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
which is going to be fine with a much
 
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
better understanding and i appreciate
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
that conversation so i'm going to focus
 
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh this morning just on
 
00:54:59.910 --> 00:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
page nine uh that i'm aware of fixed
 
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
dated um
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
text of may 26 2022 in its uh safc
 
00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:09.860 align:start position:0%
text of may 26 2022 in its uh safc
6507.01

00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:09.870 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:11.109 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
we believe that uh this proposed
 
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
language in in rule creates an
 
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.430 align:start position:0%
language in in rule creates an
additional

00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:18.309 align:start position:0%
additional
um

00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
an additional uh condition beyond
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
legislative intent
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
um we believe that in
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
in rsa 265 a colon 36 roman numeral one
 
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
in roman numeral 1a it clearly states
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
the legislative intent is is that this
 
00:55:37.349 --> 00:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
device shall be installed
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
this creates um sort of a putting on the
 
00:55:40.079 --> 00:55:41.030 align:start position:0%
this creates um sort of a putting on the
breaks

00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
breaks
 
00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
of wait a minute no it's not going to be
 
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
installed if
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
if they can't happen to to pass three
 
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
breath tests
 
00:55:49.599 --> 00:55:50.870 align:start position:0%
breath tests
um

00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
a couple of things we believe that goes
 
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
beyond the legislative intent
 
00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:56.549 align:start position:0%
beyond the legislative intent
um

00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
clearly stating that it shall be
 
00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
installed and secondly um you know some
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
people can be very savvy and if they
 
00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:03.190 align:start position:0%
people can be very savvy and if they
don't

00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
like the fact that this device is being
 
00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
mandated upon them to install in any
 
00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
registered vehicle that they have
 
00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
they can simply go in and
 
00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
not not pass the three tests
 
00:56:18.309 --> 00:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
and guess what happens that that device
 
00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:20.720 align:start position:0%
as as it says no interlock service
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
providers shall install a device in the
 
00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
vehicle of a user who is unable to pass
 
00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
the breath test
 
00:56:29.109 --> 00:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
um they're walking away that day with no
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
ignition interlock
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
on their car or cars
 
00:56:33.839 --> 00:56:34.710 align:start position:0%
on their car or cars
and

00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
we don't believe that's in in in the in
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
the public interest because this person
 
00:56:40.789 --> 00:56:40.799 align:start position:0%
has been deemed
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
a concern of public safety
 
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
and this device shall be installed
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
so again we just believe that this is a
 
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
needless loophole i believe is
 
00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:52.150 align:start position:0%
needless loophole i believe is
unintentional

00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
unintentional
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
and we have concerns about that going
 
00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:55.839 align:start position:0%
beyond legislative intent and i'll be
 
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so um
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
you indicated in your initial remarks
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
that you had some conversations i
 
00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
believe this morning and you worked out
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
some of the issues
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh and did you discuss this particular
 
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
aspect as well we did and what is the
 
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
result of that
 
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh colloquy the result of that
 
00:57:24.069 --> 00:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
representative is that we agreed to
 
00:57:24.079 --> 00:57:26.150 align:start position:0%
representative is that we agreed to
disagree

00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
disagree
 
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
very respectfully it was a wonderful
 
00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:29.030 align:start position:0%
very respectfully it was a wonderful
conversation

00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
we just happened to not
 
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:34.799 --> 00:57:35.750 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
where are we going to go from here is
 
00:57:38.789 --> 00:57:38.799 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
well my understanding um is that um
 
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's up to you all to determine if
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
this goes beyond the legislative intent
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
um about creating an additional
 
00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:50.630 align:start position:0%
um about creating an additional
condition

00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
condition
 
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
um clearly i think that this statute
 
00:57:54.309 --> 00:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
states that it shall be installed period
 
00:57:55.829 --> 00:57:55.839 align:start position:0%
that's what you all as the legislature
 
00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
has determined
 
00:57:59.190 --> 00:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
these rules are saying wait a minute no
 
00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be installed if they
 
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
don't can't do but i i take your point
 
00:58:05.589 --> 00:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
and i understand and now we have to hear
 
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
from our attorneys what they think
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm looking at 265 a 36 the two
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
sections that he's
 
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
referenced said any person who is
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
convicted of driving while
 
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
suspend under suspension or revocation
 
00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
resulting from a dwi fence
 
00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
shall be required by the court to
 
00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
install an ignition interlock device in
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
any vehicle registered to that person or
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
used by that person on a regular basis
 
00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
so it does say that it shall be
 
00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:35.829 align:start position:0%
so it does say that it shall be
installed

00:58:35.829 --> 00:58:35.839 align:start position:0%
installed
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
i do take his point that this could
 
00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
create a situation in which the device
 
00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:42.559 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be installed at that time
 
00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know whether or not and maybe
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
the department can speak to it whether
 
00:58:46.559 --> 00:58:47.670 align:start position:0%
the department can speak to it whether
or not

00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
it would be installed at a later time or
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
if there's any provision if a person
 
00:58:51.839 --> 00:58:53.670 align:start position:0%
if there's any provision if a person
continuously

00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
continuously
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
you know flows too high of an alcohol
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
concentration and can't have the device
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
installed don't know what happens at
 
00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
that point so perhaps the committee may
 
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:08.710 align:start position:0%
 
mike

00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
mike
 
00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
it would seem i understand the
 
00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
legislative intent is to have the device
 
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
installed i would think that
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
with that intent is that the device
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
actually work for the person that's
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
go ahead i would think the intent is
 
00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
that someone who can't safely blow less
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
than 0.2 or 0.25
 
00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
not be driving
 
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
and so the point is to have the ignition
 
00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
interlock device installed so that that
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
person can't drive
 
00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not they they can manage the
 
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
technicality of doing it once
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't exempt them from you know not
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
wanting to have
 
00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
you know a car they can drive without
 
00:59:58.470 --> 00:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
showing that they're not drunk
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
may i mr chairman this isn't about uh
 
01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
it's been a little misunderstanding here
 
01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
this isn't about whether or not this
 
01:00:04.079 --> 01:00:05.349 align:start position:0%
this isn't about whether or not this
individual

01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
um passes
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh meaning whether or not their car is
 
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
going to start or not this is simply
 
01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:12.549 align:start position:0%
going to start or not this is simply
about

01:00:12.549 --> 01:00:12.559 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
um instructing the individual
 
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
i mean hopefully they're going to show
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
up and they haven't been drinking
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
this is about the individual having
 
01:00:23.589 --> 01:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
three successful tests of they can do it
 
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's a device that has a
 
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
little tube that you blow into
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
um and it's it can get a little bit of
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
it's it's not rocket science it's very
 
01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
simple you blow into it but it's
 
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
obviously different for those who have
 
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
never done it before
 
01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
um so they just blow into it and the the
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
the guts of the device has to determine
 
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
um the breath sample about whether or
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
not there's any alcohol detected or not
 
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
so this is not about determining if the
 
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
car is going to start and this is about
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
whether like training the person this is
 
01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
what you do this is how it's done yeah
 
01:00:59.670 --> 01:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
if i could um
 
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
so it seems like the issue would be on
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
the language where it says no interlock
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
service provider shall install a device
 
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
in a vehicle of a user who is unable to
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
pass the breath test but i mean at that
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
point if they're there and they're
 
01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
getting it installed and they can't pass
 
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
the breath test i mean they can't drive
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not really sure and i don't know
 
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
anything about the legislative intent i
 
01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
haven't been involved you know in those
 
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
bills but it would seem to be that you
 
01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
know like mike said part of the intent
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
would not be for this person to be able
 
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
yeah this is apprentice
 
01:01:43.109 --> 01:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
you gotta use your mic
 
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative switch so
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
they show up
 
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
they can't pass this test so the device
 
01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
can't be
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
placed in the vehicle so what happens at
 
01:01:59.589 --> 01:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
that moment is law enforcement called do
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
they drive away
 
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
like what do we do because i think the
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
point is to have
 
01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
in the best case scenario them show up
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
taking this seriously um passing this
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
test putting this device in and then
 
01:02:12.069 --> 01:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
following along the law so that they're
 
01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
not driving well intoxicated but if they
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
can't get past that point what do we do
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
because that seems to be the issue
 
01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:18.829 align:start position:0%
because that seems to be the issue
all

01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:18.839 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
right what do we do okay so i'm first of
 
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
all um the department may have a
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
different answer than me but i am not
 
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
aware of anybody that's that's not able
 
01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:31.839 align:start position:0%
to to use a device this is um this is a
 
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
very simple simple thing where you just
 
01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
blow into a tube
 
01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
so so if my my our whole concern is is
 
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
the potential savvy person
 
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
who purposely does not want to pass
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
this test who doesn't want this device
 
01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
on their vehicle
 
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
that's the the issue that's created
 
01:02:54.789 --> 01:02:54.799 align:start position:0%
beyond the legislative intent so to
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
answer your credit what what happens
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
currently right now my understanding is
 
01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
that these people are instructed on on
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
how to use the device
 
01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:04.549 align:start position:0%
how to use the device
and

01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
i have not heard of anybody that has not
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
been able to to perform this simple
 
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
breath test
 
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay department
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
yeah department thank you
 
01:03:25.109 --> 01:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to take it in exact order
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
so i think i'm going to try to respond
 
01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
in total here but 265 a
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
36 1 was cited but the second part of
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
that paragraph also says that a
 
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
certificate proving installation of the
 
01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:47.750 align:start position:0%
certificate proving installation of the
device

01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
device
 
01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
shall be provided to the dmv as a
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
conditioned precedent to reinstatement
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
of the individual's license to drive so
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't even be driving
 
01:04:00.549 --> 01:04:00.559 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have their theirs
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
their suspension lifted in order to
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
drive until we got that certificate of
 
01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:07.270 align:start position:0%
drive until we got that certificate of
installation

01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
installation
 
01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:11.670 align:start position:0%
um so
so

01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
they have to have it on their car
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise they it the car can't operate
 
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
and they can't drive that's the idea it
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
has to be foolproof
 
01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
that i mean i get it that they they have
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
to be instructed it's a simple procedure
 
01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:30.799 align:start position:0%
i've had it explained several times uh
 
01:04:30.799 --> 01:04:31.670 align:start position:0%
i've had it explained several times uh
and

01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
it's a simple procedure and the device
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
is on there car can't be driven without
 
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
and without the device having given the
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
the go sign it this is this i mean
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
people could be using someone else's
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle whatever car that they regularly
 
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
would use is the vehicle that has to
 
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
01:04:57.599 --> 01:04:59.829 align:start position:0%
in addition
um

01:04:59.829 --> 01:04:59.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
what we i think the dmv would say is
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
that there have been instances in which
 
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
individuals might say that they were not
 
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
instructed properly on how to use a
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
device and that's why there's a failure
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
of sorts when they're brought in because
 
01:05:15.359 --> 01:05:16.309 align:start position:0%
of sorts when they're brought in because
once

01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
once
 
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
once that device is put in if they
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
somehow fail they are rung up
 
01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
and so that is to to ensure that the
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
individual knows how to and we know that
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
they know how because they've had three
 
01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.270 align:start position:0%
they know how because they've had three
past

01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
past
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
breath tests
 
01:05:34.799 --> 01:05:35.829 align:start position:0%
breath tests
right

01:05:35.829 --> 01:05:35.839 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
it's not only the case as i understand
 
01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
it that they get rung up as you say but
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
the vehicle won't operate you cannot
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
drive the vehicle it you won't start
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
correct at 0.020
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:51.670 align:start position:0%
mr chair
tim

01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
tim
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
thank you so i i think it's pretty clear
 
01:05:55.589 --> 01:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
you got to get the device installed
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
first before you get your suspension
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
lifted then you get suspension lifted
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
then you have to use the device on the
 
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
drive every single time i don't have an
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
issue with that process it seems to work
 
01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
clear my issue is the 0.20
 
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
because the statute
 
01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
specifically says 2-5
 
01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
is where penalties start occurring and
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
so yet to represent a mcguire's statute
 
01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
we're imposing a penalty at a lower rate
 
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
by saying you can't drive your car
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
at 200 which isn't what the statute says
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm that's my only concern is the set
 
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
point of the alcohol content at 2 2 0
 
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
which is below the statutory as i look
 
01:06:36.069 --> 01:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
at 265 a 37 it talks about penalties and
 
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
it talks about concentration points of
 
01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.829 align:start position:0%
it talks about concentration points of
0.25

01:06:38.829 --> 01:06:38.839 align:start position:0%
0.25
 
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
025025025 throughout the entire thing
 
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
and yet somehow now we've set a new
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
standard of 0.20 and said you can't
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
drive at 0.20
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
so and somehow the agency thinks it has
 
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
the authority to do that
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
so the
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
violation set point is when somebody is
 
01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
rung up in terms of a a bringing being
 
01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
brought in for a hearing having an
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
extension of the
 
01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
order itself
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
0.020 is the alcohol set point that when
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
the device reads that 0.020
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
the vehicle won't start it's in the the
 
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
person will not be
 
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
considered having violated it's just a
 
01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.270 align:start position:0%
considered having violated it's just a
a

01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
preventing the car from starting until
 
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
the alcohol level is lower
 
01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
that is the model recommendations from
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
the feds it is the industry standard
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
that was um that we've been advised by
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
the other vendors as well um what what
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
265 a 37 talks about is the violation
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
set point
 
01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
senator gray
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
i agree with the the people who are
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we need to go back and
 
01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
have a legislative solution to the
 
01:08:05.589 --> 01:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
0.020 and 025
 
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
right now i don't believe that
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
you know supports what you're doing
 
01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh taking away the the access to the
 
01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
vehicle at that point
 
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
and i'll be voting
 
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh that way
 
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
unless the
 
01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:36.829 align:start position:0%
unless the
provisions

01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
is it not true that
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
the person is under suspension
 
01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
and is not supposed to drive their
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle until the device is installed
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
therefore the
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
the point up to the level of a violation
 
01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
they the only penalty is that they
 
01:09:03.669 --> 01:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
cannot drive and they're under
 
01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
i think what you're asking is unless
 
01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:12.070 align:start position:0%
i think what you're asking is unless
they

01:09:12.070 --> 01:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
have the device installed
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
they would their license would be
 
01:09:16.799 --> 01:09:18.149 align:start position:0%
they would their license would be
suspended

01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
suspended
 
01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
and once they have the the dmv has the
 
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
certificate of installation of that
 
01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:24.229 align:start position:0%
certificate of installation of that
device

01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
device
 
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
they would be able to operate as long as
 
01:09:38.309 --> 01:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
mr j again just just to
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
clarify if if i heard that right was
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
again their license once they've gotten
 
01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
the device installed in their car their
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
license status is no longer suspended or
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
revoked their license status is valid at
 
01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
that point the only condition and term
 
01:09:55.510 --> 01:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
is that they have to breathe into the
 
01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
breathalyzer before the car will start
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
is that accurate
 
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
they have to comply with the program
 
01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
which is have an interlock device
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
installed and then before prior to
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
starting the car blowing to the breath
 
01:10:09.189 --> 01:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
too to make sure
 
01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
so just as a background i'm a former
 
01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
police officer probably the only person
 
01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
here was certified as a breathalyzer
 
01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
operator so i understand the process and
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
understand the interlock system but
 
01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
again my concern to it senator gray is
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
that the department's setting a standard
 
01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:24.790 align:start position:0%
that the department's setting a standard
that's

01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
i'll say greater than what's allowed by
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
statute in other words they're they're
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
adding conditions that aren't allowed as
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
far as i can see by statute anywhere
 
01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:34.709 align:start position:0%
far as i can see by statute anywhere
um

01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to create a program and i
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
understand your difference is that you
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
don't think that not starting the car is
 
01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
a penalty but i would say that starting
 
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
the car is not being able to get to
 
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
where you need to go would be a penalty
 
01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
or or a problem for a citizen and where
 
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
the state's imposing that problem
 
01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
and and because of a standard that isn't
 
01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
set in statute so so if i could respond
 
01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
the the department is is provided the
 
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority to approve the
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
ignition interlock devices and we've
 
01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
incorporated by reference the federal
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
register standard
 
01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
for the model specifications for these
 
01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
devices which has an alcohol set point
 
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
this was also i believe the
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations of
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
some of the public comments that we
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
so the conflict is between the federal
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
register and new hampshire law well i
 
01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:36.709 align:start position:0%
register and new hampshire law well i
don't

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:11:36.719 --> 01:11:37.750 align:start position:0%
don't
i

01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
i respectfully disagree in the sense
 
01:11:42.610 --> 01:11:42.620 align:start position:0%
that the violation
 
01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:44.630 align:start position:0%
that the violation
[Music]

01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that the device just says okay
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
you're you're pretty close to to being
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
rung up
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
um with a violation which could extend
 
01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
or suspend your driver's license
 
01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
depending on how many violations you may
 
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
have had in any period of time
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
and it it's just going to delay your
 
01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.590 align:start position:0%
and it it's just going to delay your
movement

01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
movement
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
until your alcohol
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
while while a .025
 
01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
is you're going to be found in violation
 
01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
mr chair just what what are our options
 
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
there is a conditional approval uh
 
01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.510 align:start position:0%
there is a conditional approval uh
request

01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
that has been submitted so
 
01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
basically the committee could
 
01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
approve the final proposal approve the
 
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
conditional approval or preliminarily
 
01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:47.910 align:start position:0%
conditional approval or preliminarily
object

01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
and there would need to be a basis for
 
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
the objections such as legislative
 
01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:53.270 align:start position:0%
the objections such as legislative
intent

01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
intent
 
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
you could also postpone and um
 
01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
the committee or i'm sorry the
 
01:12:59.189 --> 01:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
department could come back with a
 
01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
amended conditional approval
 
01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
yeah they could come back with amended
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
conditional approval um just to go back
 
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
to 265 a37
 
01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:10.229 align:start position:0%
to 265 a37
um

01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
roman 3a i mean this statute i did not
 
01:13:16.149 --> 01:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
find any place that said exactly what
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
the device has to be set at and the
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
statute does state that upon
 
01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
satisfactory proof that a person who is
 
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
restricted by law to drive
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
only a motor vehicle equipped with an
 
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
ignition interlock device has attempted
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
to start a motor vehicle equipped with
 
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
the device while having an alcohol
