person we like to speak to is U fire
Master

00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:43.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:45.720 align:start position:0%

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh review House Bill 432 relative
 
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
recovery houses good morning yeah uh
 
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
Sean Tumi State Fire Marsh for the
 
00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
record uh yes sir I have taken a look at
 
00:08:59.590 --> 00:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
it um we this is a bill it's very
 
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
similar to was introduced last year and
 
00:09:04.829 --> 00:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
my office was uh involved in the the
 
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:06.760 align:start position:0%
definition part of it we were not
 
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
involved in the Planning and Zoning
 
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
discussion because we feel like that's
 
00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:12.519 align:start position:0%
not our really Arena to be in but as far
 
00:09:14.949 --> 00:09:14.959 align:start position:0%
as the definition itself uh we worked
 
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
with several stakeholders to try to
 
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
refine the definition a little bit um
 
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
one of the big things was that crossed
 
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
out was that safe healthy family Lake uh
 
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
was being crossed out and one of the the
 
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
conversation was uh sort of how do you
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
define safe health healthy and family
 
00:09:32.829 --> 00:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
like family like's not defined that well
 
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
in the codes um and then safe and
 
00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
healthy was a little bit difficult what
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
we're relying on is uh in further in
 
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
15310 D in the fire code side we have
 
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
about a dozen items that are required in
 
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
order to meet the requirement for
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
exemption it talks about egress for
 
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
instance um a fire alarm system for
 
00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
places over eight eight people um it
 
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
talks about smoke alarms and carbon
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
monoxide alarms and heating systems at
 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
work and those types of things and I
 
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
think inherently when you follow those
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
requirements uh and uh are are certified
 
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
by one of the certifying groups that
 
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
that safe and healthiness kind of comes
 
00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:15.519 align:start position:0%
with that uh for a well-run house so uh
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
we were amenable to to removing that as
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
long as they followed the rest of the
 
00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:22.959 align:start position:0%
process in that um uh definition the
 
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
other big adding the primarily
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
non-transit dwelling unit um we wanted
 
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
to recognize that the people that are
 
00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
living in a recovering house from our
 
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
perspective are there for a period of
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
time usually these guys behind me I
 
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
think could speak far better to it but
 
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:41.240 align:start position:0%
you know a year a year and a half is is
 
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:43.240 align:start position:0%
pretty customary I believe for someone
 
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
that's living in a home it's not a
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
typical like a motel hotel type
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
situation where you're in and out in a
 
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
day or a couple of days so that people
 
00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:52.959 align:start position:0%
have a general familiarity with the
 
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
house and and uh you know the
 
00:10:57.389 --> 00:10:57.399 align:start position:0%
whereabouts of of egress and and things
 
00:11:01.069 --> 00:11:01.079 align:start position:0%
like that so um the the last part of it
 
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:03.160 align:start position:0%
uh living as a single household we
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to recognize that uh there's a
 
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
unit cohesiveness to these uh people
 
00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
living and Recovery which is part of
 
00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:12.680 align:start position:0%
their success in in in the the path for
 
00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
recovery so um you know we again getting
 
00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:17.959 align:start position:0%
away from the family like because we
 
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
can't really Define real well what a
 
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
family like is but if you live as a
 
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
single household and have the general
 
00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
whereabouts I've used an example um
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
actually uh Jonathan's behind me but one
 
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
his place is a three family in
 
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
Manchester and and I went in there
 
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
several years ago and said to one of the
 
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
residents on the first floor Hey where's
 
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
so and so on the third floor and they
 
00:11:38.629 --> 00:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
could tell me that exactly they were
 
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
working at um you know the restaurant
 
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
Dunkin' Donuts or Market Basket down the
 
00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:44.959 align:start position:0%
street I can't remember the exact
 
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
specifics but you know they they knew
 
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
where everyone was and there when they
 
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
were coming and going and that's uh
 
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
that's important to this the the last
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
part of it and the definition cleanup is
 
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
we don't wanted a boarding house or
 
00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:57.160 align:start position:0%
rooming house cuz those are more of
 
00:11:59.389 --> 00:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
renting a specific room and you don't
 
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily know about the whereabouts
 
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
you you you have your your own room is
 
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
locked and it's a very different field
 
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
versus the the folks that are living in
 
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:08.440 align:start position:0%
recovery and in need that uh
 
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
cohesiveness and and kind of living
 
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
together to to be successful so happy to
 
00:12:15.949 --> 00:12:15.959 align:start position:0%
um try to uh answer any questions but I
 
00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
think the big message is that our office
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
has been involved in the the defin
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
definition change uh for the past year
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
plus and uh you know we're we're
 
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
supportive of of the definition change
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
as it as it's presented thank you
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you sir uh any questions from the
 
00:12:36.269 --> 00:12:36.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
Frack thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:44.269 align:start position:0%
Frack thank you thank you for taking my
question

00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:47.069 --> 00:12:47.079 align:start position:0%
um what
 
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
requirements or let me rephrase
 
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
that in other congregant living
 
00:12:59.590 --> 00:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
situation such as a group home for
 
00:13:02.189 --> 00:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled
 
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
people um transitional housing perhaps
 
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
for people coming out of the criminal
 
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.230 align:start position:0%
for people coming out of the criminal
justice

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:11.240 align:start position:0%
justice
 
00:13:13.189 --> 00:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
system are
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
the Life Safety Code requirements or
 
00:13:22.949 --> 00:13:22.959 align:start position:0%
exemptions similar or different for what
 
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here for the
 
00:13:26.509 --> 00:13:26.519 align:start position:0%
recovery house thank you for the
 
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
question so that there's no exemptions
 
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
for those other uses at this point uh
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we big so we've
 
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
been working on this with the recovery
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
Community since I know I've been since
 
00:13:39.949 --> 00:13:39.959 align:start position:0%
about 2018 and one of the things that we
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
learned early on is that um through
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
federal regulations that um they're uh
 
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
classified that they need an
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
accommodation um and they need um so the
 
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:53.240 align:start position:0%
the big thing for this is the sprinkler
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
system so
 
00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
the the the I'm going to say family like
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
even though we just crossed out but
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
living as a single household which is
 
00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:02.959 align:start position:0%
the language that we've added in now is
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
that the people in recovery have to live
 
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959 align:start position:0%
as a single household to be uh to be
 
00:14:11.069 --> 00:14:11.079 align:start position:0%
successful uh have this needs to be a
 
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
social certain social model to make this
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
work and go back to some of these other
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
congregate living scenarios like the
 
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
halfway houses or the transitional
 
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
housing or uh some of these other group
 
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:23.560 align:start position:0%
homes they're they're more in and out
 
00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
and there's more of an individual
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
component to it um that is uh what is
 
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
has always been portrayed and and
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
understood uh as a little bit different
 
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
than these recovery houses and they
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
didn't fit quite as nicely into our code
 
00:14:39.069 --> 00:14:39.079 align:start position:0%
chapters and that's why we did this
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
carvo um and there's been some federal
 
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
um core cases that have kind of shown
 
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
that uh people in recovery uh need to be
 
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
treated a little bit differently uh in
 
00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:55.160 align:start position:0%
this case I think going back to um the
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
code change I think is that most of
 
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
these houses that if they're you know we
 
00:15:01.949 --> 00:15:01.959 align:start position:0%
need to inspect them because every house
 
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
is a little different but if we can meet
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
the existing chapters which typically
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
we're talking sprinklers here in almost
 
00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:09.710 align:start position:0%
we're talking sprinklers here in almost
all

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:12.279 align:start position:0%
cases most existing buildings don't
 
00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
require sprinkler systems and I I think
 
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
the the big issue is these are these are
 
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
sort of change of uses change of
 
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
occupancy in our code world and um you
 
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
know we're we're really letting them not
 
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
sprinkle the building but they're saying
 
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
that where the fallback for us and the
 
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
and I think in the cold world is that
 
00:15:32.189 --> 00:15:32.199 align:start position:0%
they're living under that single
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
household model that they're
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
representing or resembling like what
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
would be in our own homes you know I
 
00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
think some of our what I've seen is
 
00:15:41.949 --> 00:15:41.959 align:start position:0%
people living in these big houses that
 
00:15:44.189 --> 00:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
might have you know six bedrooms and you
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
put in 12 people in the house two beds
 
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
in a in a house and uh it's it's it's a
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
little bit different than some of those
 
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:53.720 align:start position:0%
other occupancies that you spoke about
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
um and I think that some of the other
 
00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
you got to be very careful about the
 
00:16:00.509 --> 00:16:00.519 align:start position:0%
disabilities I think but but
 
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
um as uh some of these congregate living
 
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
situations exist that have like physical
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities or cognitive disabilities
 
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
that need that higher level of
 
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
protection because of trying to help
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
upset the ability to get out physically
 
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
or something if there people are stuck
 
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
in the facility you're going to want
 
00:16:22.309 --> 00:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
some of these other systems or different
 
00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
Staffing models to make sure those
 
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
people can get out safely and and folks
 
00:16:28.269 --> 00:16:28.279 align:start position:0%
that are in recovery are able-bodied
 
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
like we are and uh you know they're just
 
00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
they're in recovery and they they can
 
00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
get out and respond appropriately to a
 
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
smoke alarm and get out a window or find
 
00:16:38.189 --> 00:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
another exit as needed so hope that
 
00:16:39.389 --> 00:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
answers your question I know it was a
 
00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
little bit lengthy it does thank you
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
response represent
 
00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
Dolan thank you um
 
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you for uh taking my question
 
00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh one of a couple of the concerns that
 
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
I have uh if we're not going to require
 
00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:01.829 align:start position:0%
I have uh if we're not going to require
smoke

00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
smoke
 
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
alarms uh or at least we're not going to
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
require them to be checked it it says in
 
00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:08.789 align:start position:0%
require them to be checked it it says in
the

00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
legislature uh in the uh legislation
 
00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:14.919 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to be required to
 
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
uh to look at a permit or an approval
 
00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
process uh so evidently we won't be able
 
00:17:24.429 --> 00:17:24.439 align:start position:0%
to check for the presence of smoke
 
00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:27.959 align:start position:0%
alarms or exit signs for example of
 
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
someone needs uh a method of erress but
 
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
it's if it's at night and there's not
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
going to be an exit sign for them to be
 
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
able to find their way out at night um
 
00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:43.480 align:start position:0%
and uh so the question I have is uh what
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
do what can we do to
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
protect in the inhabitants of a of a
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh a house like this a recovery house
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
like this not only for the inhabitants
 
00:17:59.710 --> 00:17:59.720 align:start position:0%
but for the Neighbors I mean in many
 
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
cases these houses uh large houses are
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
adjacent to other structures in the
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
community that if there's a fire or a
 
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
disturbance or whatever it's going to
 
00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:16.039 align:start position:0%
bleed over it could very very well bleed
 
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
over into the adjacent structures what
 
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
do we do to protect both the inhabitants
 
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:23.320 align:start position:0%
of the recovery house and the Neighbors
 
00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
in the community thank you yeah so I
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:18:31.029 --> 00:18:31.039 align:start position:0%
um I think we're maybe mixing the two
 
00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
sections a little bit um because the way
 
00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
I understand this bill is is written
 
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
there's uh left less of an emphasis on
 
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
planning and and uh zoning approvals and
 
00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
site plan approvals which is takes a
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
more of a hands-off approach as you um
 
00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
talked about on the Planning and Zoning
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
sides on the fire code and the building
 
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
code sides and especially on the fire
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
code because it speaks to the chapter
 
00:18:58.909 --> 00:18:58.919 align:start position:0%
153 which is a state fire code um and I
 
00:19:00.669 --> 00:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
think the the recovery community that
 
00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
are here behind me can speak to this but
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
I there's no intent to push the fire
 
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
departments out the the the statute the
 
00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:10.919 align:start position:0%
the further statute 15310 D actually
 
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
allows the fire departments to do annual
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
inspections of these facilities which is
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
which is above and beyond which would be
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
we would normally see in another type of
 
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
building so I I think you know the we as
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
we worked with the recovery community
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
over the past six seven years to address
 
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
this um you know they they've understood
 
00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
and been uh working with the the fire
 
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
departments to allow the annual
 
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
inspections which is you know very
 
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
different than a typical say apartment
 
00:19:37.149 --> 00:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
building right if you have an apartment
 
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
building I'm going to use Manchester or
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
Nashville say that was historically a
 
00:19:45.149 --> 00:19:45.159 align:start position:0%
three or four a two or three family uh
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
structure that had separate dwelling
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
separate uh homes and now we've got a a
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
Recovery House in there that have
 
00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
multiple people in there that house is
 
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
actually being inspected now under 153t
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
10d by the fire department to make sure
 
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
that the fire alarms are working the
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
smoke alarms are working the egress is
 
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
still there the heating systems are
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
still operating the way they're supposed
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
to and things like that so I think in
 
00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:10.919 align:start position:0%
under 153 we have a a lot of uh ability
 
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
to get in on annual basis and work with
 
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
the recovery house that's the operator
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
and make sure that the the facilities
 
00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:20.360 align:start position:0%
are safe thank you as a as a followup um
 
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
as a a professional and in your uh
 
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
discipline when you're when you
 
00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:29.720 align:start position:0%
encounter a a proposal for a recovery
 
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:33.400 align:start position:0%
house like this uh do you maybe you
 
00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:35.480 align:start position:0%
could walk through the type of
 
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
inspection that you do from a fire
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
safety uh do you you permit smoking
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the in the facility do you
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
require fire
 
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
extenders so many per occupant that type
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
of thing could you walk us through that
 
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
sure yeah so each of the recovery houses
 
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:54.200 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to try to pull it up
 
00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:55.720 align:start position:0%
because I don't remember all the points
 
00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
in detail but uh each recovery house
 
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
that's in operation in the State uh over
 
00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
um usually it's over four people but
 
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
they would come and request a a variance
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
to the fire code from the from our
 
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
office uh and one of the inspectors of
 
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
my office physically goes out and meets
 
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
with each of the operators and walks
 
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
through the facility and does an
 
00:21:19.269 --> 00:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
inspection to make sure that uh as you
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
said the smoke alarms are good
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
extinguishers are good and make sure
 
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
this contact information available to
 
00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:26.440 align:start position:0%
reach an owner the street numbers are in
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
place so they can see you know the fire
 
00:21:30.269 --> 00:21:30.279 align:start position:0%
department or EMS is responding conf
 
00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
find the or police if they have to
 
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
confine the location of the property
 
00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:35.919 align:start position:0%
make sure the heating systems uh
 
00:21:38.029 --> 00:21:38.039 align:start position:0%
inspected annually that the cooking
 
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
equipment is in in good shape um I'm
 
00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:43.799 align:start position:0%
trying to there's no smoking provision
 
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
in the building you have to smoke a
 
00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
certain distance away I believe it's 10
 
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
ft please don't quote me exactly on that
 
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
it's in the Statue but there's um we go
 
00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
through that whole inspection uh we work
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
with the certifying body to make sure
 
00:21:58.029 --> 00:21:58.039 align:start position:0%
that there's a certification there's a
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
little Nuance to that that it usually
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
takes a few for a new upcoming house
 
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of time to get that
 
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
certification in place so we give them
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
usually 6 months to um get the
 
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
certification which is an additional
 
00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
followup to make sure that the recovery
 
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
Community the house is running the way
 
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
that the certification require which is
 
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
above and beyond what we require on the
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
fire code um so there's a checks and
 
00:22:21.029 --> 00:22:21.039 align:start position:0%
balances there we want to see that
 
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
paperwork submitted to our office and
 
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
then that annual inspection process
 
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
happens so um any recovery house that's
 
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:32.360 align:start position:0%
uh operating I would say legitimately
 
00:22:35.909 --> 00:22:35.919 align:start position:0%
and and upfront uh which is um a good
 
00:22:38.269 --> 00:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
number of them comes through our office
 
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
and we actually physically walk through
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
with the local fire department each and
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
open any other questions yes represent
 
00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:53.799 align:start position:0%
Walker is the G current code for multif
 
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
family homes to have
 
00:22:59.310 --> 00:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
sprinklers so new if a new building yes
 
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
right old one an older not likely unless
 
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
there's some reason for it um existing
 
00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
buildings and existing Apartments um it
 
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
depends there's a size component to this
 
00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:13.640 align:start position:0%
and it's not as as real simple yes or no
 
00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
but most existing say apartment
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
buildings do not require a sprinkler
 
00:23:21.789 --> 00:23:21.799 align:start position:0%
system um over if it's a high-rise
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
situation then you're in a sprinkler
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
system scenario but uh most existing are
 
00:23:30.269 --> 00:23:30.279 align:start position:0%
not required to have them the caveat
 
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
that we see a lot of times is if they're
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
using them for a trade-off for something
 
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
else there's an egress problem or
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
something like that they they'll put
 
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
them in after the fact all new
 
00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
construction over a one and two family
 
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:43.480 align:start position:0%
dwelling uh has been required to have
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
sprinklers for quite sometime cuz if you
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
if a Recovery House moves into a multi
 
00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
family dwelling they're all quadrant off
 
00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
that there's no connection so they're
 
00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
not like they're like you mentioned a
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
six-bedroom house that a family used to
 
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
live in that could all congregate you
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
can keep track of each other these are
 
00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
going to be separate units with separate
 
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
locks and all that how does that
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
pertained for safety codes wouldn't you
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
want smoke detectors and Sprinklers and
 
00:24:14.669 --> 00:24:14.679 align:start position:0%
all that stuff in there just for that I
 
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
I person I would love sprinklers
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
everywhere I sprinkled my own own house
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
but I recognize that's not a fit for
 
00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
everybody um you know uh I know so
 
00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:29.320 align:start position:0%
uh my wife in front of me because we
 
00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:31.039 align:start position:0%
have duplicate smoke alarm systems in
 
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
our house but anyways that's a different
 
00:24:37.149 --> 00:24:37.159 align:start position:0%
story too but uh you know I I think that
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh at the end of the day as long as we
 
00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:42.200 align:start position:0%
have working smoke and carbon monoxides
 
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:44.799 align:start position:0%
alarms in in what we're you know single
 
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:47.240 align:start position:0%
family single unit dwellings and good uh
 
00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
means of Escape or egress that's the
 
00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:51.320 align:start position:0%
important part right early detection and
 
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
warning and getting people out a
 
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
sprinkler system uh for these existing
 
00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
structures is icing on the cake uh and I
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
think is suitable for you know when
 
00:25:03.149 --> 00:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
there's a Nuance that we need to address
 
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
some uniqueness to it um you
 
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
know it's hard to say like I said I'd
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
like them everywhere but there's the
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
code has allowed non-s sprinkled
 
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
structures existing structures uh for
 
00:25:18.269 --> 00:25:18.279 align:start position:0%
for a very long time it's very hard to
 
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
retrofit it's harder to retrofit some of
 
00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
these buildings than
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh versus new construction so um I I
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
feel like I'm dancing around this a
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
little bit but um you know I I would
 
00:25:33.789 --> 00:25:33.799 align:start position:0%
love sprinkles everywhere but I guess I
 
00:25:36.029 --> 00:25:36.039 align:start position:0%
the true is there's there's there's
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
safety in buildings that are existing
 
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
that that are non-s sprinkle there's
 
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
there's new construction that's
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
different uses that are non-s sprinkle
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
based on size and construction type and
 
00:25:48.029 --> 00:25:48.039 align:start position:0%
a number of factors so we can have a
 
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
safe building being non-s sprinkled um
 
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
you know but I think that you there's
 
00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
there's different requirements that you
 
00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
can intermingle into that uh
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
equation I guess to make sure that you
 
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:02.440 align:start position:0%
have a safe structure right
 
00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
so uses over eight people we put our
 
00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
alarm a residential alarm system which
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
is a little bit more of belt and
 
00:26:11.389 --> 00:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
suspenders than our regular smoke or
 
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
carbon monoxide alarms that I hope that
 
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
we would have in our own homes um
 
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:17.240 align:start position:0%
recognizing that people take smoke
 
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
alarms down well if you have a monitored
 
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
system because you have 8 10 12 people
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
in a house well if one of those comes
 
00:26:25.149 --> 00:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
down someone's going to know about the
 
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
owner the operator the structure is
 
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
going to get notified by that alarm
 
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:28.789 align:start position:0%
going to get notified by that alarm
company

00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
company
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
and that alarm is going to go off so we
 
00:26:32.389 --> 00:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
you know we've worked to try to add a
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
little bit more um to that I'll go back
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
to a quick question you had about like
 
00:26:38.909 --> 00:26:38.919 align:start position:0%
the multistory use a three-story
 
00:26:40.909 --> 00:26:40.919 align:start position:0%
structure some of the three story
 
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
structures they run as sort of three
 
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:46.360 align:start position:0%
separate units almost like there's three
 
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
three separate entities and the you know
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
it's locked like it's it's still runs
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
sort of an apartment but there's more
 
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
people there might be six or eight
 
00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:55.640 align:start position:0%
people in that floor based on the floor
 
00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
space which is more than what we would
 
00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
normally be accustomed to but there are
 
00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
some structures that that whole three
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
Decker runs as one house and there's no
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
locks anywhere in the space the bedrooms
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
aren't locked the uh the doors between
 
00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:11.720 align:start position:0%
the units aren't locked and it's a free
 
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:14.200 align:start position:0%
flow where the first floor living room
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
might be uh the living room where they
 
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
sit and watch TV the second floor one
 
00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
might have been turned into a space
 
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
where they can meditate or do yoga or do
 
00:27:24.029 --> 00:27:24.039 align:start position:0%
something like that and the third floor
 
00:27:25.389 --> 00:27:25.399 align:start position:0%
might be used for something a little
 
00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
different the living room space so um
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
you know there's there's different
 
00:27:30.909 --> 00:27:30.919 align:start position:0%
scenarios out there and I think that's
 
00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:32.559 align:start position:0%
the importance of us getting out in
 
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
every one of them to understand the
 
00:27:36.669 --> 00:27:36.679 align:start position:0%
situation when before they operate and
 
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
do these inspections and then understand
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
what they're doing and and to make sure
 
00:27:42.669 --> 00:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
that we have a facility that complies
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
with the the statute in the uh in in the
 
00:27:47.789 --> 00:27:47.799 align:start position:0%
rules that we have in
 
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
place thank
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
you go ahead repr
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
Bron hey so I know that you mentioned
 
00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
that um certification before um and you
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
said usually you like to see in about 6
 
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
months in the in what we have in front
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
of us it is a year do you think like in
 
00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
your opinion would we be able to bring
 
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
that back to 6 months would a year be a
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
little bit kind of too much
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:18.039 align:start position:0%
to I think the uh I want to go back so
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
we just had a transition a little bit in
 
00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
some of the the New Hampshire cor's role
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
and then the New Hampshire partnership
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
for Recovery residences role recently in
 
00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
the last I think within the last six or
 
00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
eight months or so
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
um and we're trying to navigate the time
 
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
I think some of the timelines on that
 
00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:39.320 align:start position:0%
and and maybe someone behind me might be
 
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
better able to answer it um if it just
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
thinking out loud if it took a year to
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
make that happen now we still should be
 
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
in there before it operates and the fire
 
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
departments have the year to get in
 
00:28:54.029 --> 00:28:54.039 align:start position:0%
there and do an inspection so um I think
 
00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:56.200 align:start position:0%
the end goal still is important to get
 
00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
the certification for the the operation
 
00:29:01.509 --> 00:29:01.519 align:start position:0%
because it helps um provide better for
 
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
parameters on how it operates uh but I I
 
00:29:07.509 --> 00:29:07.519 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I guess I would be flexible I
 
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
guess is the best way to say it on on
 
00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
whether it's 6 months or a year as long
 
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
as we can maintain those other uh
 
00:29:15.389 --> 00:29:15.399 align:start position:0%
parameters in there I think
 
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
the I will say that I've been in a lot
 
00:29:21.149 --> 00:29:21.159 align:start position:0%
of these facilities the ones that are uh
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
well-run and uh follow these parameters
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
and are you know follow the
 
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
certification process are are great and
 
00:29:32.029 --> 00:29:32.039 align:start position:0%
then the ones that are the Bad actors
 
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
are the problem ones and I think the the
 
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
recovery community in general uh wants
 
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
to follow the good model is the ones
 
00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
that you know we is Bad actors in
 
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
everything we do sometimes but I think
 
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
the the end goal that I've seen over my
 
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
years in the fire Marshall's office is
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
that there's a a great emphasis within
 
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
the recovery Community to work to try to
 
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
get a a well-run model in there that's
 
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
um works for the recovery housing
 
00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
community and you know follow follows
 
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
you know as many of the guidelines as
 
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
possible um yeah thank you for that
 
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
response and thanks for taking another
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
question um with that certification if
 
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
they if uh one of these were to open up
 
00:30:17.509 --> 00:30:17.519 align:start position:0%
and not get it in that year do you think
 
00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
just based on the way this reads makes
 
00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
me nervous that they could just reapply
 
00:30:23.149 --> 00:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
and just kind of keep doing that same
 
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
process over and over again um I'm not
 
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
sure kind of what you think about that
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
yeah I think uh I I guess I concur with
 
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
you there's there's loopholes sometimes
 
00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
around stuff and I you don't want to if
 
00:30:38.669 --> 00:30:38.679 align:start position:0%
you can close up some of those loopholes
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
it's good I think there's also
 
00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity sometimes where things take
 
00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:44.519 align:start position:0%
a little bit longer than need they need
 
00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:46.919 align:start position:0%
to legitimately I think as long as we
 
00:30:48.509 --> 00:30:48.519 align:start position:0%
change something there's an an
 
00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity somewhere that they can um
 
00:30:53.509 --> 00:30:53.519 align:start position:0%
ask for extension I guess is and I don't
 
00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:56.039 align:start position:0%
know who that necessarily would be go to
 
00:30:58.629 --> 00:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
um but I think that
 
00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
um I think there's there's people that
 
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
try to do things right and stumble on a
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
roadblock and just need a little bit
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
more time and I think as long as we have
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
a mechanism to to work with th those
 
00:31:13.149 --> 00:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:16.269 --> 00:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
good any other questions I just have one
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
for you sir um how many recovery houses
 
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
do we have in New Hampshire do you know
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
that are checked by the fight how much
 
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh the number is probably a little bit
 
00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:26.200 align:start position:0%
lower than we would like and I think
 
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
part of it's I would say is around the
 
00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
Planning and Zoning stuff so I think
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
there's still some that are sort of
 
00:31:33.629 --> 00:31:33.639 align:start position:0%
underground as we call them because
 
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
they're afraid to come to to the surface
 
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
and get shut down by you know and put
 
00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:41.240 align:start position:0%
these people on the street um if I had
 
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
to take a wild guest we'd probably have
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
20 or 24 uh that I know we've we've been
 
00:31:48.629 --> 00:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
in and certify I can actually get you
 
00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
the the the exact list um there's more
 
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
than that in the state I do know that
 
00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
but we I just saw um the inspector from
 
00:31:59.509 --> 00:31:59.519 align:start position:0%
my office that is pretty much dedicated
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
to looking at these send me four of them
 
00:32:05.149 --> 00:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
yesterday to to approve um so we're you
 
00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:07.720 align:start position:0%
know we're working uh closely to keep
 
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
doing these approvals as well but this
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
Planning and Zoning thing is has been a
 
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
big challenge I know for the recovery
 
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
community that if they um come to the
 
00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
surface they end up getting closed
 
00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
closed down so they they try to stand
 
00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
under the radar and I think that's why
 
00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
we don't see as many as we we would like
 
00:32:24.559 --> 00:32:25.549 align:start position:0%
we don't see as many as we we would like
to

00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes thank you just one more quick
 
00:32:30.149 --> 00:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
question to uh get that inspection
 
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
presently they have to be certified to
 
00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.430 align:start position:0%
presently they have to be certified to
get

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:36.909 --> 00:32:36.919 align:start position:0%
that so we'll do the inspection without
 
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
the certification and give them time to
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.909 align:start position:0%
 
certification

00:32:44.909 --> 00:32:44.919 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
Dolan thank you um one additional
 
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
question uh recognizing that those in in
 
00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
one of these homes uh is in a category
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
I'll say one of the more vulnerable in
 
00:33:04.269 --> 00:33:04.279 align:start position:0%
our community that that needs our help
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh and needs us to look out for them in
 
00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
the when they're in this uh condition uh
 
00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:15.880 align:start position:0%
would you if if we pursued an amendment
 
00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:18.200 align:start position:0%
to this legislation that required
 
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
sprinklers would you be in support of
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
that as I mentioned before I would love
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
sprinklers everywhere um but I think it
 
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
would be a a big detriment to the
 
00:33:30.509 --> 00:33:30.519 align:start position:0%
operation of these structures overall I
 
00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:32.120 align:start position:0%
think you would find that most of them
 
00:33:34.509 --> 00:33:34.519 align:start position:0%
can't achieve that and we' we'd shut
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
down effectively shut down a significant
 
00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
number of the recovery houses if we put
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
that into place say it passed as of July
 
00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:43.960 align:start position:0%
1 or something like that we would see uh
 
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
it would it have a significant impact on
 
00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
the recovery Community is what I would
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
think um and I think there's there's
 
00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:51.519 align:start position:0%
facilities out there that are running

00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholders for several years on this
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
project of trying to clarify a path
 
00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
forward for Recovery Home housing in New
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire recovering H recovery housing
 
00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
have long had a stigma of being homes
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
for drug users this is factually UN true
 
00:35:00.589 --> 00:35:00.599 align:start position:0%
it is important for legislators and
 
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
citizens to understand the value of
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
recovery housing for the rehabilitation
 
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
of those who have completed a treatment
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
program this is the next important step
 
00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
to substance-free living in New
 
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire due to recovery houses being a
 
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
fairly New Concept in New Hampshire the
 
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
building and fire codes and land use
 
00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
laws did not recognize their use
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
barriers needed to be identified and
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
resolved through amendments amendments
 
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
to the building of fire codes to Define
 
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
recovery homes and include the use in
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
the codes was completed in the 2024
 
00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.510 align:start position:0%
the codes was completed in the 2024
legislative

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
session the Amendments made to codes and
 
00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:41.839 align:start position:0%
requested here in HB 432 help New
 
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Better align with federal law
 
00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
with regards to
 
00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities a key component of HB 432
 
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
is the requirement for certification
 
00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:54.599 align:start position:0%
through a recognized organization that
 
00:35:57.069 --> 00:35:57.079 align:start position:0%
has clear standards of operation
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
boarding a rooming houses have no
 
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
required certification and therefore do
 
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
not have the same standards of
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
operation the certification process for
 
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:09.400 align:start position:0%
Recovery homes bring a higher Comfort
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
level to code officials that the
 
00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
required standards are being regularly
 
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
monitored that is an important piece of
 
00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
recovery housing over again boarding
 
00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
houses or rooming
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
houses no certification a loss of the
 
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:25.599 align:start position:0%
certification brings much more stringent
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
building and fire code requirements into
 
00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:30.599 align:start position:0%
play Recovery homes do get some waivers
 
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
as you've heard from the Fire Marshall
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
as far as sprinkler systems if they are
 
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
not a certified home they lose that that
 
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
waiver and then they would they would
 
00:36:40.349 --> 00:36:40.359 align:start position:0%
now have to look at sprinkling that
 
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
building as a rooming or a boarding
 
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
house amending the land use law in HB
 
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
432 is the next step to addressing the
 
00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:51.400 align:start position:0%
barriers that prevent recovery houses
 
00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
that is necessary to helping curb the
 
00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:56.079 align:start position:0%
addiction problems in New Hampshire and
 
00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
with that I'll be glad to take any
 
00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
committee thank you any questions uh
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
represent Dolan thank you for taking my
 
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
question uh do you believe that these uh
 
00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:13.720 align:start position:0%
buildings and the use of these buildings
 
00:37:22.109 --> 00:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
Compliant if the if the federal
 
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines were to require that then yes
 
00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
um however under the homes having not a
 
00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
change of use not having alterations
 
00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
that exceed 50% of the florer of the
 
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
building um they wouldn't require Ada
 
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
upgrades if they did alterations to the
 
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
buildings um and again if they if if it
 
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
was classified as a change of use which
 
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
it isn't under the codes in this case
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
then the Ada M the Ada or accessibility
 
00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
under the building code would would um
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
apply but again under a one or two
 
00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:03.640 align:start position:0%
family dwelling that's still being
 
00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:05.839 align:start position:0%
utilized as a one two one or two family
 
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
dwelling access the accessibility in Ada
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
apply any other
 
00:38:17.309 --> 00:38:17.319 align:start position:0%
questions yes sir represent
 
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
walker uh my understanding of the the
 
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
exemptions that they're getting what
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
zoning and local exemptions do they have
 
00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
what particular codes do they going to
 
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
get exempt from or
 
00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
waved good question uh I can't speak to
 
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
the zoning um I I I don't I only dabble
 
00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:43.960 align:start position:0%
that in my profession um um but um as
 
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
far as the exemptions that they receive
 
00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:49.079 align:start position:0%
Mo most the the largest one is the um
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
sprinkler system that they can apply to
 
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
the State Fire Marshalls off office and
 
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
receive a waiver from sprinkler systems
 
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
which is a very costly um system to
 
00:38:59.430 --> 00:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
install in some areas almost almost
 
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
impossible when you think about some of
 
00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
the rural areas where some of these
 
00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
homes may be um the uh as far as zoning
 
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
exemptions that would be left up to the
 
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
individual communities um to DET
 
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
determine whether they can get an
 
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
exception through either a waiver
 
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
variance okay thank
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:56.309 --> 00:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:56.319 --> 00:40:26.309 align:start position:0%
 
morning

00:40:26.309 --> 00:40:26.319 align:start position:0%

e

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:26.230 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:56.230 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:39.200 align:start position:0%

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr chairman uh I
 
00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
have a couple of questions if you'll
 
00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
indulge me um do you would you agree
 
00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
that that there are in our population
 
00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:57.910 align:start position:0%
that that there are in our population
people

00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:43:01.549 --> 00:43:01.559 align:start position:0%
uh that need to be in a recovery house
 
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
disability thank you for the question
 
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan um I would agree
 
00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
with components of that statement U
 
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
there are obviously individuals in the
 
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
community that need support of uh living
 
00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
in a household unit perhaps of with
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
individuals that are having a similar
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
experience or dealing with similar
 
00:43:26.109 --> 00:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
challenges uh what I would perhaps add
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
as Nuance that statement is simply that
 
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
they living in that format or in that
 
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
household typology should not
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that
 
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
they perspective certainly the does
 
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
exist in the community thank you and uh
 
00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
how how do you
 
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
address those individuals that seek
 
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
recovery who can't use the
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
bathroom or who can't don't have access
 
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
in and out of the front door how how do
 
00:43:59.190 --> 00:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
you deal with that and and and that we
 
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
might find in in these
 
00:44:04.349 --> 00:44:04.359 align:start position:0%
cases thank you for representa and I
 
00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
don't know if I can speak to the details
 
00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:07.160 align:start position:0%
of the operations and I think that's
 
00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:09.160 align:start position:0%
what you're getting to as as a regulator
 
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:56.030 align:start position:0%
 
necessarily

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
representative uh thank you um looking
 
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
at the multif family structure part of
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
it I'm not sure how many of those that
 
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
you have in nasua um but could you speak
 
00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
to if you do have them um is there any
 
00:45:50.589 --> 00:45:50.599 align:start position:0%
data that it is effective for the people
 
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
living in these homes and kind of what
 
00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:55.400 align:start position:0%
the effect is on the community around
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
those it's a great question thank you
 
00:45:59.870 --> 00:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
representative for
 
00:46:02.109 --> 00:46:02.119 align:start position:0%
that obviously in the city of Nashville
 
00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
we allow recovery housing a variety form
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:55.829 align:start position:0%
 
single

00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:43.880 align:start position:0%
I just have a quick question you require
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
certification in ASA for Recovery
 
00:47:49.549 --> 00:47:49.559 align:start position:0%
House mdon we do not require
 
00:47:49.559 --> 00:47:52.549 align:start position:0%
House mdon we do not require
certification

00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
c one of the benefits of course sub
 
00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
certification is that it's a very
 
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
over and public uh representation that
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
that recovery home is operated in a
 
00:48:05.109 --> 00:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
manner that's consistent with best
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
practices and for Community interests
 
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
but we do not require certification uh
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
in fact it's those that do not require
 
00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:13.960 align:start position:0%
certification that have
 
00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
often so I can't speak enough to the to
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
the necessity of the certification
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
process but it's not
 
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
requir another quick question for you if
 
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
you do have issues with an non-certified
 
00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
Recovery House how do you enforce or
 
00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:30.200 align:start position:0%
what laws do you have regulations to
 
00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you any other
 
00:49:22.829 --> 00:49:22.839 align:start position:0%
questions rep Walker do you have any uh
 
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
police data on those 30 houses how many
 
00:49:27.789 --> 00:49:27.799 align:start position:0%
trips how many
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
that sort of
 
00:49:32.349 --> 00:49:32.359 align:start position:0%
thing I don't in front of me today I
 
00:49:34.109 --> 00:49:34.119 align:start position:0%
could certainly provide some of that
 
00:49:37.069 --> 00:49:37.079 align:start position:0%
information um anecdotally we've had we
 
00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
have had discussions though and we don't
 
00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
see increased frequency for for all of
 
00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:43.960 align:start position:0%
those homes we have had some problematic
 
00:49:46.349 --> 00:49:46.359 align:start position:0%
locations in the city uh but again no
 
00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
more than other households where we have
 
00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:49.640 align:start position:0%
regular disturbances but if that's
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
something the committee might be
 
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
interested certain that would be that
 
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
okay any other
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr s for coming in
 
00:50:11.069 --> 00:50:11.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:55.630 align:start position:0%
 
in

00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:55.640 --> 00:51:25.549 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:25.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:25.559 --> 00:51:55.510 align:start position:0%

00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%

00:52:50.829 --> 00:52:50.839 align:start position:0%
thank you our
 
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
questions represent Doan uh thank you Mr
 
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you for taking my
 
00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
question uh as you can tell by my
 
00:53:00.349 --> 00:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
previous questions I'm I'm a little
 
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about ada8
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
compliance um in
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
nashwa uh how many um exceptions have
 
00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
you taken taken for Nashville city hall
 
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
not being ADA
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
Compliant thank you for the question
 
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
representan specifically to City Halls
 
00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
accessibility right I I don't have in
 
00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
let me say that that I'm going to assume
 
00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
that you're fully ADA Compliant at the
 
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
city hall uh
 
00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
and the question in context is uh if
 
00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
that's what you're offering to the
 
00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:51.400 align:start position:0%
community so people have access whether
 
00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:55.160 align:start position:0%
they're uh disabled or not that they
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
have access to their local government
 
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
um the concern I have is when somebody
 
00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:07.480 align:start position:0%
who may be disabled that wants to use uh
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
one of these these homes uh may not have
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
access uh and therefore you're creating
 
00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:15.640 align:start position:0%
a you might be creating a double
 
00:54:17.789 --> 00:54:17.799 align:start position:0%
standard in the community if you want to
 
00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:20.559 align:start position:0%
go to the town hall you have full access
 
00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
if you want to go uh to a recovery house
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
you don't so uh that's consideration
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
that that I offer back that that you
 
00:54:32.109 --> 00:54:32.119 align:start position:0%
might want to think about uh how you how
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
you might want to deal with that and I'm
 
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
interested in your comment about that
 
00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
and I I don't mean to create a an an
 
00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:43.480 align:start position:0%
unanswerable question but it's a thought
 
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
that's going through my my mind and in
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
the context of here we have some very
 
00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
vulnerable people in our community that
 
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
we want to help yet we may be denying
 
00:54:56.109 --> 00:54:56.119 align:start position:0%
them access to the house that they may
 
00:54:58.109 --> 00:54:58.119 align:start position:0%
have to live
 
00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:25.319 --> 00:55:55.230 align:start position:0%
 
much

00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
Walker so I'll ask you the same question
 
00:56:57.150 --> 00:56:57.160 align:start position:0%
how many or what type of exceptions or
 
00:56:59.589 --> 00:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
waivers would from the zoning would a
 
00:57:03.069 --> 00:57:03.079 align:start position:0%
recovery house get certainly um so as we
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
currently regulate them um none however
 
00:57:08.589 --> 00:57:08.599 align:start position:0%
we do have some regulations that do come
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
into apply that that create you know
 
00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:12.559 align:start position:0%
some guard rails around these one of
 
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
which is is regulating um unrelated
 
00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
occupancy whereas currently we have a
 
00:57:21.309 --> 00:57:21.319 align:start position:0%
regulation that that bases occupancy
 
00:57:24.789 --> 00:57:24.799 align:start position:0%
thresholds on the type of building
 
00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
sometimes the type of
 
00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
and we have a table in our ordinance
 
00:57:31.109 --> 00:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
that basically says take a single family
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
you would be allowed one unrelated
 
00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:36.200 align:start position:0%
occupy one unrelated occup for
 
00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
300t Li for the example of a 3600 foot
 
00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:43.640 align:start position:0%
home that would be 12 individuals now
 
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
you can turn that on his head a little
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
bit and say well you can have a really
 
00:57:50.349 --> 00:57:50.359 align:start position:0%
large family where they are related
 
00:57:53.109 --> 00:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
individuals when we talk about this this
 
00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
regulations really in terms of making
 
00:57:58.589 --> 00:57:58.599 align:start position:0%
don't expose neighborhoods to
 
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
overs undo density of Ops um
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
but a natural family um would would not
 
00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
be subject to that um this is a
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
regulation that is accepted under the
 
00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
Fair Housing Act um obviously though it
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
does you look at it you are treating
 
00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
people differently based on their
 
00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
related or unrelated status um but that
 
00:58:28.870 --> 00:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
is one of the r which uh someone coming
 
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
to establish this use um May seek some
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
various relief from that um only
 
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
considers context neighborhood building
 
00:58:43.029 --> 00:58:43.039 align:start position:0%
typology things like that but we have
 
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
not actually seen any of these requests
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
associated with this sort of use I think
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
that might just be inded that the
 
00:58:52.349 --> 00:58:52.359 align:start position:0%
thresholds and the standards around our
 
00:58:59.190 --> 00:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
you didn't exactly give me a number but
 
00:59:04.589 --> 00:59:04.599 align:start position:0%
are you asking for a number of
 
00:59:06.549 --> 00:59:06.559 align:start position:0%
regulations that you have waivers for
 
00:59:09.029 --> 00:59:09.039 align:start position:0%
for a recovery huh so so that would be
 
00:59:13.029 --> 00:59:13.039 align:start position:0%
the one regulations just one yes because
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
we don't actually have recover hous
 
00:59:17.829 --> 00:59:17.839 align:start position:0%
established as a use the way we treat it
 
00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:19.799 align:start position:0%
is whatever the building is so this is
 
00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
right in line This legislation that
 
00:59:23.829 --> 00:59:23.839 align:start position:0%
proposed if it's a single family home
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
it's being treated as a single family
 
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
home subject to their occupancy
 
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
standards on that single bilding line
 
00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
the table um so that's really the key
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
thing if a building is being developed
 
00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
built you know setbacks law area
 
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
standard dimensional regulations that go
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
along with site development would still
 
00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:44.839 align:start position:0%
apply but it's no different a recover
 
00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
home any use the OCC if you took a
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
single family home very large one that's
 
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
in a single family zoned area and it
 
00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:57.069 align:start position:0%
in a single family zoned area and it
gets

00:59:57.069 --> 00:59:57.079 align:start position:0%
gets
 
01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
more rooms get made or whatever to to
 
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
more people go into that single family
 
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
home than normal would that be allowed
 
01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:07.640 align:start position:0%
again it's going to come down to that
 
01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
one person for 300 sareet um so yes new
 
01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
bedrooms could be made but the way our
 
01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
code operates it's not based on it's
 
01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
square footage of the building all told
 
01:00:21.309 --> 01:00:21.319 align:start position:0%
so they can make as many me as they want
 
01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
but they're still constrained by
 
01:00:28.829 --> 01:00:28.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
yes sir represent Frack
 
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
please thank you um in Nashua do you
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
differentiate your occupancy codes on
 
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
areas that are served by Town sewer Town
 
01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:49.480 align:start position:0%
water versus more rural areas where you
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:45.069 --> 01:01:45.079 align:start position:0%
any other
 
01:01:47.549 --> 01:01:47.559 align:start position:0%
questions represent Doan please one
 
01:01:50.789 --> 01:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
quick question thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:59.150 --> 01:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
permitting or approval process is is
 
01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:01.839 align:start position:0%
limited for this application this
 
01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
legislation uh
 
01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
what input do uh local
 
01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:12.680 align:start position:0%
residents uh in in particular uh
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
neighbors uh
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
of projects like this what what
 
01:02:20.109 --> 01:02:20.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity do they have to provide
 
01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:23.480 align:start position:0%
input to folks like you and people who
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
run the local government about uh their
 
01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.150 align:start position:0%
 
certain

01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
certain
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
use on the general scale that we're
 
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
seeing them where it's a single building
 
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
that's a change of use that's an
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
administrative approval there is no
 
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
public hearing before planning rule so
 
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
in that instance there there is no
 
01:02:50.269 --> 01:02:50.279 align:start position:0%
public process
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
um you look at what the impact is you
 
01:02:56.029 --> 01:02:56.039 align:start position:0%
know obviously I think you do have
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
chances where you could go a bit
 
01:03:00.349 --> 01:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
extremely having a very large
 
01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:18.630 align:start position:0%
 
individual

01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully exous
 
01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:24.680 align:start position:0%
concerns but because it's really just a
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
conversion use but at the same time the
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
use is relativ similar it's just it's
 
01:03:31.039 --> 01:03:33.990 align:start position:0%
use is relativ similar it's just it's
now

01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:03:36.549 --> 01:03:36.559 align:start position:0%
indidual in my professional opinion
 
01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:38.200 align:start position:0%
that's not something that would rise the
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
level of ACC a public hearing simply
 
01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.710 align:start position:0%
level of ACC a public hearing simply
because

01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:49.029 align:start position:0%
because
not

01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
termity or other concerns and I do want
 
01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
to speak to the fact that this
 
01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
legislation is requiring certification
 
01:03:57.789 --> 01:03:57.799 align:start position:0%
and I think that that
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
adds important distinction and I think a
 
01:04:05.029 --> 01:04:05.039 align:start position:0%
level of comfort to the
 
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
resen signant
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:17.119 --> 01:04:18.910 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:04:18.910 --> 01:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
Frank thank you
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
um most development projects that I'm
 
01:04:26.079 --> 01:04:27.589 align:start position:0%
um most development projects that I'm
familiar

01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
familiar
 
01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
with that require some sort of a
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
certification or public hearing the
 
01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
certification happens prior to the start
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
development and in the case of recovery
 
01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
houses they are given a period of time
 
01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
whether it's six months or 12 months is
 
01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
irrelevant but the uh the point being
 
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
that the house needs to be up and
 
01:05:00.349 --> 01:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
running before the certification
 
01:05:03.789 --> 01:05:03.799 align:start position:0%
Authority can provide that
 
01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
certification my question
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
is it's kind of not the normal way of
 
01:05:16.029 --> 01:05:16.039 align:start position:0%
doing things the normal order and how
 
01:05:20.029 --> 01:05:20.039 align:start position:0%
how has that been received amongst the
 
01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
broad community of residents in the city
 
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
of Nashua
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
um well I don't think that I'd be able
 
01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
to speak to you know the general public
 
01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
in nation's perception of this
 
01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
particular element of the bill um but I
 
01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
will speak
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
to how I would see that how we would
 
01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:41.720 align:start position:0%
operate through
 
01:05:45.029 --> 01:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
that I have no concerns about the
 
01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
substantial race where you do get up and
 
01:05:50.269 --> 01:05:50.279 align:start position:0%
running but you are required to seek
 
01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
this I think that's a fine way to
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
operate understanding that know of
 
01:05:57.039 --> 01:06:00.549 align:start position:0%
operate understanding that know of
operators

01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:00.559 --> 01:06:03.990 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:07.240 align:start position:0%
certific but I do think that what this
 
01:06:10.109 --> 01:06:10.119 align:start position:0%
legislation provides level of protection
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
radiator speaking um but that book being
 
01:06:16.269 --> 01:06:16.279 align:start position:0%
you do have to
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
aeve I think that there is some
 
01:06:22.510 --> 01:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
exercises that need to ur what does
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
happen not achieve certific
 
01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:32.230 align:start position:0%
happen not achieve certific
is

01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:43.029 align:start position:0%
 
State

01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:45.789 --> 01:06:45.799 align:start position:0%
local thank
 
01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:48.200 align:start position:0%
you go ahead
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
representative thank you going back to
 
01:06:53.069 --> 01:06:53.079 align:start position:0%
that certification um do you think that
 
01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
with the year it's that right now that
 
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
it could be cut back to maybe 6 months
 
01:06:58.510 --> 01:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
with additional time if you're working
 
01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
municipality I think that it could I
 
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily see a benefit to
 
01:07:07.589 --> 01:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
cutting it back I think it amount of
 
01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
time um I also don't believe that I
 
01:07:12.309 --> 01:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
would be the right person to really
 
01:07:15.390 --> 01:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
answer that I don't know certification
 
01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
process I don't know if achiev
 
01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
certification in six months is actually
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
um so I wouldn't want to say that you
 
01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
let's let's cut it down to six
 
01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions I just have a quick
 
01:07:41.789 --> 01:07:41.799 align:start position:0%
question for you um the city nro seems
 
01:07:44.589 --> 01:07:44.599 align:start position:0%
to have addressed a lot of the things
 
01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:46.839 align:start position:0%
locally within this bill as far as
 
01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
regulating the the recovery houses why
 
01:07:51.029 --> 01:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
do we need this bill shouldn't this be
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
done at the local level rather than
 
01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
through the state that's a that's a very
 
01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
good question
 
01:07:59.109 --> 01:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
um I will say that I think that we are
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
in n a bit of an outl simply because we
 
01:08:04.109 --> 01:08:04.119 align:start position:0%
have so many of these and we seen them
 
01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
and they've actually been challenged INT
 
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
in different ways where we are kind of
 
01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
at the point of this year navigating
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
again the relationship between local
 
01:08:17.070 --> 01:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
regulations and federal law I think that
 
01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:26.349 --> 01:09:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
Anthony salvi I hope I didn't miss penoa
 
01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:42.749 --> 01:09:42.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
sir my name is Anthony salbuchi I am the

01:10:02.590 --> 01:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
here in the state of New
 
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I am Rising today in in
 
01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill
 
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
432 um this bill is extremely important
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
to uh solidify a definition of recovery
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
housing in the state of New Hampshire uh
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
as many previous speakers have have said
 
01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:27.080 align:start position:0%
today um the stigma and and the nuances
 
01:10:29.470 --> 01:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
of the planning and development
 
01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
processes can become cumbers cumbersome
 
01:10:35.550 --> 01:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
uh throughout the state and limit the
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
ability to open up suitable and safe
 
01:10:41.149 --> 01:10:41.159 align:start position:0%
drug and alcohol-free housing in every
 
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
community in this uh in this great state
 
01:10:47.550 --> 01:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire Coalition of recovery
 
01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
residences partnered up with uh the
 
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
Fletcher group and performed a study um
 
01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
on the amount of home homes that were
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
needed in the state of New Hampshire uh
 
01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
and that was estimated at
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
15,000 um and after conversations with
 
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
nhpr and ourselves I believe there's
 
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
approximately 108 certified homes and
 
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.510 align:start position:0%
approximately 108 certified homes and
only

01:11:12.510 --> 01:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
1340 uh certified beds in the state um
 
01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
so we have a significant shortfall and
 
01:11:21.189 --> 01:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
it is imperative that we all begin to
 
01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
address this and I think the first step
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
is having a common understanding of what
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
recovery housing is what recovery
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
housing provides um and how recovery
 
01:11:33.310 --> 01:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
housing is intended to slip in and
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
become part of any Community uh and any
 
01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
neighborhood that uh the operator
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
chooses to open um I am in support we
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
are fully in support I can provide you
 
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
with the Nar standards of certification
 
01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm available to answer any uh any
 
01:11:52.629 --> 01:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
questions you may
 
01:11:57.470 --> 01:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
have we d thank you Mr chairman 1 1300
 
01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
beds in the state what's your estimate
 
01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
as to how many beds do we really
 
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
need um as stated they estimate
 
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
15,000 1300 to 15,000 right right now we
 
01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
have 1300 and after the study with the
 
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
Fletcher group it is 1
 
01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
you goe
 
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
representive thank you um in your
 
01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
experience kind of as these um homes get
 
01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
bigger and we get into the multif family
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
use um is there evidence or data
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere that this is still an
 
01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
effective method for the people living
 
01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
living in those homes and that it's
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
still um kind of the impact on the
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
community I don't have any of that data
 
01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
in front of me I'm sure we could uh work
 
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
with some of our partners and and also
 
01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:47.080 align:start position:0%
with the National Alliance of recovery
 
01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
residents and try to collect some of
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
that data um a little bit more globally
 
01:12:53.709 --> 01:12:53.719 align:start position:0%
and uh and I'll provide it to to this
 
01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
committee uh once we rece receive it um
 
01:12:59.310 --> 01:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
but what I will say is the social model
 
01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
of recovery is the gold standard
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
throughout the United States of America
 
01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
um and it is imperative and important
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
that these homes operate with
 
01:13:13.629 --> 01:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
uh larger than normal size I guess as
 
01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
you would compare to a single family use
 
01:13:18.189 --> 01:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
um because of the fact that those
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
individuals within that home are relying
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
upon the other individuals that are
 
01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
going through the same challenges
 
01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
concerns thought process
 
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh struggles um and they rely on one
 
01:13:32.830 --> 01:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
another without that support next to you
 
01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
um or without ample support in that home
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
suffer go ahead
 
01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
representative yes
 
01:13:48.990 --> 01:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
uh the majority of the the recovery
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
homes around or single family or two
 
01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
family do you have how many what's the
 
01:13:54.510 --> 01:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
percentage for like multifamilies do you
 
01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
have is that something new that you're
 
01:13:58.669 --> 01:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
pursuing I I don't have that count in
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
front of me um what I could say is they
 
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
they do range from one two and three
 
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
family homes uh
 
01:14:09.310 --> 01:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
yes represent
 
01:14:11.669 --> 01:14:11.679 align:start position:0%
Frank thank you
 
01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
um changing the focus of the discussion
 
01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
just a bit here uh excuse me our rec
 
01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
recovery houses are set up as a business
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
is that a valid
 
01:14:31.149 --> 01:14:31.159 align:start position:0%
assumption it's like any other real
 
01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
estate uh in LLC or or a particular
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
owner will uh purchase the building and
 
01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
then either lease it or operate the
 
01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
recovery residents themselves so they
 
01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
would file business filings but for all
 
01:14:46.110 --> 01:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
intents and purposes the home does not
 
01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
operate as a business it operates as a
 
01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
single family there is not Brook brick
 
01:14:53.310 --> 01:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
and mortar foot traffic uh that that is
 
01:14:55.229 --> 01:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
going to be coming into that home so
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
that gray area tends to be something
 
01:14:59.790 --> 01:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
that indiv you know individuals jump
 
01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:03.400 align:start position:0%
towards uh in in an opportunity to raise
 
01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
the stigmatic approach of of recovery
 
01:15:07.629 --> 01:15:07.639 align:start position:0%
housing and preventing them from coming
 
01:15:09.910 --> 01:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
to the area but the reality of it is is
 
01:15:11.629 --> 01:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
the individuals living within that home
 
01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
are living as a single family unit and
 
01:15:17.229 --> 01:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
and the business is recovery in that
 
01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
house so are are the businesses set up
 
01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:22.149 align:start position:0%
house so are are the businesses set up
as

01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
nonprofits or profit making
 
01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
entities uh we have both entities
 
01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of New Hampshire um
 
01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
some are nonprofit um but again NH core
 
01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:36.760 align:start position:0%
along with Fletcher group did a study um
 
01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
and found that it is um sign
 
01:15:43.229 --> 01:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
significantly more uh expensive to
 
01:15:45.550 --> 01:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
operate a recovery home as a nonprofit
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
than as a for-profit business due to uh
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
additional positions that are within
 
01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
those boards and and those
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
organizations uh which translates down
 
01:15:59.189 --> 01:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
to a more uh expensive housing fee for
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
individuals that are that are seeking
 
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
that housing so we have both in the
 
01:16:03.629 --> 01:16:03.639 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and they'll
 
01:16:05.470 --> 01:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
they'll submit whatever appropriate
 
01:16:09.310 --> 01:16:09.320 align:start position:0%
taxes um that they should be but the
 
01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
majority of homes in New Hampshire are
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh not nonprofit organizations
 
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
thanks repr
 
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
Walker that brings up a subject in my
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
mind do the individual people people
 
01:16:27.790 --> 01:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
living in these homes pay rent or is
 
01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:30.520 align:start position:0%
there how is the payment rent
 
01:16:33.229 --> 01:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
transaction done so there's no rent and
 
01:16:35.229 --> 01:16:35.239 align:start position:0%
Recovery housing there is a housing fee
 
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
or a fee for service um but there is no
 
01:16:39.950 --> 01:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant relationship between
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
those individuals because of the fact
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
that a normal landlord tenant uh
 
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
situation wouldn't allow him to remove
 
01:16:47.550 --> 01:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
someone from the home for consuming uh
 
01:16:49.950 --> 01:16:49.960 align:start position:0%
drugs or alcohol uh whereas recovery
 
01:16:52.350 --> 01:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
residences need to ensure that the
 
01:16:53.790 --> 01:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
remainder of the residents of the house
 
01:16:56.629 --> 01:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
are are able to live uh free from drugs
 
01:16:58.830 --> 01:16:58.840 align:start position:0%
and alcohol so uh that we call them
 
01:17:02.229 --> 01:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
housing fees typically uh the individual
 
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
is expected to pay that out of pocket
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
there are numerous uh scholarship and uh
 
01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
state and federal funding that is
 
01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
available uh through the doorways of New
 
01:17:14.110 --> 01:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well as some other
 
01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organizations uh that will
 
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
assist uh but the goal longterm is to
 
01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
get these individuals to uh obtain 40h
 
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
Hour Week gainful employment or
 
01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh whether that be you know working
 
01:17:30.149 --> 01:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
full-time volunteering
 
01:17:32.629 --> 01:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
full-time uh or any combination thereof
 
01:17:34.990 --> 01:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
or attending schooling to become a more
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh competitive individual in the

employment Market as they move to
 
01:17:39.199 --> 01:17:40.550 align:start position:0%
employment Market as they move to
Independent

01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
Independent
 
01:17:43.150 --> 01:17:43.160 align:start position:0%
Living uh the purpose is
 
01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:44.629 align:start position:0%
Living uh the purpose is
[Music]

01:17:44.629 --> 01:17:44.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:17:48.750 --> 01:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
to have them pay their own fees so that
 
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
they understand what it's going to be
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
like as they move on to Independent
 
01:17:53.950 --> 01:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
Living too much funding and too much uh
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
additional money can be considered uh
 
01:17:58.590 --> 01:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
enabling there is conversations
 
01:18:00.189 --> 01:18:00.199 align:start position:0%
throughout uh the federal government
 
01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
right now that is considering uh a
 
01:18:05.310 --> 01:18:05.320 align:start position:0%
Medicare Medicaid payer paye Insurance
 
01:18:06.990 --> 01:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
situation but there that has not come to
 
01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
fruition and clearly with the uh new
 
01:18:11.790 --> 01:18:11.800 align:start position:0%
Administration there's some uh some
 
01:18:13.709 --> 01:18:13.719 align:start position:0%
uncertainty how that's going to proceed
 
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:18:20.669 --> 01:18:20.679 align:start position:0%
future if I may right sir the tenant
 
01:18:23.070 --> 01:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
landlord situation if you violate your
 
01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
lease or you do some drinking or
 
01:18:28.110 --> 01:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
whatever drugs in the house you can be
 
01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
evicted but that eviction process can be
 
01:18:34.990 --> 01:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
30 60 days if a person in a Recovery
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
House disrupts the breaks the rules
 
01:18:41.310 --> 01:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
relapses and uses drugs on premises how
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
is that handled by the recovery house um
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
so there every house uh may handle it a
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
little bit differently but there is an
 
01:18:50.510 --> 01:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
expectation through NH core as a
 
01:18:52.669 --> 01:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
certifying body I will not speak for
 
01:18:55.870 --> 01:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
nhpr they uh have a representative here
 
01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
as well um but for NH core it is
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
expected that all uh recovery homes
 
01:19:08.070 --> 01:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
operate with a relapse plan um some
 
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
residents have individuals sign it upon
 
01:19:11.629 --> 01:19:11.639 align:start position:0%
arrival where kind of gives them a
 
01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
breakdown of what that would look like
 
01:19:14.910 --> 01:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
there is the safety of the other
 
01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
residents that we have to keep in mind
 
01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
keeping someone that is uh intoxicated
 
01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
or under mind altering uh drugs or
 
01:19:24.030 --> 01:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
alcohol cannot remain in that house so
 
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
typically what the the process would be
 
01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
is the individual be uh confronted or UA
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
in order to determine if they had
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
consumed illegal drugs or alcohol um and
 
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
then there would be a discussion on
 
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not that if it is positive
 
01:19:40.510 --> 01:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not that individual wanted to
 
01:19:43.470 --> 01:19:43.480 align:start position:0%
go to a respit in order to provide uh
 
01:19:45.149 --> 01:19:45.159 align:start position:0%
some time in order to provide a clean
 
01:19:47.189 --> 01:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
year analysis to come back to that home
 
01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
if that is an option there's been no
 
01:19:51.390 --> 01:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
other safety issues uh that go along
 
01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
with the relapse um they can elect to go
 
01:19:57.629 --> 01:19:57.639 align:start position:0%
back into a treatment PHP IOP
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
inpatient um but we have to also
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
remember that these individuals are not
 
01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
incarcerated they are not required to be
 
01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
in recovery housing so they also have
 
01:20:09.310 --> 01:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
the option to uh leave and go to a
 
01:20:10.350 --> 01:20:10.360 align:start position:0%
friend's house if that's what they
 
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
choose to do or um at their own expense
 
01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
get a hotel operators are are educated
 
01:20:18.669 --> 01:20:18.679 align:start position:0%
appropriately as well as their house
 
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
leadership on the fact that individuals
 
01:20:24.430 --> 01:20:24.440 align:start position:0%
need to be placed in a safe location if
 
01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
that is an option so we want them
 
01:20:29.310 --> 01:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
communicating with that individual um
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
one of the houses in particular that
 
01:20:33.550 --> 01:20:33.560 align:start position:0%
I've spoken to um then I have some
 
01:20:35.709 --> 01:20:35.719 align:start position:0%
knowledge of it's a requirement upon
 
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
arrival to select what option you would
 
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
have in the event of a
 
01:20:45.070 --> 01:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
reoccurrence and uh if there is that
 
01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
reoccurrence we're able to kind of look
 
01:20:47.950 --> 01:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
back at the resident and say you're
 
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
changing your mind right now on
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
something that sober you said was a
 
01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
better idea maybe you should listen back
 
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
to who you are um and then they'll
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
they'll bring them on to that that
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
respit that IOP or that
 
01:21:03.310 --> 01:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
PHP thank
 
01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
you represent Dolan thank you Mr
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
chairman um as we look at recovery
 
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
houses in this
 
01:21:17.149 --> 01:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
context uh typically those in recovery
 
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
have good days and bad days sometimes
 
01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
they fall out of
 
01:21:25.870 --> 01:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
recovery uh and uh we tend to call that
 
01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:26.629 align:start position:0%
recovery uh and uh we tend to call that
a

01:21:26.629 --> 01:21:26.639 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:21:30.990 --> 01:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:35.189 --> 01:21:35.199 align:start position:0%
cases how often do you require law
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement to be
 
01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
involved and or mental health
 
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
professionals to intervene or something
 
01:21:47.310 --> 01:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
similar to that we currently don't track
 
01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
that data
 
01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
specific I'm sorry I didn't haveit my
 
01:21:55.470 --> 01:21:55.480 align:start position:0%
microphone you're able to if you have to
 
01:21:59.950 --> 01:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
repeat the record no I don't think
 
01:22:03.070 --> 01:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
so um yeah I don't have that data
 
01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
directly in front of me um I can say
 
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
from my personal experience um we've had
 
01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
interactions with
 
01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:14.239 align:start position:0%
of false alarms from the from the system
 
01:22:25.950 --> 01:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:27.870 align:start position:0%
 
thank

01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:22:29.790 --> 01:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
you Le
 
01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
Jam thank you can you uh speak to that
 
01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
process of gaining that certification
 
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
and kind of what that timeline looks
 
01:22:38.910 --> 01:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
like sure I mean it's a comprehensive
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:44.159 --> 01:22:53.430 align:start position:0%
 
stand

01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:53.440 --> 01:23:23.430 align:start position:0%
 
are

01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:53.430 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:53.440 --> 01:24:23.310 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:53.310 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:53.320 --> 01:25:23.310 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.470 --> 01:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:02.109 --> 01:26:02.119 align:start position:0%
actually have a followup go ahead
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
perfect um so do you believe that the
 
01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:06.639 align:start position:0%
way it's written here that there is a
 
01:26:08.430 --> 01:26:08.440 align:start position:0%
chance someone could abuse it and just
 
01:26:10.990 --> 01:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
keep reapplying for that
 
01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
certification in terms of of re or abuse
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
I would say no right this is
 
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
not the way I view this bill
 
01:26:23.229 --> 01:26:23.239 align:start position:0%
is the individuals that are going to be
 
01:26:31.030 --> 01:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
will as well as the planning board and
 
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
and the certifying body which would by
 
01:26:42.189 --> 01:26:42.199 align:start position:0%
default the uh e gu uh these individuals
 
01:26:45.189 --> 01:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
it's an expensive Endeavor to try to try
 
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
to push off and I guess Carri on on the
 
01:26:51.709 --> 01:26:51.719 align:start position:0%
top of that is the fact that once you
 
01:27:03.390 --> 01:27:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
great thank
 
01:27:09.149 --> 01:27:09.159 align:start position:0%
you represent Frank thank you um has
 
01:27:09.159 --> 01:27:10.189 align:start position:0%
you represent Frank thank you um has
your

01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:27:14.430 --> 01:27:14.440 align:start position:0%
organization or any of its members ever
 
01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
had any conversations with Dees or with
 
01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:19.550 align:start position:0%
had any conversations with Dees or with
Town

01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
Town
 
01:27:23.550 --> 01:27:23.560 align:start position:0%
officials about occupancy levels that
 
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
exceed the design parameters for the
 
01:27:53.109 --> 01:27:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:53.119 --> 01:28:23.109 align:start position:0%
 
property

01:28:23.109 --> 01:28:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:23.119 --> 01:28:53.030 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:39.629 --> 01:29:39.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:41.109 --> 01:29:41.119 align:start position:0%
any other
 
01:29:45.790 --> 01:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
questions I just have a a couple uh I
 
01:29:48.629 --> 01:29:48.639 align:start position:0%
contacted Health and Human Services and
 
01:29:50.550 --> 01:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
how many recovery houses do you have
 
01:29:52.750 --> 01:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
that are part of your group right now
 
01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
part of nh4 specifically yeah we are the
 
01:29:59.950 --> 01:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
last time I spoke with our certification
 
01:30:04.350 --> 01:30:04.360 align:start position:0%
specialist was Friday last week it
 
01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
was7 okay those are ones that are being
 
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
certified you have members that not
 
01:30:13.229 --> 01:30:13.239 align:start position:0%
certified that belong to the group no
 
01:30:16.990 --> 01:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
okay now how does a work with the
 
01:30:18.990 --> 01:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
registry there's a voluntary registry I
 
01:30:20.430 --> 01:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
guess through Health and Human Services
 
01:30:24.189 --> 01:30:24.199 align:start position:0%
how does that relationship work so um
 
01:30:26.950 --> 01:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
currently New Hampshire Partnership of
 
01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
recovery residen is is the sole
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:41.470 --> 01:30:41.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're working with with the
 
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
state at this time to to discuss that
 
01:30:47.709 --> 01:30:47.719 align:start position:0%
nh4 has been the certified body
 
01:30:56.189 --> 01:30:56.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:56.199 --> 01:30:57.669 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:30:57.669 --> 01:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:20.709 --> 01:31:20.719 align:start position:0%
to that it is not the home that you are
 
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
just another quick
 
01:31:40.629 --> 01:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
followup how do I lose my certification
 
01:31:42.310 --> 01:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
who checks the certification is it
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
yearly or once they get it is that there
 
01:31:46.990 --> 01:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
forever or how does it work yeah so
 
01:31:50.030 --> 01:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
annually and Rees that every home
 
01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
certified ised that includes another
 
01:31:58.070 --> 01:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
upload and
 
01:32:01.390 --> 01:32:01.400 align:start position:0%
by as well as an additional walk to that
 
01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:09.229 align:start position:0%
by as well as an additional walk to that
they

01:32:09.229 --> 01:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
process which is opport for individual
 
01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:20.590 align:start position:0%
process which is opport for individual
to

01:32:20.590 --> 01:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:26.990 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:32:26.990 --> 01:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:30.430 --> 01:32:30.440 align:start position:0%
what happens if a uh a recover this law
 
01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
is passed and Recovery house uh goes and
 
01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
opens up and they lose the certification
 
01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen to that house
 
01:32:38.990 --> 01:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
they can still operate
 
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
or can you think of any penalties that
 
01:32:43.590 --> 01:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
would that could
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
apply if if I I passed the first time
 
01:32:48.870 --> 01:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
around my certification I this law
 
01:32:51.629 --> 01:32:51.639 align:start position:0%
passes two years later I lose my
 
01:32:53.669 --> 01:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
certification what protection are is
 
01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
there there to make him get that
 
01:32:57.149 --> 01:32:57.159 align:start position:0%
certification again so they comply with
 
01:33:00.870 --> 01:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
the law so we're not typically unless
 
01:33:04.350 --> 01:33:04.360 align:start position:0%
it's truly egregious we're not going to
 
01:33:07.550 --> 01:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
roke certification in that nature there
 
01:33:10.109 --> 01:33:10.119 align:start position:0%
would be some kind of action plan
 
01:33:14.510 --> 01:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
establ with that so we would follow up
 
01:33:19.109 --> 01:33:19.119 align:start position:0%
policy out we would notify that they had
 
01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
my suggestion is that if individuals are
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
do have their certification
 
01:33:35.189 --> 01:33:35.199 align:start position:0%
remok and it's egg enough that
 
01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
certifying body they
 
01:33:41.629 --> 01:33:41.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate municipality the appropriate
 
01:33:45.629 --> 01:33:45.639 align:start position:0%
action NH and I don't want to speak but
 
01:33:47.629 --> 01:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty confident that they feel the
 
01:33:51.310 --> 01:33:51.320 align:start position:0%
same way uh we don't want that happening
 
01:33:54.510 --> 01:33:54.520 align:start position:0%
this this statute is to bring people to
 
01:33:57.669 --> 01:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:57.679 --> 01:33:59.470 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:33:59.470 --> 01:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:02.830 --> 01:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
certific seeking this
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
bill are the ones that are coming to

certification thank you any other
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%

appreciate uh B the from the New
 
01:35:58.149 --> 01:35:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:59.709 --> 01:35:59.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chairman and thank you
 
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
to the subcommittee for uh letting me
 
01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
speak today for the record my name is
 
01:36:05.229 --> 01:36:05.239 align:start position:0%
bro Dees I represent the nire municipal
 
01:36:07.629 --> 01:36:07.639 align:start position:0%
Association and we currently oppose the
 
01:36:10.350 --> 01:36:10.360 align:start position:0%
bill as written I've learned a lot
 
01:36:11.470 --> 01:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
meeting with some of the other
 
01:36:12.830 --> 01:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that are currently in this
 
01:36:17.229 --> 01:36:17.239 align:start position:0%
room about um about recovery homes and
 
01:36:18.270 --> 01:36:18.280 align:start position:0%
how they're regulate in different
 
01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities how they're regulated by
 
01:36:21.270 --> 01:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
the state and the federal government our
 
01:36:24.149 --> 01:36:24.159 align:start position:0%
biggest concern is that um this bill
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
would mandate that all recovery homes be
 
01:36:27.870 --> 01:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
treated as single family two family or
 
01:36:30.830 --> 01:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
multif family use in every um zoning
 
01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
ordinance across the state um it would
 
01:36:35.229 --> 01:36:35.239 align:start position:0%
prevent municipalities from regula
 
01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
regulating recovery homes that qualify
 
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
as congregate living in their zoning
 
01:36:40.590 --> 01:36:40.600 align:start position:0%
ordinances I use that term specifically
 
01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
because it's used in Keen zoning
 
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
ordinance and they have a pretty
 
01:36:45.550 --> 01:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
comprehensive zoning ordinance on what
 
01:36:47.070 --> 01:36:47.080 align:start position:0%
congregate living is and what types of
 
01:36:50.510 --> 01:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
uses fall under that um and many
 
01:36:52.270 --> 01:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
recovery homes are utilized as congrate
 
01:36:54.149 --> 01:36:54.159 align:start position:0%
living spaces and being owned and
 
01:36:56.430 --> 01:36:56.440 align:start position:0%
facilitated by nonprofits or for-profit
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
institutions so sometimes they're owned
 
01:37:00.430 --> 01:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes they pay the people's um rent
 
01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
or the quote fees that they'll pay to
 
01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
the landlords um this also amends a
 
01:37:06.990 --> 01:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
definition of quote recovery homes be
 
01:37:09.550 --> 01:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
quote primarily non-transient dwelling
 
01:37:12.870 --> 01:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
or dwelling units which in our opinion
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
is not an accurate depiction of recovery
 
01:37:17.070 --> 01:37:17.080 align:start position:0%
homes and their usage in every single
 
01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
municipality um we heard some of that in
 
01:37:20.430 --> 01:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
the testimony that you guys received a
 
01:37:23.550 --> 01:37:23.560 align:start position:0%
few weeks ago um we believe that by the
 
01:37:26.189 --> 01:37:26.199 align:start position:0%
very nature recovery homes are not
 
01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
dwellings that they are dwellings that
 
01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
serve as a transient population there's
 
01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
no expectation that they stay there for
 
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
a very extended period of time there's
 
01:37:36.229 --> 01:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
an expectation that eventually they need
 
01:37:39.149 --> 01:37:39.159 align:start position:0%
to leave and go on to Independent Living
 
01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
um I want to point out there was a
 
01:37:41.910 --> 01:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
hearing yesterday in front of the house
 
01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
housing committee on house bill 457
 
01:37:45.629 --> 01:37:45.639 align:start position:0%
which is a more expansive mandate that
 
01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
allows congre living or group homes in
 
01:37:50.910 --> 01:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
all residential zones and um congregate
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
or group living versus regular dwellings
 
01:37:54.510 --> 01:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
is very different imagine the difference
 
01:37:58.030 --> 01:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
between your house or your apartment and
 
01:38:00.830 --> 01:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
dormitories right dormitories have those
 
01:38:02.510 --> 01:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
those communal spaces where there's a
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
communal kitchen communal um bathrooms
 
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
you know everyone has shared Wastewater
 
01:38:10.109 --> 01:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
and shared trash disposal um you have
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
different rooms sometimes they can be
 
01:38:13.709 --> 01:38:13.719 align:start position:0%
locked sometimes they're unlocked um
 
01:38:15.830 --> 01:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
versus our house you know or an
 
01:38:18.109 --> 01:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
apartment that we may live in um you
 
01:38:20.709 --> 01:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
know you have all your own bathrooms you
 
01:38:22.750 --> 01:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
have your own you know locked door your
 
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
entire unit your dwelling is closed off
 
01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
to others you're not sharing your
 
01:38:28.589 --> 01:38:28.599 align:start position:0%
kitchen with your neighbors um you might
 
01:38:29.669 --> 01:38:29.679 align:start position:0%
share a hallway if you live in an
 
01:38:31.629 --> 01:38:31.639 align:start position:0%
apartment building um if you live on a
 
01:38:33.589 --> 01:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
single family you know residence that's
 
01:38:35.629 --> 01:38:35.639 align:start position:0%
a house you have your own lot to
 
01:38:38.109 --> 01:38:38.119 align:start position:0%
yourself so um so these concret living
 
01:38:40.350 --> 01:38:40.360 align:start position:0%
situations are much different as a use
 
01:38:42.189 --> 01:38:42.199 align:start position:0%
versus what we what I'm going to call
 
01:38:43.870 --> 01:38:43.880 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of this discussion
 
01:38:45.189 --> 01:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
regular dwellings and there's an
 
01:38:46.990 --> 01:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
interest to regulate for safety health
 
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
and uh General Welfare especially
 
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
General Welfare congrate living
 
01:38:53.589 --> 01:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
situations differently than um Regular
 
01:38:55.109 --> 01:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
dwellings whether it be single family
 
01:38:57.950 --> 01:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
dwellings um two family dwellings or
 
01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
multif family dwelling um housing and
 
01:39:04.350 --> 01:39:04.360 align:start position:0%
congrate housing is a change of use in
 
01:39:06.430 --> 01:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
some zoning ordinances in some
 
01:39:08.229 --> 01:39:08.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities across the state it's
 
01:39:09.669 --> 01:39:09.679 align:start position:0%
actually not a lot that regulate
 
01:39:10.910 --> 01:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
congrate living but it tends to be
 
01:39:12.709 --> 01:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
college towns or places where you know
 
01:39:15.030 --> 01:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
that are higher density or urban areas
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
um where people might try to um become
 
01:39:21.229 --> 01:39:21.239 align:start position:0%
roommates or where um College landlords
 
01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
might try to lease out per bedroom and
 
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
so you might have per bedroom occupancy
 
01:39:28.149 --> 01:39:28.159 align:start position:0%
um zoning ordinances to try to prevent
 
01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
um you know too many people from living
 
01:39:32.109 --> 01:39:32.119 align:start position:0%
in One Singular dwelling and making sure
 
01:39:33.629 --> 01:39:33.639 align:start position:0%
that congrate living dwellings are away
 
01:39:35.109 --> 01:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
from single family neighborhoods or two
 
01:39:36.709 --> 01:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
family neighborhoods because again their
 
01:39:38.990 --> 01:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
usage is different and their uh impact
 
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
on a community's infrastructure traffic
 
01:39:43.390 --> 01:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
and especially parking is um is much
 
01:39:45.790 --> 01:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
different than a single family dwelling
 
01:39:48.629 --> 01:39:48.639 align:start position:0%
um unrelated people living together too
 
01:39:50.470 --> 01:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
um are much different behave differently
 
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
than families just for an example cars
 
01:39:54.310 --> 01:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
right if you have a family of five
 
01:39:55.629 --> 01:39:55.639 align:start position:0%
you're still likely going to have only
 
01:39:57.910 --> 01:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
two cars um if you have eight people
 
01:39:59.589 --> 01:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
living in a congrate living situation
 
01:40:00.990 --> 01:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
it's more likely each person's going to
 
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
need a car because the reality in New
 
01:40:03.669 --> 01:40:03.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is we don't have a lot of
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
public transit people need to drive to
 
01:40:07.390 --> 01:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
get to work so and they can't
 
01:40:08.910 --> 01:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily always carpool because I
 
01:40:10.990 --> 01:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
might work you know one's one hour West
 
01:40:13.189 --> 01:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
and the other one's 1 hour East so
 
01:40:14.830 --> 01:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities have an interest of when
 
01:40:16.350 --> 01:40:16.360 align:start position:0%
there's a change of use requiring as
 
01:40:18.270 --> 01:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
part of the variance and site plan uh
 
01:40:19.870 --> 01:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
review making sure that there's
 
01:40:21.390 --> 01:40:21.400 align:start position:0%
additional parking and it works with the
 
01:40:22.910 --> 01:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
current traffic patterns especially in
 
01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:24.229 align:start position:0%
current traffic patterns especially in
dense

01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
dense
 
01:40:27.589 --> 01:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
areas um and this is especially true
 
01:40:29.589 --> 01:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
with leases by bedroom if you do lease
 
01:40:31.790 --> 01:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
by bedroom um I'm not sure if recovery
 
01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
homes would do it that way but with
 
01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
congr living situations you might have a
 
01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
lease by bedroom recovery homes are a
 
01:40:38.189 --> 01:40:38.199 align:start position:0%
little bit different as as we've
 
01:40:40.109 --> 01:40:40.119 align:start position:0%
discussed they're there are fees that
 
01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
they pay but um still those fees could
 
01:40:44.430 --> 01:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
be a fee per bedroom that you live in
 
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
and um if all of a sudden you decide
 
01:40:46.870 --> 01:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
well I don't want to pay the fees to
 
01:40:48.030 --> 01:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
live in this recovery home I'm going to
 
01:40:49.550 --> 01:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
go live in another one well they'll
 
01:40:51.189 --> 01:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
probably fill someone else and so then
 
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
that's more of a a transient use too um
 
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances they do help and they
 
01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
don't hurt the ability of municipalities
 
01:41:01.470 --> 01:41:01.480 align:start position:0%
to have safe responsible development uh
 
01:41:03.070 --> 01:41:03.080 align:start position:0%
it's trying to make sure that specific
 
01:41:05.109 --> 01:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
uses are done in zones that have been
 
01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
developed for 40 50 60 years to be able
 
01:41:09.589 --> 01:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
to deal with that infrastructure impact
 
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
of whether it's congrate living multif
 
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
family dwellings or single family
 
01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
dwellings um and whether the waste water
 
01:41:17.870 --> 01:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
is discharged to the sewer system or
 
01:41:19.550 --> 01:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
done through a traditional septic
 
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
on-site Wastewater disposal um I'd like
 
01:41:24.030 --> 01:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
to really stress again site plan
 
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
approval is important when you're doing
 
01:41:27.950 --> 01:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
the parking and the traffic planning if
 
01:41:31.950 --> 01:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
you require um more parking spaces um
 
01:41:33.629 --> 01:41:33.639 align:start position:0%
also the threshold for conget living in
 
01:41:35.229 --> 01:41:35.239 align:start position:0%
many zoning ordinances is typically
 
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
aligned with a fire code so four
 
01:41:38.189 --> 01:41:38.199 align:start position:0%
unrelated people so it's not an
 
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number it's kind of aligned
 
01:41:42.030 --> 01:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
with the fire code because there might
 
01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
be additional um modifications that need
 
01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
to be made to the dwelling to ensure
 
01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
that it's in accordance with the um the
 
01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
fire code also regulating congr housing
 
01:41:53.550 --> 01:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
is not discrimination it's about the
 
01:41:55.790 --> 01:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
property and the dwelling use not those
 
01:41:57.790 --> 01:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
who are using it or trying to change the
 
01:42:01.709 --> 01:42:01.719 align:start position:0%
use now if someone was let's say let's
 
01:42:04.629 --> 01:42:04.639 align:start position:0%
say um an organization nonprofit or
 
01:42:07.229 --> 01:42:07.239 align:start position:0%
for-profit facilitating um recovery
 
01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
housing wanted to use a multi family
 
01:42:11.629 --> 01:42:11.639 align:start position:0%
dwelling so it had six units or seven
 
01:42:13.709 --> 01:42:13.719 align:start position:0%
units eight units and they wanted to
 
01:42:15.390 --> 01:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
make it so that each unit someone who is
 
01:42:17.950 --> 01:42:17.960 align:start position:0%
in recovery would live in there um or
 
01:42:19.270 --> 01:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
they could even do it so there are two
 
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
unrated people living in each um
 
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit that's not change of use
 
01:42:25.790 --> 01:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
in many zoning ordinances that's still a
 
01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:27.679 align:start position:0%
multif family dwelling now if all of a
 
01:42:29.149 --> 01:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
sudden if it's a single family dwelling
 
01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
and you're putting four five six people
 
01:42:33.149 --> 01:42:33.159 align:start position:0%
or even in a multi-dwelling unit you're
 
01:42:34.750 --> 01:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
trying to put more than four people in
 
01:42:37.470 --> 01:42:37.480 align:start position:0%
each dwelling unit then it becomes congr
 
01:42:39.629 --> 01:42:39.639 align:start position:0%
use the use changes and typically you
 
01:42:43.550 --> 01:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
need to go get a variance um I'd like to
 
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
also mention you know multi again so
 
01:42:47.070 --> 01:42:47.080 align:start position:0%
that's a distinction so multif family is
 
01:42:49.390 --> 01:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
not congregate use there's multif family
 
01:42:52.229 --> 01:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
use there's congregate use um and any
 
01:42:54.510 --> 01:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
municipality can adopt the language in
 
01:42:56.990 --> 01:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
this legislation on their own it sounds
 
01:42:58.950 --> 01:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
like to me the previous municipality
 
01:43:00.270 --> 01:43:00.280 align:start position:0%
spoke that they've adopted a lot of
 
01:43:02.189 --> 01:43:02.199 align:start position:0%
these things in their ordinances um and
 
01:43:03.470 --> 01:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
it's their belief that that's a benefit
 
01:43:05.550 --> 01:43:05.560 align:start position:0%
to their Community um we've had more
 
01:43:07.310 --> 01:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities tell us that this mandate
 
01:43:09.870 --> 01:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
would make it harder for them to have
 
01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
safe responsible zoning ordinances that
 
01:43:15.149 --> 01:43:15.159 align:start position:0%
promote the health welfare and safety of
 
01:43:17.629 --> 01:43:17.639 align:start position:0%
their municipalities um I'd also like to
 
01:43:19.390 --> 01:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
point out that if a for-profit is
 
01:43:21.709 --> 01:43:21.719 align:start position:0%
commercial use uh that's also a change
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
from residential to commercial if it's
 
01:43:24.830 --> 01:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
it's owned by a for-profit or it's being
 
01:43:28.030 --> 01:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
used by a for-profit so um so that's
 
01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
something that would impact it too so
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden if any for-profit were
 
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
operate a dwelling unit in any Zone as a
 
01:43:38.669 --> 01:43:38.679 align:start position:0%
um as a recovery home you know we'd have
 
01:43:40.350 --> 01:43:40.360 align:start position:0%
concerns that they would try to maybe
 
01:43:42.510 --> 01:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
mix the Waters of is this really a
 
01:43:45.030 --> 01:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
residential use versus a commercial use
 
01:43:47.310 --> 01:43:47.320 align:start position:0%
um you know to to the vice Chairman's
 
01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
point this is part of the reason why
 
01:43:52.030 --> 01:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
these are dealt with locally and by the
 
01:43:54.070 --> 01:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
voters of adopting ordinances and I'd
 
01:43:56.070 --> 01:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
also like to point out that um many
 
01:43:58.149 --> 01:43:58.159 align:start position:0%
communities don't regulate congregate
 
01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
living situations and the reason why is
 
01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
because of many small municipalities
 
01:44:04.030 --> 01:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
it's not an issue right if you have you
 
01:44:06.229 --> 01:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
know six unrelated people who decide to
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
rent a home on a 2 acre lot that's you
 
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
know zoned for you know or that has like
 
01:44:13.350 --> 01:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
a three-bedroom or a four-bedroom septic
 
01:44:16.350 --> 01:44:16.360 align:start position:0%
system there's no impact on the abutters
 
01:44:17.629 --> 01:44:17.639 align:start position:0%
or the municipality or its
 
01:44:18.990 --> 01:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure but where this really
 
01:44:20.310 --> 01:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
becomes a problem is where they are
 
01:44:22.510 --> 01:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
regulated which is denser areas and
 
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
College towns so um it's our belief that
 
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
those communities have developed over a
 
01:44:29.709 --> 01:44:29.719 align:start position:0%
you know multi-decade period to ensure
 
01:44:31.629 --> 01:44:31.639 align:start position:0%
that each zoning district has a capacity
 
01:44:33.229 --> 01:44:33.239 align:start position:0%
and the ability to deal with the types
 
01:44:34.990 --> 01:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
of dwellings and how the dwellings are
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
used and it's probably best to not um
 
01:44:41.070 --> 01:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
disrupt that reasonable and and planning
 
01:44:43.950 --> 01:44:43.960 align:start position:0%
that's been done for decades and um I'll
 
01:44:46.470 --> 01:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
take any questions if you guys have
 
01:44:49.510 --> 01:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
any thank you Mr Des what questions from
 
01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:51.109 align:start position:0%
any thank you Mr Des what questions from
Mr

01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
Des see thank you for coming minute sir
 
01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:56.709 align:start position:0%
Des see thank you for coming minute sir
thank

01:44:56.709 --> 01:44:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:00.229 --> 01:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
you okay uh I have one more card left
 
01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:02.639 align:start position:0%

you
 
01:45:11.950 --> 01:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
hi hi uh I'm Jonathan Gerson uh I'm an
 
01:45:14.149 --> 01:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
operator so I thought I'd I'd sit up
 
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
here and give you uh my perspective
 
01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
without giving you a whole Spiel I'd
 
01:45:19.870 --> 01:45:19.880 align:start position:0%
rather just open it up to you know some
 
01:45:21.070 --> 01:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
questions but just to give you a little
 
01:45:23.589 --> 01:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
bit of my background um
 
01:45:27.189 --> 01:45:27.199 align:start position:0%
go the uh agency is into action so we're
 
01:45:30.870 --> 01:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
living um we've been operating since
 
01:45:34.550 --> 01:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
2017 um we have homes for men and homes
 
01:45:38.669 --> 01:45:38.679 align:start position:0%
for women um all the homes are certified
 
01:45:41.310 --> 01:45:41.320 align:start position:0%
um I've been doing the work uh also as
 
01:45:45.189 --> 01:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
an advocate um I support new operators
 
01:45:47.470 --> 01:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
you know throughout the state I have
 
01:45:50.229 --> 01:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
been in front of many zoning boards in
 
01:45:53.310 --> 01:45:53.320 align:start position:0%
front of many planning boards um both on
 
01:45:56.310 --> 01:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
behalf of my own homes uh projects that
 
01:45:58.950 --> 01:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
I wanted to attempt in other
 
01:46:01.390 --> 01:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh and also for those PE
 
01:46:03.790 --> 01:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
you know those people that I work with
 
01:46:06.510 --> 01:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
and I've seen the challenges of not
 
01:46:09.750 --> 01:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
having uh a definition of recovery
 
01:46:13.390 --> 01:46:13.400 align:start position:0%
housing um I've seen it play out and
 
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
I've been in a lot of uh zoning and
 
01:46:19.109 --> 01:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
planning board meetings where um the
 
01:46:22.270 --> 01:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
board itself um wanted to support the
 
01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:23.950 align:start position:0%
board itself um wanted to support the
application

01:46:23.950 --> 01:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
application
 
01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
but naturally uh the nimi issues come up
 
01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:30.719 align:start position:0%
and the entire
 
01:46:33.270 --> 01:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
neighborhood comes out in full
 
01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
force and the zoning board's hands are
 
01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
tied despite them wanting to support the
 
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
application um typically our type
 
01:46:47.910 --> 01:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
of uh I don't want to speak I don't want
 
01:46:49.550 --> 01:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
to speak legally but typically it
 
01:46:51.390 --> 01:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem we meet the variance
 
01:46:53.790 --> 01:46:53.800 align:start position:0%
criteria specifically
 
01:46:56.589 --> 01:46:56.599 align:start position:0%
um all the criteria and where we're
 
01:46:58.470 --> 01:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
looking for a reasonable accommodation
 
01:47:01.310 --> 01:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
under the Fair Housing Act um many
 
01:47:03.390 --> 01:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
zoning boards and planning boards around
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
the state don't seem to be prepared to
 
01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
um really rule on those types of
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
applications so again I I've seen
 
01:47:14.550 --> 01:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities zoning boards planning
 
01:47:17.629 --> 01:47:17.639 align:start position:0%
boards want to support these homes and
 
01:47:20.709 --> 01:47:20.719 align:start position:0%
have these homes in their Community they
 
01:47:24.189 --> 01:47:24.199 align:start position:0%
work with rcos you know Community
 
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
organizations healthc Care organizations
 
01:47:29.550 --> 01:47:29.560 align:start position:0%
and they all want these homes they do
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
because they know that they
 
01:47:34.109 --> 01:47:34.119 align:start position:0%
work but they don't have any and they're
 
01:47:36.629 --> 01:47:36.639 align:start position:0%
not going to have any because operators
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
like me wouldn't dare go to certain
 
01:47:41.870 --> 01:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
cities and towns in the state because we
 
01:47:43.589 --> 01:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
know we
 
01:47:47.189 --> 01:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
know um so having this
 
01:47:51.189 --> 01:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
defined um because as a residential use
 
01:47:54.030 --> 01:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
and bringing the part parties that
 
01:47:56.790 --> 01:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
really know how they operate which would
 
01:47:59.270 --> 01:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
be the State Fire Marshall's office who
 
01:48:01.629 --> 01:48:01.639 align:start position:0%
you've heard from because this the way I
 
01:48:03.709 --> 01:48:03.719 align:start position:0%
read this legislation it
 
01:48:07.709 --> 01:48:07.719 align:start position:0%
requires us to notify the municipality
 
01:48:10.870 --> 01:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
hey we're here we're we're here which
 
01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
then requires us to notify State Fire
 
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
Marshall's office have them do their
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
walkthroughs um and it also requires us
 
01:48:22.990 --> 01:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
to notify uh the certifying body and and
 
01:48:25.470 --> 01:48:25.480 align:start position:0%
maintain certification so now you have
 
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
the all the parties that really should
 
01:48:30.910 --> 01:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
be providing oversight of of these
 
01:48:33.070 --> 01:48:33.080 align:start position:0%
recovery houses so what you're going to
 
01:48:35.709 --> 01:48:35.719 align:start position:0%
have is you're going to
 
01:48:38.030 --> 01:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
have the good there are a lot of good
 
01:48:40.629 --> 01:48:40.639 align:start position:0%
homes out there and this I think would
 
01:48:43.030 --> 01:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
remove some of those quote unquote Bad
 
01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:44.629 align:start position:0%
remove some of those quote unquote Bad
actors

01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:44.639 align:start position:0%
actors
 
01:48:47.070 --> 01:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
that you've maybe heard some of the
 
01:48:50.910 --> 01:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
complaints about because I would like to
 
01:48:53.470 --> 01:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
say I think I'm one of the good actors
 
01:48:56.390 --> 01:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
and a lot of people have success in our
 
01:49:00.229 --> 01:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
homes uh and we need homes like like I
 
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
provide and like a lot of other people
 
01:49:06.510 --> 01:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
like myself provide um so I'm here to
 
01:49:08.870 --> 01:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you might have
 
01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
thank you what questions do we have uh
 
01:49:13.950 --> 01:49:13.960 align:start position:0%
representative Walker what size home do
 
01:49:17.950 --> 01:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
you run so we have eight um and they're
 
01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
all different um so we have two types of
 
01:49:23.870 --> 01:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
houses we have a
 
01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
the more structured house which we
 
01:49:28.149 --> 01:49:28.159 align:start position:0%
certify is what's called a level three
 
01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
house is some more support there's more
 
01:49:33.390 --> 01:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
uh for example in a level three house
 
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
they do a morning meditation every
 
01:49:37.550 --> 01:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
morning together um they have their
 
01:49:40.109 --> 01:49:40.119 align:start position:0%
weekly house meeting they're provided
 
01:49:43.149 --> 01:49:43.159 align:start position:0%
some recovery support case management
 
01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
from somebody offsite that doesn't live
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
there um and those are level three homes
 
01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
um we have uh in those homes we have
 
01:49:55.390 --> 01:49:55.400 align:start position:0%
three men's homes those are those are
 
01:49:58.270 --> 01:49:58.280 align:start position:0%
approximately 18 men uh they're large
 
01:50:00.390 --> 01:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
homes they're all approximately 4,500
 
01:50:02.669 --> 01:50:02.679 align:start position:0%
5,000 square ft total square
 
01:50:05.709 --> 01:50:05.719 align:start position:0%
footage um and then we have three uh two
 
01:50:08.870 --> 01:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
smaller women's homes uh then those are
 
01:50:11.149 --> 01:50:11.159 align:start position:0%
one is a single family and one is a two
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
family uh those have 11 women um and
 
01:50:17.510 --> 01:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
then the remaining three homes are what
 
01:50:20.270 --> 01:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
we what I call a phase 2 home these are
 
01:50:21.589 --> 01:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
for people that have been with us for
 
01:50:24.430 --> 01:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
about a year uh they meet certain other
 
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
criteria they've been St you know stable
 
01:50:29.669 --> 01:50:29.679 align:start position:0%
employment for long period of time they
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
Mee in certain uh recovery goals um we
 
01:50:35.270 --> 01:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
do practice a 12-step program so they
 
01:50:37.709 --> 01:50:37.719 align:start position:0%
have to have met certain you know
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
accomplishments in that program again
 
01:50:42.870 --> 01:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
stable employment uh and some other
 
01:50:44.470 --> 01:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
things been compliant with all of our
 
01:50:46.229 --> 01:50:46.239 align:start position:0%
house requirements for an extended
 
01:50:48.589 --> 01:50:48.599 align:start position:0%
period of time uh once they once they
 
01:50:51.149 --> 01:50:51.159 align:start position:0%
are at that point and they choose to
 
01:50:54.310 --> 01:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
step down to a phase two uh home um we
 
01:50:55.990 --> 01:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
we do have those options for both men
 
01:50:58.910 --> 01:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
and women um less less structure there's
 
01:51:01.790 --> 01:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
a reduction in the cost to their weekly
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
fee um and uh and those homes one is a
 
01:51:08.669 --> 01:51:08.679 align:start position:0%
single F
 
01:51:11.310 --> 01:51:11.320 align:start position:0%
uh they're all single family they're all
 
01:51:13.709 --> 01:51:13.719 align:start position:0%
single family how many bedrooms
 
01:51:13.719 --> 01:51:15.310 align:start position:0%
single family how many bedrooms
about

01:51:15.310 --> 01:51:15.320 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:51:18.870 --> 01:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
um one of them is uh five
 
01:51:21.310 --> 01:51:21.320 align:start position:0%
bedroom two of them are five
 
01:51:23.550 --> 01:51:23.560 align:start position:0%
bedroom and
 
01:51:26.550 --> 01:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
and the other one is six bedroom thank
 
01:51:30.149 --> 01:51:30.159 align:start position:0%
you followup great the I can see I've
 
01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
been on a planning board in Rochester
 
01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
for 18 years so you know about a
 
01:51:38.910 --> 01:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
property oh yeah and I can tell you you
 
01:51:40.350 --> 01:51:40.360 align:start position:0%
are going to run into problems with
 
01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
zoning boards just the way they're
 
01:51:44.109 --> 01:51:44.119 align:start position:0%
designed because you have to meet their
 
01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
five criteria for hardship right and I
 
01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
don't think you probably don't meet one
 
01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
of them cuz it's not designed for that
 
01:51:53.189 --> 01:51:53.199 align:start position:0%
sort of thing correct so that's a that's
 
01:51:55.350 --> 01:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
a tough hurdle to get around correct and
 
01:51:57.030 --> 01:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
the planning board you're right you're
 
01:51:59.629 --> 01:51:59.639 align:start position:0%
going to have all the the neighborhood
 
01:52:01.589 --> 01:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
come out in the planning board and I
 
01:52:04.270 --> 01:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
have public input
 
01:52:06.589 --> 01:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
and I can see some planning board
 
01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
members getting uh yeah kind of
 
01:52:10.750 --> 01:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
concerned that they're going against
 
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
what the community wants so I think you
 
01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
do have a tough road to go through that
 
01:52:17.109 --> 01:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
kind of permanent system but I think
 
01:52:19.109 --> 01:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
it's a necessary one because
 
01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
I it's it's a complicated issue
 
01:52:26.910 --> 01:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
I know we've had uh a lot of uh
 
01:52:28.669 --> 01:52:28.679 align:start position:0%
boardrooms filled with people because of
 
01:52:30.669 --> 01:52:30.679 align:start position:0%
boarding houses because oh man did the
 
01:52:31.790 --> 01:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods come out against the
 
01:52:34.350 --> 01:52:34.360 align:start position:0%
boarding room houses in in certain
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods so I can see you getting
 
01:52:38.189 --> 01:52:38.199 align:start position:0%
into a dense neighborhood is going to be
 
01:52:40.830 --> 01:52:40.840 align:start position:0%
difficult you're more have to be on
 
01:52:43.830 --> 01:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
the less less dense
 
01:52:47.229 --> 01:52:47.239 align:start position:0%
areas thank you okay I represent Dolan
 
01:52:52.189 --> 01:52:52.199 align:start position:0%
may I add one one thing to that um so uh
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
again my I've tried projects in in other
 
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
cities and towns that I I couldn't move
 
01:52:59.589 --> 01:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
forward in uh after some obstacles and
 
01:53:01.470 --> 01:53:01.480 align:start position:0%
challenges in front of zoning or
 
01:53:04.470 --> 01:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
planning but so primarily uh I do
 
01:53:07.629 --> 01:53:07.639 align:start position:0%
understand Manchester very very well um
 
01:53:11.550 --> 01:53:11.560 align:start position:0%
and what's unfortunate is the way the
 
01:53:13.750 --> 01:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
zoning map is laid
 
01:53:17.950 --> 01:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
out if you follow the zoning map and and
 
01:53:20.229 --> 01:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
the zoning ordinance where it's
 
01:53:23.109 --> 01:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
identified as congregated housing in the
 
01:53:24.870 --> 01:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
interpretation is we are congregate
 
01:53:27.589 --> 01:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
housing according to their table of uses
 
01:53:30.910 --> 01:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
then you are only allowed in the
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
toughest neighborhoods in the city and I
 
01:53:37.069 --> 01:53:37.079 align:start position:0%
would I do want to say that those are
 
01:53:39.069 --> 01:53:39.079 align:start position:0%
some of the neighborhoods that people in
 
01:53:42.270 --> 01:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
recovery desperately need to
 
01:53:45.750 --> 01:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
escape and um so yeah I want to say that
 
01:53:47.430 --> 01:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
as well I don't disagree with that
 
01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
that's not exactly a place that you want
 
01:53:52.589 --> 01:53:52.599 align:start position:0%
someone in recovery in right too many
 
01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
Temptations or influences that could be
 
01:53:58.069 --> 01:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
detriment yeah thank
 
01:54:01.149 --> 01:54:01.159 align:start position:0%
you he representative Dolan please thank
 
01:54:05.669 --> 01:54:05.679 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh thank you for taking my
 
01:54:09.270 --> 01:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
question you you seem to um indicate
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
that you're aware that many zoning
 
01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
boards would like to have more recovery
 
01:54:16.109 --> 01:54:16.119 align:start position:0%
houses but they're reluctant to approve
 
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
it probably because of adverse public
 
01:54:23.149 --> 01:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
reaction to it are you looking
 
01:54:26.589 --> 01:54:26.599 align:start position:0%
for us in the legislature to
 
01:54:30.350 --> 01:54:30.360 align:start position:0%
mandate that the zoning boards approve
 
01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:34.069 align:start position:0%
mandate that the zoning boards approve
recovery

01:54:34.069 --> 01:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:36.669 --> 01:54:36.679 align:start position:0%
housings I think by having a definition
 
01:54:38.669 --> 01:54:38.679 align:start position:0%
of what recovery housing is would be
 
01:54:41.790 --> 01:54:41.800 align:start position:0%
incredibly helpful um because again I've
 
01:54:43.870 --> 01:54:43.880 align:start position:0%
been in front of I don't want to name
 
01:54:45.550 --> 01:54:45.560 align:start position:0%
the municipality but a very small
 
01:54:47.629 --> 01:54:47.639 align:start position:0%
municipality so the zoning ordinance I
 
01:54:49.510 --> 01:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
don't even think it was adopted until
 
01:54:52.709 --> 01:54:52.719 align:start position:0%
like 2005 their first zoning ordinance
 
01:54:55.109 --> 01:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
there was nothing even close remotely
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
close in their ordinance to what we do
 
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
um and so it was almost impossible to
 
01:55:02.990 --> 01:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
even give a
 
01:55:06.270 --> 01:55:06.280 align:start position:0%
proposal um it would be very helpful in
 
01:55:09.950 --> 01:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
trying to uh present an
 
01:55:14.229 --> 01:55:14.239 align:start position:0%
application or uh you know uh to be able
 
01:55:17.069 --> 01:55:17.079 align:start position:0%
to open an a recovery house uh if there
 
01:55:20.510 --> 01:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
was a definition for it does uh as
 
01:55:23.149 --> 01:55:23.159 align:start position:0%
followup does this legislation fulfill
 
01:55:25.189 --> 01:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
that requirement in your mind to offer
 
01:55:29.910 --> 01:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:34.030 --> 01:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
yes any other questions go ahead sir
 
01:55:36.390 --> 01:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um in your experience with
 
01:55:38.550 --> 01:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
those larger houses is it still as
 
01:55:40.189 --> 01:55:40.199 align:start position:0%
effective for each person that walks in
 
01:55:41.629 --> 01:55:41.639 align:start position:0%
the door as it would be for some of the
 
01:55:43.310 --> 01:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
houses with fewer people in them in
 
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
terms of staying sober and kind of
 
01:55:48.149 --> 01:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
staying with that mission to um stay
 
01:55:49.589 --> 01:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
clean and kind of move
 
01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
on absolutely and it was for me just you
 
01:55:56.430 --> 01:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
know and complete disclosure I moved up
 
01:55:59.709 --> 01:55:59.719 align:start position:0%
here from Boston uh I'm a Massachusetts
 
01:56:01.870 --> 01:56:01.880 align:start position:0%
transplant I love New Hampshire I came
 
01:56:05.950 --> 01:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
up here in uh early 2016 and uh I moved
 
01:56:08.030 --> 01:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
into a recovery house one of the few
 
01:56:09.310 --> 01:56:09.320 align:start position:0%
that was around back then in New
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we I think there was about
 
01:56:13.350 --> 01:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
five or six and and I came up here and
 
01:56:16.990 --> 01:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
into a house of about 18 to uh no 19
 
01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
guys and it saved my life um there's a
 
01:56:22.270 --> 01:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
sweet spot I have noticed that the women
 
01:56:24.910 --> 01:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
women's homes do better little smaller
 
01:56:28.270 --> 01:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
size men seem to do well in more of a
 
01:56:31.870 --> 01:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
fraternity type Brotherhood than uh uh
 
01:56:35.109 --> 01:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
the women's homes do so smaller homes
 
01:56:36.990 --> 01:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
for the women's at least for interaction
 
01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.069 align:start position:0%
for the women's at least for interaction
sober

01:56:40.069 --> 01:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:43.470 --> 01:56:43.480 align:start position:0%
living any other questions I just got a
 
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
couple uh how long would you usually
 
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
stay in recovery house you mentioned a
 
01:56:50.589 --> 01:56:50.599 align:start position:0%
couple of different phases I guess so
 
01:56:53.470 --> 01:56:53.480 align:start position:0%
when I do a phone screen uh with so I do
 
01:56:55.750 --> 01:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
the phone screens for the men um I have
 
01:56:59.270 --> 01:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
a I have a recovery case manager that uh
 
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
does all the women's phone screens I try
 
01:57:05.870 --> 01:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
to keep a uh uh some distance um and um
 
01:57:07.830 --> 01:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
but when I do a phone screen I always
 
01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
recommend a minimum of six of or I ask
 
01:57:13.589 --> 01:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
for an an agreement a commitment to 6
 
01:57:17.189 --> 01:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
months but I recommend one year um and I
 
01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
was actually just looking um at
 
01:57:22.390 --> 01:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
January's average length of Stak cuz I
 
01:57:24.709 --> 01:57:24.719 align:start position:0%
know somebody had asked about transient
 
01:57:26.709 --> 01:57:26.719 align:start position:0%
um our average length of stay for
 
01:57:30.589 --> 01:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
January was 252 days for our eight
 
01:57:33.069 --> 01:57:33.079 align:start position:0%
people that had left the residence so
 
01:57:34.990 --> 01:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
out of that out of those eight people
 
01:57:37.430 --> 01:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
that left the residence five we
 
01:57:39.270 --> 01:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
considered to be a positive discharge
 
01:57:42.030 --> 01:57:42.040 align:start position:0%
they moved on towards Independent Living
 
01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh three of those were uh and then the
 
01:57:46.750 --> 01:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
other three were reoccurrence uh and
 
01:57:48.629 --> 01:57:48.639 align:start position:0%
they one of them was only with us for 4
 
01:57:51.430 --> 01:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
days they were not ready um and when
 
01:57:53.470 --> 01:57:53.480 align:start position:0%
somebody does have a reoccurrence I've
 
01:57:56.189 --> 01:57:56.199 align:start position:0%
been doing this for a long time I also
 
01:57:58.510 --> 01:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
uh at one point did work uh in substance
 
01:58:01.109 --> 01:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
abuse treatment I have a lot of good uh
 
01:58:03.550 --> 01:58:03.560 align:start position:0%
Partnerships throughout the community uh
 
01:58:06.310 --> 01:58:06.320 align:start position:0%
when somebody wants help I'm very good
 
01:58:08.910 --> 01:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
at getting somebody right back into a
 
01:58:11.229 --> 01:58:11.239 align:start position:0%
level of care that they that is best
 
01:58:16.390 --> 01:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:19.589 --> 01:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
them uh what's like the average cost per
 
01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
month is a sliding scale does everyone
 
01:58:24.750 --> 01:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
pay the same or how does that work um
 
01:58:26.790 --> 01:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
there there's different costs from the
 
01:58:29.390 --> 01:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
uh from the level three to the level two
 
01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
um so the level three is
 
01:58:34.910 --> 01:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
$225 per week and the level two is $200
 
01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:36.750 align:start position:0%
$225 per week and the level two is $200
per

01:58:36.750 --> 01:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
per
 
01:58:38.870 --> 01:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
week and for that
 
01:58:41.550 --> 01:58:41.560 align:start position:0%
$225 they are provided all the
 
01:58:44.950 --> 01:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
Furnishings um all the utilities uh
 
01:58:48.189 --> 01:58:48.199 align:start position:0%
computer access coffee cream or sugar
 
01:58:51.069 --> 01:58:51.079 align:start position:0%
cleaning supplies uh and also uh Case
 
01:58:54.149 --> 01:58:54.159 align:start position:0%
Management Services that are not uh
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
those are not reimbursable or some
 
01:58:57.950 --> 01:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
people say we we charge for those
 
01:58:59.870 --> 01:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
Services we do not charge for those
 
01:59:02.669 --> 01:59:02.679 align:start position:0%
Services those are not uh Medicaid
 
01:59:05.910 --> 01:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
reimburse reimbursable or at least we we
 
01:59:08.430 --> 01:59:08.440 align:start position:0%
do not
 
01:59:12.830 --> 01:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
so uh one last question I'm sorry uh a
 
01:59:15.709 --> 01:59:15.719 align:start position:0%
lot of times people that have been uh
 
01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
involved in crimes may have some type of
 
01:59:21.109 --> 01:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
follow-up counseling or whatever do you
 
01:59:22.830 --> 01:59:22.840 align:start position:0%
provide that service can someone like
 
01:59:24.589 --> 01:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
that stay at one of your places or how
 
01:59:25.950 --> 01:59:25.960 align:start position:0%
does where do you fit in the whole
 
01:59:29.950 --> 01:59:29.960 align:start position:0%
pyramid I guess of um so you're required
 
01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh so it I one of our biggest partners
 
01:59:34.470 --> 01:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
are the recovery courts both maram
 
01:59:37.350 --> 01:59:37.360 align:start position:0%
County and Hillsboro um recovery courts
 
01:59:39.950 --> 01:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
I got the pleasure of going to uh
 
01:59:41.990 --> 01:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
maramont County's recovery Court
 
01:59:44.629 --> 01:59:44.639 align:start position:0%
graduation uh two weeks ago three out of
 
01:59:47.629 --> 01:59:47.639 align:start position:0%
the five uh graduates were our residents
 
01:59:49.470 --> 01:59:49.480 align:start position:0%
or alumni and then they had a guest
 
01:59:52.390 --> 01:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
speaker uh that was a graduate of ours
 
01:59:54.910 --> 01:59:54.920 align:start position:0%
about two years ago um so we have
 
01:59:57.870 --> 01:59:57.880 align:start position:0%
incredible Partnerships with them um and
 
02:00:01.069 --> 02:00:01.079 align:start position:0%
yeah uh if you are in a recovery court
 
02:00:03.910 --> 02:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
you are required and mandated by us to
 
02:00:05.510 --> 02:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
fulfill all the requirements of that
 
02:00:08.510 --> 02:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
program um you are required to fulfill
 
02:00:10.790 --> 02:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
all the Aftercare recommendations from

02:01:17.510 --> 02:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health around our state uh we
 
02:01:19.430 --> 02:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
were we've been involved with this bill
 
02:01:21.189 --> 02:01:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh we worked uh you know going back two
 
02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
years we've worked with with the fire
 
02:01:24.069 --> 02:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
marshall office everyone else you heard
 
02:01:26.830 --> 02:01:26.840 align:start position:0%
here today and crafting this language um
 
02:01:27.990 --> 02:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
I don't want to repeat too much of
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
what's been said I do want to to kind of
 
02:01:32.550 --> 02:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
clarify and re reinforce a few different
 
02:01:34.910 --> 02:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
points first off I I just want to again
 
02:01:36.430 --> 02:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
level set and I know it was stated at
 
02:01:38.830 --> 02:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
the the hearing and I know um you know
 
02:01:40.750 --> 02:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
as we've alluded to here lots of people
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
and communities have uh strong feelings
 
02:01:45.550 --> 02:01:45.560 align:start position:0%
when recovery residences are proposed
 
02:01:47.430 --> 02:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
but the data is absolutely crystal clear
 
02:01:49.229 --> 02:01:49.239 align:start position:0%
that neighborhoods that do have recovery
 
02:01:50.669 --> 02:01:50.679 align:start position:0%
houses in them have lower rates of
 
02:01:52.669 --> 02:01:52.679 align:start position:0%
substance use have lower of Overdose
 
02:01:55.270 --> 02:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
have lower rates of of substance related
 
02:01:58.189 --> 02:01:58.199 align:start position:0%
crime so I just want to level set these
 
02:02:00.390 --> 02:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
are nothing but a benefit to the the
 
02:02:01.750 --> 02:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
public health of our of both the
 
02:02:03.910 --> 02:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
individuals who who reside in these
 
02:02:06.350 --> 02:02:06.360 align:start position:0%
houses and uh to the communities at
 
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
large um secondly I really want to
 
02:02:10.510 --> 02:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
reinforce you know there's been lots of
 
02:02:12.910 --> 02:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
talk uh today about uh occupancy
 
02:02:15.750 --> 02:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
restrictions um again you know as as we
 
02:02:17.790 --> 02:02:17.800 align:start position:0%
heard from Mr salvucci from NH core
 
02:02:19.709 --> 02:02:19.719 align:start position:0%
there is an occupancy restriction
 
02:02:21.109 --> 02:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
related to you know for for their
 
02:02:24.629 --> 02:02:24.639 align:start position:0%
certification uh 50 square foots per bed
 
02:02:28.149 --> 02:02:28.159 align:start position:0%
uh I would I don't know offhand the nhpr
 
02:02:29.310 --> 02:02:29.320 align:start position:0%
Restriction but I'm sure that there's
 
02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
one there as well I have to imagine that
 
02:02:33.189 --> 02:02:33.199 align:start position:0%
these are in line with generally local
 
02:02:36.149 --> 02:02:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh local zoning regulations um a few
 
02:02:38.510 --> 02:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
other points uh there's been lots of
 
02:02:40.310 --> 02:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
talk about for-profit and nonprofit
 
02:02:42.510 --> 02:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
issue I'm not entirely sure about the
 
02:02:44.109 --> 02:02:44.119 align:start position:0%
the relevance of this to my knowledge
 
02:02:45.910 --> 02:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm not a zoning expert you you all
 
02:02:47.550 --> 02:02:47.560 align:start position:0%
are but I don't believe that local
 
02:02:50.030 --> 02:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
residential zoning regulates land use
 
02:02:51.910 --> 02:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
based on an occupant's tax status
 
02:02:53.350 --> 02:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that for any other type of
 
02:02:54.550 --> 02:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
housing to my knowledge and I don't
 
02:02:56.589 --> 02:02:56.599 align:start position:0%
believe it it it would apply in this
 
02:02:59.350 --> 02:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
case um there's also been uh questions
 
02:03:01.069 --> 02:03:01.079 align:start position:0%
about the transient and non-transient
 
02:03:02.550 --> 02:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
language I want to be clear this
 
02:03:04.430 --> 02:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
language was based on the international
 
02:03:05.990 --> 02:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
residential codes Definition of
 
02:03:08.470 --> 02:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
transient as being not more than 30 days
 
02:03:10.589 --> 02:03:10.599 align:start position:0%
occupancy uh again that's comes from the
 
02:03:13.470 --> 02:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
international residential code uh and
 
02:03:15.629 --> 02:03:15.639 align:start position:0%
again as you just heard from Mr Gerson
 
02:03:17.510 --> 02:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know in this at his home's
 
02:03:19.550 --> 02:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
average lengths of stays are are are are
 
02:03:22.430 --> 02:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
250 days plus well well in uccess of the
 
02:03:27.629 --> 02:03:27.639 align:start position:0%
30-day uh definition has applied here um
 
02:03:28.669 --> 02:03:28.679 align:start position:0%
I think those are the main points I
 
02:03:30.589 --> 02:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
wanted to make again we strongly support
 
02:03:31.950 --> 02:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
this bill and ask you and thank you for
 
02:03:33.310 --> 02:03:33.320 align:start position:0%
