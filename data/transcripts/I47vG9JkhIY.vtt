finance thank you Mr chairman so uh
 
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
first off we have House Bill 1
 
00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
005 relative to judicial training he
 
00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 align:start position:0%
understand that representative Maguire
 
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
has an amendment that will be passed
 
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
out yes thank you Mr chairman so um
 
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
you'll um Mr Hoffman is handing out
 
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1113 H and just I'll give you
 
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 align:start position:0%
some background while while he's doing
 
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
that um so this is a bill to um tell the
 
00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
Judiciary to add a Jud a uh training
 
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
coordinator uh primarily for judges but
 
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
also for for others who work in the
 
00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 align:start position:0%
Judiciary and and to create um
 
00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 align:start position:0%
procedures for uh regular training uh
 
00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
regular training for judges under the
 
00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
direction of the chief justice so when
 
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
we heard this bill um first of all it it
 
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
was it it would would have acted in 60
 
00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
days um and we originally thought well
 
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
just let them put this in in their um
 
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
next budget in a coordinated manner so
 
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
our original Amendment and the one that
 
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
we approved in committee 9 nothing was
 
00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 align:start position:0%
to um have it take effect July 1st
 
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
2025 and it also because the Judiciary
 
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
basically said you're you're messing
 
00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
with our internal um actions here and so
 
00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:26.199 align:start position:0%
we we the bill had a lot of very a lot
 
00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
of specific things about a judge will do
 
00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:31.639 align:start position:0%
so many hours of training and such and
 
00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:33.639 align:start position:0%
such a you know schedule and things like
 
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
that and so we cut that back to give
 
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
them a little more flexibility mostly
 
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
because it didn't have any concept that
 
00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
a brand new judge needs more training
 
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
and a judge who's been there for 20
 
00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
years needs less training right it was
 
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
it was strictly uh every judge every
 
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
year so much training so that didn't
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
seem to us to make a lot of sense so we
 
00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
decided to give them more flexibility
 
00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:01.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 align:start position:0%
so but the new amendment that was so but
 
00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:08.879 align:start position:0%
we also have a several bills dealing
 
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
with bail and um one of the things in
 
00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:15.879 align:start position:0%
common in all these other bills is that
 
00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
the bail Commissioners need training
 
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.360 align:start position:0%
right so the bail Commissioners are
 
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
operating today and while we didn't hear
 
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of complaints about they made bad
 
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
decisions except in maybe one or two
 
00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
isolated cases but it seems to be the
 
00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
general General thought that they need
 
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
to be trained more professionally they
 
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
don't they don't just sort of jump in
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
and do their work so we thought subse so
 
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
subsequent to our actions on
 
00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
105 I thought and and others seem to
 
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
agree is that this would be a good
 
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle for bail commissioner training
 
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
because bail Commissioners are are
 
00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:57.080 align:start position:0%
nominally they're they're parts of the
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
Judiciary they're sort of the first
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
person from the Judiciary that an
 
00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
accused person meets and so um so this
 
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:08.360 align:start position:0%
amendment uh
 
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
113h changes the effective date back to
 
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
60 days right so that's what it was in
 
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
the original bill so it makes it so the
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
the the coordinator is hired right away
 
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
and then it it puts training of bail
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
Commissioners into the purview of this
 
00:08:29.149 --> 00:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
trainer of this uh training commissioner
 
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
right so it will help us with the other
 
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:33.640 align:start position:0%
bills by getting the the bail
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioners trained right away so I
 
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
would hope you would um approve this
 
00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%
amendment and so I will move Amendment
 
00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:45.949 align:start position:0%
amendment and so I will move Amendment
1113

00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:45.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
H okay so has everyone seen the
 
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
amendment do we need a roll call or can
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
we do this by show of hands I have a
 
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
question Mr
 
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
chairman represent Lehman thanks Mr
 
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
chairman I see there's some um numbers
 
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
in here as far as the amount of
 
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
time um blocks of time for
 
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:13.240 align:start position:0%
training is there an additional fiscal
 
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
impact to this Dan
 
00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:20.360 align:start position:0%
or so I I believe this amendment is in
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
that in those
 
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.030 align:start position:0%
that in those
respects

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
respects
 
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
um is um the same as the amendment we
 
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
passed in in committee N9 to nothing so
 
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
less there's there's sort of less detail
 
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
in here than was in the original Bill
 
00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:39.560 align:start position:0%
the original Bill had you know 16 hours
 
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:41.720 align:start position:0%
of this and five hours of that and all
 
00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
that sort of stuff this is much much
 
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
reduced it does say for for initial
 
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
train there's a Min minimum initial
 
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
training for
 
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
judges which is specified in the bill
 
00:09:58.069 --> 00:09:58.079 align:start position:0%
right um orientation for new judges
 
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
education for new judges an hour of
 
00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
training on each of these topics Etc but
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
it's very minimal um instruction all
 
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
that is copied from the original Bill we
 
00:10:12.509 --> 00:10:12.519 align:start position:0%
left out um so many hours for clerks and
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
Court administrators and you know all
 
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
stuff but it's still the bill still says
 
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
that those people will get appropriate
 
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
training so so our our my basic
 
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
philosophy with this is you know tell
 
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
them to to do training and if later it
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
seems to be that that they're not doing
 
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
enough then we can come back and have
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
detail further
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
questions representative evil thank you
 
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I guess I had a question
 
00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
I know that we're working on the other
 
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
bail reform bills and I wondered um
 
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
especially I guess this is addressed to
 
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
our division chair how this dovetails
 
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
with what's under
 
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:03.160 align:start position:0%
consideration in that and then the other
 
00:11:05.629 --> 00:11:05.639 align:start position:0%
thing is I think the senate had passed a
 
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
bill to increase the hourly fee to 60
 
00:11:11.069 --> 00:11:11.079 align:start position:0%
from 50 but this sticks with the
 
00:11:11.079 --> 00:11:14.350 align:start position:0%
from 50 but this sticks with the
original

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
50 may I answer who wants the answer yes
 
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
so yeah so this bill
 
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
um it adds a little money in the sense
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
that it bail Commissioners will be paid
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
during their training so it requires
 
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:31.240 align:start position:0%
them to do eight hours of annual
 
00:11:34.269 --> 00:11:34.279 align:start position:0%
training um and they will get uh pay of
 
00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
$50 for those eight hours I mean that's
 
00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:43.079 align:start position:0%
not very much money um and uh that's all
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
it does not this does not affect what
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
the bail Commissioners are paid for
 
00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:50.519 align:start position:0%
their actual service right when they
 
00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
when they meet with an accused and and
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
make a decision that's going to be in
 
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
another bill um but we anticipate what
 
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
the House pass passed and I guess we
 
00:12:03.269 --> 00:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
anticipate passing is that that will be
 
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
$50 and then you know we can send it to
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
the Senate and see if you know make a
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
decision later about 50 versus
 
00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:15.079 align:start position:0%
60 further questions I could add to that
 
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
so the division is working on House Bill
 
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
318 Senate Bill 249 and Senate bill and
 
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
looking at Senate Bill
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
252 uh tomorrow I'm bringing an
 
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
amendment forward to combine all those
 
00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
I've been working with uh chairman Roy
 
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
talking to Chairman Roy and others about
 
00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
trying to bring this together so we can
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
get something over the Finish Line in my
 
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:41.240 align:start position:0%
bill tomorrow there's an increase in the
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
bill commissioner fee to $60 in line
 
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
with the Senate which this bill has a
 
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
$50 or this amendment is a $50 amount so
 
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get everything on one
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
bill so it's uh easier to understand and
 
00:12:57.389 --> 00:12:57.399 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note is consistent on each
 
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
bill instead of um inconsistent on all
 
00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839 align:start position:0%
the different bills which we've already
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
seen the division so I'm not sure where
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
I'm falling down on this amendment to be
 
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
words representative grai um would it be
 
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate to send this back to the
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
division to get it merged in with the
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
bills if if the amendment is not uh
 
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
adopted that might be the way to
 
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.910 align:start position:0%
adopted that might be the way to
go

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:13:32.189 --> 00:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
or I could withdraw my motion and do
 
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
that yeah yeah okay so are we do we want
 
00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:39.079 align:start position:0%
to withdraw the whole bill or we want to
 
00:13:41.069 --> 00:13:41.079 align:start position:0%
vote on what what's been passed so far
 
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
out of
 
00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
division yeah vote on the bill as it
 
00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.310 align:start position:0%
division yeah vote on the bill as it
came

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
came
 
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
to okay and and deal the and put the
 
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
bail stuff into the other Bill bail
 
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
bills he has that you'll be working on
 
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
in division one all right
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
so um so I don't think this quite Works
 
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
no I I would can we not act at this
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh obviously I I
 
00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:50.959 align:start position:0%
want to State for the committee that all
 
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
nine of us are concerned with
 
00:14:55.389 --> 00:14:55.399 align:start position:0%
homelessness among youth but there were
 
00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
a number of issues with the approach
 
00:14:59.629 --> 00:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
that this bill was going to take I was
 
00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
trying to identify unused arpa funds to
 
00:15:05.069 --> 00:15:05.079 align:start position:0%
fund a new state employee position in
 
00:15:07.629 --> 00:15:07.639 align:start position:0%
the office of the child advocate uh to
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
expand their scope of services Beyond
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
student uh children that are in the
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
system uh to homeless youth up to the
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
age of 25 years old uh in order to
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
coordinate uh resources to uh house
 
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
those youths uh instead of spending that
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
onetime money on one-time needs or to
 
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
expand bed services at homeless shelters
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
it was going to be using arpa funds are
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
directing to find arpa funds to add
 
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
another state employee that would then
 
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
have to be sustained with general fund
 
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
dollars in the future uh which is why I
 
00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:39.959 align:start position:0%
would I would move why I moved in
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate thank
 
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
you okay representative Sweeny moves in
 
00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:47.839 align:start position:0%
expedient representative Maguire seconds
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
Is there further discussion
 
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
representative grassy and we had
 
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
discussion from the the state um and the
 
00:15:57.069 --> 00:15:57.079 align:start position:0%
department division for child advocacy
 
00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns that they had to the
 
00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:01.160 align:start position:0%
children that this bill deals with are
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
children that are not in the system
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
these are children that are not in
 
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
foster care they're not in the judicial
 
00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
system anywhere they're not they they've
 
00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
never been identified as as children in
 
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
need and what this you know it it
 
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
affects tremendously lgbtq children who
 
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
have been basically thrown out of their
 
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
homes these kids have never been in
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
trouble before but they have no place to
 
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
live and what this does is it's small
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
money to um to advocate for these
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
children to leverage this position into
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
more resources to be able to provide
 
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
alternative housing for these children
 
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:35.720 align:start position:0%
uh it it's something that right now the
 
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
department cannot deal with they are not
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
statuto allowed to deal with these
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
children and this bill will change that
 
00:16:42.309 --> 00:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
so that they can deal with those
 
00:16:44.309 --> 00:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
children uh this is something that is
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
ongoing it's not just a one-year thing
 
00:16:48.309 --> 00:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh it's certainly something that we need
 
00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:51.880 align:start position:0%
to identify um uh to identify these
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
children and be able to provide services
 
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
to the children these are children who
 
00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
are at a very high risk of sex
 
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
trafficking I mean we talk about sex
 
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
traffic on the floor of the house this
 
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
is someplace we can actually do
 
00:17:06.429 --> 00:17:06.439 align:start position:0%
something about it and i' hope that we
 
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
could overturn this committee decision
 
00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:10.839 align:start position:0%
here and send this to the floor as ought
 
00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:12.029 align:start position:0%
here and send this to the floor as ought
to

00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:12.039 align:start position:0%

1279 relative to payment by the state of
 
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
a portion of the retirement system
 
00:19:49.149 --> 00:19:49.159 align:start position:0%
contributions of political
 
00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
subdivision employers like to recognize
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:55.640 align:start position:0%
chairman thank
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
you okay one of the most important jobs
 
00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
of the legislature to pass a balanced
 
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
budget in order to accomplish this the
 
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
task this task all expenditures must be
 
00:20:07.149 --> 00:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
limited to a given amount supported by
 
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:09.400 align:start position:0%
expected Revenue the idea of the state
 
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
paying for municipal and County
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
Employees Retirement share leaves too
 
00:20:15.549 --> 00:20:15.559 align:start position:0%
much uncertainty in the 24 months after
 
00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
the budget is approved the state has no
 
00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
control over how many new employees are
 
00:20:22.029 --> 00:20:22.039 align:start position:0%
hired or any pay raises granted to them
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
this legislation Echoes a bill from last
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
year with the same title of property tax
 
00:20:29.549 --> 00:20:29.559 align:start position:0%
reduction it would not accomplished the
 
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
claim of that title in 2023 the budget
 
00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
sent back $100 million of direct
 
00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:37.559 align:start position:0%
property tax reduction in reduced swept
 
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
payments a request of any group asking
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
how did that reduction work out is
 
00:20:45.149 --> 00:20:45.159 align:start position:0%
answered with the answer I never saw one
 
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
this proposal would possibly reduce
 
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
those taxes by 28 million there would be
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
even less notice of such a reduction the
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
amount of work this proposed entails
 
00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:55.480 align:start position:0%
proposal entails at all the
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
administrative levels is not worth all
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
the fuss over such a minor effort
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
in 2012 we stopped contributing to the
 
00:21:03.549 --> 00:21:03.559 align:start position:0%
employer share of the retirement system
 
00:21:05.789 --> 00:21:05.799 align:start position:0%
for non-state employees the difference
 
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
for that contribution was largely made
 
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
up by increases in the employee share
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
which was far less than the employer
 
00:21:15.149 --> 00:21:15.159 align:start position:0%
share at the time those payments would
 
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
have cost the state 60 million now they
 
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
would be over 100
 
00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
million I would move inexpedient to
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.909 --> 00:21:34.919 align:start position:0%
speak okay yeah okay um so to me the the
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
what you just heard was the blurb I
 
00:21:39.269 --> 00:21:39.279 align:start position:0%
think for for the calendar um all right
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
but to me it's it's the the steps we got
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
here so this bill is identical to last
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
year's house bill 50 and if you remember
 
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
house bill 50 so did this pay 7 and a
 
00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
half% of of U municipalities retirement
 
00:21:58.830 --> 00:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
costs um uh I believe not teachers right
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
this is just um others but
 
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
um but uh we as a group um put it in the
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
budget well first of all we passed it on
 
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
the floor with a a very different
 
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:16.919 align:start position:0%
Amendment so the amendment changed it
 
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:20.200 align:start position:0%
from a from this ongoing 7 and a half%
 
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:23.480 align:start position:0%
which is roughly but but we we changed
 
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
it to an an immediate pay down of the
 
00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.269 align:start position:0%
it to an an immediate pay down of the
unfunded

00:22:27.269 --> 00:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
liability of $50 million so onetime
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
roughly the same amount right so $50
 
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559 align:start position:0%
million onetime pay down of the
 
00:22:39.269 --> 00:22:39.279 align:start position:0%
liability that helps
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities and school districts and
 
00:22:45.269 --> 00:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
others by reducing their ongoing costs
 
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
for retirement not as much as this this
 
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
shot would be for the specifics but long
 
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
term right sort of over the over the
 
00:22:59.789 --> 00:22:59.799 align:start position:0%
long term and um so that's what we did
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
we we passed it in the house we put it
 
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
into the budget the Senate took it out
 
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
and then this year we did the same thing
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
we passed it in the house as House Bill
 
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
436 and I've already testified in the
 
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
Senate finance committee on exactly that
 
00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:19.799 align:start position:0%
on the $50 million pay down of the
 
00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:22.360 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability they did not
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
immediately itl it so I'm hoping it has
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
some chances over there um but
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
essentially my point is the reason this
 
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
should be itl is that we've already
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
considered this to death it's the same
 
00:23:38.669 --> 00:23:38.679 align:start position:0%
thing as we did last year we did this
 
00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
year it you know let's do it again next
 
00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
year I guess or something but not now
 
00:23:47.269 --> 00:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the amendment
 
00:23:47.279 --> 00:23:48.310 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the amendment
representative

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:52.360 align:start position:0%
grassy um yes sir um Mr chairman one of
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
the things that this bill uh does is is
 
00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
that this is a bill that we've seen yes
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
year after year is because our city
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
councils our Board of alderman our
 
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
Selectmen um our local governing
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
agencies have requested that we put this
 
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
bill in every year um when this was when
 
00:24:12.269 --> 00:24:12.279 align:start position:0%
the retirement fund was originally
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
instituted the state said that they
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
would pay a share of the municipality's
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
cost in order to get them into the
 
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
system that promise has been degraded
 
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
every year since and in 2012 it was
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
significantly removed and what since
 
00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
that time I served on the council that
 
00:24:30.269 --> 00:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
time we saw a tax increase an immediate
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
tax increase because of that and the
 
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
thing is since that time communities
 
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
have been asking that we that we put
 
00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:36.919 align:start position:0%
some of that support back into the
 
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
system the 7 half% is a small ask from
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
the communities but it's something that
 
00:24:42.669 --> 00:24:42.679 align:start position:0%
the thing is is that will bring
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
stability to some local budgets and they
 
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
have requested it year after year and
 
00:24:49.149 --> 00:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
they will continue to request it until
 
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
this legisl take Jackson to honor the
 
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
promise that was made to them when they
 
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
entered the retirement system and I
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
would urge the uh the committee to uh to
 
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
approve this uh U to approve this
 
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
bill representative papich Miller thank
 
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair just a couple of things uh
 
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
first um as somebody who's been the
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
finance director for the town of wiam I
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
do know that the legislature cannot make
 
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
promises for future legislators they can
 
00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:20.200 align:start position:0%
only speak to their intent and keep
 
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
their word while they're in office when
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
a new term starts a new term starts and
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
realities change second on General
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
government accountability grounds
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
here the level of government that's
 
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:37.480 align:start position:0%
responsible for driving the cost by
 
00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
making the decisions to hire people and
 
00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:42.200 align:start position:0%
offer them benefits should be the level
 
00:25:44.669 --> 00:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
of government that should address those
 
00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
costs they are the ones hiring and they
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
are the ones who should pay for the
 
00:25:52.029 --> 00:25:52.039 align:start position:0%
benefits when we separate the people who
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
benefit from the people who pay we end
 
00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
up with less than optimal behaviors and
 
00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to be very polite here so I
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
would suggest that this bill uh should
 
00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
uh not see the light of day thank
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:17.549 --> 00:26:17.559 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none the motion is
 
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:19.880 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate the clerk will
 
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%

1307 providing a supplemental
 
00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation for members of the
 
00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
retirement system receiving an
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
accidental disability retirement
 
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
allowance I'd like to call on
 
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire I'll I'll move
 
00:28:53.549 --> 00:28:53.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
pass thank you I'm sorry I I I didn't
 
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
hear that about to pass was a second a
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
second represent Sweeny all right
 
00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
so um this bill um corrects an oversight
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
from I'm not sure if it's two or three
 
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
years ago but in the last session there
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
was a one-time uh $500 payment to
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
retirees um who had worked 20 years or
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
more as a as a supplement kind of
 
00:29:27.509 --> 00:29:27.519 align:start position:0%
a it's not quite a cola but it's a
 
00:29:27.519 --> 00:29:28.669 align:start position:0%
a it's not quite a cola but it's a
similar

00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
similar
 
00:29:28.679 --> 00:29:29.909 align:start position:0%
similar
and

00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
um the the oversight in that payment was
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
that there are some retirees who retire
 
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.149 align:start position:0%
that there are some retirees who retire
with

00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
disability they retire when they get
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
their disability and they don't
 
00:29:45.389 --> 00:29:45.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily make it to 20 years right
 
00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
but but it it almost everyone involved
 
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
in this uh decision thinks that they
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
deserve this $500 payment so this bill
 
00:30:00.269 --> 00:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
is a $500 payment for those who retire
 
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
due to disability and it comes to
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
there's there's like 802 such people
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
comes to $400,000 onetime payment and um
 
00:30:14.669 --> 00:30:14.679 align:start position:0%
it is possible that that some employees
 
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
will receive this payment twice in the
 
00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
sense that they did retire after 20
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
years with a dis Disability Pension but
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
that's felt to be sort of di Minimus so
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
um thank
 
00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:35.480 align:start position:0%

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
you every two years the Secretary of
 
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
State contracts to have 5,000 copies of
 
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution printed
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
copy of 6 by9 in and has pictures of the
 
00:33:17.549 --> 00:33:17.559 align:start position:0%
elected leaders so it is only current
 
00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
for a two-year term the distribution is
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
mainly for the fourth graders who Tour
 
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
the State House as part of their
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
education the General Distribution is
 
00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
somewhat limited the size is not as
 
00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
convenient as most of the United States
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
contrib constitutions that different
 
00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:33.320 align:start position:0%
groups distribute the majority of those
 
00:33:36.509 --> 00:33:36.519 align:start position:0%
us Constitutions are 3 in by six and a
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
half and easily fit in a pocket this
 
00:33:40.629 --> 00:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
bill proposes to print a large number of
 
00:33:42.509 --> 00:33:42.519 align:start position:0%
that smaller size and make them more
 
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
generally available without expiration
 
00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
because we wouldn't be having any
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
pictures of people in there we' just
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
have the the wording of the Constitution
 
00:33:53.549 --> 00:33:53.559 align:start position:0%
by leaving out the elected elected
 
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
pictures the effective date will be
 
00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
after the results of the next election
 
00:33:59.629 --> 00:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
in order to include any Constitutional
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
Amendments that might pass in that
 
00:34:03.549 --> 00:34:03.559 align:start position:0%
election we hope the size and lack of
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
pictures will reduce the cost which we
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
would told it would as well as making it
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
hand you to carry all of our citizens
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
should be familiar with this document
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
not just legislators and fourth graders
 
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
pass um Mr chairman I'd like to move um

00:34:27.069 --> 00:34:27.079 align:start position:0%
of you and it was the amendment that the
 
00:34:32.669 --> 00:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:35.629 --> 00:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
okay Amendment 09
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
09h and representative Maguire is
 
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
recognized to explain it yes so
 
00:34:45.069 --> 00:34:45.079 align:start position:0%
um this amendment does a couple of
 
00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
different things it moves the effective
 
00:34:50.589 --> 00:34:50.599 align:start position:0%
date to uh July 1st 2025 so the
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State can put the printing
 
00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:56.200 align:start position:0%
costs into his next budget we anticipate
 
00:34:58.349 --> 00:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
that the constitution might
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
change um in November because we passed
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
that um Constitutional Amendment about
 
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
slavery and so it seems likely that that
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
would pass and the Constitution would
 
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
change so so if we printed this now it
 
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
would become obsolete quite quickly so
 
00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
um that's why the delay and then also uh
 
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment allows if if people want
 
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
you know a a case of constitutions for
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
for handing out to groups or something
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
it allows the Secretary of State to
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
charge them a uh a fee for for that
 
00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
printing so you know he'll still um hand
 
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
them out to visitors with no charge but
 
00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
but if somebody wants a hundred of them
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
or something he he'll charge some costs
 
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
so that's what this amendment does is
 
00:35:52.309 --> 00:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
Sweeny okay any further discussion on

second thank you I'm sorry I I'll move
 
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1141 H uh which actually has
 
00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative Lehman's name at the top
 
00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
but it is the amendment that we passed
 
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
in our
 
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
division um so this is a bill to uh
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
regulate music
 
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
therapists and um there are roughly 30
 
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
of them in the state the um office of
 
00:41:57.870 --> 00:41:57.880 align:start position:0%
professional professional life
 
00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:01.720 align:start position:0%
licenser uh plans to uh charge them a
 
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
licensing fee of roughly
 
00:42:08.589 --> 00:42:08.599 align:start position:0%
$150 every two years the bill as it came
 
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
to us in included a new employee for the
 
00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:18.079 align:start position:0%
oplc and so that's not justified by you
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
know 30 time 150 divided by two that
 
00:42:25.349 --> 00:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
kind of thing so so this amendment um
 
00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:28.839 align:start position:0%
changes the new employee to to a simple
 
00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
$33,000 a year of additional temporary
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
part-time or overtime that to in their
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
budget which is which is is more or less
 
00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:43.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:46.109 --> 00:42:46.119 align:start position:0%

fight but you you are welcome to vote as
 
00:43:59.910 --> 00:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
you please thank
 
00:44:04.109 --> 00:44:04.119 align:start position:0%
you hle thank you Mr share I understand
 
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
the desire of those pushing for the bill
 
00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:09.400 align:start position:0%
to allow um this discipline to have
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
access to insurance money um I think the
 
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
free market solves some of these I know
 
00:44:17.349 --> 00:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
that when we sought medical care for one
 
00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
of our kids that wasn't covered by
 
00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
insurance that wasn't covered by
 
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
anything else it was important enough
 
00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
for us to get that treatment that we
 
00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
dove into our checking account I think
 
00:44:30.349 --> 00:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
just because we create access to
 
00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:32.079 align:start position:0%
insurance doesn't mean we need to to
 
00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
prohibit the growth of this by adding
 
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
one more license and more oversight by
 
00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:39.720 align:start position:0%

00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
1647 relative to the calculation of
 
00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:43.839 align:start position:0%
group to retirement benefits in the
 
00:51:43.839 --> 00:51:48.190 align:start position:0%
group to retirement benefits in the
retirement

00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:50.589 --> 00:51:50.599 align:start position:0%
system and representative Maguire would
 
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
like to speak to the amendment which you
 
00:51:54.789 --> 00:51:54.799 align:start position:0%
should have in front of you which is
 
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
1134 um yes thank you I'll move
 
00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:58.630 align:start position:0%
1134 um yes thank you I'll move
Amendment

00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:01.160 align:start position:0%
1134 so
 
00:52:05.309 --> 00:52:05.319 align:start position:0%
um just just to set the stage so uh this
 
00:52:08.829 --> 00:52:08.839 align:start position:0%
is a very important bill and and it was
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
very heavily supported by the house uh
 
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
in its original form last year which was
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
436 so it was a bill to improve the
 
00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
retirement um circumstances of group two
 
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
members that's police fire and
 
00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:29.470 align:start position:0%
members that's police fire and
Corrections

00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:29.480 align:start position:0%
Corrections
 
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
and um because they had been uh it
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
originally started as strictly for those
 
00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
who were hired as of
 
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
2010 but not yet vested right because in
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
2010 we made significant changes to the
 
00:52:51.870 --> 00:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
retirement system both in the
 
00:52:55.069 --> 00:52:55.079 align:start position:0%
multiplier and the way that that income
 
00:52:59.309 --> 00:52:59.319 align:start position:0%
was calculated and and the um some of
 
00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:01.640 align:start position:0%
the dates by which you know the the
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
length of service required to get
 
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
retirement things like that so there
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
were significant changes in
 
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
2010 maybe 2011 and 2011 really and um
 
00:53:18.510 --> 00:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
so that's been brewing and now um this
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
bill the original House Bill
 
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
4036 undid all of those changes for all
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
of those affected employees not for
 
00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
employees younger than that not not for
 
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
those who weren't yet hired in
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
2011 all right um House Bill 436 would
 
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
have cost $250 million spread over five
 
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
years it was passed strongly by the
 
00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
house we put it in the budget the Senate
 
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
took it out of the budget um and the
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
Senate substituted a commission to study
 
00:53:57.069 --> 00:53:57.079 align:start position:0%
the whole issue the commission met this
 
00:53:59.589 --> 00:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
summer it was chaired by representative
 
00:54:01.589 --> 00:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
Maguire not
 
00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:07.839 align:start position:0%
me and um they voted 8 to six in favor
 
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
of uh improving just the multiplier of
 
00:54:15.549 --> 00:54:15.559 align:start position:0%
those implo of but but for all group two
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
employees who are not yet retired not
 
00:54:24.589 --> 00:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
just the ones hired prior to 2011 so um
 
00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:26.200 align:start position:0%
it change so what that's what this bill
 
00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
does does is it changes the
 
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
multiplier um from uh the current 2% to
 
00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
25% times length of service times um
 
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
times average final
 
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
compensation and um so the total cost of
 
00:54:47.789 --> 00:54:47.799 align:start position:0%
this for existing employees and
 
00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:49.640 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether those employees
 
00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
are state employees most of them are
 
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
Municipal Employees is $53 million
 
00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:56.990 align:start position:0%
Municipal Employees is $53 million
roughly

00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:01.400 align:start position:0%
and um so this amendment is just sort of
 
00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
a technical change to the bill because
 
00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:05.240 align:start position:0%
the bill didn't include the
 
00:55:08.589 --> 00:55:08.599 align:start position:0%
appropriation so this is the
 
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
appropriation um for that $53 million
 
00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:15.400 align:start position:0%
that's what the amendment is um but it
 
00:55:18.349 --> 00:55:18.359 align:start position:0%
it this is not a a substantive change to
 
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
the bill it's it's um just makes it
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
correct basically from a financial point
 
00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:28.799 align:start position:0%
of view now um there is this bill does
 
00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
create ongoing costs to municipalities
 
00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
and the state in the sense that
 
00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
employees who are not in group two who
 
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
are not yet employees people who are not
 
00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
yet hired well they're going to have a
 
00:55:46.589 --> 00:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
better pension ongoing than current law
 
00:55:48.309 --> 00:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
and therefore they'll be slightly more
 
00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:51.640 align:start position:0%
expensive so so that cost is I believe
 
00:55:54.910 --> 00:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
it's roughly um you you have a fiscal
 
00:55:57.549 --> 00:55:57.559 align:start position:0%
note here but it's it's a little under 4
 
00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
million a year for the subdivision for
 
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
and and a little under a million a year
 
00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:07.160 align:start position:0%
for the state but you know it pays for
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
something which is a better um pension
 
00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:13.480 align:start position:0%
and the 2 and a half% is standard in
 
00:56:17.309 --> 00:56:17.319 align:start position:0%
this um occupation for our surrounding
 
00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:19.240 align:start position:0%
states from Massachusetts Maine and
 
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:23.240 align:start position:0%
Vermont and so therefore we have had a
 
00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:26.359 align:start position:0%
very hard time hiring uh group to
 
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
employees and this will go a long way to
 
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
to improving that situation speaking of
 
00:56:34.829 --> 00:56:34.839 align:start position:0%
which I I did not arrange
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
that timing was great
 
00:56:41.589 --> 00:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
though all right seconded by
 
00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:42.760 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin who's going to
 
00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
write the blur representative
 
00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
Griffin all right and be sure and
 
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
mention what the amendment
 
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
does all right so we have an amendment
 
00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:55.240 align:start position:0%
to adopt
 
00:56:59.230 --> 00:56:59.240 align:start position:0%
um Amendment 1134 to House Bill
 
00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:01.640 align:start position:0%
1647 is there any further discussion on
 
00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:03.270 align:start position:0%
1647 is there any further discussion on
the

00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:05.720 align:start position:0%

of

00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:06.520 align:start position:0%

before us now is
 
00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:29.240 align:start position:0%
1647 as a amended by 1134 ought to pass
 
00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:31.480 align:start position:0%

um I can you would represent Maguire
 
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'm I'm opposed to this bill um
 
01:02:38.269 --> 01:02:38.279 align:start position:0%
it what it it's basically um a
 
01:02:42.109 --> 01:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
straightforward subsidy for of two years
 
01:02:44.109 --> 01:02:44.119 align:start position:0%
if I remember correctly roughly it costs
 
01:02:44.119 --> 01:02:45.069 align:start position:0%
if I remember correctly roughly it costs
roughly

01:02:45.069 --> 01:02:45.079 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:49.799 align:start position:0%
$120,000 a year um for uh New Hampshire
 
01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:52.279 align:start position:0%
farmers of specific products that
 
01:02:54.510 --> 01:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the bill Maple and other
 
01:02:57.870 --> 01:02:57.880 align:start position:0%
things and um so it creates a program
 
01:03:01.269 --> 01:03:01.279 align:start position:0%
where schools can can apply for for this
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
money and then uh use it in their in
 
01:03:07.109 --> 01:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
their C spend the money with New
 
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire farmers and then um use the
 
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:13.039 align:start position:0%
products in their cafeterias and so on
 
01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
and um it just seems like a a lot of
 
01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
money for for a very little benefit
 
01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
because part of the bill I believe hires
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
someone to run the program right so
 
01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
um or at least a part-time someone to
 
01:03:30.309 --> 01:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
run the program so and there's
 
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
applications there's this there's that
 
01:03:36.309 --> 01:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
so so the actual benefit being
 
01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
um uh realized is fairly is small
 
01:03:42.910 --> 01:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
compared to to the expense so I'm I'm
 
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
going to be voting against this was the
 
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
employee at the at agriculture or at
 
01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:49.640 align:start position:0%
education I think it's at I believe it's
 
01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
at agriculture I don't have the bill in
 
01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:54.440 align:start position:0%
front of me unfortunately it's an
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
agriculture um
 
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
to to you know accept the applications
 
01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:01.559 align:start position:0%
hand out the money Etc very good further
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion representative
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
Edwards uh thank you Mr chair I I just
 
01:04:10.589 --> 01:04:10.599 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that um I I've been in
 
01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
previous terms committees where a bill
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
extremely similar to this has been
 
01:04:18.670 --> 01:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
debated and I've always come down on uh
 
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
no uh because I think we have a a market
 
01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:25.400 align:start position:0%
based economy that can make this happen
 
01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
it's just a money issue and I don't I
 
01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
don't think we should be uh
 
01:04:34.349 --> 01:04:34.359 align:start position:0%
incentivizing any dependency on a state
 
01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
program the farmers can Market their
 
01:04:39.549 --> 01:04:39.559 align:start position:0%
products the schools can buy their
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
products and with the with the addition
 
01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:45.559 align:start position:0%
of a $40,000 person this is just a
 
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of overhead so this is
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
me representative Heath thank you Mr
 
01:04:57.390 --> 01:04:57.400 align:start position:0%
chair um I'd like to speak in support of
 
01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
this bill we've seen it numerous times
 
01:05:02.829 --> 01:05:02.839 align:start position:0%
our Farmers work well with our school
 
01:05:05.549 --> 01:05:05.559 align:start position:0%
districts this is an opportunity to have
 
01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
a person work with our schools to bring
 
01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
the um food that comes from the farmers
 
01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
um we've see the wonderful work that
 
01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
they're doing with the farmers markets
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
across the state this will when my
 
01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:25.240 align:start position:0%
grandchildren and I love to work in the
 
01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:26.309 align:start position:0%
grandchildren and I love to work in the
garden

01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
garden
 
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
most kids like to work with in the
 
01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
garden this gives an opportunity for
 
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
someone to work with the schools to
 
01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
maybe even start one of their own
 
01:05:36.150 --> 01:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
Gardens I think this is a great
 
01:05:38.349 --> 01:05:38.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity and I definitely will be
 
01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
voting yes on the OTP thank you very
 
01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:43.480 align:start position:0%
much further discussion representative
 
01:05:46.589 --> 01:05:46.599 align:start position:0%
Griffin yes I'd like to point out that
 
01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
uh the fiscal committee dealt with a
 
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
bill some time ago that involved a half
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
a million dollars of government money
 
01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
and it went to the same virtually the
 
01:05:58.880 --> 01:05:59.870 align:start position:0%
and it went to the same virtually the
same

01:05:59.870 --> 01:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
purpose uh the problem with this bill is
 
01:06:05.349 --> 01:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
that the state money instead of going to
 
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
the end use goes
 
01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
primarily to personnel and
 
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
benefits and uh I think a half a million
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
dollars of the government money should
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
go a long way to solving the problem and
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
I don't think the state needs to get
 
01:06:22.829 --> 01:06:22.839 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
this thank
 
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
you pres tki thank you Mr
 
01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
chairman um I'd like to speak in support
 
01:06:35.190 --> 01:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
of this bill um the price tag is
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
relatively small for something that's
 
01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
going to have a big impact and be a win
 
01:06:41.269 --> 01:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
for Farmers a win for our small
 
01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
producers a win for our schools and a
 
01:06:45.470 --> 01:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
win for our school children here in the
 
01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
state part of the bill um is an
 
01:06:51.789 --> 01:06:51.799 align:start position:0%
educational portion that will bring uh
 
01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
programming to our school children to
 
01:06:56.269 --> 01:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
understand where their food comes from
 
01:06:58.510 --> 01:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
how it's grown this is more than just
 
01:07:01.829 --> 01:07:01.839 align:start position:0%
paying Farmers for food for cafeterias
 
01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
and I would encourage the committee to
 
01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
please support the opop
 
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
pass further discussion representative
 
01:07:11.829 --> 01:07:11.839 align:start position:0%
grassy yes uh Mr chairman I speak in in
 
01:07:13.309 --> 01:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
support of this as well and I I just
 
01:07:15.309 --> 01:07:15.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to correct some information here
 
01:07:17.069 --> 01:07:17.079 align:start position:0%
the bill in no way says that there will
 
01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
be a new person hired in any departments
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
it says that the department May contract
 
01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire Farm to school to
 
01:07:24.109 --> 01:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
support the program coordination
 
01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
management which New Hampshire Farm the
 
01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
school is already doing most of that
 
01:07:29.549 --> 01:07:29.559 align:start position:0%
work so uh this provides an opportunity
 
01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
for Farmers as been said to bring
 
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
product into the schools uh and
 
01:07:35.789 --> 01:07:35.799 align:start position:0%
particularly in smaller school districts
 
01:07:37.549 --> 01:07:37.559 align:start position:0%
that don't have the ability to do a lot
 
01:07:39.309 --> 01:07:39.319 align:start position:0%
of this stuff themselves I think a lot
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
of towns will benefit from this more
 
01:07:43.589 --> 01:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
than the bigger cities will

morning would you make the same comment
 
01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
you did this morning you were on a
 
01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:06.470 align:start position:0%
you did this morning you were on a
roll

01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
roll
 
01:16:10.189 --> 01:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
well that's uh Hy lots of pressure here
 
01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid so to make a long story short
 
01:16:17.070 --> 01:16:17.080 align:start position:0%
as much as I'm capable of
 
01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
that the essence of the bill is to
 
01:16:22.270 --> 01:16:22.280 align:start position:0%
establish certain due process rights for
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
campus community members that are facing
 
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
disciplinary reaction in you know our
 
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
public colleges and
 
01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
universities we've received testimony
 
01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
that uh most of such situations would
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
not escalate to the point where
 
01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
suspensions may be at risk and I would
 
01:16:42.669 --> 01:16:42.679 align:start position:0%
strongly suggest that for
 
01:16:45.629 --> 01:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
those infrequent cases where there is a
 
01:16:48.510 --> 01:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
disputed proceeding where you know the
 
01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
party being accused feel strong in the
 
01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
arena and they should have those process
 
01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
due process rights secure to them so
 
01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
they can defend themselves against an
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
accusation that they find is unjust it
 
01:17:02.709 --> 01:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
is a complicated area of the law that
 
01:17:05.669 --> 01:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
are interplays with Federal legislation
 
01:17:08.910 --> 01:17:08.920 align:start position:0%
and so on but this bill has been uh you
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
know thought very thoroughly and uh it's
 
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
a good
 
01:17:17.310 --> 01:17:17.320 align:start position:0%
bill there was also testimony on the
 
01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
size of the uh fiscal note and I think
 
01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
that it's important to notice that if
 
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
providing du process to the students and
 
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
other campus community members that are
 
01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
facing suspension is rather expensive
 
01:17:33.629 --> 01:17:33.639 align:start position:0%
that's a sign of the fact that
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
frequently we accuse them and we don't
 
01:17:38.669 --> 01:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
give them their due process rights and
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
therefore we risk reaching the incorrect
 
01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
conclusion and you know it's it's
 
01:17:48.669 --> 01:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
important to support this Bill thank you
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent I have a
 
01:17:53.709 --> 01:17:53.719 align:start position:0%
couple of comments representative Emer
 
01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
first uh
 
01:17:58.110 --> 01:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
we also we had testimony in in the
 
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
committee from a representative from the
 
01:18:02.830 --> 01:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
University system that said last year
 
01:18:06.430 --> 01:18:06.440 align:start position:0%
they had approximately 20,000 or plus
 
01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
issu issues or incidents or cases or
 
01:18:11.070 --> 01:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
what whatever we're calling them and of
 
01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
those 80 actually went to a hearing so
 
01:18:19.149 --> 01:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
the the drop off of uh pleading out or
 
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever you might want to call
 
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
it is very high um and so
 
01:18:29.189 --> 01:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
but the what we're trying to avoid is a
 
01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
kangaroo court where somebody shows up
 
01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
to for a hearing and they're declared
 
01:18:37.390 --> 01:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
guilty before they they even show up so
 
01:18:39.790 --> 01:18:39.800 align:start position:0%
what this does is it gives them rights
 
01:18:42.270 --> 01:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
so that the the hearings are not are not
 
01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:45.880 align:start position:0%
kangaroo courts thank you representative
 
01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
Heath thank you Mr chair um I would like
 
01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
to speak against this bill the
 
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
university system has a long standing
 
01:18:57.790 --> 01:18:57.800 align:start position:0%
disciplinary system that immediately
 
01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.310 align:start position:0%
disciplinary system that immediately
addresses

01:18:59.310 --> 01:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
01:19:03.070 --> 01:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
situations um that is particularly in
 
01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
compliance with Federal statutes this
 
01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
bill creates unnecessary costs for
 
01:19:10.990 --> 01:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
families and the university system
 
01:19:14.110 --> 01:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
Federal Law requires
 
01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
immediate steps to address
 
01:19:19.870 --> 01:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
situations um the sponsor could not
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
really talk to any specific data or
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
instances that this this bill would
 
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
address this creates a parallel system
 
01:19:31.229 --> 01:19:31.239 align:start position:0%
within our University system the
 
01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
university system spoke against this
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
bill this conflicts with our federal
 
01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
highered statutes and I would recommend
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
an itl motion on this bill I will not
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
support the art to pass thank you very
 
01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
much further discussion representative
 
01:19:49.870 --> 01:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
H thank you Mr chair if I recall
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
correctly this was a bill that there was
 
01:19:53.070 --> 01:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
a great discussion on the floor relative
 
01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
to due process
 
01:19:58.669 --> 01:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
and we would want it seems to me that we
 
01:20:00.669 --> 01:20:00.679 align:start position:0%
would want our campuses to truly be a
 
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
place where Free Speech can happen and
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
it is not necessarily guided and
 
01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
constrained by the con by the the
 
01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
management and the and the upper
 
01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
leadership of the university and becomes
 
01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
an echo box what we really want to do is
 
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
allow policies that let the students
 
01:20:20.189 --> 01:20:20.199 align:start position:0%
share the information they want as they
 
01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
continue in their education I will be
 
01:20:23.629 --> 01:20:23.639 align:start position:0%
supporting the
 
01:20:23.639 --> 01:20:25.750 align:start position:0%
supporting the
aass

01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
aass
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
represent hacken
 
01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
Phillips oh thank you Mr chair um I I
 
01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
too will be voting Against The Spill um
 
01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
for a few specific reasons um that
 
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative Heath already touched
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
upon but I just wanted to delineate a
 
01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
little further um in our subcommittee we
 
01:20:46.149 --> 01:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
heard no testimony that there was any
 
01:20:48.790 --> 01:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
example of any student or faculty member
 
01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
who had been denied their due process
 
01:20:52.669 --> 01:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
rights in a result of a disciplinary
 
01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
hearing and either the community colle
 
01:20:57.550 --> 01:20:57.560 align:start position:0%
colge system or the university system um
 
01:21:00.629 --> 01:21:00.639 align:start position:0%
and when um both the sponsors and other
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
folks giving testimony were asked you
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
know had they experienced any you
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
know EV had they come upon any evidence
 
01:21:11.310 --> 01:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
of the reason for this bill being
 
01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
necessary the only person who offered
 
01:21:16.629 --> 01:21:16.639 align:start position:0%
any um support was someone saying that
 
01:21:20.110 --> 01:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
they were trying to model um other
 
01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
states um who had passed similar
 
01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
legislation um to defeat I quote
 
01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
wokness unquote so um again there was no
 
01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
evidence that this was needed um
 
01:21:37.470 --> 01:21:37.480 align:start position:0%
furthermore um if if in case you know if
 
01:21:39.229 --> 01:21:39.239 align:start position:0%
in fact someone had been denied due
 
01:21:41.629 --> 01:21:41.639 align:start position:0%
process in either one of those systems
 
01:21:43.390 --> 01:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
you know they are still afforded the
 
01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to seek damages and Justice
 
01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
through our court system so I fail to
 
01:21:52.189 --> 01:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
understand why we would expand the
 
01:21:55.070 --> 01:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
government's footprint EXP spend
 
01:21:58.750 --> 01:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
additional costs for an additional quasi
 
01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
Judicial System Within These systems as
 
01:22:03.629 --> 01:22:03.639 align:start position:0%
opposed to just using the system in
 
01:22:05.189 --> 01:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
place that is already
 
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
working furthermore um both the
 
01:22:10.229 --> 01:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
Community College systems of New
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the University Systems in
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire testified that there were
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
no Appropriations to assist them in
 
01:22:20.590 --> 01:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
supporting this new infrastructure to
 
01:22:22.669 --> 01:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
guarantee these due process rights that
 
01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
again were not evidenced for any need so
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
you know there this bill is creating
 
01:22:32.830 --> 01:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
quite the snowball of infrastructure for
 
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
our state without giving an adequate
 
01:22:38.910 --> 01:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
support to fund it to run it to to
 
01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
operationalize it so um you know I'm
 
01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:43.719 align:start position:0%
having a lot
 
01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:46.639 align:start position:0%
of trouble trying to find out you know
 
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
to make sense of this in my mind of why
 
01:22:51.229 --> 01:22:51.239 align:start position:0%
it's needed and why it's appropriate to
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
pass lastly I'll just say that I am very
 
01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
concerned about the conflict of federal
 
01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
law that will be will be a problem if
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
this bill is passed because we're not
 
01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
just talking about you know future
 
01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
litigation coming down the road from
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
possible students or faculty who are
 
01:23:13.229 --> 01:23:13.239 align:start position:0%
denied certain rights but we're also
 
01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
talking about federal funds coming to
 
01:23:17.229 --> 01:23:17.239 align:start position:0%
our states to support these University
 
01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
and Community College systems if this
 
01:23:22.709 --> 01:23:22.719 align:start position:0%
bill goes into effect so this I think
 
01:23:25.950 --> 01:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
the testimony uncovered
 
01:23:29.149 --> 01:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
in our subdivision hearing shows
 
01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
substantial negative and adverse effects
 
01:23:34.750 --> 01:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to go into effect and
 
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
when in fact on the opposite end there
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
was no evidence or substantial testimony
 
01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
to show us that this bill is worthwhile
 
01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
for our state and for that reason for
 
01:23:44.910 --> 01:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
all of these reasons Mr chair I will not
 
01:23:46.470 --> 01:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
be supporting this
 
01:23:49.870 --> 01:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
bill representative Edwards uh thank
 
01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I I I think there
 
01:23:54.510 --> 01:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
are reports all over the country where D
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
process rights of college students have
 
01:24:01.229 --> 01:24:01.239 align:start position:0%
been uh impinged and um given that our
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
public schools are uh our government
 
01:24:06.510 --> 01:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
this isn't an issue of having government
 
01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
get involved our public school system at
 
01:24:11.149 --> 01:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
the University and college level or
 
01:24:14.229 --> 01:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
already government and as such they are
 
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
obligated to be protecting fully the
 
01:24:19.790 --> 01:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights of every student and the
 
01:24:23.189 --> 01:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
right to do process is uh is Central to
 
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
every every human right in terms of
 
01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
protecting us from an intrusive abusive
 
01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
government and and so it's given that
 
01:24:35.310 --> 01:24:35.320 align:start position:0%
it's an inherent uh and necessary and
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
important duty I'm I'm going to be
 
01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
voting for this because uh I I don't
 
01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
think they should be opposed to it
 
01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
because it's their obligation
 
01:24:49.149 --> 01:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:53.109 --> 01:24:53.119 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Emme yes the
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
argument about how much this is going to
 
01:24:58.830 --> 01:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
increase cost is kind of like a catch22
 
01:25:00.590 --> 01:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
discussion because if it's if it's going
 
01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
to increase cost that's saying they're
 
01:25:04.510 --> 01:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
not doing anything
 
01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
now I mean so they've got to have some
 
01:25:11.390 --> 01:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
cost at in the current program whatever
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
they're using I I don't I don't see
 
01:25:17.790 --> 01:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
where the increased cost comes from
 
01:25:21.310 --> 01:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
I thank you further
 
01:25:24.629 --> 01:25:24.639 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none the motion on
 
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1288 is ought to

a contentious one I
 
01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
recognize representative papichi mu for
 
01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:06.800 align:start position:0%

make a motion to adopt the um amendment
 
01:28:10.159 --> 01:28:11.229 align:start position:0%
make a motion to adopt the um amendment
number

01:28:11.229 --> 01:28:11.239 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:28:18.750 --> 01:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:22.830 --> 01:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
1304 you may speak to motion yeah U very
 
01:28:25.229 --> 01:28:25.239 align:start position:0%
briefly it's uh Common Sense amendment
 
01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
that we adopted uh in with that we
 
01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
recommended from Finance 2 with 90 there
 
01:28:33.629 --> 01:28:33.639 align:start position:0%
is a minor wording change where the
 
01:28:36.709 --> 01:28:36.719 align:start position:0%
original Bill said it applied only to
 
01:28:40.270 --> 01:28:40.280 align:start position:0%
renew decals but we also it's good
 
01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
policy to also apply to replace decals
 
01:28:45.310 --> 01:28:45.320 align:start position:0%
to decals it doesn't change anything in
 
01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
else in the bill it doesn't change the
 
01:28:50.070 --> 01:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal note so it's just housekeeping
 
01:28:52.990 --> 01:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
really so it is there is an amendment on
 
01:28:55.229 --> 01:28:55.239 align:start position:0%
this bill then right yes this is the
 
01:28:57.149 --> 01:28:57.159 align:start position:0%
motion we are discussing is for the
 
01:28:59.390 --> 01:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
amendment on the bill very good okay
 
01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
what's represent Heath seconds the the
 
01:29:09.550 --> 01:29:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
0933 Mr
 
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
chair representative hack Phil thank you
 
01:29:15.910 --> 01:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I just wanted to let the uh
 
01:29:18.430 --> 01:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
larger committee know that the amendment
 
01:29:20.070 --> 01:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
actually originates in the gel car
 
01:29:22.750 --> 01:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
committee which I help serve on and um
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
this is part of um
 
01:29:27.709 --> 01:29:27.719 align:start position:0%
concern that
 
01:29:30.350 --> 01:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
arose that there were fees being
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
possibly charged for replacement decals
 
01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
um that were not explicitly authorized
 
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
in law so this minor change just helps
 
01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
reaffirm that Authority thank you thank
 
01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:45.000 align:start position:0%

Mr chair the vote is 25 to Z any
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
affirmative okay I guess we'll put this
 
01:44:40.910 --> 01:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
on the regular calendar because it does
 
01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:42.109 align:start position:0%
on the regular calendar because it does
spend

01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
spend
 
01:44:44.990 --> 01:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
100,000 shows no money per
 
01:44:47.149 --> 01:44:47.159 align:start position:0%
year I think there's money a lot of
 
01:44:50.950 --> 01:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
money it it stipulates that a town can
 
01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
request up to $100,000 it doesn't
 
01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate anything but a fund will
 
01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
established yeah I believe Mickey yeah I
 
01:45:01.990 --> 01:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
think this has money is that correct it
 
01:45:07.229 --> 01:45:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:10.229 --> 01:45:10.239 align:start position:0%
it's so if the folks in division 2 will
 
01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
recall this bill allows the
 
01:45:15.350 --> 01:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities to seek uh funding with
 
01:45:17.149 --> 01:45:17.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal approval from those dis that
 
01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
Disaster Relief Fund which has $45,000
 
01:45:22.270 --> 01:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
in it there's no other mechanism here so
 
01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
I'd say this bill somewhat limited to
 
01:45:26.990 --> 01:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
that so you can decide if that's the
 
01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
threshold for consent or regular that
 
01:45:32.229 --> 01:45:32.239 align:start position:0%
we'll put it on the regular calendar and
 
01:45:34.030 --> 01:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
especially where it's 25 to Zer I don't
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
think we're going to have much
 
01:45:38.189 --> 01:45:38.199 align:start position:0%
discussion thank you very
 
01:45:40.709 --> 01:45:40.719 align:start position:0%

01:48:12.629 --> 01:48:12.639 align:start position:0%
I see so this is more for is is this an
 
01:48:15.470 --> 01:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
extension of that or is this completely
 
01:48:17.950 --> 01:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
different or yes it would be completely
 
01:48:19.870 --> 01:48:19.880 align:start position:0%
different it's not has nothing to do
 
01:48:21.350 --> 01:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
with Conway
 
01:48:24.430 --> 01:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
Conway North Conway Scenic Railroad
 
01:48:27.709 --> 01:48:27.719 align:start position:0%
is goes It goes from con North Conway
 
01:48:30.229 --> 01:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
back to Conway and then back that's
 
01:48:32.350 --> 01:48:32.360 align:start position:0%
that's the I think there there's one
 
01:48:35.589 --> 01:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
that leaves the station there in um wiip
 
01:48:38.550 --> 01:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
pasak where the Mount Washington is is
 
01:48:40.109 --> 01:48:40.119 align:start position:0%
that was that where the Conway Scenic
 
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
Railroad goes Representative no con
 
01:48:44.470 --> 01:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
Conway Scenic Railroad goes from North
 
01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
Conway to back to Conway South and then
 
01:48:51.310 --> 01:48:51.320 align:start position:0%
back to North Conway it also goes out
 
01:48:53.229 --> 01:48:53.239 align:start position:0%
north to to to
 
01:48:57.149 --> 01:48:57.159 align:start position:0%
Bartlet but but but this this Branch
 
01:49:00.270 --> 01:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
here goes from oopy to Madison and it's
 
01:49:02.270 --> 01:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
been not has not been used for many
 
01:49:05.550 --> 01:49:05.560 align:start position:0%
years oh all right so what what this
 
01:49:07.870 --> 01:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do would put put
 
01:49:10.990 --> 01:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
these people together to um come up with
 
01:49:13.510 --> 01:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
some kind of a master plan what we heard
 
01:49:15.310 --> 01:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
in testimony was really they just want
 
01:49:17.709 --> 01:49:17.719 align:start position:0%
to get it to the point where it's safe
 
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
and level and
 
01:49:22.350 --> 01:49:22.360 align:start position:0%
and you know and not not do anything
 
01:49:25.430 --> 01:49:25.440 align:start position:0%

representative Mari yeah I just wanted
 
01:49:29.950 --> 01:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
to clarify this is um a feasibility
 
01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
study regarding the snowmobiling walking
 
01:49:34.229 --> 01:49:34.239 align:start position:0%
and biking on an existing Trail this
 
01:49:36.669 --> 01:49:36.679 align:start position:0%
becomes a rail trail it's not about the
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
train it's about the rail trail and
 
01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
people's public use for it thank you
 
01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:42.430 align:start position:0%
people's public use for it thank you
representative

01:49:42.430 --> 01:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:49:44.950 --> 01:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
Edwards uh representative Murray may
 
01:49:47.910 --> 01:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
have just answered my question but I I I
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
would assume that the do already has
 
01:49:53.709 --> 01:49:53.719 align:start position:0%
authority to do strateg IC planning and
 
01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
already has a budget for senior managers
 
01:49:58.470 --> 01:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
who are supposed to be good at strategic
 
01:50:01.790 --> 01:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
planning and so I I just need to ask the
 
01:50:03.950 --> 01:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
question you know why do we have to
 
01:50:06.229 --> 01:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
legislate something the executive branch
 
01:50:08.709 --> 01:50:08.719 align:start position:0%
ought to just do because they're
 
01:50:11.870 --> 01:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
professionals my understanding if I may
 
01:50:15.390 --> 01:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
um thank thank you um the
 
01:50:18.510 --> 01:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
trail goes across several municipalities
 
01:50:20.350 --> 01:50:20.360 align:start position:0%
and areas and this is a way of bringing
 
01:50:22.310 --> 01:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
people from the disparate areas together
 
01:50:23.830 --> 01:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
and I I guess it requires a little bit
 
01:50:25.790 --> 01:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
of effort or
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps um recognition that it's okay
 
01:50:31.709 --> 01:50:31.719 align:start position:0%
for them to come together and and talk
 
01:50:31.719 --> 01:50:33.470 align:start position:0%
for them to come together and and talk
about

01:50:33.470 --> 01:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:50:36.270 --> 01:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
this if it passes the legislature then
 
01:50:38.910 --> 01:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
we've kind of instructed do to get busy
 
01:50:42.709 --> 01:50:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
it just a
 
01:50:49.629 --> 01:50:49.639 align:start position:0%

for 1199 and 1394 we need to know the
 
01:53:15.390 --> 01:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
authors of the minority reports on 1199
 
01:53:18.030 --> 01:53:18.040 align:start position:0%

in the calendar send you to P County
 
01:53:30.189 --> 01:53:30.199 align:start position:0%
that's what we'll do and if you made a
 
01:53:34.229 --> 01:53:34.239 align:start position:0%
motion uh on any of these bills please
 
01:53:35.790 --> 01:53:35.800 align:start position:0%
before you leave today I have to have
 
01:53:37.629 --> 01:53:37.639 align:start position:0%
the blur according to what the speaker
 
01:53:37.639 --> 01:53:39.750 align:start position:0%
the blur according to what the speaker
says

01:53:39.750 --> 01:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
and if you had a vote like 25 to zero
 
01:53:45.669 --> 01:53:45.679 align:start position:0%
you probably won't have to speak if you
 
01:53:49.069 --> 01:53:49.079 align:start position:0%
had a split vote and you made the motion
 
01:53:50.830 --> 01:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
you will probably have to speak on the
 
01:53:53.830 --> 01:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
01:53:59.149 --> 01:53:59.159 align:start position:0%
at least have a have a uh a pi and I
 
01:54:01.709 --> 01:54:01.719 align:start position:0%
will discuss with the two division heads
 
01:54:04.990 --> 01:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
who will do the pis on the split votes
 
01:54:08.189 --> 01:54:08.199 align:start position:0%
and either either the uh division chairs
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
or I will make the
 
01:54:13.550 --> 01:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
piis on those on those things so if you
 
01:54:15.870 --> 01:54:15.880 align:start position:0%
if you made a motion on a split vote be
 
01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
ready for discussion and have a have a
 
01:54:22.149 --> 01:54:22.159 align:start position:0%

01:55:46.990 --> 01:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
9:15 so uh without any further
 
01:55:50.430 --> 01:55:50.440 align:start position:0%
uh anything further
 
01:55:52.750 --> 01:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
no before we go
 
01:55:55.390 --> 01:55:55.400 align:start position:0%
I thank you all for your good work and
 
01:55:59.229 --> 01:55:59.239 align:start position:0%
uh as I said if you've made a motion and
 
01:56:03.390 --> 01:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
it was a split vote be ready for the uh
 
01:56:07.470 --> 01:56:07.480 align:start position:0%
for the speech if uh if not you probably
 
01:56:08.790 --> 01:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
don't have anything to worry about even
 
01:56:10.229 --> 01:56:10.239 align:start position:0%
though it's likely to be on the regular
 
01:56:12.589 --> 01:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
calendar if it spends money but I
 
01:56:15.069 --> 01:56:15.079 align:start position:0%
suspect the speaker will just move
 
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
through those very quickly with voice
 
01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:18.310 align:start position:0%
through those very quickly with voice
votes

01:56:18.310 --> 01:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
votes
 
01:56:21.550 --> 01:56:21.560 align:start position:0%
so the finance committee is adjourned
 
01:56:23.109 --> 01:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
thank you all very much for all your
 
01:56:44.069 --> 01:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:44.079 --> 01:56:47.079 align:start position:0%
