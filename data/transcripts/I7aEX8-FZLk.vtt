00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
at this point we're going to begin our
 
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
executive sessions today I would ask
 
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 align:start position:0%
that you join me in rise for the
 
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:43.429 align:start position:0%
 
Japan

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 align:start position:0%
and at this point I'll open the
 
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill
 
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
through D2 FN
 
00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 align:start position:0%
and I recognize representative Rhodes to
 
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
make a motion
 
00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I would like to
 
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 align:start position:0%
make a motion of itl for house bill 32.
 
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.309 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
yes

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
I agree with the reasonings that our
 
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 align:start position:0%
prior speaker brought
 
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.949 align:start position:0%
prior speaker brought
um

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
brought this bill to us I understand the
 
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
reasons why he wrote it
 
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
listening to the testimony there was a a
 
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
lot of unattended consequences I think
 
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 align:start position:0%
that will happen if this bill were to
 
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
pass a perfect example was if a person
 
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
is walking their child to school
 
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 align:start position:0%
I I think a worse situation than having
 
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 align:start position:0%
their gun on them is leaving it in
 
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
somebody's yard is there any way to
 
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
approach the school so they don't have
 
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.170 align:start position:0%
approach the school so they don't have
it

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
the other thing would be if you were
 
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
going to pick up your child from an
 
00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 align:start position:0%
event you would be breaking the law if
 
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
you were if you're
 
00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 align:start position:0%
um caring so for those reasons amongst
 
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative would you like to speak
 
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
to you a second
 
00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh I believe in the same things that the
 
00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 align:start position:0%
representative just said we're going to
 
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
make uh law-abiding citizens who just
 
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
have a moment of absence of thought into
 
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
criminals and I I don't think that's
 
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
what anybody wants so
 
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 align:start position:0%
it does have a a really good
 
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
idea behind it I just don't think it's
 
00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 align:start position:0%
going to work as intended so
 
00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 align:start position:0%
thank you I will open the discussion um
 
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
if we could make
 
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
absolute sure that no firearms or any
 
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
deadly weapons at all were got into our
 
00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 align:start position:0%
schools I think that would be a laudable
 
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
thing unfortunately all this does is
 
00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 align:start position:0%
tell people who have no intention of
 
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
committing a crime because they're the
 
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 align:start position:0%
only ones who had listened to it that
 
00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 align:start position:0%
they can't bring a firearm onto the
 
00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 align:start position:0%
school property or near within some
 
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
distance of a school the people that are
 
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
already ignoring the law in other words
 
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 align:start position:0%
I'm going to murder people I'm not going
 
00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 align:start position:0%
to stop just because of this law
 
00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 align:start position:0%
if we could find a way to do such a
 
00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 align:start position:0%
thing that would be great but it doesn't
 
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
so all it does is tell people who have
 
00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 align:start position:0%
no intention of committing a crime that
 
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 align:start position:0%
they will become criminals if they walk
 
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
near a school with a firearm
 
00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 align:start position:0%
like I said if we could find a way to
 
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 align:start position:0%
make the school perfectly safe and we
 
00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 align:start position:0%
could somehow get into the minds of
 
00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 align:start position:0%
criminals but we can't so with that said
 
00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.770 align:start position:0%
further discussion
yeah

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be opposing the itl motion
 
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons why I'm opposing
 
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
it there are there are people in in my
 
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
community who are uh extremely concerned
 
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
about this
 
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
um they were not aware of the fact that
 
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
the federal uh uh gun-free school zones
 
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
law was not being enforced in New
 
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.450 align:start position:0%
law was not being enforced in New
Hampshire

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
they became aware of the fact that we're
 
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
only one of three states that currently
 
00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that
 
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
one of the things I think that we do
 
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 align:start position:0%
need to weigh as we make this decision
 
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 align:start position:0%
are all the incidents we've been hearing
 
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
about in the media this year about mass
 
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 align:start position:0%
shootings and a fairly significant
 
00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 align:start position:0%
percentage of them have involved
 
00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 align:start position:0%
shootings in schools where there haven't
 
00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 align:start position:0%
been incidents
 
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 align:start position:0%
where people have lost their lives and
 
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
been wounded there have been other
 
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
incidents where entire schools have been
 
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.890 align:start position:0%
incidents where entire schools have been
swatted

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 align:start position:0%
swatted
 
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
so and we're
 
00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 align:start position:0%
we're running into a situation where
 
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
many parents are starting to run into a
 
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
situation where they are uh their
 
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
children are afraid to go to school
 
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
and and I think in New Hampshire one of
 
00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
the things we want is we want every
 
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 align:start position:0%
child uh to be able to go to to be able
 
00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 align:start position:0%
to go to school uh I think the way that
 
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
most of us did when we were kids uh the
 
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
last thing I think that any of us
 
00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
thought of was uh the possibility that
 
00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 align:start position:0%
somebody could walk into our classroom
 
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
or walk onto our school grounds and and
 
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
shoot one of us
 
00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 align:start position:0%
um this this bill as it stands
 
00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 align:start position:0%
um does not prevent a shooting
 
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
none of the bills that we will consider
 
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 align:start position:0%
today will prevent
 
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
um uh the possibility of these things
 
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.150 align:start position:0%
um uh the possibility of these things
happening

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
happening
 
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
but what we can do is we can reduce the
 
00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
risk the risk and close the window a
 
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
little bit and every one of these things
 
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
that we pass we close the window a
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
little bit and we reduce the level of
 
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.210 align:start position:0%
little bit and we reduce the level of
risk

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220 align:start position:0%
risk
 
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
um this is something that I think we owe
 
00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:39.539 align:start position:0%
our kids and we owe our teachers many
 
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
other states do it
 
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for the discussion
 
00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 align:start position:0%
representative salik
 
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
um I also will be opposing the move to
 
00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.990 align:start position:0%
um I also will be opposing the move to
itl

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
itl
 
00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:01.259 align:start position:0%
um I was a teacher during Columbine I
 
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
taught in Maryland and I taught during
 
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340 align:start position:0%
the time of the DC sniper and if you
 
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
aren't familiar with that it was people
 
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220 align:start position:0%
literally driving around
 
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:10.860 align:start position:0%
in a car with a long-range Gun and
 
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:13.740 align:start position:0%
shooting people at schools and shooting
 
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 align:start position:0%
people at gas stations and grocery
 
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.270 align:start position:0%
people at gas stations and grocery
stores

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
stores
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
um and was in lockdown in our school for
 
00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:20.930 align:start position:0%
um and was in lockdown in our school for
weeks

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
and now I have two students in high
 
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
school who've never known A Year Without
 
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:27.560 align:start position:0%
a school shooting they were
 
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
in preschool and Elementary School for
 
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
Sandy Hook
 
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
they were in middle school for Parkland
 
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
um and the number of shootings that they
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
have have lived through
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
has led to a few different things to
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
happen for my kids and for their peers
 
00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759 align:start position:0%
um one is that my 17 year old who weighs
 
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
all of a hundred pounds walks into every
 
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
single classroom and every room she goes
 
00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
into on a daily basis
 
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
looking first for where are the exits
 
00:07:59.089 --> 00:07:59.099 align:start position:0%
where are the hiding places
 
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:01.860 align:start position:0%
where are the projectiles and who in the
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
room is more important than she is so
 
00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:04.919 align:start position:0%
she can throw her body in front of them
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
when a shooter comes in
 
00:08:09.409 --> 00:08:09.419 align:start position:0%
that's how she lives her life as a 17
 
00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:12.419 align:start position:0%
year old instead of focusing on you know
 
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:14.460 align:start position:0%
statistics and history and everything
 
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
else that's what comes to the front of
 
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
her mind at the beginning
 
00:08:22.369 --> 00:08:22.379 align:start position:0%
um it's it's not fair to our kids our
 
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
kids are begging us
 
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
begging us and their parents and other
 
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:27.860 align:start position:0%
parents and parents in my community
 
00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:30.419 align:start position:0%
including one who lost a nephew in the
 
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
Oxford school shootings last uh two
 
00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
are begging us to take action so yes
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
it's true We Can't Stop every criminal
 
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:40.140 align:start position:0%
we'll never stop every criminal we'll
 
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
never stop every sociopath
 
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
who's out there
 
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:46.860 align:start position:0%
it's not possible but what we can do is
 
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
take incremental steps to make things
 
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:49.970 align:start position:0%
take incremental steps to make things
safer

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:49.980 align:start position:0%
safer
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
and it's crucial that we do whatever it
 
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
takes to protect our kids to find
 
00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:56.220 align:start position:0%
whatever steps we can so that if someone
 
00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
does walk into school with a gun
 
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
they are removed from the building where
 
00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:02.700 align:start position:0%
the gun is removed from them to to give
 
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
our kids a better chance of surviving
 
00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:08.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:10.980 align:start position:0%
I would I would respond to several of
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
the comments I just want to make it
 
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
clear the current state of law in New
 
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:14.810 align:start position:0%
clear the current state of law in New
Hampshire

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:14.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
the only way you can carry a firearm
 
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:20.700 align:start position:0%
onto school property is if you have a
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
license to carry a firearm currently in
 
00:09:24.889 --> 00:09:24.899 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we are at What's called
 
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional carry state so the
 
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
vast majority of people no longer carry
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
licenses to carry firearms unless they
 
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
intend to travel out of the state for
 
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
reciprocity reasons so
 
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:38.820 align:start position:0%
to be able to actually the way the law
 
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
is now you have to get the license to
 
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
carry which requires a background check
 
00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:44.519 align:start position:0%
by the local police chief so it's not
 
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
like just everyone is able under the
 
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
current law to walk into the school
 
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
with a firearm and and secondly to to
 
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
the things that you just said and that
 
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
representative you said which are
 
00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.290 align:start position:0%
representative you said which are
absolutely

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
true and and laudable but if this bill
 
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
became magically law tonight it would
 
00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
not change the fact that children would
 
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
still have to worry and we have to
 
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
address the problem of violence in this
 
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
society and stop focusing on the
 
00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
inanimate object because what we've done
 
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
is we will say it's illegal to bring
 
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
that in there again I go back to the
 
00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:20.339 align:start position:0%
person who wants to hurt children in
 
00:10:22.009 --> 00:10:22.019 align:start position:0%
that school doesn't care what law we
 
00:10:22.019 --> 00:10:23.389 align:start position:0%
that school doesn't care what law we
pass

00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:32.220 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting ringtone
 
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
I would just say that I I've been I've
 
00:10:38.329 --> 00:10:38.339 align:start position:0%
actually been contacted by three
 
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
School teachers in one of the districts
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
that I represent here in this house
 
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
um I can't disclose and I won't disclose
 
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
who they are and they told me that they
 
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
carry a firearm to school as a teacher
 
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:55.380 align:start position:0%
and they are doing it to protect their
 
00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
students if this bill were to pass into
 
00:11:00.889 --> 00:11:00.899 align:start position:0%
law we'd be stripping them of that right
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
to defend themselves and and others as
 
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
we guarantee them in article 2A of our
 
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.370 align:start position:0%
we guarantee them in article 2A of our
constitution

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:07.380 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:11:09.889 --> 00:11:09.899 align:start position:0%
secondary to that
 
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
I'm a volunteer a compensated volunteer
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
for my local
 
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
emergency management office and we
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
recently had a drill at one of our
 
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
schools in my district again I won't
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
disclose which
 
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.470 align:start position:0%
disclose which
where

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
the scenario was that
 
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:28.860 align:start position:0%
our local Department of Public Works
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
would send their trucks to block
 
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
entrances and exits of the school
 
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
and when the drill came to to be it was
 
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
found out that three out of the five
 
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Works employees
 
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:46.620 align:start position:0%
were carrying firearms to defend
 
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
themselves and others if this law were
 
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
to pass I'm sorry this bill were to pass
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
into law those three DPW workers would
 
00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:56.459 align:start position:0%
not be able to carry a firearm to defend
 
00:11:59.569 --> 00:11:59.579 align:start position:0%
themselves and others so I I definitely
 
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
am supporting the itl recommendation
 
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
representative Stone thank you Mr chair
 
00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
what I do know is that criminals don't
 
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:14.220 align:start position:0%
follow laws and that's why they're
 
00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
criminals and I don't see any logic in
 
00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:18.899 align:start position:0%
disarming law-abiding citizens
 
00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
to have a feel good and make soft
 
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
targets of our schools in addition a lot
 
00:12:25.009 --> 00:12:25.019 align:start position:0%
of communities have schools that have
 
00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:27.660 align:start position:0%
their zones uh posted in a lot of
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
residential areas as well
 
00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
which presents a problem the federal
 
00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
government established the school zones
 
00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
as a separate charging document when it
 
00:12:38.449 --> 00:12:38.459 align:start position:0%
comes to enhanced Firearms violations
 
00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the day I just I will
 
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
thank you and also as a reminder this
 
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
bill would make a thousand foot buffer
 
00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
zone if you ever look at a map that's a
 
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
huge distance that this would swoop into
 
00:12:59.449 --> 00:12:59.459 align:start position:0%
and cover people
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
um that they wouldn't be legally allowed
 
00:13:04.129 --> 00:13:04.139 align:start position:0%
to carry their firearm and
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
I'm reminded of the disc
 
00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
we had on um
 
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
the bill about
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
um warrants
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
um when someone's hunting
 
00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
and if I remember correctly one of the I
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
think one of the things that
 
00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
bring true with a lot of us is the idea
 
00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:30.180 align:start position:0%
that there are areas that are the
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
commons and there are certain agreements
 
00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:33.959 align:start position:0%
that you make
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
um when you step in Step foot in
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
um certain places and I understand and
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
definitely to a large extent agree with
 
00:13:45.949 --> 00:13:45.959 align:start position:0%
the idea that criminals don't follow
 
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
laws but we don't have laws in place to
 
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
tell people what not to do we have laws
 
00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%
in place to provide Justice when they
 
00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:53.220 align:start position:0%
violate them
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
and that's the entire reason for having
 
00:13:58.970 --> 00:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
laws against behaviors that we find
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
unacceptable in our society
 
00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:05.420 align:start position:0%
um if if we only made laws against
 
00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
just the the
 
00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
reasoning there is like kind of makes me
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
want to laugh the idea that you would
 
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:12.590 align:start position:0%
want to laugh the idea that you would
only

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
only
 
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
Implement a law if you thought someone
 
00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
would follow it but not if you didn't
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
think they would follow it kind of
 
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
negates the existence of this entire
 
00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:21.740 align:start position:0%
building and all of our positions
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
but circular reasoning can do that to
 
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.550 align:start position:0%
but circular reasoning can do that to
you

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:14:28.009 --> 00:14:28.019 align:start position:0%
uh I think it I think that if we're
 
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
going for example if we're going to have
 
00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
properties where we permit people to
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
hunt than it is incumbent upon the state
 
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the wildlife is managed
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
in a way where the animals can continue
 
00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:41.220 align:start position:0%
reproducing a sufficient number where
 
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
they're still available for hunting in
 
00:14:44.329 --> 00:14:44.339 align:start position:0%
the future right I think that's
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable and similarly
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
um any other public publicly available
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
or publicly accessible property needs to
 
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
be managed responsibly by the government
 
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
if it wants to have those kinds of
 
00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.910 align:start position:0%
if it wants to have those kinds of
entities

00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
entities
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
so I'll be opposing the itl thank you
 
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
um I would just respond and say that
 
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
laws are are indeed designed to punish
 
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
those who would but they also are
 
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
designed for a deterrent effect so it
 
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily circular logic I
 
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
believe that having a law in place
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
deters people from breaking the law as
 
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
much as it is for punishing the people
 
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
who do it
 
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
um representative Newman
 
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
so we've talked we've talked a lot about
 
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
this law and I I just want to remind
 
00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
people and I found this out because I
 
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
found out and and reviewed the current
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
law that talks about
 
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:41.220 align:start position:0%
what is constitutional and what is not
 
00:15:42.889 --> 00:15:42.899 align:start position:0%
constitutional it's called New York
 
00:15:44.449 --> 00:15:44.459 align:start position:0%
State Rifle and Pistol Association
 
00:15:46.009 --> 00:15:46.019 align:start position:0%
versus Bruin
 
00:15:49.129 --> 00:15:49.139 align:start position:0%
and it was in uh it's several months ago
 
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
that this was passed
 
00:15:55.009 --> 00:15:55.019 align:start position:0%
and there is no constitutional right to
 
00:15:57.769 --> 00:15:57.779 align:start position:0%
carry firearms into
 
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
sensitive buildings and it says in in
 
00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
the Court decisions specifically Schools
 
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:04.740 align:start position:0%
and Government buildings
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
so there is enough there is not a
 
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional protection for that
 
00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:12.839 align:start position:0%
and that's why the federal state law the
 
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
federal thousand foot regulation has not
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
been overturned by the courts
 
00:16:22.009 --> 00:16:22.019 align:start position:0%
so and we've talked about how do we
 
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
protect the random citizen that goes
 
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
into a school just in case there might
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
be a
 
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:28.740 align:start position:0%
heat they might be assaulted in the
 
00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:29.629 align:start position:0%
heat they might be assaulted in the
school

00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
so if you want to test the EXP the
 
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
exceptions to the rule then pass a law
 
00:16:40.189 --> 00:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
and put the court test on it
 
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
and see if it's constitutional or not
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
that's why listening to this rule is
 
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
that this law is constitutional we heard
 
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:48.180 align:start position:0%
a lot of that when we had the public
 
00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:50.759 align:start position:0%
hearing I had the Constitution waved at
 
00:16:52.249 --> 00:16:52.259 align:start position:0%
us and said don't you read the
 
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
Constitution this law is constitutional
 
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
that in fact
 
00:16:59.329 --> 00:16:59.339 align:start position:0%
this is unconstitutional that in fact is
 
00:17:00.829 --> 00:17:00.839 align:start position:0%
a false statement
 
00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:03.839 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to not go I'm going to not
 
00:17:05.809 --> 00:17:05.819 align:start position:0%
vote for the itl because of that because
 
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:08.220 align:start position:0%
I think we should be passing laws that
 
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
will protect our citizens and for the
 
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
most part they uh by that the more the
 
00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:16.140 align:start position:0%
majority of Americans opposed guns in
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
the schools
 
00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.079 align:start position:0%
but there are exceptions to that because
 
00:17:20.809 --> 00:17:20.819 align:start position:0%
you can have resource offices and you
 
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
can you can write a rule that says you
 
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
can have teachers to be armed legally so
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
they're not breaking the law
 
00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
and have them take their guns to school
 
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
like that and and go ahead and do it but
 
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
I will vote against this law
 
00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
thank you I would um I would um
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
I would say that so far at least in this
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
room for during this um process no one
 
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
has made the argument that this would be
 
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:47.100 align:start position:0%
on constitutional as fact that I would
 
00:17:48.529 --> 00:17:48.539 align:start position:0%
openly agree the state does have the
 
00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
power to regulate
 
00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
um where Firearms are carried in
 
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
sensitive buildings so we would be with
 
00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
within the Constitution if we were to
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
pass this I agree with you
 
00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
um there was actually arguments made at
 
00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:03.660 align:start position:0%
the hearing where people did say that
 
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
they thought this would be
 
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and I agree with you
 
00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:07.799 align:start position:0%
per the court case that you are correct
 
00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:10.140 align:start position:0%
it would not be unconstitutional
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
I specifically avoided saying it was
 
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
anybody in this room because I've never
 
00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
heard any testimony like that today very
 
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
good thank you I appreciate it okay at
 
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
this point I'm going to go ahead and ask

the clerk to call the roll
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%

further refinement
 
00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your second
 
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative sure pretty much the same
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
reasons uh we do have a bunch of these
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
bills coming and this one didn't quite
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
complete the circle of what it needed to
 
00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:16.740 align:start position:0%
do so I think it needs some work and uh
 
00:21:18.409 --> 00:21:18.419 align:start position:0%
maybe with some of the other bills we
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
can come up with a better bill
 
00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
um and and just so the committee
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
understands we we are going to we are
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
going to work on one of these this
 
00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
summer and we are going to come up with
 
00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
a uh a bill so in case anyone's thinking
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
we're kicking this can down the road we
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
are not we will be working on this and I
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
believe we'll be uh making a study
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
commission out of one of them I believe
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
representative gath writes and we will
 
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
be getting getting a piece of work out
 
00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
of this committee that can pass
 
00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:50.750 align:start position:0%
of this committee that can pass

to make a motion thank you Mr chair my
 
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:23.700 align:start position:0%
motion to itl house bill 59.
 
00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative Stone would you like to
 
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I would the uh
 
00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
currently ffls are utilized to do
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
Commercial background checks on all
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
sales in New Hampshire in addition they
 
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
use the Nyx system which is a federal
 
00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
system for long guns in the state of New
 
00:24:45.289 --> 00:24:45.299 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all handguns are done by the
 
00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
State Police gun line which I believe
 
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
the cost on that is around 10 million
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
dollars a year to operate and it's done
 
00:24:53.149 --> 00:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
by your driver's license number as well
 
00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:55.740 align:start position:0%
to verify identity this bill really
 
00:24:57.289 --> 00:24:57.299 align:start position:0%
serves no legitimate purpose in
 
00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
enhancing safety we already have a
 
00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
process in place that all ffls are
 
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
mandated to follow there is no deviation
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
from that
 
00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:25:09.529 --> 00:25:09.539 align:start position:0%
I really think that this is just a
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
duplicating effort of federal law
 
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:13.980 align:start position:0%
representative per would you like to
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
speak to you a second
 
00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:16.740 align:start position:0%
that was exactly what I was going to say
 
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
that the law is already in place and is
 
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:20.940 align:start position:0%
followed in this state by every gun
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
dealer commercial gun dealer um
 
00:25:26.029 --> 00:25:26.039 align:start position:0%
uh and if they step around that
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
there are penalties for it so I don't
 
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
see a need for this
 
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
um I'll open the uh
 
00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:38.700 align:start position:0%
the discussion I think that the the way
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
the statute is written
 
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
um I think there's a lot of issues with
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
the use of the word commercial it would
 
00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:47.460 align:start position:0%
uh it would go a lot further if if it
 
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
just said private because I think that's
 
00:25:51.529 --> 00:25:51.539 align:start position:0%
what they're trying to do is regulate
 
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
the sale of private between two
 
00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:56.220 align:start position:0%
individuals and I think that the the
 
00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.590 align:start position:0%
individuals and I think that the the
statute

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
it on some level makes sense but it
 
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
needs it needs to um there are there
 
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
needs to be exemptions people shouldn't
 
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
be at risk or have to go to a dealer to
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
get a background check to sell to
 
00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.909 align:start position:0%
get a background check to sell to
someone

00:26:10.909 --> 00:26:10.919 align:start position:0%
someone
 
00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
um who they know or in their family the
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
current state of the law is you it is
 
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:16.980 align:start position:0%
illegal to sell a firearm to a
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
prohibited person or to someone that you
 
00:26:21.049 --> 00:26:21.059 align:start position:0%
do not personally know that is the
 
00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:23.220 align:start position:0%
current state of the law
 
00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
um I have not heard law enforcement did
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
not testify that there's an issue or
 
00:26:30.669 --> 00:26:30.679 align:start position:0%
that they've discovered a rash of sales
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh Private Sales that are leading to
 
00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.149 align:start position:0%
uh Private Sales that are leading to
crimes

00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
crimes
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
there is a there is a possibly a version
 
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
of this law that I could support in the
 
00:26:41.769 --> 00:26:41.779 align:start position:0%
future if it was very carefully crafted
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
but this is a very Broad and I can't
 
00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
support it for that reason what we did
 
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
hear from law enforcement is that we
 
00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
need to worry about is straw purchases
 
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
and those are people that come up and
 
00:26:54.769 --> 00:26:54.779 align:start position:0%
buy firearms legally through a dealer
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of giving it to someone
 
00:27:00.169 --> 00:27:00.179 align:start position:0%
else and that is handled with federal
 
00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:02.700 align:start position:0%
law currently but it is still a problem
 
00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
that they need to work harder on in my
 
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
okay representative Newman can I just
 
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
ask to share a question to clarify
 
00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
absolutely that is the state of the law
 
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:16.740 align:start position:0%
is it federal law state law where that
 
00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:18.900 align:start position:0%
is it's actually written okay so in
 
00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:20.940 align:start position:0%
current state law it's illegal to sell a
 
00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:22.140 align:start position:0%
firearm to someone you don't know
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
personally the other parts of the law
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
discussed with the straw purchases is
 
00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
federal law is the federal law just says
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
that it's an early the only state law
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
that I know about says it's illegal to
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
sell a firearm to a felon
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
um I believe that is incorrect would
 
00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:40.610 align:start position:0%
um I believe that is incorrect would
someone

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
someone
 
00:27:42.049 --> 00:27:42.059 align:start position:0%
um could someone call up the current
 
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
statute does anyone have it handy
 
00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:47.700 align:start position:0%
chairman rsa159 does state that it must
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
go through a federal firearms licensed
 
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
dealer for a back with a background
 
00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:52.860 align:start position:0%
check unless it's somebody you
 
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
personally know and they are not
 
00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
prohibited oh could you uh tell us the
 
00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
statute number again I knew that's what
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
it said but I didn't know the number
 
00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
what does it RSA
 
00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:05.700 align:start position:0%
it's in it's in section 159.
 
00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:08.700 align:start position:0%
okay and I don't see any contradiction
 
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
with what this says it says you you are
 
00:28:12.529 --> 00:28:12.539 align:start position:0%
not responsible according to the
 
00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
amendment with the law
 
00:28:16.669 --> 00:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
that where that one paragraph was left
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
out it said if you know
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
you you can set you can sell it to
 
00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:23.700 align:start position:0%
somebody if you know they are not a
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
prohibited person
 
00:28:27.409 --> 00:28:27.419 align:start position:0%
and so I I don't see where this
 
00:28:30.409 --> 00:28:30.419 align:start position:0%
conflicts with that law at all and it
 
00:28:33.049 --> 00:28:33.059 align:start position:0%
may not it may be just duplicative
 
00:28:36.289 --> 00:28:36.299 align:start position:0%
um any further discussion
 
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
representative Sue Newman
 
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:41.580 align:start position:0%
I I would just add that I believe
 
00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:43.799 align:start position:0%
background checks and I believe most of
 
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
you would agree background checks do
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
work I don't have a statistic right in
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
front of me but in the past I have
 
00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:53.220 align:start position:0%
certainly read and seen numbers where X
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
number of people were booted out of the
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
system and did not qualify so they do
 
00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
work and and as was previously said this
 
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
is a Time
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
because of recent events we owe it to
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
our children we owe it to our grown
 
00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:11.820 align:start position:0%
children to do something thank you
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Newman and
 
00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for joining us again today
 
00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:17.940 align:start position:0%
we're happy to have you with us I um I
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
agree that no one on this committee
 
00:29:21.049 --> 00:29:21.059 align:start position:0%
would say that background checks are not
 
00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:22.919 align:start position:0%
good and that background checks do not
 
00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:25.740 align:start position:0%
work and currently we believe that
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
background checks are being conducted in
 
00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
the current state of New Hampshire law
 
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
says that if you don't know someone you
 
00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
cannot sell them a firearm without a
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
background check so
 
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
and I agree with the events around the
 
00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:38.940 align:start position:0%
country happening this law would not
 
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
prevent one of them
 
00:29:42.769 --> 00:29:42.779 align:start position:0%
um and it's currently covered already uh
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative salik
 
00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I would just say
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
point out that the purpose of this
 
00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
specific bill is to close the Charleston
 
00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
loophole and
 
00:29:57.529 --> 00:29:57.539 align:start position:0%
if we think about the circumstances of
 
00:29:59.630 --> 00:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
that particular event and the fact that
 
00:30:01.549 --> 00:30:01.559 align:start position:0%
I can't go to religious services at my
 
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
synagogue without having to hire armed
 
00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:07.860 align:start position:0%
police to keep our services safe because
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
of people who use loopholes like this to
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
buy guns illegally
 
00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
that we have a problem that we need to
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
address so I will be voting against itl
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
I want to recognize that if we use
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
common sense we should be coming up with
 
00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
common sense Solutions and not looking
 
00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
for additional ways to put more
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
obstacles to preventing gun violence
 
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
thank you could for the benefit of the
 
00:30:31.549 --> 00:30:31.559 align:start position:0%
committee would you mind explaining to
 
00:30:33.529 --> 00:30:33.539 align:start position:0%
Charleston loophole
 
00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
it it allowed the young man to who's um
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
there were hit the time frame for him
 
00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
getting his background check wasn't
 
00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:43.020 align:start position:0%
completed and that he was therefore
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
given a gun before it was completed it
 
00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:46.380 align:start position:0%
was proven he wasn't supposed to be
 
00:30:48.529 --> 00:30:48.539 align:start position:0%
given a gun that he had a number of
 
00:30:51.409 --> 00:30:51.419 align:start position:0%
things this is one of the the steps to
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
close that loophole to make it so that
 
00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:55.140 align:start position:0%
he would not have been given a gun
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
so um just to expound the net for the
 
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
committee that the current law is
 
00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
um the federal law is if you go for a
 
00:31:03.769 --> 00:31:03.779 align:start position:0%
background check and it takes them more
 
00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:04.860 align:start position:0%
than three days to complete the
 
00:31:06.529 --> 00:31:06.539 align:start position:0%
background check the dealer is
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
authorized to transfer the firearm to
 
00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
the purchaser
 
00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
um regardless of the background check
 
00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:14.700 align:start position:0%
and that is a in my mind a flaw in
 
00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:16.980 align:start position:0%
federal law which covers this
 
00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
um and they need to fix it it is my
 
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
experience that is very rare that that
 
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
happens they are very quick so I don't
 
00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:25.860 align:start position:0%
know the circumstances of that
 
00:31:27.289 --> 00:31:27.299 align:start position:0%
particular case
 
00:31:29.149 --> 00:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
um but it doesn't appear to be a New
 
00:31:30.409 --> 00:31:30.419 align:start position:0%
Hampshire problem
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
um representative Stone
 
00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'd just like to
 
00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
point out if the committee is not aware
 
00:31:36.889 --> 00:31:36.899 align:start position:0%
of it that there's bipartisan
 
00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:38.820 align:start position:0%
legislation at the federal level that
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
has made it uh now a new requirement for
 
00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
ffls anyone under the age of uh 21 years
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
old ends up having an automatic
 
00:31:48.289 --> 00:31:48.299 align:start position:0%
three-day delay then during the course
 
00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:49.860 align:start position:0%
of that three-day delay there actually
 
00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:51.419 align:start position:0%
you get a phone call that gives you
 
00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
another 10-day delay for them to
 
00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
continue their next research so they've
 
00:31:57.889 --> 00:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
kind of closed in on that if you're not
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
aware of it so representative Stone just
 
00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
for for everyone's benefit I'm going to
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
repeat that currently there is federal
 
00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:08.039 align:start position:0%
bipartisan legislation coming forward to
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
close that and also currently
 
00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
it is the state of the law that if
 
00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
you're under 21 years old there's an
 
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
automatic three-day delay in purchasing
 
00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:20.039 align:start position:0%
a firearm and if it takes them longer
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
than that an automatic 10-day kicks in
 
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
so any one of the 21 currently is not
 
00:32:27.049 --> 00:32:27.059 align:start position:0%
able to get a firearm when they walk in
 
00:32:29.149 --> 00:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
the store and walk right out with it is
 
00:32:30.289 --> 00:32:30.299 align:start position:0%
that is that correct representative
 
00:32:33.409 --> 00:32:33.419 align:start position:0%
stone that is correct thank you
 
00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:37.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
so given the fact that there is some
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
emerging consensus on this at the
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
federal level one of the things that New
 
00:32:47.049 --> 00:32:47.059 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can do is actually
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
pass a law pass this law in case that
 
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
doesn't make it through at the federal
 
00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:56.940 align:start position:0%
level uh I think uh changes to gun laws
 
00:32:58.370 --> 00:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
at the federal level have the same level
 
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
of difficulty uh maybe perhaps even a
 
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
higher level of difficulty than a
 
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
legislation like this has in New
 
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:08.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the other thing that I wanted
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
to say is that in in addition to closing
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
the so-called Charleston loophole one of
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
the things that this bill would also do
 
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
is require a background check for for
 
00:33:24.889 --> 00:33:24.899 align:start position:0%
unlicensed sellers so one of the things
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
that uh that we have heard is that there
 
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:29.940 align:start position:0%
are places where you can go uh online
 
00:33:33.289 --> 00:33:33.299 align:start position:0%
put a gun up for sale uh and in many
 
00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
cases the gun is not uh uh or at least
 
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
let me clarify that in in some cases uh
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
there is not about there is no there is
 
00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:46.980 align:start position:0%
no background check
 
00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
um and the firearm is actually delivered
 
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
uh is actually exchanged between two
 
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
people who have no relationship other
 
00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
than the relationship that they have
 
00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:58.130 align:start position:0%
than the relationship that they have
online

00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:58.140 align:start position:0%
online
 
00:33:58.140 --> 00:33:59.289 align:start position:0%
online
um

00:33:59.289 --> 00:33:59.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
there is also something called The Gun
 
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
Show loophole uh which allows a private
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
uh or I'd say a one of the things we
 
00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
struggle with a little bit is the diff
 
00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:12.899 align:start position:0%
the definition between a commercial
 
00:34:15.649 --> 00:34:15.659 align:start position:0%
seller and a private seller so if you're
 
00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:18.599 align:start position:0%
using uh an internet website if you're
 
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
using a classified ad uh if you're
 
00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
selling uh a weapon at an advertised
 
00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:27.780 align:start position:0%
event that actually counts as a
 
00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:29.899 align:start position:0%
commercial sale it's not the same thing
 
00:34:33.169 --> 00:34:33.179 align:start position:0%
as selling an extra firearm to your
 
00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:34.919 align:start position:0%
neighbor or selling it to your brother
 
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
or something like that what the bill is
 
00:34:40.609 --> 00:34:40.619 align:start position:0%
very careful to do is to Define what a
 
00:34:43.369 --> 00:34:43.379 align:start position:0%
commercial sale is representative Smith
 
00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
also offered an amendment during the
 
00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
public hearing when she introduced when
 
00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:50.419 align:start position:0%
she introduced the bill
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
that that clarified some of that some of
 
00:34:55.369 --> 00:34:55.379 align:start position:0%
that language as well
 
00:34:58.970 --> 00:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
so you know I I think this is this is
 
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
one of those things that um I I think a
 
00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:05.700 align:start position:0%
lot of people think makes sense to do uh
 
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
I think the the idea that there are
 
00:35:11.329 --> 00:35:11.339 align:start position:0%
people uh who shouldn't have a gun who
 
00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
potentially can slip through the cracks
 
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
of something that should bother all of
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
us especially
 
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:18.300 align:start position:0%
some of the members of our committee who
 
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
are former police officers
 
00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't think anybody wants
 
00:35:26.089 --> 00:35:26.099 align:start position:0%
to have to deal with any anything even
 
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
resembling an unnecessary uh tragedy
 
00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:31.740 align:start position:0%
with a with a firearm
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh so I will be uh I will be opposing uh
 
00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
the itl and uh and I hope we if the Ito
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
goes through in the house we will uh
 
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
come back with a better Bill thank you
 
00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:48.839 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Muse
 
00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
um just look I'm going to talk for a
 
00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
second about online there's a lot of
 
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
talk about online we hear from people um
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
I myself sold a firearm online the
 
00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
hunting rifle that I no longer use I
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
regret it because you should just never
 
00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:04.740 align:start position:0%
sell firearms because you can regret it
 
00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:08.540 align:start position:0%
um to use the website called um
 
00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.310 align:start position:0%
um to use the website called um
gunbroker.com

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
gunbroker.com
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
you list the weapon you sell the weapon
 
00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
someone bids on it or buys it
 
00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
and what has to it's very very strict
 
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
what has to happen is the firearm has to
 
00:36:23.329 --> 00:36:23.339 align:start position:0%
be sent by me to a licensed firearm
 
00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
dealer in whatever state that person's
 
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.390 align:start position:0%
dealer in whatever state that person's
in

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
that person then has to go pick up the
 
00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
firearm I sold from the Firearms dealer
 
00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:33.300 align:start position:0%
and get a background check if they don't
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
or if they fail it the farm gets sent
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
back to me and the sale does not proceed
 
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
um that's and there's other companies
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
you can buy directly online from
 
00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
um I've bought several from a place
 
00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
called grab a gun and you go online you
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
look at a firearm you make the purchase
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
they don't sell the you the firearm they
 
00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:54.300 align:start position:0%
send it to an FFL in your state
 
00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
and you have to go there to pick up the
 
00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
firearm where you get a background check
 
00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
so there may be websites like a
 
00:37:02.329 --> 00:37:02.339 align:start position:0%
Craigslist type of thing where people
 
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
are doing that but it's illegal first of
 
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
all federally to transfer a firearm like
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
that to someone not in your state
 
00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:13.140 align:start position:0%
and it's already it's already covered
 
00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:14.220 align:start position:0%
they're already doing the background
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
check and anyone who's not doing it is
 
00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:18.300 align:start position:0%
is doing a legal sale currently under
 
00:37:20.089 --> 00:37:20.099 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
um and as far as the Gun Show loophole
 
00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.510 align:start position:0%
um and as far as the Gun Show loophole
goes

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
goes
 
00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
if you go to a gun show
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
99.9 of the people at gun shows are ffls
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
selling their Wares at the gun show and
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
when you find a gun you like at a gun
 
00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:34.740 align:start position:0%
show they do a background check on the
 
00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:37.140 align:start position:0%
spot they call the FBI they run it to
 
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
give it through if there's someone there
 
00:37:41.569 --> 00:37:41.579 align:start position:0%
privately selling Firearms
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
um and they don't have an FFL and they
 
00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
don't conduct a background check first
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
of all it's illegal to sell a handgun to
 
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
someone from another state without going
 
00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
through an FFL
 
00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
um so and the people who run the gun
 
00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
shows are very strict because they lose
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
their ability to run these shows so if
 
00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:01.260 align:start position:0%
there's a one-off on the side sale at a
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
gun show it's not really a Gun Show
 
00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
loophole it's just a someone's breaking
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
the law the current state of the law the
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
gun show is if you buy a gun the dealer
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
at the gun show has to do an instant
 
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
background check and they do
 
00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:15.660 align:start position:0%
um and if they don't they're breaking
 
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
the law already representative Newman
 
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I hope you'll
 
00:38:23.089 --> 00:38:23.099 align:start position:0%
indulge in me for a comment if I can
 
00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:24.660 align:start position:0%
make a comment about what you said
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely and then I would like to make
 
00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:28.140 align:start position:0%
my own comment on what I think about
 
00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:30.300 align:start position:0%
this particular law absolutely federal
 
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
agents who do the right thing and do all
 
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff
 
00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:37.140 align:start position:0%
I don't expect that that goes to like
 
00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:39.780 align:start position:0%
the other kind of sales sites on online
 
00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
it may be illegal but people are able to
 
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
sell it through Google market and
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
pick I don't know all the websites but
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
pick pick not a particularly a gun site
 
00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:51.300 align:start position:0%
they sell guns online and there's no fun
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
there's no federal firearm agent
 
00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:54.780 align:start position:0%
involved in any of that
 
00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
so that's what we're trying to do with
 
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
the state law
 
00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
and I I don't take much comfort in the
 
00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
fact that there is a that there is a
 
00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:04.140 align:start position:0%
federal law coming forward as it applies
 
00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
to any of these laws because we've all
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
seen in the laws that have been
 
00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
submitted to this house this year are
 
00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
the Nullification laws that that we
 
00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
shall not spend any money enforcing
 
00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
federal laws so I think that for us to
 
00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
do what is common sense and sensible so
 
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
that we will have mirror laws because
 
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
that's the term they use in those laws
 
00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
we need to have these mirror laws that
 
00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:31.740 align:start position:0%
cover face to cover federal law so that
 
00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
we can then enforce them instead of
 
00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:35.460 align:start position:0%
having to deal with these nullification
 
00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:37.079 align:start position:0%
laws thank you
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Newman
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative salic
 
00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:43.140 align:start position:0%
thank you um chairman Roy earlier you
 
00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
slight could withdraw the motion to itl
 
00:39:52.849 --> 00:39:52.859 align:start position:0%
and retain this bill so that we can
 
00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
tweak the language with the bipartisan
 
00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:56.820 align:start position:0%
group to come up with language we can
 
00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
all agree with so that we can make
 
00:40:01.849 --> 00:40:01.859 align:start position:0%
change and pass this bill
 
00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
thank you at this point um I believe
 
00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
that the law needs a little bit more
 
00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
than a tweak it needs a thorough
 
00:40:11.089 --> 00:40:11.099 align:start position:0%
rewriting examination that would require
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee which I wouldn't oppose
 
00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
to unfortunately the calendar would not
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
agree with that I'm up against it I have
 
00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:21.260 align:start position:0%
a week to get these bills out and
 
00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
reports written so
 
00:40:25.849 --> 00:40:25.859 align:start position:0%
the current motion has to stand as it is
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
which is ideal representative Cameron
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I wanted to
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
clarify I'm reading from RSA 15914
 
00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:41.460 align:start position:0%
um and Prada 14 is all of the ways that
 
00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:43.140 align:start position:0%
a person in New Hampshire can become
 
00:40:46.089 --> 00:40:46.099 align:start position:0%
licensed to sell firearms
 
00:40:49.849 --> 00:40:49.859 align:start position:0%
and requiring and it speaks to selling
 
00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
to minors who may be Hunters
 
00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
speaks to the straw purchase you spoke
 
00:40:58.010 --> 00:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
of earlier if it's a parent they can
 
00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
purchase it and give it to the child as
 
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
long as they have a hunting license
 
00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:04.740 align:start position:0%
um penalties for violating the law but
 
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
to go into 14 it says None of the
 
00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
provisions of this chapter so prohibit
 
00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:11.820 align:start position:0%
an individual not licensed under the
 
00:41:14.089 --> 00:41:14.099 align:start position:0%

business of selling pistols
 
00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
I'm going to skip a few because it's
 
00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
very wordy under this chapter or to a
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
person and personally known to them so
 
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
to go to the gun show you're correct it
 
00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:31.140 align:start position:0%
is a it's a violation of law under the
 
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:33.300 align:start position:0%
federal statute as well as state statute
 
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:37.140 align:start position:0%
for them to do that at a gun show in a
 
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
former life I worked for two retailers
 
00:41:42.349 --> 00:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
that sold firearms
 
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
um Walmart and Dick's Sporting Goods and
 
00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:48.300 align:start position:0%
I was one of those responsible persons
 
00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
that was listed on the FFL so that I
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
could sell firearms unsupervised and I
 
00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
will tell you that never have I ever
 
00:41:58.849 --> 00:41:58.859 align:start position:0%
sold a firearm that it did not go
 
00:41:58.859 --> 00:42:00.530 align:start position:0%
sold a firearm that it did not go
through

00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:00.540 align:start position:0%

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
a federal firearms licensee with a

background investigation with one
 
00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
exception my son's birthday last year I
 
00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
I gifted him a pistol
 
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
and I brought him to an FFL for a
 
00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:17.400 align:start position:0%

hearing on HP 59 and I opened a public
 
00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
hearing on HP 76. and I recognize
 
00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:08.460 align:start position:0%

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:10.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'd like to make a
 
00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
motion to itl it helps bill 76.
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
do I hear a second second
 
00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
Ed by representative representative
 
00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:20.460 align:start position:0%
Stone would you like to speak to your
 
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
motion Mr chairman I would this bill
 
00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:24.839 align:start position:0%
would serve no legitimate purpose for
 
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
thousands of law-abiding New Hampshire
 
00:44:31.069 --> 00:44:31.079 align:start position:0%
citizens to purchase firearms uh I know
 
00:44:32.569 --> 00:44:32.579 align:start position:0%
we've heard some testimony that in cases
 
00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:35.220 align:start position:0%
of suicide uh Firearms have been used
 
00:44:37.609 --> 00:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
but also there's numerous cases where
 
00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
those who are committed to commit
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
suicide will do it with other means such
 
00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
as drugs ropes belts vehicles
 
00:44:47.089 --> 00:44:47.099 align:start position:0%
denying someone's constitutional right
 
00:44:49.849 --> 00:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
to pick up a firearm could cause them a
 
00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
safety issue as we've heard testimony
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
from uh I believe it was a woman's
 
00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:55.740 align:start position:0%
Supportive Services Group
 
00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
came in and testify that that would be a
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
detrimental for a abuser in protection
 
00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:04.740 align:start position:0%
so at the end of the day I really don't
 
00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:07.079 align:start position:0%
see where restricting someone's right if
 
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
they are legally able to purchase a
 
00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:11.819 align:start position:0%
firearm should be prohibited
 
00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
absent Pro would like to speak to a
 
00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:14.930 align:start position:0%
absent Pro would like to speak to a
second

00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:14.940 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
I would so I I agree that the waiting
 
00:45:18.359 --> 00:45:19.329 align:start position:0%
I would so I I agree that the waiting
period

00:45:19.329 --> 00:45:19.339 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
on one hand is good
 
00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:24.900 align:start position:0%
on on another hand it's bad I've had a
 
00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:27.420 align:start position:0%
personal experience with a friend who
 
00:45:29.569 --> 00:45:29.579 align:start position:0%
was being threatened
 
00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:31.380 align:start position:0%
got a firearm
 
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
the next day and the day after that I
 
00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:36.660 align:start position:0%
had to actually brandish it
 
00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:40.140 align:start position:0%
to prevent harm to herself
 
00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
so it worked out well for her nobody got
 
00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:43.430 align:start position:0%
so it worked out well for her nobody got
hurt

00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
hurt
 
00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
the assailant ran away uh
 
00:45:50.569 --> 00:45:50.579 align:start position:0%
so I've seen it
 
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
where it could have been very
 
00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
detrimental if she had to wait the three
 
00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:54.349 align:start position:0%
detrimental if she had to wait the three
days

00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:45:54.359 --> 00:45:55.970 align:start position:0%
days
so

00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:55.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:59.690 --> 00:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
knowing that I can't go with this
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you discussion
 
00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes
 
00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I would just like
 
00:46:08.329 --> 00:46:08.339 align:start position:0%
to reiterate what representative pru
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
said I could not think of a worse
 
00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
situation than telling a woman that she
 
00:46:12.829 --> 00:46:12.839 align:start position:0%
has to wait three days to protect
 
00:46:12.839 --> 00:46:14.450 align:start position:0%
has to wait three days to protect
herself

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:14.460 align:start position:0%
herself
 
00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:19.069 align:start position:0%
herself
sadly

00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:20.770 --> 00:46:20.780 align:start position:0%
we all know circumstances where somebody
 
00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:22.740 align:start position:0%
very well may have been in that position
 
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
and saying no wait wait three days
 
00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
about the silliest thing I've ever heard
 
00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:31.569 align:start position:0%
about the silliest thing I've ever heard
of

00:46:31.569 --> 00:46:31.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
I'll acknowledge that Firearms are used
 
00:46:37.930 --> 00:46:37.940 align:start position:0%
often in suicides
 
00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:41.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we cannot read minds we
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
cannot predict someone's Mental Health
 
00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
and delaying the constitutional right of
 
00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of the over a million
 
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire
 
00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
because a very small percentage will use
 
00:46:59.210 --> 00:46:59.220 align:start position:0%
that right
 
00:47:02.569 --> 00:47:02.579 align:start position:0%
to hurt themselves it does not in my
 
00:47:05.329 --> 00:47:05.339 align:start position:0%
mind pass the balancing test
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
I think that um it's the saddest thing
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
in the world that people are using these
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
to hurt themselves with but to the
 
00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
testimony we've heard people will use
 
00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
other methods we cannot
 
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:17.089 align:start position:0%
other methods we cannot
um

00:47:17.089 --> 00:47:17.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:19.609 --> 00:47:19.619 align:start position:0%
for a lack of a better term wrap the
 
00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
state in a plastic bubble to protect
 
00:47:23.809 --> 00:47:23.819 align:start position:0%
everyone in case they decide to hurt
 
00:47:26.089 --> 00:47:26.099 align:start position:0%
themselves and by delaying the
 
00:47:29.089 --> 00:47:29.099 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights of most people
 
00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
to protect those who may hurt themselves
 
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
um I just I just can't justify that in
 
00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
my mind
 
00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
um representative who won who had their
 
00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:40.140 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
my comment to this is this is this is
 
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%
designed to prevent suicide it's
 
00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:51.900 align:start position:0%
provided for people that have a get in
 
00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
their head about suicide and most times
 
00:47:55.849 --> 00:47:55.859 align:start position:0%
people know when people are depressed
 
00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
like that there is a way to tell when
 
00:47:58.910 --> 00:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
people are are
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
mentally unstable and and that potential
 
00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
may happen
 
00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:05.220 align:start position:0%
and this is only designed if someone has
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
a gun in the house or has a gun of their
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
own this doesn't do anything to them but
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's specifically rented to somebody to
 
00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
go down like we had testimony in a
 
00:48:13.849 --> 00:48:13.859 align:start position:0%
previous session
 
00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
where uh a minor went down bought a gun
 
00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:20.220 align:start position:0%
with a with the credit card
 
00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
they found out about the credit card
 
00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:24.780 align:start position:0%
thing they got the gun returned and the
 
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
next day he got a gun for somewhere else
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
and killed himself
 
00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
and and I will say that I keep hearing
 
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
again that you have a constitutional
 
00:48:34.609 --> 00:48:34.619 align:start position:0%
right to be able to go into a gun store
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
buy a gun and get it immediately
 
00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:39.180 align:start position:0%
that is simply not true
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
We There are waiting periods in other
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
states they have not been challenged and
 
00:48:44.589 --> 00:48:44.599 align:start position:0%
that particular
 
00:48:48.109 --> 00:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
alleged right is not a right under the
 
00:48:49.849 --> 00:48:49.859 align:start position:0%
Constitution it's silent on it I believe
 
00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:51.660 align:start position:0%
it's silent and it may be there may be
 
00:48:53.809 --> 00:48:53.819 align:start position:0%
cases that quote those laws because it's
 
00:48:55.309 --> 00:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
been challenged
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
so I just think that
 
00:48:59.450 --> 00:48:59.460 align:start position:0%
the we know that Firearms are the most
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
effective way to do it and we kind of
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
passed off people jumping and people
 
00:49:05.089 --> 00:49:05.099 align:start position:0%
taking pills and whatever and I think
 
00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839 align:start position:0%
all the percentages for all of other
 
00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
kinds of suicide is less than 50 percent
 
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
I can get the exact numbers for you and
 
00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
even update them for 22 because this was
 
00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:15.300 align:start position:0%
in the previous session
 
00:49:17.329 --> 00:49:17.339 align:start position:0%
so I believe that this will go a long
 
00:49:20.809 --> 00:49:20.819 align:start position:0%
way to prevent harm
 
00:49:23.569 --> 00:49:23.579 align:start position:0%
by having people commit suicide by using
 
00:49:25.849 --> 00:49:25.859 align:start position:0%
the most effective thing there is to
 
00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
commit suicide so I'll be opposing the
 
00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:30.710 align:start position:0%
commit suicide so I'll be opposing the
itls

00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
itls
 
00:49:32.569 --> 00:49:32.579 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
um I I would um in response to the your
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
your comment regarding the
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
constitutionality I would remind the
 
00:49:40.609 --> 00:49:40.619 align:start position:0%
committee the Constitution does not give
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
anybody any rights the Constitution
 
00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
recognizes rights and tells the state
 
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
what it can and cannot do to infringe on
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
those rights and the fact that it's
 
00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
silent on whether or not you have an
 
00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:53.660 align:start position:0%
immediate access to that right does not
 
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
infer in any way that the state has a
 
00:49:58.550 --> 00:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
right to delay it I firmly believe a
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
right delayed is a right deny as there
 
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
is no Supreme Court case as to whether
 
00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:07.980 align:start position:0%
or not a state can delay a right
 
00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:10.980 align:start position:0%
in my mind you always defer to the right
 
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
of the citizen versus the government
 
00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:19.140 align:start position:0%
but I we will amiably uh disagree uh go
 
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
ahead Representative no could I I just
 
00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
want to ask your question sure even
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
though that it's not there you can't say
 
00:50:26.569 --> 00:50:26.579 align:start position:0%
that they have the right and I I mean
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
people can people can fall both ways
 
00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:29.940 align:start position:0%
when it's not mentioned in the
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution thank you and I I
 
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree
 
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes thank you Mr
 
00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
chairman so when you look at this bill I
 
00:50:40.309 --> 00:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
think there's a there's a lot of there's
 
00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of things I think were meant to be
 
00:50:42.119 --> 00:50:43.670 align:start position:0%
a lot of things I think were meant to be
good

00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
um line 28 where it says expressed to a
 
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
lot a law enforcement officer a
 
00:50:50.809 --> 00:50:50.819 align:start position:0%
reasonable fear for his or her own
 
00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:52.980 align:start position:0%
personal safety it doesn't explain how
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
you express that fear are you I mean is
 
00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:56.940 align:start position:0%
that just is that a verbal fear is there
 
00:50:58.370 --> 00:50:58.380 align:start position:0%
going to be a form that has to be filled
 
00:50:58.380 --> 00:50:59.569 align:start position:0%
going to be a form that has to be filled
out

00:50:59.569 --> 00:50:59.579 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:01.740 align:start position:0%
um line 17 it talks about if you're a
 
00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:02.569 align:start position:0%
um line 17 it talks about if you're a
hunter

00:51:02.569 --> 00:51:02.579 align:start position:0%
hunter
 
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:05.700 align:start position:0%
taking the hunter the minimum the
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
education course but it doesn't say well
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
what if there's a what if there's a
 
00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:11.220 align:start position:0%
backlog and there's a two-month you know
 
00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
waiting period to get into this
 
00:51:13.849 --> 00:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
particular Law class what if you've what
 
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:16.140 align:start position:0%
if you took this this uh this safety
 
00:51:18.109 --> 00:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
class three years ago right so there's
 
00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
just a lot of things that as much
 
00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:22.140 align:start position:0%
assistance was intended to be good if
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
you actually look at the language that
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
none of this is explained on how to do
 
00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:30.780 align:start position:0%
it it for that reason alone is is why
 
00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I I would say a bill that actually
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
would have an impact on the ability of
 
00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:46.140 align:start position:0%
people that commit suicide is actually
 
00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
pretty good and thank you representative
 
00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:52.740 align:start position:0%
verodes for correcting uh yourself uh
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
from your earlier statement uh when you
 
00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
raised a concern about a woman who
 
00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:58.930 align:start position:0%
raised a concern about a woman who
potentially

00:51:58.930 --> 00:51:58.940 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
would have an issue or might be in a
 
00:52:03.049 --> 00:52:03.059 align:start position:0%
situation where they might need a weapon
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
to defend themselves immediately when
 
00:52:07.549 --> 00:52:07.559 align:start position:0%
you actually read the bill all the way
 
00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:10.460 align:start position:0%
down it does take into account
 
00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
situations like that the reason it takes
 
00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
it into account is we have gone through
 
00:52:18.109 --> 00:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
a process over a number of years of
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
getting feedback from people at public
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
hearings from members of our own
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
committee and each time we do this the
 
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
bill gets better and IT addresses IT
 
00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:31.980 align:start position:0%
addresses more of the concerns
 
00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:32.690 align:start position:0%
addresses more of the concerns
um

00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:36.900 align:start position:0%
we've reached a point on many of these
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
bills and this this seems to be one of
 
00:52:42.049 --> 00:52:42.059 align:start position:0%
them that literally no matter what we do
 
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
uh is enough to address some concerns
 
00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:47.220 align:start position:0%
and and I think part of
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things I think that we that
 
00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:51.900 align:start position:0%
we have to realize is that
 
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
um that when we do nothing uh in a
 
00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:56.700 align:start position:0%
country that has millions and millions
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
and millions of firearms insert in
 
00:53:02.569 --> 00:53:02.579 align:start position:0%
circulation when we are not willing to
 
00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:05.220 align:start position:0%
close the window on anything even a
 
00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
little tiny bit one of the things that
 
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
we're doing is we're significantly
 
00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
increasing the risk for our Citizens
 
00:53:15.130 --> 00:53:15.140 align:start position:0%
We're increasing the risk for gun owners
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
we're increasing the risk for our kids
 
00:53:21.049 --> 00:53:21.059 align:start position:0%
in schools we're increasing the risk for
 
00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:22.380 align:start position:0%
people who might have mental health
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
problems you know might try to harm
 
00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:25.990 align:start position:0%
problems you know might try to harm
themselves

00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:53:28.609 --> 00:53:28.619 align:start position:0%
we are not helping
 
00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
and I think one of the the duties of
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
this commission or this committee and
 
00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why we have Public
 
00:53:38.089 --> 00:53:38.099 align:start position:0%
Safety in our name is sometimes we have
 
00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
to make hard decisions like this where
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
we have to balance rights our own state
 
00:53:47.089 --> 00:53:47.099 align:start position:0%
constitution and article three actually
 
00:53:50.329 --> 00:53:50.339 align:start position:0%
refers you know to the need periodically
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
for for us to put the public good over a
 
00:53:56.450 --> 00:53:56.460 align:start position:0%
natural right
 
00:53:58.130 --> 00:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
that's actually in our state
 
00:54:00.109 --> 00:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
constitution nobody likes to talk about
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
article 3 but there it sits right
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
underneath article two
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
so we have a public obligation to do
 
00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
both of these things and and I think we
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
have an obligation to try to come to
 
00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
balance in a situation like this not my
 
00:54:19.309 --> 00:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
way or the highway or no change is ever
 
00:54:19.319 --> 00:54:20.510 align:start position:0%
way or the highway or no change is ever
good

00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
but we have an obligation uh to the
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
people of this state to do a better job
 
00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:27.900 align:start position:0%
of coming together on this issue than we
 
00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:29.809 align:start position:0%
of coming together on this issue than we
have

00:54:29.809 --> 00:54:29.819 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:54:31.309 --> 00:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:33.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
representative pru
 
00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:37.970 align:start position:0%
representative pru
so

00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:37.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit about me is that I have
 
00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:42.420 align:start position:0%
been running the granite state critical
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
incident stress management team for
 
00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
about 35 years and that helps uh please
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
Fire EMS any emergency responder get
 
00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
through bad calls and handle stress
 
00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
one of the big things in my pre-incident
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
education is suicide and suicide
 
00:54:58.849 --> 00:54:58.859 align:start position:0%
prevention so I do know a little bit
 
00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:01.140 align:start position:0%
about that and I have weighed both of
 
00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:04.380 align:start position:0%
those again pretty heavily because those
 
00:55:05.809 --> 00:55:05.819 align:start position:0%
are my brothers and sisters that I'm
 
00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
trying to protect
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
but I also feel
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
that there's a
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
civilian population out there and I'm
 
00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:15.180 align:start position:0%
gonna go primarily female but not just
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
female because
 
00:55:20.089 --> 00:55:20.099 align:start position:0%
some guys get threatened by females so
 
00:55:23.569 --> 00:55:23.579 align:start position:0%
I do believe they have the ability or
 
00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
need the ability
 
00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
to get their firearm
 
00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
and I will tell you especially in my
 
00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:33.710 align:start position:0%
and I will tell you especially in my
head

00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
head
 
00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:35.460 align:start position:0%
a man who's being threatened by the
 
00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
woman isn't going to want to go talk to
 
00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
the police officer and say hey I'm a
 
00:55:42.170 --> 00:55:42.180 align:start position:0%
little afraid and and I need to get a
 
00:55:43.849 --> 00:55:43.859 align:start position:0%
gun quick so can I get permission to do
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
that they just want to go get it and you
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
know to say yeah I need a gun or
 
00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:50.630 align:start position:0%
know to say yeah I need a gun or
whatever

00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:55:54.170 --> 00:55:54.180 align:start position:0%
so I think that might inhibit them
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
so I still think this should
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
I understand the concerns of suicide I
 
00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
really do
 
00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:02.690 align:start position:0%
really do
but

00:56:02.690 --> 00:56:02.700 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:56:05.089 --> 00:56:05.099 align:start position:0%
I also understand the concerns of murder
 
00:56:10.790 --> 00:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative Jammer
 
00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
they jacked the microphone up on me so
 
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.329 --> 00:56:23.339 align:start position:0%
again I was a responsible person for an
 
00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:28.700 align:start position:0%
FFL and sold Firearms the form 4473
 
00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:30.230 align:start position:0%
FFL and sold Firearms the form 4473
asks

00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
asks
 
00:56:35.930 --> 00:56:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:39.049 --> 00:56:39.059 align:start position:0%
uh have you ever been adjudicated by a
 
00:56:41.089 --> 00:56:41.099 align:start position:0%
court to be
 
00:56:41.099 --> 00:56:43.309 align:start position:0%
court to be
mentally

00:56:43.309 --> 00:56:43.319 align:start position:0%
mentally
 
00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
unable to to possess a firearm and
 
00:56:50.569 --> 00:56:50.579 align:start position:0%
there's a second one about drug usage
 
00:56:50.579 --> 00:56:51.650 align:start position:0%
there's a second one about drug usage
um

00:56:51.650 --> 00:56:51.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:53.030 align:start position:0%
um
yesterday

00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:55.380 align:start position:0%
I actually had a citizen in my town take
 
00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
his own life
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
and he
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
went to purchase a firearm and he
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
answered the 4473 truthfully and was
 
00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
denied the sale of the firearm
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
and the person that denied the sale of
 
00:57:14.089 --> 00:57:14.099 align:start position:0%
the firearm actually contacted
 
00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
authorities and explained to them
 
00:57:18.290 --> 00:57:18.300 align:start position:0%
he said something that he wants to harm
 
00:57:20.329 --> 00:57:20.339 align:start position:0%
himself by the time the police
 
00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:22.140 align:start position:0%
department got that word he had already
 
00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:25.220 align:start position:0%
committed suicide so
 
00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:27.900 align:start position:0%
this three-day waiting period that we're
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
talking about here
 
00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:30.410 align:start position:0%
talking about here
um

00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:33.059 align:start position:0%
I don't think has any effect
 
00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
I think that the the the situation I
 
00:57:41.089 --> 00:57:41.099 align:start position:0%
just explained uh us all taking care of
 
00:57:42.589 --> 00:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
each other when we see somebody in need
 
00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
we we give them that that help that they
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
need sometimes we're too late
 
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
but at the same time the the safety net
 
00:57:53.690 --> 00:57:53.700 align:start position:0%
that's in place is in place for a reason
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
the 4473
 
00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
does work
 
00:58:00.829 --> 00:58:00.839 align:start position:0%
especially for these things here I don't
 
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
feel like meddling in
 
00:58:05.569 --> 00:58:05.579 align:start position:0%
making somebody wait three days to
 
00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:07.380 align:start position:0%
defend themselves others in the state
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
that's a right guaranteed on the
 
00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
Constitution so obviously I don't think
 
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
it's any surprise to anybody I'll be
 
00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
and this oh representative
 
00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:24.780 align:start position:0%
thank you I I don't think any of us
 
00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:26.030 align:start position:0%
thank you I I don't think any of us
believe

00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:27.049 align:start position:0%
believe
percent

00:58:27.049 --> 00:58:27.059 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
prevent suicide and we certainly can't
 
00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
100 prevent suicide by gun because of
 
00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
the number of people who already own
 
00:58:36.289 --> 00:58:36.299 align:start position:0%
guns or who will find ways to get them
 
00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:39.180 align:start position:0%
again I come back to people are asking
 
00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
my constituents are reaching out to me
 
00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:43.559 align:start position:0%
they're calling as I went out and
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
knocked on 2 000 doors in the town
 
00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
almost every single person said to me
 
00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
are you going to work for gun control to
 
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
help stop the amount of gun violence
 
00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
that we have can you put in Waiting
 
00:58:56.930 --> 00:58:56.940 align:start position:0%
periods can you help
 
00:58:58.490 --> 00:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
Studies have shown and I don't have the
 
00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:00.180 align:start position:0%
statistics in front of me but I can get
 
00:59:02.930 --> 00:59:02.940 align:start position:0%
them that something like 55 percent of
 
00:59:05.450 --> 00:59:05.460 align:start position:0%
the people who are going to a gun shop
 
00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
to get a gun and for the purposes of
 
00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
committing suicide if they're made to
 
00:59:12.829 --> 00:59:12.839 align:start position:0%
wait 48 hours in that 48 Hours someone
 
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
reaches out to them and helps redirect
 
00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
them and saves their life
 
00:59:19.549 --> 00:59:19.559 align:start position:0%
so it may be that we can't protect
 
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
everybody and clearly nothing was going
 
00:59:22.849 --> 00:59:22.859 align:start position:0%
to protect the person in your town and
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
I'm very sorry for their loss
 
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't say that people
 
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
suffering from domestic violence can't
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
get a gun Quite Contrary it specifies
 
00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:33.660 align:start position:0%
them as a category of people who can
 
00:59:36.109 --> 00:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
if we're not willing to take the brave
 
00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:39.180 align:start position:0%
step and take some action
 
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
then we're condoning every one of those
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:49.799 align:start position:0%
um I would uh I would caution us against
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
saying that we are the members of this
 
00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
committee condoning anything I know that
 
00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
you mean implicitly but still
 
00:59:56.940 --> 00:59:57.890 align:start position:0%
you mean implicitly but still
um

00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:59.809 --> 00:59:59.819 align:start position:0%
like you I got
 
01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:02.700 align:start position:0%
um hundreds and hundreds of calls for my
 
01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
visits and people I spoke to my
 
01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
constituents and said are you going to
 
01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:10.740 align:start position:0%
stop them from taking our guns and
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
limiting our rights so I think it's
 
01:00:14.569 --> 01:00:14.579 align:start position:0%
clear that um we all have different
 
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
constituencies on this committee
 
01:00:19.210 --> 01:00:19.220 align:start position:0%
and um I
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself I do not think that
 
01:00:24.829 --> 01:00:24.839 align:start position:0%
any member of this committee is a quote
 
01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:28.020 align:start position:0%
gun Grabber and what I think everyone is
 
01:00:29.809 --> 01:00:29.819 align:start position:0%
operating from a position of what they
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
think is best for the citizens of the
 
01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
state and their constituents and I
 
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate both sides of the argument
 
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
and and through US each of us from our
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
individual districts are speaking for
 
01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:45.900 align:start position:0%
the people of the state so in my phone's
 
01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:46.910 align:start position:0%
the people of the state so in my phone's
rings

01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
rings
 
01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to call have the
 
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
clerk called oh excuse me representative
 
01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:52.740 align:start position:0%
Newell would like to
 
01:00:54.589 --> 01:00:54.599 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to throw in
 
01:00:56.569 --> 01:00:56.579 align:start position:0%
um especially that
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
when we talk about natural rights what I
 
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
think what this does and the way that it
 
01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
was explained in some of the testimony
 
01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
and some of the research that I've done
 
01:01:06.370 --> 01:01:06.380 align:start position:0%
is that something like this
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
takes into consideration human nature
 
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
and the fact that if there is you know
 
01:01:13.309 --> 01:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
they call it a cooling off period And so
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
something like this just kind of I don't
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
I guess I don't I don't agree with the
 
01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
fact that you know the the perspective
 
01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:23.220 align:start position:0%
that a right delayed is a is a right
 
01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:24.530 align:start position:0%
that a right delayed is a is a right
denied

01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
denied
 
01:01:27.289 --> 01:01:27.299 align:start position:0%
um I think that in some cases it should
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
be delayed and that's on on the or you
 
01:01:31.549 --> 01:01:31.559 align:start position:0%
know it's not harmful for it to be
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
delayed and it has the potential to uh
 
01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:38.220 align:start position:0%
help someone uh cool off in the
 
01:01:40.609 --> 01:01:40.619 align:start position:0%
potential to reduce harm so anyway
 
01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
that's my two cents thank you and we
 
01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
um with that I'm gonna ask the court to
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
call the roll
 
01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:49.079 align:start position:0%

um we had voted to retain the bill but
 
01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
actually we had an amendment that we
 
01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:14.940 align:start position:0%
were given and that amendment allowed us
 
01:27:16.490 --> 01:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:27:20.629 --> 01:27:20.639 align:start position:0%
put this into a study committee so I
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
would like everyone to vote Yes
 
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
on a reconsideration so we can put
 
01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
another motion forward
 
01:27:31.250 --> 01:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
thank you um I would just say that this
 
01:27:34.669 --> 01:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
was actually my bad I did not recognize
 
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
the number and Associated to the bill
 
01:27:40.610 --> 01:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
that representative Harry gathright had
 
01:27:42.110 --> 01:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
put forward that we agreed was going to
 
01:27:44.149 --> 01:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
go be the one that we used as a vehicle
 
01:27:46.250 --> 01:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
for a study committee
 
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
so I would also urge some members to
 
01:27:51.410 --> 01:27:51.420 align:start position:0%
support the motion and reconsider this
 
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
really doesn't require any discussion
 
01:27:55.490 --> 01:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
unless anyone really feels they need to
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
seeing no one go ahead I'm gonna ask the

01:30:20.510 --> 01:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
um I'll go to the duties in the in the
 
01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment it says that the committee
 
01:30:28.610 --> 01:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
shall evaluate while the bill
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner should replace or be
 
01:30:32.330 --> 01:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
supplemented by Court magistrates and
 
01:30:33.890 --> 01:30:33.900 align:start position:0%
assess the following benefits and
 
01:30:36.050 --> 01:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
problems of the current bail system Bill
 
01:30:38.209 --> 01:30:38.219 align:start position:0%
commissioner system potential structure
 
01:30:39.890 --> 01:30:39.900 align:start position:0%
of a court imaginary system throughout
 
01:30:41.689 --> 01:30:41.699 align:start position:0%
the state Court's replacement of bail
 
01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
Commissioners with court magistrates and
 
01:30:44.930 --> 01:30:44.940 align:start position:0%
supplementation of the bill
 
01:30:47.090 --> 01:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
Commissioners with court magistries and
 
01:30:50.209 --> 01:30:50.219 align:start position:0%
I think that this is a good track to
 
01:30:53.090 --> 01:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
look at and I think it's a good way to
 
01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
work with the judicial branch to make
 
01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
this happen
 
01:30:59.570 --> 01:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:31:01.729 --> 01:31:01.739 align:start position:0%
um I would just add that this this as I
 
01:31:03.530 --> 01:31:03.540 align:start position:0%
said is the vehicle that we are going to
 
01:31:06.890 --> 01:31:06.900 align:start position:0%
use to give a deep dive and come up with
 
01:31:09.050 --> 01:31:09.060 align:start position:0%
a workable piece of legislation on bail
 
01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:10.490 align:start position:0%
a workable piece of legislation on bail
reform

01:31:10.490 --> 01:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
reform
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
at that I would ask the clerk to call
 
01:31:15.890 --> 01:31:15.900 align:start position:0%
the roll on I'm sorry representative
 
01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
Newman I didn't see
 
01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
yeah I just have a parliamentary inquiry
 
01:31:21.709 --> 01:31:21.719 align:start position:0%
about the eligibility of someone to vote
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
and that would be the representative who
 
01:31:26.209 --> 01:31:26.219 align:start position:0%
came into the Hall you hadn't started to
 
01:31:28.850 --> 01:31:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:31.370 --> 01:31:31.380 align:start position:0%
yeah once I call the question he can't
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
vote unfortunately oh he can we didn't
 
01:31:36.530 --> 01:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
vote yet so he can vote I haven't called
 
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
the I haven't called the question so
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
once I say clerk call the vote then you
 
01:31:43.310 --> 01:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
can't vote if you come in thank you for
 
01:31:44.689 --> 01:31:44.699 align:start position:0%
the clarification thank you
 
01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
representative for pointing that out
 
01:31:48.770 --> 01:31:48.780 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
one more request for for clarification
 
01:31:52.970 --> 01:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
essentially what we're doing is we're
 
01:31:55.850 --> 01:31:55.860 align:start position:0%
replacing uh the entire Bill uh with a
 
01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
study committee bill
 
01:32:00.229 --> 01:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
um the language of this bill
 
01:32:02.330 --> 01:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
um while we may have issues with it in
 
01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
certain places is going to be really
 
01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
useful nothing about doing this
 
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
precludes us from using this language
 
01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
again in a different Bill am I correct
 
01:32:14.270 --> 01:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
in assuming that
 
01:32:16.669 --> 01:32:16.679 align:start position:0%
that is correct the my goal in retaining
 
01:32:18.350 --> 01:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
all these bills was preserving the
 
01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:19.729 align:start position:0%
all these bills was preserving the
issues

01:32:19.729 --> 01:32:19.739 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:32:21.470 --> 01:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
um were we to itl one of them and we
 
01:32:23.209 --> 01:32:23.219 align:start position:0%
would not be able to use a similar bill
 
01:32:25.129 --> 01:32:25.139 align:start position:0%
or a bill with similar language so I'm
 
01:32:26.629 --> 01:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
trying to preserve all these for the
 
01:32:28.970 --> 01:32:28.980 align:start position:0%
capability to be used again
 
01:32:31.610 --> 01:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh representative
 
01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:32.810 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh representative
um Bolden

01:32:32.810 --> 01:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
um Bolden
 
01:32:35.629 --> 01:32:35.639 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of the whole committee I
 
01:32:37.550 --> 01:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
have to expand a little on the when you
 
01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:40.310 align:start position:0%
have to expand a little on the when you
can

01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
you can by the time the chairman
 
01:32:44.570 --> 01:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
instructs the clerk to start calling
 
01:32:46.250 --> 01:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
names and writing on writing down the
 
01:32:48.530 --> 01:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
votes then not only can you vote but you
 
01:32:50.030 --> 01:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
must just like when we're in the house
 
01:32:52.250 --> 01:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
and so the structure of the process is
 
01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
the chair or in the case of the house
 
01:32:57.050 --> 01:32:57.060 align:start position:0%
the speaker announces the subject matter
 
01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
and then and invites motions then
 
01:33:01.790 --> 01:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
there's the discussion debate phase and
 
01:33:04.490 --> 01:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
then there's the specific voting phase
 
01:33:07.129 --> 01:33:07.139 align:start position:0%
and the period of time between when the
 
01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
chairman says the clerk will now call
 
01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
the roll and when the voting happens is
 
01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
obviously milliseconds and that's
 
01:33:14.810 --> 01:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
specifically the period during which you
 
01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
need to be present in the room even if
 
01:33:18.169 --> 01:33:18.179 align:start position:0%
you're not in your seat yet and I'm
 
01:33:19.610 --> 01:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
hoping that if I'm incorrect about
 
01:33:20.930 --> 01:33:20.940 align:start position:0%
anything you could clarify that thank
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
you I believe that is that's correct and
 
01:33:26.330 --> 01:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
that is my current understanding as well
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
um and with that I will ask the clerk to
 
01:33:33.770 --> 01:33:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:37.850 --> 01:33:37.860 align:start position:0%

46 and open the executive session on
 
01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill 106. oh excuse me act 78 and

01:36:25.490 --> 01:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'd like to make a
 
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
motion itl house bill 78. entire second
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
second second about representative Peru
 
01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
representative Stone would you like to
 
01:36:35.570 --> 01:36:35.580 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion Mr chair I would uh
 
01:36:37.250 --> 01:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
during testimony there was no uh
 
01:36:39.709 --> 01:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
convincing information provided that
 
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
would justify this bill going forward
 
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
in addition I'd like to make an example
 
01:36:46.370 --> 01:36:46.380 align:start position:0%
that uh currently the New Hampshire
 
01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
attorney general has joined in 25 other
 
01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
states on a pistol race issue
 
01:36:53.330 --> 01:36:53.340 align:start position:0%
that's currently done in a rulemaking
 
01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
authority of the ATF
 
01:36:57.050 --> 01:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
in addition the uh some of these
 
01:36:58.729 --> 01:36:58.739 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authorities and executive
 
01:37:00.890 --> 01:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
orders lack due process improper Court
 
01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:04.729 align:start position:0%
orders lack due process improper Court
challenges

01:37:04.729 --> 01:37:04.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:06.110 --> 01:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
representative would you like to speak
 
01:37:07.490 --> 01:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
to you a second
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh pretty much the same thing uh that
 
01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
I've seen the ATF uh just randomly
 
01:37:16.729 --> 01:37:16.739 align:start position:0%
change the rules sometimes depending on
 
01:37:18.530 --> 01:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
what administration happens to be
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
sitting in the big seat so
 
01:37:23.330 --> 01:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
it's hard to keep up one minute it's
 
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
legal then it's not legal then it's
 
01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:32.330 --> 01:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
it just gets very confusing so I think
 
01:37:35.090 --> 01:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
if we can just be on a level plane that
 
01:37:37.010 --> 01:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
would be better
 
01:37:38.510 --> 01:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:37:41.629 --> 01:37:41.639 align:start position:0%
um I will say that I was this is
 
01:37:44.689 --> 01:37:44.699 align:start position:0%
um not in my opinion partisan I was a I
 
01:37:46.450 --> 01:37:46.460 align:start position:0%
objected to the previous president
 
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
making uh an executive order without due
 
01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
process to make a certain item illegal
 
01:37:54.169 --> 01:37:54.179 align:start position:0%
that's since been overturned by the
 
01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
court ever I object to this President
 
01:37:58.490 --> 01:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
and through the ATF making executive
 
01:38:01.689 --> 01:38:01.699 align:start position:0%
orders that don't go through due process
 
01:38:05.570 --> 01:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
we have a problem I believe with the
 
01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:06.530 align:start position:0%
we have a problem I believe with the
Congress

01:38:06.530 --> 01:38:06.540 align:start position:0%
Congress
 
01:38:09.169 --> 01:38:09.179 align:start position:0%
abrogating its duties and delegating
 
01:38:12.290 --> 01:38:12.300 align:start position:0%
authority to these agencies to just make
 
01:38:14.209 --> 01:38:14.219 align:start position:0%
random rules the one that representative
 
01:38:15.410 --> 01:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
Stone just brought up with the pistol
 
01:38:18.410 --> 01:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
braces the ATF specifically issued a
 
01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
letter saying that these were legal
 
01:38:23.090 --> 01:38:23.100 align:start position:0%
after an extensive study millions of
 
01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
them were sold and then the ATF changed
 
01:38:27.229 --> 01:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
its mind and said they're no longer
 
01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
legal and no matter how many how much
 
01:38:32.209 --> 01:38:32.219 align:start position:0%
money you invest in thousands of dollars
 
01:38:34.910 --> 01:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
into such a such a device
 
01:38:36.890 --> 01:38:36.900 align:start position:0%
they said you can either turn it in or
 
01:38:40.490 --> 01:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
you can pay this new tax and keep it and
 
01:38:43.129 --> 01:38:43.139 align:start position:0%
as the representative pointed out
 
01:38:44.990 --> 01:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
um over 20 states are filing a lawsuit
 
01:38:48.169 --> 01:38:48.179 align:start position:0%
against that so I believe that this law
 
01:38:50.209 --> 01:38:50.219 align:start position:0%
was passed with the intent of protecting
 
01:38:52.270 --> 01:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
our citizens from this
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
yo-yo effect of of rule making from the
 
01:38:56.689 --> 01:38:56.699 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
01:38:58.910 --> 01:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
but it is now open for third discussion
 
01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative Newman you have a
 
01:39:02.030 --> 01:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
question you want to speak
 
01:39:04.669 --> 01:39:04.679 align:start position:0%
yeah I just want to say I hear a lot of
 
01:39:07.010 --> 01:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
discussions about executive orders and
 
01:39:08.810 --> 01:39:08.820 align:start position:0%
administrative people and places
 
01:39:10.610 --> 01:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
changing rules
 
01:39:13.729 --> 01:39:13.739 align:start position:0%
this is about laws we pass laws here in
 
01:39:15.110 --> 01:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
in this body
 
01:39:17.810 --> 01:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
and I think that it's been passed in
 
01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
many other states it has not been
 
01:39:22.310 --> 01:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
challenged constitutionally it is
 
01:39:24.290 --> 01:39:24.300 align:start position:0%
constitutional for us to be able to go
 
01:39:26.270 --> 01:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
ahead and pass this law and wait just
 
01:39:28.129 --> 01:39:28.139 align:start position:0%
like you're waiting for that those court
 
01:39:29.689 --> 01:39:29.699 align:start position:0%
cases to finish
 
01:39:31.610 --> 01:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
we would have to have the same thing we
 
01:39:34.090 --> 01:39:34.100 align:start position:0%
would wait until they are are
 
01:39:36.169 --> 01:39:36.179 align:start position:0%
challenged in court and they go to the
 
01:39:38.570 --> 01:39:38.580 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court a supreme court which I
 
01:39:40.490 --> 01:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
think has a likelihood that maybe they
 
01:39:42.050 --> 01:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
will fail maybe they will say it's
 
01:39:44.450 --> 01:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and at that point I
 
01:39:45.590 --> 01:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
will have to live with what the
 
01:39:48.290 --> 01:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
Constitution says today but today this
 
01:39:50.990 --> 01:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
is a this is a bill that that prevents
 
01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.010 align:start position:0%
is a this is a bill that that prevents
harm

01:39:52.010 --> 01:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
harm
 
01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
and it prevents harm in a lot of places
 
01:39:57.770 --> 01:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
and it is the harm that it prevents is
 
01:40:00.530 --> 01:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
having people commit suicide so that
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:08.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:40:08.229 --> 01:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
everything you said is well taken though
 
01:40:14.030 --> 01:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
can I yes save that for the next one and
 
01:40:16.610 --> 01:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
could I amend my remarks you may thank
 
01:40:19.490 --> 01:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
I I mentioned this before so I don't
 
01:40:22.669 --> 01:40:22.679 align:start position:0%
have a lot to say it's a nullification
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
line it says we're not going to fall
 
01:40:25.250 --> 01:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
we're not going to pay any money to it
 
01:40:27.290 --> 01:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
so I'm against this law thank you and
 
01:40:29.689 --> 01:40:29.699 align:start position:0%
sorry for the distraction and disruption
 
01:40:31.250 --> 01:40:31.260 align:start position:0%

if someone could remind me that would be
great

01:40:48.530 --> 01:40:48.540 align:start position:0%

78
regarding

01:40:54.169 --> 01:40:54.179 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
01:40:56.209 --> 01:40:56.219 align:start position:0%
um uh repealing a previous Bill we
 
01:40:57.649 --> 01:40:57.659 align:start position:0%
passed last year
 
01:41:01.070 --> 01:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
related to State not Hampshire state law
 
01:41:04.729 --> 01:41:04.739 align:start position:0%
enforcement and federal firearms laws
 
01:41:04.739 --> 01:41:08.870 align:start position:0%
enforcement and federal firearms laws
foreign

01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:12.649 --> 01:41:12.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:15.590 --> 01:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm the prime sponsor
 
01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
of this bill and I will say the reason
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
why I filed it
 
01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
the reason why I filed this bill is
 
01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:22.550 align:start position:0%
the reason why I filed this bill is
because

01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:41:24.649 --> 01:41:24.659 align:start position:0%
of the conversation that just in an
 
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
example the conversations that we had
 
01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
this morning over and over about relying
 
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
on the federal government to control
 
01:41:33.290 --> 01:41:33.300 align:start position:0%
guns in our state that's a quick summary
 
01:41:35.870 --> 01:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
according to me so if that's not what
 
01:41:38.930 --> 01:41:38.940 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing then please let me know but
 
01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
I do think that with the confusion
 
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
caused by this
 
01:41:46.490 --> 01:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
presidential presidential and executive
 
01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:47.450 align:start position:0%
presidential presidential and executive
orders

01:41:47.450 --> 01:41:47.460 align:start position:0%
orders
 
01:41:50.270 --> 01:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
we might be going after being able to
 
01:41:51.890 --> 01:41:51.900 align:start position:0%
limit that but what we're actually doing
 
01:41:54.169 --> 01:41:54.179 align:start position:0%
is really tying the hands of Law
 
01:41:57.169 --> 01:41:57.179 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers we had an incident
 
01:41:59.270 --> 01:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
two years ago in
 
01:42:01.310 --> 01:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
Nashua behind the high school we had a
 
01:42:04.910 --> 01:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
militia that was organizing and with the
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
laws that we have now on the books in in
 
01:42:09.590 --> 01:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we wouldn't be able to ask
 
01:42:11.629 --> 01:42:11.639 align:start position:0%
those people to leave the school grounds
 
01:42:14.330 --> 01:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
so this is one of the things where we
 
01:42:16.129 --> 01:42:16.139 align:start position:0%
have a lot of police presence and we
 
01:42:17.570 --> 01:42:17.580 align:start position:0%
have people from all over the state
 
01:42:20.090 --> 01:42:20.100 align:start position:0%
trying to help us in Nashua but really
 
01:42:22.370 --> 01:42:22.380 align:start position:0%
what we have to do is wait it out
 
01:42:24.830 --> 01:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
so that's what we're doing for now
 
01:42:27.290 --> 01:42:27.300 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is that under this
 
01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:29.030 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is that under this
law

01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:42:31.129 --> 01:42:31.139 align:start position:0%
and I have read several interpretations
 
01:42:33.410 --> 01:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
that the federal laws that we're relying
 
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
on cannot be enforced and we cannot use
 
01:42:37.250 --> 01:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
any money to do that
 
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
so I oppose the Ito motion on this Bill
 
01:42:42.290 --> 01:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:42:44.810 --> 01:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for joining our committee and
 
01:42:46.129 --> 01:42:46.139 align:start position:0%
sharing your opinion on that
 
01:42:49.010 --> 01:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
representative Harry gathright
 
01:42:53.030 --> 01:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
I too will be voting against the itl and
 
01:42:55.070 --> 01:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
it actually made me this bill made me
 
01:42:58.430 --> 01:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
think about last term when
 
01:42:58.440 --> 01:42:59.570 align:start position:0%
think about last term when
um

01:42:59.570 --> 01:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:02.930 --> 01:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
it was a bill to take New Hampshire out
 
01:43:06.109 --> 01:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
of the Union so I feel that this is just
 
01:43:07.970 --> 01:43:07.980 align:start position:0%
another piece of that another way of
 
01:43:09.649 --> 01:43:09.659 align:start position:0%
coming in the back door to do the same
 
01:43:09.659 --> 01:43:10.669 align:start position:0%
coming in the back door to do the same
thing

01:43:10.669 --> 01:43:10.679 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:43:10.679 --> 01:43:12.050 align:start position:0%
thing
so

01:43:12.050 --> 01:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:14.090 --> 01:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
that's it thank you
 
01:43:16.129 --> 01:43:16.139 align:start position:0%
um I can't speak for anyone else on the
 
01:43:18.770 --> 01:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
committee but I can tell you that um
 
01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
as chairman I would never support
 
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
um that that notion we are part of the
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
union and furthermore this this bill or
 
01:43:29.050 --> 01:43:29.060 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to repeal
 
01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
just to be clear because there's some
 
01:43:32.689 --> 01:43:32.699 align:start position:0%
confusion in the public and our own
 
01:43:35.450 --> 01:43:35.460 align:start position:0%
people a New Hampshire lawn law
 
01:43:37.129 --> 01:43:37.139 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer cannot enforce
 
01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
federal law they just can't it's
 
01:43:42.530 --> 01:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
prosecuted by the U.S attorney's office
 
01:43:47.390 --> 01:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
um so the the question is is do we
 
01:43:49.310 --> 01:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
they already can't with this law or not
 
01:43:51.229 --> 01:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
so uh to the point that representative
 
01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
made about people at school New
 
01:43:55.070 --> 01:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law enforcement can't enforce
 
01:43:56.930 --> 01:43:56.940 align:start position:0%
federal law whether we say they can or
 
01:43:58.790 --> 01:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
they can't it's prosecuted by the U.S
 
01:44:00.109 --> 01:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
attorney's Office it has to be a federal
 
01:44:00.119 --> 01:44:02.149 align:start position:0%
attorney's Office it has to be a federal
agent

01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
agent
 
01:44:03.770 --> 01:44:03.780 align:start position:0%
the law that we passed was carefully
 
01:44:05.450 --> 01:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
vetted by the Attorney General's office
 
01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
we heard no testimony from law
 
01:44:09.410 --> 01:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement saying you know you've got
 
01:44:12.410 --> 01:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
to repeal this it's it's stopping us it
 
01:44:15.310 --> 01:44:15.320 align:start position:0%
just keeps New Hampshire taxpayer money
 
01:44:17.930 --> 01:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
and our law enforcement focused on New
 
01:44:21.410 --> 01:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire laws and not being part of
 
01:44:23.330 --> 01:44:23.340 align:start position:0%
task force and things of this nature
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
related to these issues we're talking
 
01:44:28.450 --> 01:44:28.460 align:start position:0%
about that keep changing related to
 
01:44:30.649 --> 01:44:30.659 align:start position:0%
executive orders and things of this
 
01:44:32.629 --> 01:44:32.639 align:start position:0%
Nature by these agencies at the federal
 
01:44:32.639 --> 01:44:34.430 align:start position:0%
Nature by these agencies at the federal
level

01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:44:35.930 --> 01:44:35.940 align:start position:0%
um we have enough to do enforcing our
 
01:44:37.810 --> 01:44:37.820 align:start position:0%
own laws as far as I'm concerned
 
01:44:39.890 --> 01:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
representative mannion did you have a
 
01:44:41.450 --> 01:44:41.460 align:start position:0%
question do you want to speak okay all
 
01:44:41.460 --> 01:44:42.530 align:start position:0%
question do you want to speak okay all
right

01:44:42.530 --> 01:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
um any further discussion representative
 
01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:45.530 align:start position:0%
um any further discussion representative
salik

01:44:45.530 --> 01:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
salik
 
01:44:47.330 --> 01:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
I just would
 
01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
point out that we swore an oath and a
 
01:44:54.109 --> 01:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
vow to uphold the U.S Constitution as
 
01:44:56.689 --> 01:44:56.699 align:start position:0%
well as the New Hampshire Constitution
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
and this is a law that says that we're
 
01:45:02.450 --> 01:45:02.460 align:start position:0%
going to disregard Federal
 
01:45:06.050 --> 01:45:06.060 align:start position:0%
rules so I I would not support I mean I
 
01:45:09.050 --> 01:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
don't support the itl
 
01:45:10.729 --> 01:45:10.739 align:start position:0%
I think we need to repeal the law
 
01:45:12.590 --> 01:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
because I think that having state laws
 
01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
that say we are not going to follow
 
01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
federal laws as a contradiction
 
01:45:18.890 --> 01:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
representative again I would agree with
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
you but that's not what this law does it
 
01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:22.860 align:start position:0%
doesn't say we don't agree with or
 
01:45:25.550 --> 01:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
refuse to enforce federal law
 
01:45:28.189 --> 01:45:28.199 align:start position:0%
we can already can't enforce federal law
 
01:45:30.109 --> 01:45:30.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law enforcement cannot
 
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
enforce a federal law this law were
 
01:45:34.970 --> 01:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
repealed that would not change they
 
01:45:36.770 --> 01:45:36.780 align:start position:0%
still can't
 
01:45:38.990 --> 01:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
um you have to be a Federal Officer to
 
01:45:41.149 --> 01:45:41.159 align:start position:0%
enforce federal law because if you were
 
01:45:42.530 --> 01:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire police officer and you
 
01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
arrested someone for a violation of
 
01:45:46.010 --> 01:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
federal law where would you take them
 
01:45:48.050 --> 01:45:48.060 align:start position:0%
you can't take them to the courthouse he
 
01:45:49.370 --> 01:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
can't be heard there he's got to be
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
prosecuted by the U.S attorney
 
01:45:52.910 --> 01:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
and if you're not a sworn federal agent
 
01:45:54.770 --> 01:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
you can't even prosecute it the U.S
 
01:45:57.290 --> 01:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
attorney is probably going to charge you
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
um representative James
 
01:46:02.510 --> 01:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman if you recall there was
 
01:46:05.990 --> 01:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
a law passed by the house well it's it's
 
01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
why now uh that allows border patrol
 
01:46:12.350 --> 01:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
agents and Customs and Border Patrol and
 
01:46:13.550 --> 01:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
all those folks
 
01:46:16.490 --> 01:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
in the North Country to to enforce state
 
01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
law so there was a lot enabling that
 
01:46:22.189 --> 01:46:22.199 align:start position:0%
again our state law enforcement officers
 
01:46:23.209 --> 01:46:23.219 align:start position:0%
are not
 
01:46:25.010 --> 01:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
federal law enforcement officers and
 
01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
have no jurisdiction to enforce federal
 
01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:27.770 align:start position:0%
have no jurisdiction to enforce federal
law

01:46:27.770 --> 01:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:46:27.780 --> 01:46:30.709 align:start position:0%
law
unless

01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:33.109 --> 01:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
I'll ask the court to call the roll
 
01:46:37.729 --> 01:46:37.739 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I didn't see it I'll never
 
01:46:40.970 --> 01:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:42.410 --> 01:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:44.629 align:start position:0%
that's okay
um

01:46:44.629 --> 01:46:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I wanted to
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
mention in the context of of this is
 
01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:51.109 align:start position:0%
mention in the context of of this is
um well

01:46:51.109 --> 01:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
um well
 
01:46:54.109 --> 01:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
the the current law I think we heard
 
01:46:54.119 --> 01:46:55.450 align:start position:0%
the the current law I think we heard
testimony

01:46:55.450 --> 01:46:55.460 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:46:58.129 --> 01:46:58.139 align:start position:0%
hasn't really had much of an effect or
 
01:47:00.910 --> 01:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
an impact at all in New Hampshire
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
what it does do is it lays the framework
 
01:47:06.290 --> 01:47:06.300 align:start position:0%
for changes that could have a much
 
01:47:09.290 --> 01:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
greater impact and and much more severe
 
01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:10.729 align:start position:0%
greater impact and and much more severe
consequences

01:47:10.729 --> 01:47:10.739 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
01:47:13.609 --> 01:47:13.619 align:start position:0%
and I think we're sort of seeing the
 
01:47:15.649 --> 01:47:15.659 align:start position:0%
fruits of that with a couple of bills
 
01:47:17.870 --> 01:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
that are kind of come before us a little
 
01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
bit later today
 
01:47:23.330 --> 01:47:23.340 align:start position:0%
um this bill when it was presented to us
 
01:47:25.729 --> 01:47:25.739 align:start position:0%
last year I think many people thought it
 
01:47:28.010 --> 01:47:28.020 align:start position:0%
was a bad idea we were going too far
 
01:47:30.410 --> 01:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
there were things that were done at the
 
01:47:33.970 --> 01:47:33.980 align:start position:0%
last minute to pair it back a little bit
 
01:47:36.169 --> 01:47:36.179 align:start position:0%
and it made it a little bit more
 
01:47:36.179 --> 01:47:37.390 align:start position:0%
and it made it a little bit more
palatable

01:47:37.390 --> 01:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
palatable
 
01:47:41.689 --> 01:47:41.699 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is is that we have a
 
01:47:44.930 --> 01:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
we have a national crisis when it comes
 
01:47:47.149 --> 01:47:47.159 align:start position:0%
to to gun violence and violence in our
 
01:47:51.850 --> 01:47:51.860 align:start position:0%
communities and and the hazards of of
 
01:47:54.770 --> 01:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
firearms in our in our schools and in
 
01:47:55.930 --> 01:47:55.940 align:start position:0%
public places
 
01:47:59.209 --> 01:47:59.219 align:start position:0%
uh and by
 
01:48:04.070 --> 01:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
chilling the ability of local uh and
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
state and federal officials to cooperate
 
01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh on investigations like this
 
01:48:14.090 --> 01:48:14.100 align:start position:0%
um it could potentially have impact
 
01:48:17.629 --> 01:48:17.639 align:start position:0%
especially if we expand it uh simply you
 
01:48:19.609 --> 01:48:19.619 align:start position:0%
know beyond things like Firearms
 
01:48:22.189 --> 01:48:22.199 align:start position:0%
trafficking and enforcement of gun laws
 
01:48:25.129 --> 01:48:25.139 align:start position:0%
into other areas where we really would
 
01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
like to see uh cooperation between
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
federal and state officials because it
 
01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
benefits New Hampshire to have federal
 
01:48:36.050 --> 01:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
and state cooperation around things like
 
01:48:37.970 --> 01:48:37.980 align:start position:0%
the enforcement of our laws around
 
01:48:40.970 --> 01:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
Fentanyl and around illegal illegal
 
01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:42.350 align:start position:0%
Fentanyl and around illegal illegal
narcotics

01:48:42.350 --> 01:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
narcotics
 
01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:44.290 align:start position:0%
narcotics
so

01:48:44.290 --> 01:48:44.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:48.970 --> 01:48:48.980 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is I support the move
 
01:48:52.189 --> 01:48:52.199 align:start position:0%
or actually I I
 
01:48:56.209 --> 01:48:56.219 align:start position:0%
will oppose the itl uh and uh and I ask
 
01:48:57.709 --> 01:48:57.719 align:start position:0%
for the support of other folks on the
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
committee as well
 
01:49:01.310 --> 01:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Muse
 
01:49:02.450 --> 01:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
um I would just like to say one more
 
01:49:04.430 --> 01:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
thing I was struck by representative
 
01:49:07.370 --> 01:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
salig I believe it's another Bill said
 
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
something about the safety and worries
 
01:49:12.109 --> 01:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
hiring guards at her synagogue
 
01:49:14.209 --> 01:49:14.219 align:start position:0%
and that's well taken
 
01:49:17.090 --> 01:49:17.100 align:start position:0%
um with regard to this bill and our law
 
01:49:19.149 --> 01:49:19.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement cooperating with Federal
 
01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
I myself am a Catholic and I enjoy the
 
01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
Latin Mass I think it's it's beautiful
 
01:49:27.649 --> 01:49:27.659 align:start position:0%
um having said that I I recently
 
01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
discovered that according to the FBI
 
01:49:31.010 --> 01:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
that might make me and the rest of my
 
01:49:33.229 --> 01:49:33.239 align:start position:0%
parishioners questionable I don't want
 
01:49:34.669 --> 01:49:34.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law enforcement involved
 
01:49:36.890 --> 01:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
in that any more than I would want them
 
01:49:38.209 --> 01:49:38.219 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
looking at your synagogue as as
 
01:49:44.030 --> 01:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
something so it like I said the federal
 
01:49:46.189 --> 01:49:46.199 align:start position:0%
laws just seems to be at the current
 
01:49:48.830 --> 01:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
time on a seesaw and we want some
 
01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:49.970 align:start position:0%
time on a seesaw and we want some
stability

01:49:49.970 --> 01:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
stability
 
01:49:51.709 --> 01:49:51.719 align:start position:0%
but that allows the clerk to call the
 
01:49:51.719 --> 01:49:53.689 align:start position:0%
but that allows the clerk to call the
role

01:49:53.689 --> 01:49:53.699 align:start position:0%
role
 
01:49:56.810 --> 01:49:56.820 align:start position:0%

legislate
 
01:51:03.050 --> 01:51:03.060 align:start position:0%
with an 11-9 vote I hear my close
 
01:51:04.850 --> 01:51:04.860 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
01:51:07.669 --> 01:51:07.679 align:start position:0%
and I opened executive session on House
 
01:51:09.669 --> 01:51:09.679 align:start position:0%
Bill 106
 
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
and I recognize representative me to
 
01:51:16.910 --> 01:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
make a motion I move that this bill is
 
01:51:19.070 --> 01:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate second Mr
 
01:51:20.930 --> 01:51:20.940 align:start position:0%
chairman seconded by representative
 
01:51:24.470 --> 01:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
Rhodes I will speak to my motion
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
um this is probably one of the most
 
01:51:28.070 --> 01:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
controversial of the bills that are
 
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
before us today and it's controversial
 
01:51:33.470 --> 01:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
because both sides have a have a very
 
01:51:37.070 --> 01:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
very compelling argument
 
01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
um the ability to
 
01:51:42.109 --> 01:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
to protect someone before or prevent
 
01:51:44.450 --> 01:51:44.460 align:start position:0%
someone from committing a crime or a
 
01:51:47.450 --> 01:51:47.460 align:start position:0%
violent act before they do it
 
01:51:49.790 --> 01:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
um is just would be would be awesome and
 
01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:51.050 align:start position:0%
um is just would be would be awesome and
amazing

01:51:51.050 --> 01:51:51.060 align:start position:0%
amazing
 
01:51:54.129 --> 01:51:54.139 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in my opinion
 
01:51:58.609 --> 01:51:58.619 align:start position:0%
violating people's due process rights
 
01:52:02.689 --> 01:52:02.699 align:start position:0%
is is not the balance on that test is in
 
01:52:04.910 --> 01:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
my opinion is not it's not in the favor
 
01:52:06.830 --> 01:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
of passing this law
 
01:52:08.930 --> 01:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
saying to someone
 
01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
based on someone else saying that they
 
01:52:15.229 --> 01:52:15.239 align:start position:0%
believe the person to be a danger in and
 
01:52:18.129 --> 01:52:18.139 align:start position:0%
of itself is a danger to our society
 
01:52:21.229 --> 01:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
today you know one one group may say
 
01:52:22.850 --> 01:52:22.860 align:start position:0%
this person's a danger tomorrow another
 
01:52:24.350 --> 01:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
group may say a different kind of person
 
01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
is a danger and having their weapons
 
01:52:29.270 --> 01:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
seized their right to protect themselves
 
01:52:31.370 --> 01:52:31.380 align:start position:0%
and their families and property seized
 
01:52:33.590 --> 01:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
putting the burden on them to prove that
 
01:52:37.510 --> 01:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
they are not mentally ill or dangerous
 
01:52:40.490 --> 01:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
Stan's puts the entire history of our
 
01:52:43.250 --> 01:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
constitution on its head making people
 
01:52:45.709 --> 01:52:45.719 align:start position:0%
prove that they're able to have a right
 
01:52:47.629 --> 01:52:47.639 align:start position:0%
that they already in the Constitution
 
01:52:49.189 --> 01:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
says they have
 
01:52:52.189 --> 01:52:52.199 align:start position:0%
that that that balance test in my mind
 
01:52:52.199 --> 01:52:53.810 align:start position:0%
that that that balance test in my mind
fails

01:52:53.810 --> 01:52:53.820 align:start position:0%
fails
 
01:52:55.609 --> 01:52:55.619 align:start position:0%
um and with that I opened the discussion
 
01:52:57.890 --> 01:52:57.900 align:start position:0%
representative Newman did I just make a
 
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
I don't want to get away I'd like to
 
01:53:01.550 --> 01:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
have the clerk repeat to vote on the
 
01:53:03.470 --> 01:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
last one I believe she said 11 to 8 11
 
01:53:07.070 --> 01:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:08.570 --> 01:53:08.580 align:start position:0%
did you want to speak on this while I
 
01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:14.980 --> 01:53:14.990 align:start position:0%
well I think I did partially
 
01:53:14.990 --> 01:53:17.270 align:start position:0%
well I think I did partially
[Laughter]

01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:53:18.709 --> 01:53:18.719 align:start position:0%
would you like to reiterate your
 
01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
previous comments
 
01:53:24.350 --> 01:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
I'll just say that extreme risk
 
01:53:27.590 --> 01:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
protection orders are helpful because if
 
01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
someone in a family or
 
01:53:32.270 --> 01:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
relative or whatever whoever the people
 
01:53:35.689 --> 01:53:35.699 align:start position:0%
are that are allowed to make a a request
 
01:53:38.570 --> 01:53:38.580 align:start position:0%
for an extension of her order
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
they they pretty much know whether they
 
01:53:42.950 --> 01:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
are whether the person presents a danger
 
01:53:44.870 --> 01:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
to themselves or others
 
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
and it's not just a simple it is just
 
01:53:48.410 --> 01:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
don't write that down and hand it to
 
01:53:50.209 --> 01:53:50.219 align:start position:0%
somebody that usually the law
 
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement shows up they take a a
 
01:53:57.290 --> 01:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
statement under oath and then it has to
 
01:53:59.209 --> 01:53:59.219 align:start position:0%
go to a court so it's ex parte the
 
01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
individual that they are saying should
 
01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
not have access to weapons is not there
 
01:54:06.109 --> 01:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
and in Supreme Court cases
 
01:54:07.970 --> 01:54:07.980 align:start position:0%
it has said that when there is a
 
01:54:09.410 --> 01:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
governmental need and there is a short
 
01:54:13.370 --> 01:54:13.380 align:start position:0%
period of time involved that an ex parte
 
01:54:17.570 --> 01:54:17.580 align:start position:0%
uh hearing fulfills the rights fulfills
 
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
all the requirements of due process
 
01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
so therefore I I believe this
 
01:54:25.850 --> 01:54:25.860 align:start position:0%
constitutional I give it I say it's a
 
01:54:26.689 --> 01:54:26.699 align:start position:0%
good thing
 
01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:54:31.070 --> 01:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
I I will give since we've heard stories
 
01:54:33.410 --> 01:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
about anecdotal stories I have a
 
01:54:35.570 --> 01:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
relative that that was a police officer
 
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
who was opposed to every single kind of
 
01:54:40.970 --> 01:54:40.980 align:start position:0%
of law that would ever take any weapon
 
01:54:42.890 --> 01:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
away from anybody
 
01:54:45.470 --> 01:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
and I asked him about this law and he
 
01:54:48.109 --> 01:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
said he was in favor of it and it was
 
01:54:48.119 --> 01:54:49.550 align:start position:0%
said he was in favor of it and it was
because

01:54:49.550 --> 01:54:49.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:54:52.370 --> 01:54:52.380 align:start position:0%
he did not want he was glad that a
 
01:54:54.530 --> 01:54:54.540 align:start position:0%
situation had happened and they had used
 
01:54:56.689 --> 01:54:56.699 align:start position:0%
the red flag the uh
 
01:54:59.930 --> 01:54:59.940 align:start position:0%
extreme risk protection order laws and
 
01:55:01.850 --> 01:55:01.860 align:start position:0%
his comment to me which might surprised
 
01:55:03.890 --> 01:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
me immensely was
 
01:55:07.609 --> 01:55:07.619 align:start position:0%
I wanted to not have that person have
 
01:55:10.370 --> 01:55:10.380 align:start position:0%
access to those weapons because I didn't
 
01:55:13.370 --> 01:55:13.380 align:start position:0%
want to be standing here tomorrow as he
 
01:55:14.590 --> 01:55:14.600 align:start position:0%
tried to
 
01:55:17.810 --> 01:55:17.820 align:start position:0%
commit suicide by cop
 
01:55:20.510 --> 01:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
and that and I that just surprised me
 
01:55:22.250 --> 01:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
and I just put out put that out there
 
01:55:24.290 --> 01:55:24.300 align:start position:0%
for information thank you very much
 
01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your comments
 
01:55:27.890 --> 01:55:27.900 align:start position:0%
representative Newman representative
 
01:55:30.890 --> 01:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
Rhodes thank you Mr chairman well I
 
01:55:32.330 --> 01:55:32.340 align:start position:0%
recognize that there's probably not
 
01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
anything that anybody's going to say in
 
01:55:35.090 --> 01:55:35.100 align:start position:0%
this committee today that's going to
 
01:55:36.770 --> 01:55:36.780 align:start position:0%
change anybody's mind
 
01:55:39.590 --> 01:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
what I would like to say is the
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
it is unfortunate that if this were to
 
01:55:45.490 --> 01:55:45.500 align:start position:0%
become law
 
01:55:49.189 --> 01:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
the abuse that can be had by this and a
 
01:55:51.290 --> 01:55:51.300 align:start position:0%
perfect example is
 
01:55:55.790 --> 01:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
a very bad divorce going very very wrong
 
01:55:59.030 --> 01:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
and I actually know of a perfect example
 
01:56:01.609 --> 01:56:01.619 align:start position:0%
of this where a wife unfortunately was
 
01:56:04.149 --> 01:56:04.159 align:start position:0%
not getting what she thought she should
 
01:56:07.970 --> 01:56:07.980 align:start position:0%
and the husband was an avid Hunter
 
01:56:10.250 --> 01:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
he at the time had custody of the
 
01:56:10.260 --> 01:56:12.470 align:start position:0%
he at the time had custody of the
children

01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:14.450 --> 01:56:14.460 align:start position:0%
and there's some very bad things that
 
01:56:16.850 --> 01:56:16.860 align:start position:0%
happened to him because of that
 
01:56:20.750 --> 01:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
and as much as I I can understand the
 
01:56:23.209 --> 01:56:23.219 align:start position:0%
fear as a parent and in a child that you
 
01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:27.890 --> 01:56:27.900 align:start position:0%
that isn't ex that is just a thought
 
01:56:30.050 --> 01:56:30.060 align:start position:0%
that nobody should ever have to go
 
01:56:31.370 --> 01:56:31.380 align:start position:0%
through and I recognize that
 
01:56:32.930 --> 01:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
unfortunately as parents we do have to
 
01:56:34.970 --> 01:56:34.980 align:start position:0%
sometimes go through that
 
01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
but I also have to say that there is
 
01:56:38.209 --> 01:56:38.219 align:start position:0%
nowhere else in the law do we take away
 
01:56:40.010 --> 01:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
somebody's rights just simply out of
 
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
fear of something that somebody may say
 
01:56:46.189 --> 01:56:46.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:56:49.310 --> 01:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:54.530 --> 01:56:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:56.750 --> 01:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
that I just want to contribute a little
 
01:56:59.330 --> 01:56:59.340 align:start position:0%
bit to the conversation in that
 
01:56:59.340 --> 01:57:00.709 align:start position:0%
bit to the conversation in that
um

01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:00.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
I just keep coming back to this phone
 
01:57:05.510 --> 01:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
call from a friend of mine in domestic
 
01:57:07.129 --> 01:57:07.139 align:start position:0%
violence situation calling me and
 
01:57:08.810 --> 01:57:08.820 align:start position:0%
telling me that she was at the point
 
01:57:10.970 --> 01:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
where she was trying to hide the guns
 
01:57:14.570 --> 01:57:14.580 align:start position:0%
because she needed to leave and I mean I
 
01:57:16.669 --> 01:57:16.679 align:start position:0%
I hopped on a plane let's be real you
 
01:57:20.209 --> 01:57:20.219 align:start position:0%
know but the bar for someone to deal
 
01:57:24.169 --> 01:57:24.179 align:start position:0%
with a domestic violence situation is
 
01:57:26.570 --> 01:57:26.580 align:start position:0%
it's it's very difficult
 
01:57:30.410 --> 01:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
um for for someone to to get help in
 
01:57:32.570 --> 01:57:32.580 align:start position:0%
that situation and I think that you know
 
01:57:34.370 --> 01:57:34.380 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day I'm gonna err on
 
01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
the side of
 
01:57:37.970 --> 01:57:37.980 align:start position:0%
um you know someone being able to to get
 
01:57:40.729 --> 01:57:40.739 align:start position:0%
that help more easily so
 
01:57:43.370 --> 01:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
thank you I would um I would just point
 
01:57:44.930 --> 01:57:44.940 align:start position:0%
out for the committee and for
 
01:57:44.940 --> 01:57:46.430 align:start position:0%
out for the committee and for
representative

01:57:46.430 --> 01:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:57:48.109 --> 01:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
um currently under the domestic violence
 
01:57:50.990 --> 01:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
laws you can get an ex an order uh
 
01:57:52.850 --> 01:57:52.860 align:start position:0%
protective order and part of the order
 
01:57:55.970 --> 01:57:55.980 align:start position:0%
is to confiscate all firearms of the
 
01:57:57.350 --> 01:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
person who is the subject to the order
 
01:58:00.709 --> 01:58:00.719 align:start position:0%
so we currently have that in law this
 
01:58:04.250 --> 01:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
would expand that dramatically to a
 
01:58:06.470 --> 01:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of people who can just say
 
01:58:08.930 --> 01:58:08.940 align:start position:0%
that I know this person and they're not
 
01:58:10.370 --> 01:58:10.380 align:start position:0%
acting quite right and I'm worried that
 
01:58:13.370 --> 01:58:13.380 align:start position:0%
they may be a danger in having their
 
01:58:15.470 --> 01:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
firearm season before they even get a
 
01:58:18.950 --> 01:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
say and it just again I go back to in my
 
01:58:20.750 --> 01:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
mind it turns the constitution on its
 
01:58:22.850 --> 01:58:22.860 align:start position:0%
head and says prove you're a worthy
 
01:58:24.290 --> 01:58:24.300 align:start position:0%
Citizen and then you can have your
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
rights and in my mind that is just um
 
01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's just Bridge Too Far although I
 
01:58:31.550 --> 01:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
agree with everything said about it
 
01:58:33.830 --> 01:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
would be great if we could
 
01:58:35.689 --> 01:58:35.699 align:start position:0%
but it's also
 
01:58:37.669 --> 01:58:37.679 align:start position:0%
in my mind we can't and shouldn't
 
01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes just because you can do
 
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:42.020 align:start position:0%
something doesn't mean you should
 
01:58:44.570 --> 01:58:44.580 align:start position:0%
representative Muse and then
 
01:58:46.189 --> 01:58:46.199 align:start position:0%
representative Jennifer and then
 
01:58:46.199 --> 01:58:48.830 align:start position:0%
representative Jennifer and then
representative

01:58:48.830 --> 01:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:51.830 --> 01:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
I wanted to point out that the reason
 
01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
for this bill
 
01:58:58.189 --> 01:58:58.199 align:start position:0%
um isn't to uh make sure that uh people
 
01:59:01.550 --> 01:59:01.560 align:start position:0%
who may have fear of another person have
 
01:59:03.830 --> 01:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
some sort of recourse or some sort of
 
01:59:07.129 --> 01:59:07.139 align:start position:0%
Channel legal channel for that fear
 
01:59:10.970 --> 01:59:10.980 align:start position:0%
um this bill is expressly designed to
 
01:59:13.070 --> 01:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
deal with situations where a person is
 
01:59:15.830 --> 01:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
an imminent threat to themselves or to
 
01:59:18.649 --> 01:59:18.659 align:start position:0%
others one of the things that we went
 
01:59:21.530 --> 01:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
through when we considered this bill in
 
01:59:23.689 --> 01:59:23.699 align:start position:0%
a prior session and there were several
 
01:59:25.070 --> 01:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
of us on the committee that was actually
 
01:59:27.649 --> 01:59:27.659 align:start position:0%
on the subcommittee that worked on this
 
01:59:29.810 --> 01:59:29.820 align:start position:0%
bill after it was retained over the
 
01:59:32.570 --> 01:59:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:34.850 --> 01:59:34.860 align:start position:0%
um one of the things I think that we all
 
01:59:37.790 --> 01:59:37.800 align:start position:0%
learned working together and it was a
 
01:59:40.070 --> 01:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee made up of of Republicans
 
01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
Democrats I think one thing that we
 
01:59:44.030 --> 01:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
agreed on is that we were going to have
 
01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
to agree to disagree on some in some
 
01:59:49.370 --> 01:59:49.380 align:start position:0%
areas but I think that there was
 
01:59:51.709 --> 01:59:51.719 align:start position:0%
agreement around
 
01:59:51.719 --> 01:59:52.510 align:start position:0%
agreement around
um

01:59:52.510 --> 01:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:56.149 --> 01:59:56.159 align:start position:0%
moving things like like the the burden
 
01:59:58.970 --> 01:59:58.980 align:start position:0%
of proof that's required in certain
 
02:00:01.370 --> 02:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
situations under the bill
 
02:00:04.430 --> 02:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
um I think that the where we wound up uh
 
02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
which is the bill that we have now is
 
02:00:10.669 --> 02:00:10.679 align:start position:0%
much more uh protective of property
 
02:00:10.679 --> 02:00:11.930 align:start position:0%
much more uh protective of property
rights

02:00:11.930 --> 02:00:11.940 align:start position:0%
rights
 
02:00:14.450 --> 02:00:14.460 align:start position:0%
um than uh than where we originally
 
02:00:17.950 --> 02:00:17.960 align:start position:0%
started with the bill uh three years ago
 
02:00:20.629 --> 02:00:20.639 align:start position:0%
getting back to uh something that I said
 
02:00:20.639 --> 02:00:21.770 align:start position:0%
getting back to uh something that I said
earlier

02:00:21.770 --> 02:00:21.780 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
um every time we do this we we learn
 
02:00:27.709 --> 02:00:27.719 align:start position:0%
things and if we get a chance we can
 
02:00:29.930 --> 02:00:29.940 align:start position:0%
apply those learnings and we can make
 
02:00:32.629 --> 02:00:32.639 align:start position:0%
the legislation better
 
02:00:34.850 --> 02:00:34.860 align:start position:0%
what we have in front of us
 
02:00:39.290 --> 02:00:39.300 align:start position:0%
is very good well-considered legislation
 
02:00:41.990 --> 02:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
that was the product of an incredible
 
02:00:46.129 --> 02:00:46.139 align:start position:0%
amount of time uh time and effort it was
 
02:00:49.250 --> 02:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
also subject to a huge amount of review
 
02:00:53.390 --> 02:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
by legal and constitutional experts
 
02:00:56.629 --> 02:00:56.639 align:start position:0%
we are on Solid ground with a law like
 
02:00:56.639 --> 02:00:57.609 align:start position:0%
we are on Solid ground with a law like
this

02:00:57.609 --> 02:00:57.619 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:01:01.070 --> 02:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
these laws are are already in effect in
 
02:01:02.649 --> 02:01:02.659 align:start position:0%
dozens of other states
 
02:01:06.050 --> 02:01:06.060 align:start position:0%
including States like Florida
 
02:01:09.350 --> 02:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
um we would not be an outlier or or
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional Rogues uh if we
 
02:01:14.810 --> 02:01:14.820 align:start position:0%
implemented a bill like this
 
02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
what we would be
 
02:01:19.490 --> 02:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
are people who are smart enough instead
 
02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
of reacting to something after the fact
 
02:01:26.209 --> 02:01:26.219 align:start position:0%
as virtually every state legislature who
 
02:01:28.370 --> 02:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
has passed one of these bills has been
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
in a situation where something terrible
 
02:01:34.250 --> 02:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
has happened and in response to that we
 
02:01:36.770 --> 02:01:36.780 align:start position:0%
feel like finally we need to act
 
02:01:41.930 --> 02:01:41.940 align:start position:0%
the problem is is we can't go back and
 
02:01:44.330 --> 02:01:44.340 align:start position:0%
we can't go back and and save those
 
02:01:47.149 --> 02:01:47.159 align:start position:0%
people so it's so in essence by letting
 
02:01:49.850 --> 02:01:49.860 align:start position:0%
this bill go we're basically saying
 
02:01:52.070 --> 02:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's gonna it's gonna take something
 
02:01:54.129 --> 02:01:54.139 align:start position:0%
like that happening in New Hampshire
 
02:01:57.770 --> 02:01:57.780 align:start position:0%
before we are willing to act
 
02:02:00.109 --> 02:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
and what I would say is we have an
 
02:02:03.410 --> 02:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do something now and we
 
02:02:04.669 --> 02:02:04.679 align:start position:0%
should take advantage of that
 
02:02:04.679 --> 02:02:05.930 align:start position:0%
should take advantage of that
opportunity

02:02:05.930 --> 02:02:05.940 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
02:02:07.609 --> 02:02:07.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:09.169 --> 02:02:09.179 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:16.790 --> 02:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
this bill would try to take preemptive
 
02:02:19.070 --> 02:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
measures to keep somebody from hiring
 
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
others so I would like to put this in a
 
02:02:25.250 --> 02:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
different context we just had our Super
 
02:02:25.260 --> 02:02:26.390 align:start position:0%
different context we just had our Super
Bowl

02:02:26.390 --> 02:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
Bowl
 
02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
last week
 
02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:29.990 align:start position:0%
last week
and

02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:32.209 --> 02:02:32.219 align:start position:0%
you're at you have a bunch your next
 
02:02:33.589 --> 02:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
door neighbor has a bunch of his friends
 
02:02:33.599 --> 02:02:34.810 align:start position:0%
door neighbor has a bunch of his friends
over

02:02:34.810 --> 02:02:34.820 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:02:38.089 --> 02:02:38.099 align:start position:0%
and you see two or three of them through
 
02:02:39.950 --> 02:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
the window drinking alcohol
 
02:02:42.050 --> 02:02:42.060 align:start position:0%
so you call the police and you say
 
02:02:45.109 --> 02:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
listen I think these folks might go out
 
02:02:47.450 --> 02:02:47.460 align:start position:0%
and drunk drive and cause an accident
 
02:02:50.149 --> 02:02:50.159 align:start position:0%
so the police show up with six tow
 
02:02:53.330 --> 02:02:53.340 align:start position:0%
trucks and they take your cars away
 
02:02:56.629 --> 02:02:56.639 align:start position:0%
and then you can't get the cars back
 
02:02:58.790 --> 02:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
until you've proven that you won't drunk
 
02:02:59.990 --> 02:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
alcohol again
 
02:03:02.510 --> 02:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
so that's what I liken this too we're
 
02:03:04.609 --> 02:03:04.619 align:start position:0%
trying to tell people
 
02:03:06.770 --> 02:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
that a constitutionally protected right
 
02:03:09.589 --> 02:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
can be removed because your next door
 
02:03:10.910 --> 02:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
neighbor thinks that you could be a
 
02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:12.109 align:start position:0%
neighbor thinks that you could be a
threat

02:03:12.109 --> 02:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
threat
 
02:03:14.330 --> 02:03:14.340 align:start position:0%
without any proof
 
02:03:18.109 --> 02:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
and so I I have a really hard time even
 
02:03:20.149 --> 02:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
conceiving that that we're going to go
 
02:03:22.490 --> 02:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
out and preemptively try to stop crime
 
02:03:24.410 --> 02:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
from happening
 
02:03:29.330 --> 02:03:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:32.030 --> 02:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
representative Bolden welcome back
 
02:03:33.470 --> 02:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:03:36.290 --> 02:03:36.300 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if I missed a key piece
 
02:03:38.810 --> 02:03:38.820 align:start position:0%
of the conversation I've been dealing
 
02:03:40.129 --> 02:03:40.139 align:start position:0%
with some health stuff and it's making
 
02:03:42.890 --> 02:03:42.900 align:start position:0%
me a little loopy but I'm confused about
 
02:03:46.490 --> 02:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
the conversation around
 
02:03:46.500 --> 02:03:48.050 align:start position:0%
the conversation around
um around

02:03:48.050 --> 02:03:48.060 align:start position:0%
um around
 
02:03:50.689 --> 02:03:50.699 align:start position:0%
the idea that this limits Liberties in
 
02:03:52.550 --> 02:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
some substantial way it's a temporary
 
02:03:55.550 --> 02:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
experience and consistently and
 
02:03:58.850 --> 02:03:58.860 align:start position:0%
historically in our country in in our
 
02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
system of government we limit Liberties
 
02:04:03.589 --> 02:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
on a temporary basis in the interest of
 
02:04:06.649 --> 02:04:06.659 align:start position:0%
justice and safety and I think some
 
02:04:11.089 --> 02:04:11.099 align:start position:0%
examples are I mean the first amendment
 
02:04:13.729 --> 02:04:13.739 align:start position:0%
um you know in court if the judge feels
 
02:04:15.890 --> 02:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
that you're as a defendant may be
 
02:04:17.450 --> 02:04:17.460 align:start position:0%
behaving inappropriately they can limit
 
02:04:19.970 --> 02:04:19.980 align:start position:0%
your ability to talk to the media
 
02:04:23.270 --> 02:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
um and uh or if they conceal a case and
 
02:04:25.189 --> 02:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
limit your ability to speak publicly on
 
02:04:26.870 --> 02:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
that case and specifically in law and
 
02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in the family court system
 
02:04:31.490 --> 02:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
um when there's a particular type of
 
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
case it's a misdemeanor for the parents
 
02:04:37.189 --> 02:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
involved sort of the defendants involved
 
02:04:38.689 --> 02:04:38.699 align:start position:0%
in the family court case to communicate
 
02:04:41.209 --> 02:04:41.219 align:start position:0%
with the media at all and is that not a
 
02:04:42.950 --> 02:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
First Amendment issue but for whatever
 
02:04:45.290 --> 02:04:45.300 align:start position:0%
reason it was felt appropriate to have
 
02:04:47.689 --> 02:04:47.699 align:start position:0%
rules along those lines to further the
 
02:04:50.750 --> 02:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
goals um the overarching goals and so
 
02:04:52.430 --> 02:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
there there is no sense
 
02:04:54.169 --> 02:04:54.179 align:start position:0%
I mean I think legislators should know
 
02:04:55.910 --> 02:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
if anyone that there is no sense that
 
02:04:57.290 --> 02:04:57.300 align:start position:0%
the first amendment is this hard fast
 
02:05:00.229 --> 02:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
Rule and we regularly make exceptions to
 
02:05:02.330 --> 02:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
it and when you're talking about the
 
02:05:03.709 --> 02:05:03.719 align:start position:0%
Fourth Amendment
 
02:05:07.189 --> 02:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
we just had a legislation about the
 
02:05:08.990 --> 02:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
topic that fish and game doesn't need a
 
02:05:11.629 --> 02:05:11.639 align:start position:0%
warrant we just live in that reality
 
02:05:14.510 --> 02:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
there we have so many exceptions to what
 
02:05:17.089 --> 02:05:17.099 align:start position:0%
we teach high schoolers or middle
 
02:05:19.010 --> 02:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
schoolers are hard and fast rules in our
 
02:05:21.250 --> 02:05:21.260 align:start position:0%
society and it seems
 
02:05:23.810 --> 02:05:23.820 align:start position:0%
counter-intuitive to argue
 
02:05:26.810 --> 02:05:26.820 align:start position:0%
that this is the one time that we can't
 
02:05:28.910 --> 02:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
make an exception when we live in a
 
02:05:30.830 --> 02:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
world of exceptions and I think the
 
02:05:32.810 --> 02:05:32.820 align:start position:0%
build system in general is like the
 
02:05:34.729 --> 02:05:34.739 align:start position:0%
biggest exception I can think of where
 
02:05:37.129 --> 02:05:37.139 align:start position:0%
you're not convicted you're not a
 
02:05:38.689 --> 02:05:38.699 align:start position:0%
criminal under the law but you're
 
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
sitting in jail not because you're found
 
02:05:43.189 --> 02:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
guilty but because you haven't even
 
02:05:45.890 --> 02:05:45.900 align:start position:0%
faced trial yet so it's confusing to me
 
02:05:48.350 --> 02:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
that that this would be the
 
02:05:51.229 --> 02:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
the one thing where we can't
 
02:05:53.209 --> 02:05:53.219 align:start position:0%
operate with the same exceptions that we
 
02:05:54.589 --> 02:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
apply to so many other essential
 
02:05:56.629 --> 02:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
Liberties like speech and literally
 
02:05:58.550 --> 02:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
Freedom itself when you're talking about
 
02:06:00.770 --> 02:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
putting someone in behind bars when they
 
02:06:02.270 --> 02:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
haven't faced trial and are criminally
 
02:06:05.149 --> 02:06:05.159 align:start position:0%
considered innocent
 
02:06:07.550 --> 02:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
thank you I would point out that in the
 
02:06:08.930 --> 02:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
bail situation
 
02:06:12.410 --> 02:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
um the defendant is allowed prior to the
 
02:06:14.450 --> 02:06:14.460 align:start position:0%
bail being set and again after the bail
 
02:06:16.550 --> 02:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
is set to be present for the hearing
 
02:06:18.410 --> 02:06:18.420 align:start position:0%
setting his bail and make arguments in
 
02:06:21.890 --> 02:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
his own defense and as far as pausing
 
02:06:24.770 --> 02:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
shortly pausing the Liberty in the
 
02:06:26.930 --> 02:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
interest of safety
 
02:06:28.790 --> 02:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
it's a little more complicated than that
 
02:06:30.169 --> 02:06:30.179 align:start position:0%
because you're not pausing it you're
 
02:06:32.629 --> 02:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
taking it away you're actually ripping
 
02:06:34.669 --> 02:06:34.679 align:start position:0%
it out of their house you're going to
 
02:06:36.169 --> 02:06:36.179 align:start position:0%
someone's house who may have a gun
 
02:06:38.810 --> 02:06:38.820 align:start position:0%
collection worth tens of thousands of
 
02:06:41.089 --> 02:06:41.099 align:start position:0%
dollars and you're going into their
 
02:06:44.030 --> 02:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
house into their home into their inner
 
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
inner sanctum and tearing their property
 
02:06:48.649 --> 02:06:48.659 align:start position:0%
away from them and saying if you want
 
02:06:51.050 --> 02:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
this come to court and prove you can
 
02:06:53.930 --> 02:06:53.940 align:start position:0%
have it that in my mind is a Verge tooth
 
02:06:55.550 --> 02:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
par representative meesh you wanted to
 
02:06:56.930 --> 02:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
respond to representative jamrith's
 
02:06:56.940 --> 02:06:59.870 align:start position:0%
respond to representative jamrith's
comments

02:06:59.870 --> 02:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:03.109 --> 02:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
I I just wanted to to say that um
 
02:07:05.270 --> 02:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in this law that allows
 
02:07:07.669 --> 02:07:07.679 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to do anything without
 
02:07:10.609 --> 02:07:10.619 align:start position:0%
proof proof is an important part of the
 
02:07:13.310 --> 02:07:13.320 align:start position:0%
process affidavits need to be filled out
 
02:07:15.830 --> 02:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
and filed um even if it's an ex-party
 
02:07:19.550 --> 02:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
process if you are found later on to
 
02:07:21.649 --> 02:07:21.659 align:start position:0%
have falsely filed a report under under
 
02:07:24.229 --> 02:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
this bill that is a criminal offense
 
02:07:27.410 --> 02:07:27.420 align:start position:0%
that that will be punished every step of
 
02:07:29.629 --> 02:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
the way you know if you actually go
 
02:07:31.970 --> 02:07:31.980 align:start position:0%
through the text of the bill one of the
 
02:07:34.490 --> 02:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
things that you see are rigorous
 
02:07:36.950 --> 02:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
evidentiary standards
 
02:07:40.370 --> 02:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
um you know only to uh to get a
 
02:07:43.370 --> 02:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
temporary order but also to get a
 
02:07:45.229 --> 02:07:45.239 align:start position:0%
permanent order
 
02:07:47.930 --> 02:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
um I think another another thing uh that
 
02:07:50.330 --> 02:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
uh that we hear a lot um is that this
 
02:07:53.149 --> 02:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
amounts to confiscation of property
 
02:07:55.850 --> 02:07:55.860 align:start position:0%
the property is not confiscated the
 
02:07:58.970 --> 02:07:58.980 align:start position:0%
property remains under the ownership of
 
02:08:01.129 --> 02:08:01.139 align:start position:0%
the per of the person who it is
 
02:08:03.649 --> 02:08:03.659 align:start position:0%
temporarily taken from
 
02:08:06.709 --> 02:08:06.719 align:start position:0%
um it it does not become State Property
 
02:08:08.750 --> 02:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go up for auction it doesn't
 
02:08:11.990 --> 02:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
go up for sale it remains your property
 
02:08:16.250 --> 02:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
until the order uh expires or until you
 
02:08:17.930 --> 02:08:17.940 align:start position:0%
file a motion one of the things that's
 
02:08:20.810 --> 02:08:20.820 align:start position:0%
in the provision too or a provision in
 
02:08:24.290 --> 02:08:24.300 align:start position:0%
the bill is it um if you're a respondent
 
02:08:26.390 --> 02:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
in one of these orders and a permanent
 
02:08:29.450 --> 02:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
order has been issued against you you
 
02:08:31.729 --> 02:08:31.739 align:start position:0%
have the ability to go and file a motion
 
02:08:34.250 --> 02:08:34.260 align:start position:0%
at any period time before the end of the
 
02:08:37.250 --> 02:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
order that would uh that would allow you
 
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
your case to be reheard
 
02:08:42.589 --> 02:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
so there are actually if you read it and
 
02:08:44.689 --> 02:08:44.699 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why it's such a long
 
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
bill is because
 
02:08:50.030 --> 02:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
there are so many things that are done
 
02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
to properly balance the protection that
 
02:08:55.430 --> 02:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
it offers to provincial potential
 
02:08:59.350 --> 02:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
victims along with the property rights
 
02:09:02.629 --> 02:09:02.639 align:start position:0%
and the constitutional rights of the
 
02:09:02.639 --> 02:09:04.129 align:start position:0%
and the constitutional rights of the
respondent

02:09:04.129 --> 02:09:04.139 align:start position:0%
respondent
 
02:09:08.209 --> 02:09:08.219 align:start position:0%
so you know I I object to I think it's
 
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
very easy with something this long and
 
02:09:13.970 --> 02:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
this complex to frame it is doing things
 
02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
that it simply doesn't do
 
02:09:19.209 --> 02:09:19.219 align:start position:0%
um and what I would suggest to everyone
 
02:09:22.570 --> 02:09:22.580 align:start position:0%
regardless of of how you feel about this
 
02:09:25.790 --> 02:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
please take time to read the bill it's a
 
02:09:28.790 --> 02:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
pretty damn good Bill thank you
 
02:09:31.070 --> 02:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you it's been brought to my
 
02:09:32.450 --> 02:09:32.460 align:start position:0%
attention that I'm missing the right
 
02:09:34.189 --> 02:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
side of the room so representative
 
02:09:37.189 --> 02:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
Murphy Oh Thank you Mr chair
 
02:09:37.199 --> 02:09:37.850 align:start position:0%
Murphy Oh Thank you Mr chair
um

02:09:37.850 --> 02:09:37.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:40.430 --> 02:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
this bill creates what we know is is it
 
02:09:43.189 --> 02:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
it's a temporary uh restriction on a
 
02:09:46.250 --> 02:09:46.260 align:start position:0%
person's access to their firearms if the
 
02:09:48.589 --> 02:09:48.599 align:start position:0%
civil court judge finds by clear and
 
02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence that a person poses
 
02:09:54.709 --> 02:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
a significant danger of using Firearms
 
02:09:57.530 --> 02:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
to harm themselves or others this bill
 
02:10:01.250 --> 02:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
passed both Chambers in 2019-2020
 
02:10:03.649 --> 02:10:03.659 align:start position:0%
uh before being vetoed
 
02:10:05.330 --> 02:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
um and as chair of the subcommittee that
 
02:10:08.030 --> 02:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
heard this uh bill darnett that session
 
02:10:11.750 --> 02:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
I know it includes the inputs
 
02:10:13.550 --> 02:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
um and edits from a number of
 
02:10:13.560 --> 02:10:14.830 align:start position:0%
um and edits from a number of
stakeholders

02:10:14.830 --> 02:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
02:10:18.410 --> 02:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
this process ensures that a limited
 
02:10:20.450 --> 02:10:20.460 align:start position:0%
number of people are able to bring this
 
02:10:22.910 --> 02:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
forward and that would include family
 
02:10:25.490 --> 02:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
members those living within the
 
02:10:28.209 --> 02:10:28.219 align:start position:0%
household in law enforcement
 
02:10:31.370 --> 02:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
this is a tool you know this is a tool
 
02:10:33.229 --> 02:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
that we have for law enforcement it's a
 
02:10:35.390 --> 02:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
tool for families to save their loved
 
02:10:38.689 --> 02:10:38.699 align:start position:0%
ones lives you know it allows this this
 
02:10:40.910 --> 02:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
a short-term
 
02:10:45.890 --> 02:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
um uh urpo it only lasts five days in
 
02:10:47.810 --> 02:10:47.820 align:start position:0%
cases of imminent danger long-term
 
02:10:50.810 --> 02:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
orders can be longer but it's only that
 
02:10:54.169 --> 02:10:54.179 align:start position:0%
occurs only after a full hearing gun
 
02:10:56.270 --> 02:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
violence tragedies mass shootings gun
 
02:10:58.790 --> 02:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
suicides they're often preceded by red
 
02:11:00.890 --> 02:11:00.900 align:start position:0%
flags we see them and we where it's
 
02:11:03.530 --> 02:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
happening it's happening these are
 
02:11:06.070 --> 02:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
warning sets of warning signs of threats
 
02:11:08.750 --> 02:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
that we have to start doing something
 
02:11:10.609 --> 02:11:10.619 align:start position:0%
differently about
 
02:11:13.609 --> 02:11:13.619 align:start position:0%
this life-saving tool can help to
 
02:11:15.950 --> 02:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
protect prevent warning signs from
 
02:11:18.530 --> 02:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
escalating into tragedy
 
02:11:21.530 --> 02:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
um this you know one of the the concerns
 
02:11:23.810 --> 02:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
is that herpes don't have due process
 
02:11:25.850 --> 02:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
and you know and I suggest that that's
 
02:11:25.860 --> 02:11:27.169 align:start position:0%
and you know and I suggest that that's
false

02:11:27.169 --> 02:11:27.179 align:start position:0%
false
 
02:11:30.490 --> 02:11:30.500 align:start position:0%
um that bill this bill contains a a
 
02:11:34.010 --> 02:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
brief ex parte process to ensure
 
02:11:36.169 --> 02:11:36.179 align:start position:0%
Firearms are removed quickly in cases
 
02:11:37.490 --> 02:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
where there's an imminent risk of harm
 
02:11:39.770 --> 02:11:39.780 align:start position:0%
but that order lasts no more than five
 
02:11:41.689 --> 02:11:41.699 align:start position:0%
days as someone who worked in child
 
02:11:45.229 --> 02:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
protection years ago I know we we
 
02:11:47.330 --> 02:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
utilize ex parte orders to remove
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
children from imminent danger my hearing
 
02:11:54.530 --> 02:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
was you know followed as would uh in
 
02:11:55.850 --> 02:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
this case
 
02:11:58.729 --> 02:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
um you know there there are no Anonymous
 
02:12:01.070 --> 02:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
petitioners uh and the burden of proof
 
02:12:03.410 --> 02:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
is is pretty high
 
02:12:05.750 --> 02:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
um as far as taking herpes being filed
 
02:12:07.550 --> 02:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
for Revenge purposes I I think
 
02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative Muse spoke to
 
02:12:12.709 --> 02:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
um you know statements under oath
 
02:12:14.810 --> 02:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
um false statements under oath that's a
 
02:12:16.250 --> 02:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
crime and there are
 
02:12:18.649 --> 02:12:18.659 align:start position:0%
um penalties for that
 
02:12:22.850 --> 02:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
um passing HB 106 I just think it's time
 
02:12:26.270 --> 02:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
um and this tool will provide uh say um
 
02:12:29.149 --> 02:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
a way to prevent those gun suicide and
 
02:12:31.070 --> 02:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
mass shootings it was mentioned prior
 
02:12:33.350 --> 02:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
that we can't predict someone's mental
 
02:12:35.870 --> 02:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
health but I'd suggest that though it's
 
02:12:37.550 --> 02:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
true we can't always be certain of the
 
02:12:40.430 --> 02:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
actions those in crisis will take those
 
02:12:42.770 --> 02:12:42.780 align:start position:0%
of us who've worked in mental health
 
02:12:44.689 --> 02:12:44.699 align:start position:0%
um in the in the mental health field or
 
02:12:46.010 --> 02:12:46.020 align:start position:0%
have loved ones with mental health
 
02:12:48.229 --> 02:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
challenges we recognize that there are
 
02:12:50.290 --> 02:12:50.300 align:start position:0%
definitely times when there can be
 
02:12:53.689 --> 02:12:53.699 align:start position:0%
observable signs of suicide risk
 
02:12:56.330 --> 02:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
um passing an uh arpa law here can redo
 
02:12:58.310 --> 02:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
use the suicidal person's access to
 
02:13:01.010 --> 02:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
firearms and save those lives I just
 
02:13:02.450 --> 02:13:02.460 align:start position:0%
want to end on in the words of a New
 
02:13:04.250 --> 02:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizen who reached out to us
 
02:13:06.470 --> 02:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
on the committee while embracing the
 
02:13:09.410 --> 02:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
vision of personal rights must be this
 
02:13:11.270 --> 02:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
must be tempered by our responsibilities
 
02:13:14.089 --> 02:13:14.099 align:start position:0%
to each other as a civil society we must
 
02:13:16.010 --> 02:13:16.020 align:start position:0%
do what we can to help stop gun violence
 
02:13:17.569 --> 02:13:17.579 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Murphy
 
02:13:21.649 --> 02:13:21.659 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
02:13:23.330 --> 02:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
did you
 
02:13:23.340 --> 02:13:25.310 align:start position:0%
did you
okay

okay
 
02:13:27.010 --> 02:13:27.020 align:start position:0%
um that was supposed to say Newman
 
02:13:29.870 --> 02:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
02:13:32.209 --> 02:13:32.219 align:start position:0%
I can add nothing to the excellent
 
02:13:34.430 --> 02:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
summary that my colleague over here had
 
02:13:36.770 --> 02:13:36.780 align:start position:0%
made and it's a it's a result of all the
 
02:13:38.209 --> 02:13:38.219 align:start position:0%
activity that we went through because I
 
02:13:40.550 --> 02:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
was a member of that subcommittee we
 
02:13:43.550 --> 02:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
went through every single line and and
 
02:13:46.370 --> 02:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
it passed it it went where it went thank
 
02:13:47.750 --> 02:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
02:13:49.069 --> 02:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Newman
 
02:13:51.229 --> 02:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
representative salic
 
02:13:52.790 --> 02:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:13:52.800 --> 02:13:53.930 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:13:53.930 --> 02:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:56.089 --> 02:13:56.099 align:start position:0%
sorry school nurse I'll call back in a
 
02:13:56.099 --> 02:13:57.050 align:start position:0%
sorry school nurse I'll call back in a
moment

02:13:57.050 --> 02:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
moment
 
02:14:00.470 --> 02:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
um so I would just say uh representative
 
02:14:02.510 --> 02:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
Murphy said most of what I intended to
 
02:14:04.609 --> 02:14:04.619 align:start position:0%
say and the other thing is that in
 
02:14:07.129 --> 02:14:07.139 align:start position:0%
Florida which is a state we know tends
 
02:14:08.689 --> 02:14:08.699 align:start position:0%
to swing in a different direction than I
 
02:14:08.699 --> 02:14:10.069 align:start position:0%
to swing in a different direction than I
do

02:14:10.069 --> 02:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:14:11.750 --> 02:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
um they actually have a similar lot to
 
02:14:15.890 --> 02:14:15.900 align:start position:0%
this and just last year they used it and
 
02:14:18.229 --> 02:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
stopped a school shooting
 
02:14:20.569 --> 02:14:20.579 align:start position:0%
um they had a young person who was out
 
02:14:23.270 --> 02:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
of the schools and was demonstrating and
 
02:14:25.010 --> 02:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
posting a number of comments they were
 
02:14:26.810 --> 02:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
able to go and ultimately take
 
02:14:28.970 --> 02:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
possession of things they determined he
 
02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
was in fact a significant threat and
 
02:14:32.750 --> 02:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
they worked through the process to
 
02:14:34.250 --> 02:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
secure the weapons and prevent another
 
02:14:36.410 --> 02:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
school shooting
 
02:14:38.810 --> 02:14:38.820 align:start position:0%
you know if if someone is inconvenienced
 
02:14:40.609 --> 02:14:40.619 align:start position:0%
for four or five days will we ensure
 
02:14:43.490 --> 02:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
that they're mentally well but that
 
02:14:47.390 --> 02:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
saves the lives of five kids is that
 
02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
worth it 10 kids how many kids do we
 
02:14:52.729 --> 02:14:52.739 align:start position:0%
have to lose before it's worth saying
 
02:14:54.290 --> 02:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
I'm really sorry but you have to be
 
02:14:55.910 --> 02:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
inconvenienced for five days well make
 
02:14:57.709 --> 02:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
sure you're mentally stable enough to
 
02:14:59.870 --> 02:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
have this weapon
 
02:15:02.470 --> 02:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
that's certainly a interesting question
 
02:15:05.270 --> 02:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
worthy of debate um
 
02:15:09.109 --> 02:15:09.119 align:start position:0%
again I would go back to it's I I recall
 
02:15:12.169 --> 02:15:12.179 align:start position:0%
a movie uh it was called The Minority
 
02:15:14.870 --> 02:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
Report and where they were able to
 
02:15:16.490 --> 02:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
predict crime in the future and they
 
02:15:17.870 --> 02:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
would arrest people for crimes they
 
02:15:19.069 --> 02:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
hadn't commit but they knew they were
 
02:15:20.209 --> 02:15:20.219 align:start position:0%
going to commit
 
02:15:20.219 --> 02:15:21.830 align:start position:0%
going to commit
and

02:15:21.830 --> 02:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:15:24.709 --> 02:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
that didn't end well our constitution
 
02:15:26.830 --> 02:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
like it or leave it
 
02:15:30.530 --> 02:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
says clearly these are your rights and
 
02:15:32.629 --> 02:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
to the comment that it doesn't interfere
 
02:15:35.330 --> 02:15:35.340 align:start position:0%
with due process I would respectfully
 
02:15:38.149 --> 02:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
disagree you do get due process only
 
02:15:40.189 --> 02:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
after your property has been seized in
 
02:15:42.649 --> 02:15:42.659 align:start position:0%
your your home violated
 
02:15:44.870 --> 02:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
um in in the due processes you come
 
02:15:46.250 --> 02:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
prove to us
 
02:15:48.950 --> 02:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
that you're equal to every other citizen
 
02:15:51.709 --> 02:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
in the country and that to me is is
 
02:15:51.719 --> 02:15:52.750 align:start position:0%
in the country and that to me is is
wrong

02:15:52.750 --> 02:15:52.760 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
02:15:56.270 --> 02:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
Representatives Sue Newman
 
02:15:59.810 --> 02:15:59.820 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and I hope I've for the
 
02:16:01.250 --> 02:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
benefit of the committee I will try and
 
02:16:03.229 --> 02:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
not repeat so much of the good things
 
02:16:05.149 --> 02:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
that have already been said
 
02:16:07.490 --> 02:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
but what I did say last week that I will
 
02:16:10.910 --> 02:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
repeat is I am so sorry we all are
 
02:16:13.069 --> 02:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
probably sorry that we cannot legislate
 
02:16:16.310 --> 02:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
good behavior so bad behavior is out
 
02:16:20.569 --> 02:16:20.579 align:start position:0%
there and and I think that this bill
 
02:16:23.330 --> 02:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
which I because of last week I had
 
02:16:25.370 --> 02:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
looked it over quite a bit
 
02:16:28.129 --> 02:16:28.139 align:start position:0%
people busted their chops to try and get
 
02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:35.509 --> 02:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
19 states have it
 
02:16:39.889 --> 02:16:39.899 align:start position:0%
it apparently remains constitutional
 
02:16:42.610 --> 02:16:42.620 align:start position:0%
weapons aren't seized they're
 
02:16:45.530 --> 02:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
confiscated for a period of time until
 
02:16:48.530 --> 02:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:51.349 --> 02:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
and as for people it was mentioned
 
02:16:54.110 --> 02:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
earlier about a background checks and
 
02:16:56.870 --> 02:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
being adjudicated and whatever the
 
02:16:59.330 --> 02:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
example I used last week was the person
 
02:17:02.570 --> 02:17:02.580 align:start position:0%
who was not adjudicated of anything
 
02:17:05.389 --> 02:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
but due to circumstances that were going
 
02:17:07.429 --> 02:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
on in their life was absolutely going
 
02:17:10.070 --> 02:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
haywire at the time and when people knew
 
02:17:12.410 --> 02:17:12.420 align:start position:0%
it and knew that he was he or she was
 
02:17:14.389 --> 02:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
trying to get a gun wouldn't have been a
 
02:17:16.490 --> 02:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
good thing so that
 
02:17:19.190 --> 02:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
um things to him family members or
 
02:17:21.049 --> 02:17:21.059 align:start position:0%
whatever wouldn't happen
 
02:17:23.150 --> 02:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
it's Florida has been mentioned a few
 
02:17:25.250 --> 02:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
times and I think it was brought up last
 
02:17:25.260 --> 02:17:26.270 align:start position:0%
times and I think it was brought up last
week

02:17:26.270 --> 02:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
week
 
02:17:29.870 --> 02:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
at the hearing the Florida red flag law
 
02:17:32.209 --> 02:17:32.219 align:start position:0%
was put into effect after the Stoneham
 
02:17:33.830 --> 02:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
Douglas shooting
 
02:17:36.770 --> 02:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
and recent events that have that have
 
02:17:40.190 --> 02:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
been publicized and broadcast about I
 
02:17:43.310 --> 02:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
don't I have not heard any expert on any
 
02:17:47.330 --> 02:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
channel that has refuted that signs are
 
02:17:49.910 --> 02:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
all refuted the fact that signs are
 
02:17:52.310 --> 02:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
always there when somebody is looking to
 
02:17:54.410 --> 02:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
maybe you did
 
02:17:56.150 --> 02:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
02:17:58.849 --> 02:17:58.859 align:start position:0%
um that signs are always almost all I
 
02:18:00.770 --> 02:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
will say I will qualify it almost always
 
02:18:03.169 --> 02:18:03.179 align:start position:0%
evident with somebody so what if you can
 
02:18:05.389 --> 02:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
do something
 
02:18:07.250 --> 02:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
before something happens in New
 
02:18:08.870 --> 02:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where now somebody is
 
02:18:11.570 --> 02:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
scrambling to get a law into effect I
 
02:18:12.950 --> 02:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
would think that's a better thing to do
 
02:18:14.690 --> 02:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:18:17.150 --> 02:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:18.169 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
um

02:18:18.169 --> 02:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:21.169 --> 02:18:21.179 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I got to tell you I'm pleased to
 
02:18:22.849 --> 02:18:22.859 align:start position:0%
see my colleagues Newfound love of the
 
02:18:24.950 --> 02:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
Florida legislative process
 
02:18:28.429 --> 02:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
um I wonder if it applies quite broadly
 
02:18:30.889 --> 02:18:30.899 align:start position:0%
um but having said that
 
02:18:32.990 --> 02:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
um this is New Hampshire and other
 
02:18:34.429 --> 02:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
states do what the other states are
 
02:18:36.049 --> 02:18:36.059 align:start position:0%
going to do and we don't do what we do
 
02:18:38.929 --> 02:18:38.939 align:start position:0%
because other states do it we do what we
 
02:18:40.669 --> 02:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
do because our constituents ask for it
 
02:18:42.950 --> 02:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
or don't and it's clear that at least
 
02:18:44.570 --> 02:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
half of the constituents in here want
 
02:18:47.509 --> 02:18:47.519 align:start position:0%
want this and the other half don't I
 
02:18:49.730 --> 02:18:49.740 align:start position:0%
would point out that um of the years
 
02:18:51.889 --> 02:18:51.899 align:start position:0%
I've been here I have never gotten as
 
02:18:54.530 --> 02:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
much constituent email as I did on this
 
02:18:57.129 --> 02:18:57.139 align:start position:0%
I think it's somewhere over 2 000 emails
 
02:19:00.169 --> 02:19:00.179 align:start position:0%
people asking please do not pass this
 
02:19:00.179 --> 02:19:02.089 align:start position:0%
people asking please do not pass this
bill

02:19:02.089 --> 02:19:02.099 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:19:04.429 --> 02:19:04.439 align:start position:0%
um regardless of the impetus for that I
 
02:19:05.690 --> 02:19:05.700 align:start position:0%
just thought it was worthy of
 
02:19:08.330 --> 02:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
recognizing for the behalf of all those
 
02:19:09.889 --> 02:19:09.899 align:start position:0%
people that took the time to send us an
 
02:19:12.469 --> 02:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
email that we do see those and we do
 
02:19:14.750 --> 02:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
take those into account
 
02:19:16.310 --> 02:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
um whether or not we're able to respond
 
02:19:18.709 --> 02:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
to all several thousands of you is a
 
02:19:20.750 --> 02:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
different question
 
02:19:21.950 --> 02:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
um having said that I'm gonna ask the
 
02:19:25.070 --> 02:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:27.230 --> 02:19:27.240 align:start position:0%

seconded by representative Harriet
 
02:21:10.550 --> 02:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
Gathering would you like to speak to
 
02:21:13.130 --> 02:21:13.140 align:start position:0%
your motion representative yes
 
02:21:15.530 --> 02:21:15.540 align:start position:0%
um what this what this bill what this
 
02:21:18.770 --> 02:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
amendment does is it amends the bill to
 
02:21:20.809 --> 02:21:20.819 align:start position:0%
remove the original requirement from HP
 
02:21:20.819 --> 02:21:22.070 align:start position:0%
remove the original requirement from HP
HP

02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
HP
 
02:21:27.250 --> 02:21:27.260 align:start position:0%
um 351 that a a locking Firearms device
 
02:21:30.889 --> 02:21:30.899 align:start position:0%
or a locking safety device be included
 
02:21:32.870 --> 02:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
in the sale of all firearms in New
 
02:21:35.090 --> 02:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire well I think that's a really
 
02:21:38.389 --> 02:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
good idea we did hear testimony from
 
02:21:40.849 --> 02:21:40.859 align:start position:0%
people who thought that the added
 
02:21:42.889 --> 02:21:42.899 align:start position:0%
expense of that could constitute the
 
02:21:45.410 --> 02:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
equivalent of an unfunded mandate for an
 
02:21:48.050 --> 02:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
individual and I do believe that there's
 
02:21:49.849 --> 02:21:49.859 align:start position:0%
another part of the bill that is much
 
02:21:52.610 --> 02:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
more important for us to pass and that
 
02:21:54.650 --> 02:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
is the second part of the bill that
 
02:21:56.750 --> 02:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
actually would significantly strengthen
 
02:21:59.809 --> 02:21:59.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's Firearms negligence law
 
02:22:01.929 --> 02:22:01.939 align:start position:0%
involving children
 
02:22:01.939 --> 02:22:04.150 align:start position:0%
involving children
currently

02:22:04.150 --> 02:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:22:07.370 --> 02:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
if a child gains access to an unsecured
 
02:22:07.380 --> 02:22:08.929 align:start position:0%
if a child gains access to an unsecured
firearm

02:22:08.929 --> 02:22:08.939 align:start position:0%
firearm
 
02:22:08.939 --> 02:22:09.650 align:start position:0%
firearm
um

02:22:09.650 --> 02:22:09.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:12.050 --> 02:22:12.060 align:start position:0%
there the penalty for the for the
 
02:22:16.610 --> 02:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
firearm owner only takes effect if
 
02:22:18.830 --> 02:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
should the firearm be used in a reckless
 
02:22:20.950 --> 02:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
or threatening matter
 
02:22:23.090 --> 02:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
should it be used during the commission
 
02:22:25.849 --> 02:22:25.859 align:start position:0%
of a crime or if it's negligently
 
02:22:25.859 --> 02:22:27.250 align:start position:0%
of a crime or if it's negligently
discharged

02:22:27.250 --> 02:22:27.260 align:start position:0%
discharged
 
02:22:31.370 --> 02:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
so basically to constitute negligence of
 
02:22:32.690 --> 02:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
any kind
 
02:22:32.700 --> 02:22:33.610 align:start position:0%
any kind
um

02:22:33.610 --> 02:22:33.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:33.620 --> 02:22:35.950 align:start position:0%
um
almost

02:22:35.950 --> 02:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
almost
 
02:22:39.590 --> 02:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
the worst possible thing needs needs
 
02:22:41.950 --> 02:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
needs to happen and even if that happens
 
02:22:45.670 --> 02:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
our our law limits our recourse
 
02:22:48.889 --> 02:22:48.899 align:start position:0%
to a violation and a one thousand dollar
 
02:22:51.490 --> 02:22:51.500 align:start position:0%
fine uh
 
02:22:54.830 --> 02:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
I think we've all heard of incidents
 
02:22:54.840 --> 02:22:55.969 align:start position:0%
I think we've all heard of incidents
where

02:22:55.969 --> 02:22:55.979 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:22:58.070 --> 02:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
um some of these kids go over to another
 
02:23:01.130 --> 02:23:01.140 align:start position:0%
kid's house a parent leaves a gun
 
02:23:03.710 --> 02:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
unsecured the gun goes off and either
 
02:23:06.230 --> 02:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
the child who
 
02:23:08.870 --> 02:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
um who lives in the home or that one of
 
02:23:11.450 --> 02:23:11.460 align:start position:0%
the child's friends is severely injured
 
02:23:14.210 --> 02:23:14.220 align:start position:0%
sometimes even killed
 
02:23:16.250 --> 02:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
um these incidents do happen in New
 
02:23:18.469 --> 02:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we tend not to hear about them
 
02:23:20.450 --> 02:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
a lot uh because they really make the
 
02:23:22.070 --> 02:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
media and when they do make the media
 
02:23:25.190 --> 02:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
because they involve miners
 
02:23:28.250 --> 02:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
um uh they tend to disappear
 
02:23:31.130 --> 02:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
uh we don't actually keep any kind of a
 
02:23:36.170 --> 02:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
Statewide uh record of these of these
 
02:23:39.349 --> 02:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
incidents but the bottom line is is we
 
02:23:41.990 --> 02:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
know they're happening we had one a few
 
02:23:46.550 --> 02:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
years ago up in the Lakes region where a
 
02:23:49.370 --> 02:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
young man gained access to his parents
 
02:23:51.170 --> 02:23:51.180 align:start position:0%
and secured firearm and murdered
 
02:23:53.870 --> 02:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
murdered both of his parents
 
02:23:53.880 --> 02:23:54.950 align:start position:0%
murdered both of his parents
um

02:23:54.950 --> 02:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:58.010 --> 02:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
so you know these These are these are
 
02:24:00.830 --> 02:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
things that that do happen uh and I
 
02:24:00.840 --> 02:24:01.790 align:start position:0%
things that that do happen uh and I
think

02:24:01.790 --> 02:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:24:05.270 --> 02:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
the what this bill would not do is
 
02:24:08.870 --> 02:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
penalize uh Allah a biting gun owner uh
 
02:24:11.389 --> 02:24:11.399 align:start position:0%
in any way negligence is already a crime
 
02:24:13.670 --> 02:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire what it would do is
 
02:24:15.770 --> 02:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
send a clearer message to people that we
 
02:24:18.170 --> 02:24:18.180 align:start position:0%
are committed uh to enforcing this
 
02:24:20.210 --> 02:24:20.220 align:start position:0%
policy we are committed to the safety of
 
02:24:23.030 --> 02:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
children and that if you leave a firearm
 
02:24:25.490 --> 02:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
unsecured in a place where a child can
 
02:24:27.770 --> 02:24:27.780 align:start position:0%
gain access to it
 
02:24:30.230 --> 02:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
um there will be more severe
 
02:24:32.870 --> 02:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
consequences than there are now
 
02:24:35.450 --> 02:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
so I'm hoping that this is an amendment
 
02:24:37.910 --> 02:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
that we all can support and I'm be more
 
02:24:40.070 --> 02:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
than happy to answer any questions folks
 
02:24:43.210 --> 02:24:43.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:45.650 --> 02:24:45.660 align:start position:0%
representative Musa I have a question if
 
02:24:46.910 --> 02:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
you could
 
02:24:48.710 --> 02:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
um and I'm going to just say what I
 
02:24:50.330 --> 02:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
think and you tell me if I'm incorrect
 
02:24:53.630 --> 02:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
so this law does not mandate any type of
 
02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:54.370 align:start position:0%
so this law does not mandate any type of
um

02:24:54.370 --> 02:24:54.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:58.370 --> 02:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
locking securing providing any kind of
 
02:25:01.370 --> 02:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
locks all it says is that if a minor
 
02:25:03.170 --> 02:25:03.180 align:start position:0%
gets a firearm because you didn't lock
 
02:25:03.180 --> 02:25:03.950 align:start position:0%
gets a firearm because you didn't lock
it

02:25:03.950 --> 02:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:25:06.410 --> 02:25:06.420 align:start position:0%
and it's loaded or there's ammunition
 
02:25:10.250 --> 02:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
available then and the miner does any of
 
02:25:12.050 --> 02:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
the listed things with the firearm you
 
02:25:13.730 --> 02:25:13.740 align:start position:0%
would be guilty of a misdemeanor and if
 
02:25:16.849 --> 02:25:16.859 align:start position:0%
the child hurts somebody with that it
 
02:25:18.349 --> 02:25:18.359 align:start position:0%
would be a class B felony is that a
 
02:25:21.230 --> 02:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
correct um that is correct and one of
 
02:25:23.150 --> 02:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
the other things in the amendment is the
 
02:25:25.670 --> 02:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
original language says Shelby a class B
 
02:25:28.250 --> 02:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
felony I changed that to may be a class
 
02:25:30.670 --> 02:25:30.680 align:start position:0%
B felony because I think these are cases
 
02:25:33.590 --> 02:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh looking at it again that that do
 
02:25:35.510 --> 02:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
require discretion on the part of the of
 
02:25:38.150 --> 02:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
the court and uh and I would like the
 
02:25:41.030 --> 02:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
court to have that discretion the one
 
02:25:43.969 --> 02:25:43.979 align:start position:0%
thing I I would like to point out is
 
02:25:45.590 --> 02:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
that something that remains in the
 
02:25:48.770 --> 02:25:48.780 align:start position:0%
statute that I that has not been changed
 
02:25:51.410 --> 02:25:51.420 align:start position:0%
but a parent or guardian of a child
 
02:25:53.630 --> 02:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
who's injured or dies is a result of of
 
02:25:55.370 --> 02:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
an accidental shooting she'll be
 
02:25:58.070 --> 02:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
prosecuted only in instances where the
 
02:26:00.110 --> 02:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
parent or Guardian behaved in a grossly
 
02:26:02.990 --> 02:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
negligent manner manner that is an
 
02:26:05.690 --> 02:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
extremely high standard of proof we
 
02:26:08.389 --> 02:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
understand that that
 
02:26:10.969 --> 02:26:10.979 align:start position:0%
um that a potential legal charge is
 
02:26:10.979 --> 02:26:12.230 align:start position:0%
um that a potential legal charge is
probably

02:26:12.230 --> 02:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
probably
 
02:26:14.630 --> 02:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
um uh the last thing on the mind of a
 
02:26:16.550 --> 02:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
parent that's lost their child uh
 
02:26:18.590 --> 02:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
because because of this and we
 
02:26:21.050 --> 02:26:21.060 align:start position:0%
understand uh that we that it is
 
02:26:21.060 --> 02:26:22.610 align:start position:0%
understand uh that we that it is
important

02:26:22.610 --> 02:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:26:26.389 --> 02:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
um to recognize an addition to an act of
 
02:26:28.610 --> 02:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
negligence there's there's a huge loss
 
02:26:30.590 --> 02:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
that's taken place in the part of the
 
02:26:34.070 --> 02:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
parent so the bill doesn't change that
 
02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:35.710 align:start position:0%
parent so the bill doesn't change that
language

02:26:35.710 --> 02:26:35.720 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:26:40.250 --> 02:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
all it does essentially is to put
 
02:26:40.260 --> 02:26:41.150 align:start position:0%
all it does essentially is to put
um

02:26:41.150 --> 02:26:41.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:43.550 --> 02:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
some teeth into a law that needs a few
 
02:26:45.590 --> 02:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
more teeth and and I hope it's something
 
02:26:47.809 --> 02:26:47.819 align:start position:0%
we can agree on
 
02:26:50.210 --> 02:26:50.220 align:start position:0%
thank you um this time I'm going to call
 
02:26:53.030 --> 02:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
a five minute recess ask the Republicans
 
02:27:12.110 --> 02:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:17.030 --> 02:27:17.040 align:start position:0%

02:36:07.309 --> 02:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
yes I would
 
02:36:09.889 --> 02:36:09.899 align:start position:0%
uh yep so again
 
02:36:12.590 --> 02:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
this is another carve out where I cannot
 
02:36:14.510 --> 02:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
continue with my rights because I'm
 
02:36:17.809 --> 02:36:17.819 align:start position:0%
going to do another one of my rights I'm
 
02:36:19.670 --> 02:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
kind of having trouble with that so I'm
 
02:36:22.010 --> 02:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
gonna ital this
 
02:36:23.270 --> 02:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:36:25.190 --> 02:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
um I'll open the public uh excuse me
 
02:36:28.370 --> 02:36:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:31.969 --> 02:36:31.979 align:start position:0%
I understand I think the the
 
02:36:34.490 --> 02:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
um goal of this is that um
 
02:36:36.050 --> 02:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
at a polling place you shouldn't be
 
02:36:37.730 --> 02:36:37.740 align:start position:0%
intimidated on how you're going to vote
 
02:36:39.830 --> 02:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard that that has been an
 
02:36:42.170 --> 02:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
issue in in New Hampshire
 
02:36:42.180 --> 02:36:43.730 align:start position:0%
issue in in New Hampshire
um

02:36:43.730 --> 02:36:43.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:46.130 --> 02:36:46.140 align:start position:0%
Furthermore with regard to many polling
 
02:36:49.610 --> 02:36:49.620 align:start position:0%
places are in schools and as such
 
02:36:52.610 --> 02:36:52.620 align:start position:0%
anyone coming to the polls even if the
 
02:36:55.010 --> 02:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
school is closed for voting still has to
 
02:36:57.590 --> 02:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
comply with the federal law that says
 
02:36:59.870 --> 02:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
you can't carry a firearm at a school if
 
02:37:01.370 --> 02:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
you don't have a license to carry and I
 
02:37:02.870 --> 02:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
would encourage our law enforcement to
 
02:37:05.090 --> 02:37:05.100 align:start position:0%
enforce that law that already is on the
 
02:37:05.100 --> 02:37:06.710 align:start position:0%
enforce that law that already is on the
books

02:37:06.710 --> 02:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
books
 
02:37:08.809 --> 02:37:08.819 align:start position:0%
um but I I wholeheartedly agree with
 
02:37:10.969 --> 02:37:10.979 align:start position:0%
representative proves
 
02:37:13.250 --> 02:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
um very succinct
 
02:37:15.590 --> 02:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
reading of it is I have to give up
 
02:37:17.270 --> 02:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
another one of my rights to while I'm
 
02:37:19.010 --> 02:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
exercising the other right
 
02:37:21.410 --> 02:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
again it just doesn't make any sense I
 
02:37:23.510 --> 02:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
don't know what it would stop
 
02:37:25.309 --> 02:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
um what it where's the balance on that
 
02:37:26.929 --> 02:37:26.939 align:start position:0%
what what is the public safety interest
 
02:37:29.450 --> 02:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
versus telling people you can't come in
 
02:37:33.710 --> 02:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
here or with this with a firearm on
 
02:37:35.870 --> 02:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
um I haven't seen any issues in New
 
02:37:37.969 --> 02:37:37.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at polls I have I've watched
 
02:37:39.530 --> 02:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
those pretty closely and I just haven't
 
02:37:40.849 --> 02:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
seen it so
 
02:37:45.530 --> 02:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:48.110 --> 02:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
um I agree
 
02:37:49.849 --> 02:37:49.859 align:start position:0%
agreed the concerns that you voiced were
 
02:37:52.849 --> 02:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
the same concerns that I had but
 
02:37:55.490 --> 02:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
in the interest of really trying to
 
02:37:57.290 --> 02:37:57.300 align:start position:0%
reach out and
 
02:38:01.730 --> 02:38:01.740 align:start position:0%
um and and see why this was necessary I
 
02:38:04.790 --> 02:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
did hear a variety of stories of people
 
02:38:07.250 --> 02:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
being intimidated in that way so I mean
 
02:38:10.790 --> 02:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
excess especially if it is something
 
02:38:12.889 --> 02:38:12.899 align:start position:0%
that is already on the books and then is
 
02:38:15.950 --> 02:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
being just reinforced by state law I
 
02:38:18.710 --> 02:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
don't see the harm in that
 
02:38:21.050 --> 02:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
thank you um it would not be just
 
02:38:23.389 --> 02:38:23.399 align:start position:0%
reinforced though because you can if
 
02:38:24.969 --> 02:38:24.979 align:start position:0%
that's only with regard to the school
 
02:38:27.830 --> 02:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
and you can still do it with a license
 
02:38:29.450 --> 02:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
to carry this would actually take that
 
02:38:31.550 --> 02:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
away and it's further and that's only
 
02:38:34.250 --> 02:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
with regard to the schools and if you do
 
02:38:36.469 --> 02:38:36.479 align:start position:0%
have examples of people be intimidated
 
02:38:37.790 --> 02:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
and it was New Hampshire I'd love to
 
02:38:40.910 --> 02:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
hear those uh representative
 
02:38:43.550 --> 02:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly attorney general as well
 
02:38:43.560 --> 02:38:44.270 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly attorney general as well
um

02:38:44.270 --> 02:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:48.230 --> 02:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
I actually looked at the exceptions here
 
02:38:49.969 --> 02:38:49.979 align:start position:0%
and I'll read it from the bill and the
 
02:38:52.969 --> 02:38:52.979 align:start position:0%
provisions of RSA 159 27 shall not apply
 
02:38:54.830 --> 02:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
to law enforcement officers on duty at
 
02:38:57.290 --> 02:38:57.300 align:start position:0%
the polling place or to on uniformed
 
02:38:59.450 --> 02:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
officers while they are exercising their
 
02:39:01.910 --> 02:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
right to vote or to a person who secures
 
02:39:03.950 --> 02:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
an unloaded firearm in the motor vehicle
 
02:39:05.990 --> 02:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
I have a problem with that and here's
 
02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:07.070 align:start position:0%
I have a problem with that and here's
why

02:39:07.070 --> 02:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
why
 
02:39:09.469 --> 02:39:09.479 align:start position:0%
several times I have served as an
 
02:39:11.389 --> 02:39:11.399 align:start position:0%
elected Constable for the town of cebra
 
02:39:13.670 --> 02:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
I am on the currently on the ballot for
 
02:39:15.610 --> 02:39:15.620 align:start position:0%
March 14th
 
02:39:18.530 --> 02:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
to also take that office again the
 
02:39:20.030 --> 02:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
office of a constable
 
02:39:24.050 --> 02:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
actually is subject to Direction by the
 
02:39:26.210 --> 02:39:26.220 align:start position:0%
moderator at the polling place
 
02:39:29.210 --> 02:39:29.220 align:start position:0%
the Constable is not a uniformed police
 
02:39:29.220 --> 02:39:30.410 align:start position:0%
the Constable is not a uniformed police
officer

02:39:30.410 --> 02:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
officer
 
02:39:32.030 --> 02:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
and they are not considered a law
 
02:39:34.130 --> 02:39:34.140 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer on duty
 
02:39:36.170 --> 02:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
because they're an elected position
 
02:39:39.590 --> 02:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
so there's no carvo for a constable to
 
02:39:41.150 --> 02:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
be present at the polling place and be
 
02:39:43.670 --> 02:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
armed and to be called upon by the
 
02:39:46.309 --> 02:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
moderator to do his job he's still not
 
02:39:48.410 --> 02:39:48.420 align:start position:0%
on duty until he's called upon to do so
 
02:39:50.510 --> 02:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
so because that is not carved out I'm
 
02:39:52.870 --> 02:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
against the bill
 
02:39:56.450 --> 02:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
okay and no problem with the Shameless
 
02:39:58.490 --> 02:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
plug for your re-election
 
02:40:02.090 --> 02:40:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:03.230 --> 02:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
you know we just
 
02:40:05.330 --> 02:40:05.340 align:start position:0%
down a bill that would allow local and
 
02:40:08.150 --> 02:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
State Police to enforce the Federal Gun
 
02:40:10.910 --> 02:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
free school zone laws so we're saying
 
02:40:12.950 --> 02:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
our local and State Police can't enforce
 
02:40:16.130 --> 02:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
these laws I guess the one federal agent
 
02:40:17.750 --> 02:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
that we have for Maine and New Hampshire
 
02:40:19.490 --> 02:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
and part of Massachusetts could go to
 
02:40:21.590 --> 02:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
Every polling place in a quick circuit
 
02:40:23.030 --> 02:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
and hope that he can reach all of them
 
02:40:25.010 --> 02:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
while there are people violating these
 
02:40:26.809 --> 02:40:26.819 align:start position:0%
laws when the guns are in school zones
 
02:40:28.670 --> 02:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Attorney General's
 
02:40:30.110 --> 02:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
office is state and local authorities
 
02:40:31.610 --> 02:40:31.620 align:start position:0%
can't prevent people from bringing guns
 
02:40:33.770 --> 02:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
into polling places even those located
 
02:40:36.590 --> 02:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
in school zones as gun free school zones
 
02:40:39.050 --> 02:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
are a matter of federal law so
 
02:40:41.510 --> 02:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
we're we're making contradictory
 
02:40:43.670 --> 02:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
statements in our own committee about
 
02:40:46.370 --> 02:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
which laws or maybe cherry picking which
 
02:40:48.650 --> 02:40:48.660 align:start position:0%
laws to enforce and which law is not to
 
02:40:50.510 --> 02:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
enforce and claiming well we can't we
 
02:40:51.889 --> 02:40:51.899 align:start position:0%
don't need this because the federal law
 
02:40:54.290 --> 02:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
says this but yet we're also not going
 
02:40:55.910 --> 02:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
to do anything to reinforce and support
 
02:41:03.170 --> 02:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:03.180 --> 02:41:05.330 align:start position:0%
 
correct

02:41:05.330 --> 02:41:05.340 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:41:09.110 --> 02:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire police officers on no and
 
02:41:12.170 --> 02:41:12.180 align:start position:0%
no Universe can regardless of what laws
 
02:41:15.410 --> 02:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
we pass enforce federal law we could
 
02:41:15.420 --> 02:41:16.929 align:start position:0%
we pass enforce federal law we could
actually

02:41:16.929 --> 02:41:16.939 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:41:20.510 --> 02:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
repeal the bill we passed last year and
 
02:41:22.429 --> 02:41:22.439 align:start position:0%
put in a new bill that says New
 
02:41:23.809 --> 02:41:23.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire police can enforce all the
 
02:41:26.389 --> 02:41:26.399 align:start position:0%
federal laws it would have Zero Effect
 
02:41:30.230 --> 02:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
because under the United States laws and
 
02:41:33.410 --> 02:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
Constitution we can't do that we have no
 
02:41:35.030 --> 02:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
control over that it's only Federal
 
02:41:37.429 --> 02:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
officers that can do that now I guess
 
02:41:39.530 --> 02:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire laws certain ones Law
 
02:41:41.330 --> 02:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers could be dual sworn
 
02:41:43.610 --> 02:41:43.620 align:start position:0%
which I believe does occur and we have
 
02:41:45.230 --> 02:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
some who are on task force and things
 
02:41:46.849 --> 02:41:46.859 align:start position:0%
with them who wouldn't affect wouldn't
 
02:41:48.770 --> 02:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
be affected by that because they're
 
02:41:50.809 --> 02:41:50.819 align:start position:0%
already sworn federal agents
 
02:41:54.230 --> 02:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire law enforcement State
 
02:41:57.950 --> 02:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
local fish whatever cannot enforce
 
02:41:59.389 --> 02:41:59.399 align:start position:0%
federal law unless they are sworn
 
02:42:02.750 --> 02:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
Federal officers because only the United
 
02:42:04.730 --> 02:42:04.740 align:start position:0%
States Attorney can prosecute federal
 
02:42:04.740 --> 02:42:06.830 align:start position:0%
States Attorney can prosecute federal
crimes

02:42:06.830 --> 02:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
crimes
 
02:42:09.290 --> 02:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
so we're not talking out of both sides
 
02:42:11.570 --> 02:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
of our mouth what we're saying is
 
02:42:13.070 --> 02:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law enforcement can't
 
02:42:14.750 --> 02:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
enforce federal law
 
02:42:17.870 --> 02:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
this section as federal law is the only
 
02:42:19.429 --> 02:42:19.439 align:start position:0%
law of it and this isn't only about
 
02:42:21.050 --> 02:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
schools by the way this is about all
 
02:42:24.170 --> 02:42:24.180 align:start position:0%
polling places but with regard to school
 
02:42:26.090 --> 02:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
if it's a polling place
 
02:42:28.190 --> 02:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
what I was pointing out is that the law
 
02:42:29.990 --> 02:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
that requires
 
02:42:32.210 --> 02:42:32.220 align:start position:0%
people have a license to carry a firearm
 
02:42:34.849 --> 02:42:34.859 align:start position:0%
to go into the polling place
 
02:42:37.849 --> 02:42:37.859 align:start position:0%
still exists and even if the school is
 
02:42:37.859 --> 02:42:40.250 align:start position:0%
still exists and even if the school is
closed

02:42:40.250 --> 02:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
closed
 
02:42:42.110 --> 02:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law enforcement could
 
02:42:43.610 --> 02:42:43.620 align:start position:0%
never enforce that anyway because
 
02:42:45.710 --> 02:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
they're not federal agents it's a
 
02:42:48.469 --> 02:42:48.479 align:start position:0%
federal law if to your point the federal
 
02:42:50.809 --> 02:42:50.819 align:start position:0%
government decided to staff that up and
 
02:42:52.849 --> 02:42:52.859 align:start position:0%
start patrolling all the schools they're
 
02:42:55.370 --> 02:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
the only ones who could prosecute that
 
02:42:57.170 --> 02:42:57.180 align:start position:0%
you may respond
 
02:42:59.570 --> 02:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
just want to say so we have federal law
 
02:43:01.250 --> 02:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
that says to keep guns out of polling
 
02:43:03.950 --> 02:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
places and you've just said and we have
 
02:43:06.230 --> 02:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
voted against adding any state laws to
 
02:43:09.590 --> 02:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
reinforce federal laws or to to parallel
 
02:43:12.410 --> 02:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
them as the term might be so unless we
 
02:43:14.270 --> 02:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
pass a state law
 
02:43:16.550 --> 02:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
there is going to be continue to be no
 
02:43:17.929 --> 02:43:17.939 align:start position:0%
enforcement we're going to continue to
 
02:43:19.790 --> 02:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
have risk the chair Also earlier asked
 
02:43:21.349 --> 02:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
about people who felt intimidated by
 
02:43:23.630 --> 02:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
guns at polling places I will tell you I
 
02:43:25.130 --> 02:43:25.140 align:start position:0%
am one of those people who has felt
 
02:43:27.050 --> 02:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
intimidated at a polling place because
 
02:43:28.790 --> 02:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
of people coming in with their guns both
 
02:43:31.190 --> 02:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
when I was working as a town sworn
 
02:43:34.190 --> 02:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
election official and when I was there
 
02:43:37.370 --> 02:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
on my own as an individual to vote I am
 
02:43:39.110 --> 02:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
someone who personally chooses not to
 
02:43:40.849 --> 02:43:40.859 align:start position:0%
carry I have no desire to own a gun
 
02:43:42.710 --> 02:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
because I am well aware of my own
 
02:43:44.330 --> 02:43:44.340 align:start position:0%
physical incompetence and the likelihood
 
02:43:45.889 --> 02:43:45.899 align:start position:0%
I'd be much more likely to shoot myself
 
02:43:49.270 --> 02:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
than to do any good to anyone else
 
02:43:51.889 --> 02:43:51.899 align:start position:0%
but the reality is that when someone
 
02:43:54.050 --> 02:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
came up to me and it was clear that he
 
02:43:56.510 --> 02:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
was carrying even though it might be
 
02:43:56.520 --> 02:43:58.150 align:start position:0%
was carrying even though it might be
concealed

02:43:58.150 --> 02:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
concealed
 
02:44:00.590 --> 02:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
that when he came up and I had to ask
 
02:44:02.870 --> 02:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
him for his ID based on another law that
 
02:44:05.090 --> 02:44:05.100 align:start position:0%
was passed and his response was to
 
02:44:06.830 --> 02:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
thrust his hip at me and say I don't
 
02:44:08.270 --> 02:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
really need to show you
 
02:44:08.280 --> 02:44:09.889 align:start position:0%
really need to show you
expletive

02:44:09.889 --> 02:44:09.899 align:start position:0%
expletive
 
02:44:12.710 --> 02:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
that I certainly felt intimidated
 
02:44:15.110 --> 02:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
and it was because I was sitting next to
 
02:44:17.090 --> 02:44:17.100 align:start position:0%
someone else who was able to contact our
 
02:44:19.130 --> 02:44:19.140 align:start position:0%
local author or police officer who came
 
02:44:21.170 --> 02:44:21.180 align:start position:0%
over and proceeded to stand there and
 
02:44:22.910 --> 02:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
then escort this person through the
 
02:44:22.920 --> 02:44:24.050 align:start position:0%
then escort this person through the
premises

02:44:24.050 --> 02:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
premises
 
02:44:26.090 --> 02:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
but if you're asking about people
 
02:44:28.190 --> 02:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
feeling intimidated by people carrying
 
02:44:31.969 --> 02:44:31.979 align:start position:0%
yeah I felt intimidated absolutely
 
02:44:33.590 --> 02:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for sharing that with us that
 
02:44:36.650 --> 02:44:36.660 align:start position:0%
is that is not regrettable and it sounds
 
02:44:38.450 --> 02:44:38.460 align:start position:0%
like that person was pretty close to the
 
02:44:40.730 --> 02:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
brandishing law which would make him a
 
02:44:43.490 --> 02:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
criminal representative salic excuse me
 
02:44:43.500 --> 02:44:45.650 align:start position:0%
criminal representative salic excuse me
Bolden

02:44:45.650 --> 02:44:45.660 align:start position:0%
Bolden
 
02:44:48.349 --> 02:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
you just call me say like b
 
02:44:48.359 --> 02:44:49.790 align:start position:0%
you just call me say like b
um

02:44:49.790 --> 02:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:51.590 --> 02:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
02:44:51.600 --> 02:44:52.309 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
um

02:44:52.309 --> 02:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:54.830 --> 02:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
the on the topic of giving up a right to
 
02:44:57.410 --> 02:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
exercise right we already have laws in
 
02:44:59.090 --> 02:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
place in New Hampshire that are enforced
 
02:45:00.650 --> 02:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
that prohibit electioneering in a
 
02:45:03.530 --> 02:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
polling place and if memory serves I I
 
02:45:05.330 --> 02:45:05.340 align:start position:0%
don't I think I I think I missed the
 
02:45:08.030 --> 02:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
exec on the um
 
02:45:09.770 --> 02:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
it's bill
 
02:45:09.780 --> 02:45:11.090 align:start position:0%
it's bill
um but

02:45:11.090 --> 02:45:11.100 align:start position:0%
um but
 
02:45:13.790 --> 02:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh if memory serves it was maybe last
 
02:45:16.670 --> 02:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
year or maybe the election in 2021 when
 
02:45:18.349 --> 02:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
someone tried to vote in a polling
 
02:45:18.359 --> 02:45:19.309 align:start position:0%
someone tried to vote in a polling
station

02:45:19.309 --> 02:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
station
 
02:45:21.290 --> 02:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
um in a town somewhere and they were
 
02:45:22.730 --> 02:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
wearing a shirt that advocated for
 
02:45:24.530 --> 02:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
candidate and they were asked they were
 
02:45:26.389 --> 02:45:26.399 align:start position:0%
told they could not wear the shirt in
 
02:45:28.849 --> 02:45:28.859 align:start position:0%
the PlayStation in this person took off
 
02:45:30.950 --> 02:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
her shirt and proceeded to vote because
 
02:45:32.830 --> 02:45:32.840 align:start position:0%
one was legal and the other one wasn't
 
02:45:35.510 --> 02:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
and so she complied to the extent that
 
02:45:37.910 --> 02:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
she would topless and I think maybe
 
02:45:40.610 --> 02:45:40.620 align:start position:0%
hadn't worn a bra that day but
 
02:45:43.370 --> 02:45:43.380 align:start position:0%
um anyway so there's precedent there's
 
02:45:45.730 --> 02:45:45.740 align:start position:0%
an established precedent for
 
02:45:48.290 --> 02:45:48.300 align:start position:0%
requiring you to give up some rights in
 
02:45:50.330 --> 02:45:50.340 align:start position:0%
order to exercise another right so I
 
02:45:52.750 --> 02:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
don't understand logic in that argument
 
02:45:57.230 --> 02:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
and and that's also and chiefly an issue
 
02:45:59.330 --> 02:45:59.340 align:start position:0%
of voter intimidation and without a
 
02:46:00.710 --> 02:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
doubt I think in my own polling station
 
02:46:03.670 --> 02:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
given what I know of my own constituency
 
02:46:05.990 --> 02:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
I have strong feelings about the
 
02:46:07.610 --> 02:46:07.620 align:start position:0%
presence of police at the entrance to
 
02:46:09.230 --> 02:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
the polling station I understand their
 
02:46:10.730 --> 02:46:10.740 align:start position:0%
function and that they're trying to
 
02:46:12.590 --> 02:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
prevent they want to be available in
 
02:46:13.790 --> 02:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
case there's any kind of conflict
 
02:46:16.010 --> 02:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
between voters or protesters or
 
02:46:16.020 --> 02:46:17.450 align:start position:0%
between voters or protesters or
something

02:46:17.450 --> 02:46:17.460 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:46:20.570 --> 02:46:20.580 align:start position:0%
um but I every time they're there I try
 
02:46:21.710 --> 02:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
to engage and see if there's a better
 
02:46:23.030 --> 02:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
place that we can put them so they can
 
02:46:24.530 --> 02:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
set their purpose but they don't seem to
 
02:46:26.389 --> 02:46:26.399 align:start position:0%
be gatekeeper
 
02:46:28.670 --> 02:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
um they don't so they don't give an
 
02:46:30.710 --> 02:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
impression of their Gatekeepers and
 
02:46:32.929 --> 02:46:32.939 align:start position:0%
voter intimidation is and always should
 
02:46:32.939 --> 02:46:33.650 align:start position:0%
voter intimidation is and always should
be

02:46:33.650 --> 02:46:33.660 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:46:35.870 --> 02:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
um front of mind when you're talking
 
02:46:37.790 --> 02:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
about the experience that someone has
 
02:46:39.429 --> 02:46:39.439 align:start position:0%
walking through a polling station
 
02:46:42.710 --> 02:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
and that's why you know masks were not a
 
02:46:44.929 --> 02:46:44.939 align:start position:0%
requirement when we were going through a
 
02:46:46.790 --> 02:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
period of the majority of people wearing
 
02:46:48.710 --> 02:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
masks in public polling stations were
 
02:46:50.990 --> 02:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
not requiring it because you need to be
 
02:46:53.030 --> 02:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
able to feel comfortable voting and not
 
02:46:55.429 --> 02:46:55.439 align:start position:0%
feel pressured to vote a particular way
 
02:46:58.610 --> 02:46:58.620 align:start position:0%
when you're going in and
 
02:47:00.590 --> 02:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
so I think that it's always important to
 
02:47:01.849 --> 02:47:01.859 align:start position:0%
make sure that the experience of the
 
02:47:03.950 --> 02:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
voter going in is designed
 
02:47:06.830 --> 02:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
um to to remind them that they do have
 
02:47:08.750 --> 02:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
the rights of Voters they please and
 
02:47:10.790 --> 02:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
that they maintain their right to vote
 
02:47:12.650 --> 02:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
but I think it's also worth mentioning
 
02:47:14.030 --> 02:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
that not all polling stations are in
 
02:47:16.190 --> 02:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
schools Manchester has 12 polling
 
02:47:17.990 --> 02:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
stations and two of them off the top of
 
02:47:20.030 --> 02:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
my head are in churches and I don't know
 
02:47:22.849 --> 02:47:22.859 align:start position:0%
that they're anywhere near schools so it
 
02:47:24.230 --> 02:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
does seem like there's room for this
 
02:47:27.490 --> 02:47:27.500 align:start position:0%
kind of a proposal in our current
 
02:47:30.290 --> 02:47:30.300 align:start position:0%
election process in New Hampshire thank
 
02:47:34.730 --> 02:47:34.740 align:start position:0%
you thank you I would um I would respond
 
02:47:37.190 --> 02:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
with regards to logic um I think that
 
02:47:39.110 --> 02:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
there's a big difference between me not
 
02:47:41.570 --> 02:47:41.580 align:start position:0%
being able to wear my Tippy Canoe and
 
02:47:44.150 --> 02:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
Tyler II shirt to vote
 
02:47:44.160 --> 02:47:45.490 align:start position:0%
Tyler II shirt to vote
versus

02:47:45.490 --> 02:47:45.500 align:start position:0%
versus
 
02:47:48.469 --> 02:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
carry a firearm to protect myself if I
 
02:47:50.710 --> 02:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
am not allowed to wear my t-shirt
 
02:47:53.270 --> 02:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
I might get chilly if I can't carry my
 
02:47:57.230 --> 02:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
firearm I I may be killed um there's a
 
02:47:57.240 --> 02:47:57.969 align:start position:0%
firearm I I may be killed um there's a
difference

02:47:57.969 --> 02:47:57.979 align:start position:0%
difference
 
02:48:01.490 --> 02:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
but I like your your thinking and I
 
02:48:03.170 --> 02:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
would be happy to co-sponsor a bill in
 
02:48:05.090 --> 02:48:05.100 align:start position:0%
September that relates to voter
 
02:48:06.830 --> 02:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
intimidation whether it be with a
 
02:48:08.870 --> 02:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
firearm or something else I
 
02:48:11.090 --> 02:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
what representative salic happened in my
 
02:48:11.100 --> 02:48:11.929 align:start position:0%
what representative salic happened in my
mind

02:48:11.929 --> 02:48:11.939 align:start position:0%
mind
 
02:48:14.030 --> 02:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
um should be highly illegal what what
 
02:48:17.150 --> 02:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
you said happened to you and um and if
 
02:48:19.429 --> 02:48:19.439 align:start position:0%
it's not already illegal enough we can
 
02:48:22.130 --> 02:48:22.140 align:start position:0%
stiffen that penalty
 
02:48:24.650 --> 02:48:24.660 align:start position:0%
um representative Rhodes
 
02:48:25.790 --> 02:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I would just like
 
02:48:27.050 --> 02:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
to point out that um criminal
 
02:48:29.389 --> 02:48:29.399 align:start position:0%
threatening is illegal in the state of
 
02:48:31.790 --> 02:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the mere Act of
 
02:48:34.910 --> 02:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
burying your arm is not if you're doing
 
02:48:36.770 --> 02:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
that in a peaceful manner
 
02:48:40.370 --> 02:48:40.380 align:start position:0%
that is not and should not be illegal
 
02:48:42.590 --> 02:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
regardless of where you are
 
02:48:45.349 --> 02:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
I don't think that that sounded peaceful
 
02:48:46.910 --> 02:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
what she said she described
 
02:48:50.389 --> 02:48:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:52.010 --> 02:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
I would just like to point out that
 
02:48:53.990 --> 02:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
there are there already are places in
 
02:48:56.929 --> 02:48:56.939 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh where we do not allow
 
02:48:56.939 --> 02:48:58.190 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh where we do not allow
Firearms

02:48:58.190 --> 02:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
Firearms
 
02:49:00.710 --> 02:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
um those are our courts
 
02:49:03.170 --> 02:49:03.180 align:start position:0%
um we do not allow you to take a firearm
 
02:49:06.349 --> 02:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
into a court with with very good reasons
 
02:49:06.359 --> 02:49:07.010 align:start position:0%
into a court with with very good reasons
um

02:49:07.010 --> 02:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:10.130 --> 02:49:10.140 align:start position:0%
and there are many states uh who feel
 
02:49:13.309 --> 02:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
that polling places and other public
 
02:49:15.950 --> 02:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
places actually fall into the same
 
02:49:15.960 --> 02:49:17.510 align:start position:0%
places actually fall into the same
category

02:49:17.510 --> 02:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
category
 
02:49:21.410 --> 02:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
um the Supreme Court has recognized in
 
02:49:23.690 --> 02:49:23.700 align:start position:0%
the Heller Decision the ability of
 
02:49:26.630 --> 02:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
states to do this so nothing about doing
 
02:49:29.469 --> 02:49:29.479 align:start position:0%
this is is inconsistent is
 
02:49:33.170 --> 02:49:33.180 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional or is bad public safety
 
02:49:33.180 --> 02:49:34.389 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional or is bad public safety
policy

02:49:34.389 --> 02:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
policy
 
02:49:39.309 --> 02:49:39.319 align:start position:0%
this is one more thing that we can do to
 
02:49:43.969 --> 02:49:43.979 align:start position:0%
reduce the risk of uh in this case
 
02:49:46.790 --> 02:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
not only gun violence or accidental
 
02:49:49.849 --> 02:49:49.859 align:start position:0%
discharge of a firearm but it's one more
 
02:49:52.730 --> 02:49:52.740 align:start position:0%
thing that we can do to ensure that
 
02:49:56.330 --> 02:49:56.340 align:start position:0%
people feel comfortable that they feel
 
02:49:56.340 --> 02:49:57.910 align:start position:0%
people feel comfortable that they feel
safe

02:49:57.910 --> 02:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
safe
 
02:50:02.030 --> 02:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
and insecure when they're exercising one
 
02:50:04.309 --> 02:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
of their most important rights as
 
02:50:06.469 --> 02:50:06.479 align:start position:0%
Americans which is which is the right to
 
02:50:09.469 --> 02:50:09.479 align:start position:0%
vote and in New Hampshire we
 
02:50:12.650 --> 02:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
we uh we consume a lot of oxygen uh
 
02:50:14.630 --> 02:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
talking about our elections the
 
02:50:16.010 --> 02:50:16.020 align:start position:0%
importance of our elections the
 
02:50:18.849 --> 02:50:18.859 align:start position:0%
Integrity of our elections
 
02:50:22.070 --> 02:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
bringing a firearm into a polling place
 
02:50:22.080 --> 02:50:24.050 align:start position:0%
bringing a firearm into a polling place
uh

02:50:24.050 --> 02:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:50:29.290 --> 02:50:29.300 align:start position:0%
is a way potentially of exerting control
 
02:50:32.150 --> 02:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
exerting influence around somebody
 
02:50:36.110 --> 02:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
else's decision it's something that can
 
02:50:40.010 --> 02:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
that I know has uh has kept some people
 
02:50:42.110 --> 02:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
from voting I know in my own town in
 
02:50:44.450 --> 02:50:44.460 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth when the attorney general
 
02:50:46.670 --> 02:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
made his clarification a few years ago
 
02:50:49.910 --> 02:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
and said that yes Firearms are allowed
 
02:50:53.690 --> 02:50:53.700 align:start position:0%
in polling places under our law
 
02:50:57.230 --> 02:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
um we had several people who who quit
 
02:51:00.530 --> 02:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
and we had a hard time finding people to
 
02:51:03.710 --> 02:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
replace them and we asked our polar
 
02:51:06.650 --> 02:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
workers to do a lot we asked them to be
 
02:51:09.010 --> 02:51:09.020 align:start position:0%
at the polls in the time of a pandemic
 
02:51:11.990 --> 02:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
we asked them to work incredibly long
 
02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:13.030 align:start position:0%
we asked them to work incredibly long
hours

02:51:13.030 --> 02:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
hours
 
02:51:15.710 --> 02:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
we passed laws that make them
 
02:51:18.429 --> 02:51:18.439 align:start position:0%
accountable if they make mistakes
 
02:51:21.889 --> 02:51:21.899 align:start position:0%
I think one thing that we could that we
 
02:51:23.330 --> 02:51:23.340 align:start position:0%
could do that would make things a little
 
02:51:25.389 --> 02:51:25.399 align:start position:0%
bit easier for them is at least ensure
 
02:51:28.190 --> 02:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
that when they're doing their job and
 
02:51:30.410 --> 02:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
when they're helping the rest of us do
 
02:51:33.969 --> 02:51:33.979 align:start position:0%
our are helping the rest of us exercise
 
02:51:38.110 --> 02:51:38.120 align:start position:0%
our Democratic rights that they feel
 
02:51:41.090 --> 02:51:41.100 align:start position:0%
relatively safe in doing so and and I
 
02:51:43.010 --> 02:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
think introducing a firearm into that
 
02:51:45.469 --> 02:51:45.479 align:start position:0%
situation uh changes that
 
02:51:47.150 --> 02:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:51:49.490 --> 02:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Reed
 
02:51:51.230 --> 02:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I have to
 
02:51:54.889 --> 02:51:54.899 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree when um I go um
 
02:51:57.530 --> 02:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
someplace and I see that people are
 
02:51:59.990 --> 02:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
carrying lawfully and if there's
 
02:52:02.269 --> 02:52:02.279 align:start position:0%
officers there I that gives me a sense
 
02:52:05.929 --> 02:52:05.939 align:start position:0%
of safety my first feeling is not fear
 
02:52:08.150 --> 02:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
and and worry my feelings like if
 
02:52:11.030 --> 02:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
something happens we're covered
 
02:52:12.230 --> 02:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
um so I think it's a matter of
 
02:52:15.349 --> 02:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
perception and tomato tomato but from my
 
02:52:18.769 --> 02:52:18.779 align:start position:0%
perspective I feel safer knowing that we
 
02:52:21.050 --> 02:52:21.060 align:start position:0%
are not a soft target and that there are
 
02:52:23.510 --> 02:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
people there willing and trained to keep
 
02:52:27.230 --> 02:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
us safe thank you represent Stone
 
02:52:29.870 --> 02:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh two places in
 
02:52:31.550 --> 02:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that don't allow Firearms
 
02:52:33.410 --> 02:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
or prisons and courthouses the reason
 
02:52:35.330 --> 02:52:35.340 align:start position:0%
for that is you have prisoners there
 
02:52:37.670 --> 02:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
that could cause uh you know concern
 
02:52:39.710 --> 02:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
over the issues of Escape uh going
 
02:52:42.110 --> 02:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
forward with the polling places you have
 
02:52:43.730 --> 02:52:43.740 align:start position:0%
a moderator there that controls the
 
02:52:45.110 --> 02:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
elections of the polling place if
 
02:52:46.790 --> 02:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
there's an issue any citizen can contact
 
02:52:48.530 --> 02:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
the moderator the moderator finds it
 
02:52:49.969 --> 02:52:49.979 align:start position:0%
necessary they can contact law
 
02:52:51.710 --> 02:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement at least in my community we
 
02:52:53.269 --> 02:52:53.279 align:start position:0%
have law enforcement drove in and out of
 
02:52:56.210 --> 02:52:56.220 align:start position:0%
the polling locations non-stop it's very
 
02:52:58.190 --> 02:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
common to see people with Firearms
 
02:52:59.769 --> 02:52:59.779 align:start position:0%
showing up to vote
 
02:53:01.849 --> 02:53:01.859 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm fortunate because in our
 
02:53:02.990 --> 02:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
community we have less than 10 minutes
 
02:53:04.910 --> 02:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
you're in and out it's not a significant
 
02:53:07.370 --> 02:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
amount of time to be hanging out so I
 
02:53:09.110 --> 02:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
guess I really don't see the issue with
 
02:53:10.550 --> 02:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
trying to restrict someone for about 10
 
02:53:12.889 --> 02:53:12.899 align:start position:0%
minutes of pull time
 
02:53:14.870 --> 02:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative wheeler thank
 
02:53:16.490 --> 02:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
02:53:16.500 --> 02:53:17.450 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
um

02:53:17.450 --> 02:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:19.190 --> 02:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
all of these have been hard votes for me
 
02:53:20.690 --> 02:53:20.700 align:start position:0%
and I I understand where people are
 
02:53:22.670 --> 02:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
coming from on this end and I am not
 
02:53:24.530 --> 02:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
someone who at all I don't think anyone
 
02:53:26.630 --> 02:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
here on this committee wants gun
 
02:53:30.410 --> 02:53:30.420 align:start position:0%
violence or is uh heartened by the news
 
02:53:32.269 --> 02:53:32.279 align:start position:0%
stories that we're seeing on the news
 
02:53:34.730 --> 02:53:34.740 align:start position:0%
and the horrific nature of the crimes
 
02:53:36.530 --> 02:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing I'm not sure that
 
02:53:39.010 --> 02:53:39.020 align:start position:0%
legislation like what we have before is
 
02:53:41.090 --> 02:53:41.100 align:start position:0%
specifically for these polling place
 
02:53:43.849 --> 02:53:43.859 align:start position:0%
legislation is the way to move forward I
 
02:53:46.550 --> 02:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
don't think we're elected to legislate
 
02:53:49.070 --> 02:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
based off of how comfortable people are
 
02:53:51.290 --> 02:53:51.300 align:start position:0%
feeling I think
 
02:53:53.210 --> 02:53:53.220 align:start position:0%
like representative Reed said some
 
02:53:55.790 --> 02:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
people are comforted by other people
 
02:53:59.090 --> 02:53:59.100 align:start position:0%
having a weapon so the simple Act of
 
02:54:01.670 --> 02:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
having a weapon on your holster in a
 
02:54:03.349 --> 02:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
polling place while that might make
 
02:54:04.969 --> 02:54:04.979 align:start position:0%
someone feel uncomfortable given the
 
02:54:07.670 --> 02:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
news stories that people are are hearing
 
02:54:10.790 --> 02:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
um is not reason enough to restrict
 
02:54:12.530 --> 02:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
someone from being allowed to carry that
 
02:54:14.030 --> 02:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
weapon into the polling place when they
 
02:54:16.429 --> 02:54:16.439 align:start position:0%
vote and we heard from a lot of people
 
02:54:18.290 --> 02:54:18.300 align:start position:0%
that if if this was allowed if this
 
02:54:20.030 --> 02:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
passed that they would just leave their
 
02:54:22.250 --> 02:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
gun in the car or they just would not
 
02:54:24.410 --> 02:54:24.420 align:start position:0%
come so to representative Muse's point
 
02:54:26.690 --> 02:54:26.700 align:start position:0%
about people not voting because there
 
02:54:28.370 --> 02:54:28.380 align:start position:0%
potentially could be guns on someone
 
02:54:30.530 --> 02:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
else's hip what about the people who
 
02:54:31.550 --> 02:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
might not vote because they're not
 
02:54:32.750 --> 02:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to bring their gun into the vote
 
02:54:34.429 --> 02:54:34.439 align:start position:0%
the polling place so there's there's
 
02:54:36.290 --> 02:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
parallel arguments that could be made to
 
02:54:38.690 --> 02:54:38.700 align:start position:0%
all of this and I just think that we do
 
02:54:40.550 --> 02:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
not legislate based off of comfort we
 
02:54:42.110 --> 02:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
legislate based off of what's good
 
02:54:46.070 --> 02:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
policy and I do not see HB 444 as good
 
02:54:48.769 --> 02:54:48.779 align:start position:0%
policy thank you Mr chair
 
02:54:50.630 --> 02:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
02:54:50.640 --> 02:54:54.790 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
Manion

02:54:54.790 --> 02:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:00.230 --> 02:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:02.269 --> 02:55:02.279 align:start position:0%
I definitely will be voting for this
 
02:55:02.279 --> 02:55:03.650 align:start position:0%
I definitely will be voting for this
bill

02:55:03.650 --> 02:55:03.660 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:55:08.570 --> 02:55:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:08.580 --> 02:55:09.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:55:09.830 --> 02:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:55:12.349 --> 02:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that I see with
 
02:55:14.929 --> 02:55:14.939 align:start position:0%
this bill is intimidation
 
02:55:17.450 --> 02:55:17.460 align:start position:0%
and I literally do and every time that
 
02:55:19.130 --> 02:55:19.140 align:start position:0%
I'm at the polls and there's someone
 
02:55:21.830 --> 02:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
there and you can rather they're showing
 
02:55:23.990 --> 02:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
their guns or if they're hidden it
 
02:55:25.550 --> 02:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter because you can see that
 
02:55:27.889 --> 02:55:27.899 align:start position:0%
and not just me but there are other
 
02:55:29.870 --> 02:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
people that look like me have the same
 
02:55:33.050 --> 02:55:33.060 align:start position:0%
issues it's like a hair stands up and
 
02:55:34.670 --> 02:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
given what's going on across the United
 
02:55:36.950 --> 02:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
States and even what's going on here in
 
02:55:38.690 --> 02:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire when it comes to people of
 
02:55:38.700 --> 02:55:39.410 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire when it comes to people of
color

02:55:39.410 --> 02:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
color
 
02:55:41.210 --> 02:55:41.220 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that anyone should have
 
02:55:43.190 --> 02:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
any weapons there there's a police
 
02:55:45.530 --> 02:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
officer at every polling place that I'm
 
02:55:48.110 --> 02:55:48.120 align:start position:0%
aware of and that's enough
 
02:55:48.120 --> 02:55:49.790 align:start position:0%
aware of and that's enough
foreign

02:55:49.790 --> 02:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:55:52.370 --> 02:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
02:55:52.380 --> 02:55:54.110 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
Pratt

02:55:54.110 --> 02:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
Pratt
 
02:55:55.370 --> 02:55:55.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:55:57.469 --> 02:55:57.479 align:start position:0%
for letting me speak
 
02:56:00.230 --> 02:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
um looking at the bill itself it says
 
02:56:02.450 --> 02:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
you'll be guilty of a Class A
 
02:56:04.969 --> 02:56:04.979 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor if you carry a loaded or
 
02:56:06.410 --> 02:56:06.420 align:start position:0%
unloaded gun
 
02:56:09.469 --> 02:56:09.479 align:start position:0%
if you open carry or you conceal carry
 
02:56:12.950 --> 02:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
or whether your licensed or unlicensed
 
02:56:14.809 --> 02:56:14.819 align:start position:0%
so that means a person could be in
 
02:56:17.030 --> 02:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
violation of a Class B misdemeanor if
 
02:56:18.790 --> 02:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
they're carry an unloaded pistol
 
02:56:22.010 --> 02:56:22.020 align:start position:0%
concealed with a New Hampshire license
 
02:56:24.170 --> 02:56:24.180 align:start position:0%
and that's a total Infinity on your
 
02:56:26.750 --> 02:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
second amendment rights uh we can't
 
02:56:28.790 --> 02:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
protect people's feelings
 
02:56:28.800 --> 02:56:30.590 align:start position:0%
protect people's feelings
uh

02:56:30.590 --> 02:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:56:32.330 --> 02:56:32.340 align:start position:0%
just a few months ago a state
 
02:56:34.849 --> 02:56:34.859 align:start position:0%
representative felt intimidated by my
 
02:56:37.309 --> 02:56:37.319 align:start position:0%
hat I mean how far do we go
 
02:56:39.290 --> 02:56:39.300 align:start position:0%
how far do we do where do we draw the
 
02:56:41.630 --> 02:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
line on how far do we go on people's
 
02:56:43.670 --> 02:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
rights I would be voting against this
 
02:56:45.769 --> 02:56:45.779 align:start position:0%
bill for sure thank you
 
02:56:51.110 --> 02:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:53.330 --> 02:56:53.340 align:start position:0%
um to your point representative Pratt I
 
02:56:55.429 --> 02:56:55.439 align:start position:0%
would argue that you know we we do have
 
02:56:57.830 --> 02:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
that we do have that law that people
 
02:56:59.570 --> 02:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
cannot wear
 
02:56:59.580 --> 02:57:00.230 align:start position:0%
cannot wear
um

02:57:00.230 --> 02:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:03.290 --> 02:57:03.300 align:start position:0%
you know things that are
 
02:57:06.110 --> 02:57:06.120 align:start position:0%
um as as representative Bolton said
 
02:57:07.550 --> 02:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
earlier things that are in you know
 
02:57:09.650 --> 02:57:09.660 align:start position:0%
having a candidate or something like
 
02:57:11.690 --> 02:57:11.700 align:start position:0%
that that is already on the books so I
 
02:57:13.910 --> 02:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
mean I think when we talk about you know
 
02:57:15.769 --> 02:57:15.779 align:start position:0%
legislating based on
 
02:57:18.110 --> 02:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
um intimidation it
 
02:57:20.510 --> 02:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
it is kind of an extension of what we
 
02:57:26.230 --> 02:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:28.250 --> 02:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
nobody okay
 
02:57:30.290 --> 02:57:30.300 align:start position:0%
um this time oh representative Newman he
 
02:57:32.990 --> 02:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
did I did acknowledge Him
 
02:57:34.790 --> 02:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
and and the first thing I have is a
 
02:57:36.530 --> 02:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
question for the chair and it was the
 
02:57:39.290 --> 02:57:39.300 align:start position:0%
point you made about that New Hampshire
 
02:57:42.050 --> 02:57:42.060 align:start position:0%
Law Enforcement Officers cannot enforce
 
02:57:43.910 --> 02:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
02:57:46.969 --> 02:57:46.979 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering who enforces the who
 
02:57:48.830 --> 02:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
enforces the law about
 
02:57:50.990 --> 02:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
um not having weapons at the at the
 
02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:52.910 align:start position:0%
um not having weapons at the at the
polls

02:57:52.910 --> 02:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
polls
 
02:57:55.190 --> 02:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
you mean the schools if it's a school I
 
02:57:57.530 --> 02:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
mean at the courthouses I mean just oh
 
02:58:00.590 --> 02:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
one forces that the um I believe it's
 
02:58:01.969 --> 02:58:01.979 align:start position:0%
the court
 
02:58:04.070 --> 02:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
um the court security
 
02:58:06.469 --> 02:58:06.479 align:start position:0%
um it's a state law so um any state
 
02:58:08.990 --> 02:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
trooper if it's in a municipality any
 
02:58:12.230 --> 02:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
Municipal officer but it's a state I
 
02:58:17.990 --> 02:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:19.969 --> 02:58:19.979 align:start position:0%
the other thing I wanted to note is I
 
02:58:22.309 --> 02:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned I mentioned the the Supreme
 
02:58:26.809 --> 02:58:26.819 align:start position:0%
Court case that that goes to uh school
 
02:58:28.309 --> 02:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
no weapons in the Schools and Government
 
02:58:31.550 --> 02:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
places and then also in that in that
 
02:58:33.110 --> 02:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case
 
02:58:35.389 --> 02:58:35.399 align:start position:0%
what they have to do is look at the
 
02:58:38.210 --> 02:58:38.220 align:start position:0%
historical record to see what it is and
 
02:58:40.190 --> 02:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
they gave specific examples of things
 
02:58:42.110 --> 02:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
that are in the historical record that
 
02:58:43.550 --> 02:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
can be protected and one of them was
 
02:58:47.809 --> 02:58:47.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:50.450 --> 02:58:50.460 align:start position:0%
um I I agree the um that Supreme Court
 
02:58:53.570 --> 02:58:53.580 align:start position:0%
ruling did say that we could do that
 
02:58:55.550 --> 02:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
um and I guess my response would be what
 
02:58:57.410 --> 02:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
I said earlier sometimes just because we
 
02:58:59.750 --> 02:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
can do something doesn't mean we should
 
02:59:02.269 --> 02:59:02.279 align:start position:0%
um representative Stone
 
02:59:04.010 --> 02:59:04.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just in response to
 
02:59:06.469 --> 02:59:06.479 align:start position:0%
representative Newman the judicial
 
02:59:07.849 --> 02:59:07.859 align:start position:0%
branch has their own court security
 
02:59:09.349 --> 02:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
officers that have full powers of arrest
 
02:59:11.269 --> 02:59:11.279 align:start position:0%
at all our courts and at the superior
 
02:59:12.889 --> 02:59:12.899 align:start position:0%
court level it's done by the sheriff's
 
02:59:15.950 --> 02:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
office which also has bailiffs
 
02:59:18.950 --> 02:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
can I respond yes yes and I agree with
 
02:59:21.950 --> 02:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
you and I was the the courthouse does
 
02:59:23.570 --> 02:59:23.580 align:start position:0%
not have the same kind of federal law
 
02:59:26.090 --> 02:59:26.100 align:start position:0%
associated with it that the that it is
 
02:59:27.469 --> 02:59:27.479 align:start position:0%
so I
 
02:59:30.650 --> 02:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification
 
02:59:30.660 --> 02:59:33.889 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification
Stone

02:59:33.889 --> 02:59:33.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:33.899 --> 02:59:35.269 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:59:35.269 --> 02:59:35.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:59:37.070 --> 02:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
um I I would just say that the
 
02:59:40.730 --> 02:59:40.740 align:start position:0%
courthouse is indeed um is in law the
 
02:59:42.950 --> 02:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
the difference I see is that with the
 
02:59:45.650 --> 02:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
courthouse oftentimes you are dealing
 
02:59:45.660 --> 02:59:46.550 align:start position:0%
courthouse oftentimes you are dealing
with

02:59:46.550 --> 02:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:59:48.650 --> 02:59:48.660 align:start position:0%
um known criminals who have been
 
02:59:51.349 --> 02:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
convicted of violent crimes
 
02:59:53.330 --> 02:59:53.340 align:start position:0%
and their potential to have their
 
02:59:55.190 --> 02:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
Liberty taken for extended period of
 
02:59:57.590 --> 02:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
times oftentimes can drive emotions of
 
03:00:01.130 --> 03:00:01.140 align:start position:0%
them and their family members and it's
 
03:00:05.090 --> 03:00:05.100 align:start position:0%
um a lot a more volatile situation than
 
03:00:07.370 --> 03:00:07.380 align:start position:0%
whether or not you're going to vote to
 
03:00:09.250 --> 03:00:09.260 align:start position:0%
increase the school
 
03:00:13.490 --> 03:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
budget so again it's nuanced and both
 
03:00:15.769 --> 03:00:15.779 align:start position:0%
sides have a legitimate argument having
 
03:00:17.269 --> 03:00:17.279 align:start position:0%
said that this time I'd ask the court to
 
03:00:18.889 --> 03:00:18.899 align:start position:0%
call the roll unless I miss somebody
 
03:00:21.170 --> 03:00:21.180 align:start position:0%
else represent proof I missed you
 
03:00:22.790 --> 03:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
one thing I
 
03:00:25.190 --> 03:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
like to point out about courthouses
 
03:00:28.070 --> 03:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
that I see is everybody gets screened
 
03:00:31.309 --> 03:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
going into that building so I'm pretty
 
03:00:33.650 --> 03:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
sure there's no other guns besides the
 
03:00:35.269 --> 03:00:35.279 align:start position:0%
law enforcement that's in there and
 
03:00:37.070 --> 03:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
they're making a commitment
 
03:00:38.990 --> 03:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
of my security
 
03:00:40.849 --> 03:00:40.859 align:start position:0%
when they take away my right to bear
 
03:00:43.550 --> 03:00:43.560 align:start position:0%
arms they should be stepping up to say I
 
03:00:45.170 --> 03:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
will be safe and by screening everybody
 
03:00:47.690 --> 03:00:47.700 align:start position:0%
and making sure no other weapons come in
 
03:00:49.790 --> 03:00:49.800 align:start position:0%
they're doing that so that's the
 
03:00:51.170 --> 03:00:51.180 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
03:00:54.710 --> 03:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
courthouse in a polling place that I see
 
03:00:56.809 --> 03:00:56.819 align:start position:0%
thank you that that is a very compelling
 
03:00:59.330 --> 03:00:59.340 align:start position:0%
point that at the courthouse you are
 
03:01:01.250 --> 03:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
guaranteed at least safety from firearms
 
03:01:02.929 --> 03:01:02.939 align:start position:0%
because they've taken the extra steps to
 
03:01:05.630 --> 03:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
put the the magnetometers and screen to
 
03:01:07.250 --> 03:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
okay you can't bring your gun in but
 
03:01:08.389 --> 03:01:08.399 align:start position:0%
we're going to protect you by making
 
03:01:10.730 --> 03:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
sure no one else has one either if we
 
03:01:12.590 --> 03:01:12.600 align:start position:0%

03:03:53.450 --> 03:03:53.460 align:start position:0%
on this thank you Mr chair a specific
 
03:03:57.050 --> 03:03:57.060 align:start position:0%
issue with this bill is the penalties
 
03:03:59.330 --> 03:03:59.340 align:start position:0%
um and the potential of qualified
 
03:04:00.889 --> 03:04:00.899 align:start position:0%
immunity being removed from law
 
03:04:03.410 --> 03:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement offices I believe the local
 
03:04:06.230 --> 03:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
law enforcement should not be subject to
 
03:04:09.410 --> 03:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
the penalties that this bill uh puts in
 
03:04:10.969 --> 03:04:10.979 align:start position:0%
place there are some felonies involved
 
03:04:14.030 --> 03:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
there are costs attorney costs for the
 
03:04:16.670 --> 03:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
person who is being investigated by the
 
03:04:18.889 --> 03:04:18.899 align:start position:0%
federal government even though the law
 
03:04:20.389 --> 03:04:20.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer himself is not doing
 
03:04:23.330 --> 03:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
the investigation and and also there are
 
03:04:25.190 --> 03:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
some due process issues with him being
 
03:04:27.290 --> 03:04:27.300 align:start position:0%
terminated immediately
 
03:04:30.110 --> 03:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
upon any kind of Aid or assistance to
 
03:04:31.670 --> 03:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
federal law enforcement
 
03:04:33.650 --> 03:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
so for those issues I would recommend an

so for those issues I would recommend an
itl

03:04:34.790 --> 03:04:34.800 align:start position:0%

second
 
03:09:04.790 --> 03:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
represent Pro represent manually speak
 
03:09:07.429 --> 03:09:07.439 align:start position:0%
to emotion yes thank you Mr chair uh for
 
03:09:09.050 --> 03:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
clarification I don't know if this
 
03:09:11.030 --> 03:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
caused some issues with it I am not the
 
03:09:12.650 --> 03:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill even though the
 
03:09:14.870 --> 03:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
name is the same so I'm going to put
 
03:09:16.730 --> 03:09:16.740 align:start position:0%
that out to begin with
 
03:09:18.950 --> 03:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
the section of this bill while I
 
03:09:20.809 --> 03:09:20.819 align:start position:0%
understand the intent of it is to give
 
03:09:23.870 --> 03:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
it some teeth I don't think
 
03:09:25.910 --> 03:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
creating penalties for our local law
 
03:09:28.190 --> 03:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement just because they assist or
 
03:09:30.349 --> 03:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
Aid federal law enforcement in their
 
03:09:30.359 --> 03:09:32.210 align:start position:0%
Aid federal law enforcement in their
duties

03:09:32.210 --> 03:09:32.220 align:start position:0%
duties
 
03:09:35.090 --> 03:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
penalties up to be felonies paying for
 
03:09:36.730 --> 03:09:36.740 align:start position:0%
lawyer fees
 
03:09:38.809 --> 03:09:38.819 align:start position:0%
immediate termination which can cause
 
03:09:40.910 --> 03:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
some due process issues I don't think
 
03:09:44.330 --> 03:09:44.340 align:start position:0%
that part of the bill uh I support so it
 
03:09:46.370 --> 03:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
needs some work and for that reason I
 
03:09:48.550 --> 03:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
would support an Ito
 
03:09:50.269 --> 03:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
representative would you like to speak
 
03:09:52.010 --> 03:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
to you second
 
03:09:53.870 --> 03:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't say it needs some work I
 
03:09:55.849 --> 03:09:55.859 align:start position:0%
would say it needs a lot of work
 
03:09:55.859 --> 03:09:56.510 align:start position:0%
would say it needs a lot of work
um

03:09:56.510 --> 03:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:59.690 --> 03:09:59.700 align:start position:0%
that instant firing because
 
03:10:02.210 --> 03:10:02.220 align:start position:0%
they're required at least to
 
03:10:04.070 --> 03:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
maybe show up with their blue lights and
 
03:10:06.590 --> 03:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
is that considered assisting them when
 
03:10:08.450 --> 03:10:08.460 align:start position:0%
that's part of their Public Safety
 
03:10:10.309 --> 03:10:10.319 align:start position:0%
duties is to make sure everybody's safe
 
03:10:13.010 --> 03:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
including the public when these Fire
 
03:10:16.730 --> 03:10:16.740 align:start position:0%
Federal operations are happening so to
 
03:10:19.849 --> 03:10:19.859 align:start position:0%
say that we can't go and assist them to
 
03:10:22.190 --> 03:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
make our people safe
 
03:10:25.370 --> 03:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
I think with these big fines and
 
03:10:29.090 --> 03:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
penalties is just
 
03:10:33.469 --> 03:10:33.479 align:start position:0%
way too far so yep itl
 
03:10:36.469 --> 03:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
I would I would just add for um like a
 
03:10:39.110 --> 03:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
real world scenario or the the federal
 
03:10:41.030 --> 03:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
government raided uh whether you agree
 
03:10:42.710 --> 03:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
with it or not the home of the former
 
03:10:45.469 --> 03:10:45.479 align:start position:0%
president and there was a whole
 
03:10:47.030 --> 03:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
contingent of federal officers that
 
03:10:49.550 --> 03:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
raided it and the local police because
 
03:10:51.590 --> 03:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
it attracted a crowd had to keep the
 
03:10:53.510 --> 03:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
crowd back because even they didn't know
 
03:10:55.910 --> 03:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
what was going on so under this bill I
 
03:10:57.710 --> 03:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
believe we would be charging the local
 
03:11:00.230 --> 03:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
officers because they were there for the
 
03:11:03.650 --> 03:11:03.660 align:start position:0%
reason that it just it doesn't this does
 
03:11:06.050 --> 03:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
not make any sense and then to me it it
 
03:11:08.389 --> 03:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
smacks of some kind of anti-law
 
03:11:10.010 --> 03:11:10.020 align:start position:0%
enforcement and then I'll never support
 
03:11:12.830 --> 03:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
that in this committee anyone else
 
03:11:14.510 --> 03:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
and you can see none please call the

sorry my bad
 
03:12:40.610 --> 03:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
to pass I'm so used to saying Ito
 
03:12:42.230 --> 03:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
do I have a second
 
03:12:44.090 --> 03:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
I'll second it second it by
 
03:12:46.370 --> 03:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
representative Pratt it's the motion is
 
03:12:49.429 --> 03:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on the floor right now
 
03:12:50.630 --> 03:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
um representative would you like to
 
03:12:52.670 --> 03:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion again this is
 
03:12:54.410 --> 03:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
another one of those where
 
03:12:54.420 --> 03:12:56.690 align:start position:0%
another one of those where
um

03:12:56.690 --> 03:12:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:59.330 --> 03:12:59.340 align:start position:0%
ATF can kind of change its mind on on
 
03:13:01.790 --> 03:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
things kind of quickly with no due
 
03:13:04.309 --> 03:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
process so things that are made in New
 
03:13:06.530 --> 03:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and don't enter
 
03:13:10.550 --> 03:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce uh would be exempt
 
03:13:13.309 --> 03:13:13.319 align:start position:0%
from these laws and rapidly changing
 
03:13:15.230 --> 03:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
without Rhyme or Reason
 
03:13:17.269 --> 03:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh as long as they stay in New Hampshire
 
03:13:20.090 --> 03:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
so I I think that's a a pretty good
 
03:13:20.100 --> 03:13:21.710 align:start position:0%
so I I think that's a a pretty good
thing

03:13:21.710 --> 03:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
thing
 
03:13:23.330 --> 03:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
representative Pratt would you like to
 
03:13:24.769 --> 03:13:24.779 align:start position:0%
speak to you a second
 
03:13:28.250 --> 03:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
yes I second this is 174 license gun
 
03:13:30.349 --> 03:13:30.359 align:start position:0%
manufacturers in New Hampshire I'd like
 
03:13:32.030 --> 03:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
to support them those are people that
 
03:13:33.769 --> 03:13:33.779 align:start position:0%
are like you and me working in the state
 
03:13:36.590 --> 03:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and I believe this
 
03:13:38.990 --> 03:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
would help them in their businesses also
 
03:13:40.969 --> 03:13:40.979 align:start position:0%
the interstate commerce laws that was
 
03:13:43.790 --> 03:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
started in 1887 for the railroad have
 
03:13:45.889 --> 03:13:45.899 align:start position:0%
been overreached for many years in a lot
 
03:13:47.210 --> 03:13:47.220 align:start position:0%
of areas and this would help protect
 
03:13:49.670 --> 03:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
that in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:13:51.590 --> 03:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:13:54.429 --> 03:13:54.439 align:start position:0%
um in my mind this bill is not about
 
03:13:57.110 --> 03:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
firearm safety whatever side of the
 
03:13:59.269 --> 03:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
previous bills you come down on this is
 
03:14:02.750 --> 03:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
about the in my mind the expansion and
 
03:14:05.030 --> 03:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
growth of the federal government over
 
03:14:07.370 --> 03:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
every little aspect of our life and our
 
03:14:07.380 --> 03:14:08.510 align:start position:0%
every little aspect of our life and our
businesses

03:14:08.510 --> 03:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
03:14:12.590 --> 03:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
the ATF has jurisdiction over firearms
 
03:14:14.750 --> 03:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
because under the interstate commerce
 
03:14:17.690 --> 03:14:17.700 align:start position:0%
clause it was found you know by the
 
03:14:19.309 --> 03:14:19.319 align:start position:0%
court many many years ago that that
 
03:14:22.309 --> 03:14:22.319 align:start position:0%
qualified and so now they regulate
 
03:14:24.050 --> 03:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
everything about firearms and one day
 
03:14:25.670 --> 03:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
they'll say this is legal next day they
 
03:14:27.530 --> 03:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
say this isn't illegal they're unelected
 
03:14:27.540 --> 03:14:29.150 align:start position:0%
say this isn't illegal they're unelected
bureaucrats

03:14:29.150 --> 03:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats
 
03:14:31.190 --> 03:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
having said that
 
03:14:33.290 --> 03:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
we are protecting one of New Hampshire's
 
03:14:33.300 --> 03:14:34.630 align:start position:0%
we are protecting one of New Hampshire's
biggest

03:14:34.630 --> 03:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
biggest
 
03:14:38.290 --> 03:14:38.300 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and and sources of revenue
 
03:14:41.990 --> 03:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
of our fellow citizens who be it a small
 
03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:42.710 align:start position:0%
of our fellow citizens who be it a small
um

03:14:42.710 --> 03:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:45.950 --> 03:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturer or a huge one
 
03:14:47.690 --> 03:14:47.700 align:start position:0%
if it's made in New Hampshire and it
 
03:14:50.269 --> 03:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
stays in New Hampshire it is not by any
 
03:14:53.090 --> 03:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
definition interstate commerce and
 
03:14:54.469 --> 03:14:54.479 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to protect with
 
03:14:56.809 --> 03:14:56.819 align:start position:0%
this bill that I open it for discussion
 
03:14:59.150 --> 03:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
I see representative Newman and I heard
 
03:15:02.690 --> 03:15:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:05.990 --> 03:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
I just want to point out and read the
 
03:15:08.090 --> 03:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
last part of this bill
 
03:15:10.190 --> 03:15:10.200 align:start position:0%
because I think it has the same problems
 
03:15:11.870 --> 03:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
that we just talked about on the
 
03:15:13.010 --> 03:15:13.020 align:start position:0%
previous bill
 
03:15:15.710 --> 03:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
it has to do with the penalty any public
 
03:15:17.150 --> 03:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
servant in the state of New Hampshire is
 
03:15:20.809 --> 03:15:20.819 align:start position:0%
defined in RSA 640 colon 2 that enforces
 
03:15:24.349 --> 03:15:24.359 align:start position:0%
or attempts to enforce or act law
 
03:15:26.330 --> 03:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
statute rule or regulation of the
 
03:15:28.309 --> 03:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
government of the United States upon a
 
03:15:32.530 --> 03:15:32.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:35.389 --> 03:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
they shall be guilty of a Class A
 
03:15:38.150 --> 03:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and then it goes on to say
 
03:15:40.370 --> 03:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
that the official agent that that does
 
03:15:42.490 --> 03:15:42.500 align:start position:0%
the same kind of thing try to to
 
03:15:46.969 --> 03:15:46.979 align:start position:0%
attempts to enforce act or order a law
 
03:15:48.830 --> 03:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
statute or rule regulation of the United
 
03:15:50.570 --> 03:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
States government of the United States
 
03:15:52.969 --> 03:15:52.979 align:start position:0%
personal firearm and security accessity
 
03:15:55.309 --> 03:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
manufacturing New Hampshire and the
 
03:15:58.130 --> 03:15:58.140 align:start position:0%
penalty is a class B felony so I think
 
03:15:59.809 --> 03:15:59.819 align:start position:0%
you may have law enforcement people
 
03:16:01.730 --> 03:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
going out to assist the government for
 
03:16:03.170 --> 03:16:03.180 align:start position:0%
other reasons and I think that the
 
03:16:04.610 --> 03:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
penalties are
 
03:16:08.030 --> 03:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:10.130 --> 03:16:10.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:16:11.870 --> 03:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
representative jandron and then the
 
03:16:13.730 --> 03:16:13.740 align:start position:0%
represent Muse
 
03:16:15.950 --> 03:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and again I got a
 
03:16:19.130 --> 03:16:19.140 align:start position:0%
hot mic so I'll move it to the side
 
03:16:21.230 --> 03:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
if you look at this sponsor and
 
03:16:22.670 --> 03:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor you'll see that I'm actually
 
03:16:24.650 --> 03:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this legislation and I
 
03:16:27.290 --> 03:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
like to explain why
 
03:16:27.300 --> 03:16:28.130 align:start position:0%
like to explain why
um

03:16:28.130 --> 03:16:28.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:31.010 --> 03:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
it's not a secret I worked at a camp
 
03:16:33.410 --> 03:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
where I taught Firearms instruction for
 
03:16:35.630 --> 03:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
two years two summers the two summers I
 
03:16:37.370 --> 03:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
wasn't in this house
 
03:16:39.230 --> 03:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that we noticed
 
03:16:41.269 --> 03:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
early on was
 
03:16:43.490 --> 03:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
um that our ear protection one was
 
03:16:47.630 --> 03:16:47.640 align:start position:0%
expensive two uh didn't sometimes get
 
03:16:50.690 --> 03:16:50.700 align:start position:0%
put into the air by 11 year old boys and
 
03:16:53.150 --> 03:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
girls that um
 
03:16:55.490 --> 03:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
even as an instructor we couldn't
 
03:16:57.650 --> 03:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
confirm that they installed it correctly
 
03:16:59.809 --> 03:16:59.819 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we had
 
03:17:03.230 --> 03:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
contemplated in 2021 was to go to a
 
03:17:05.450 --> 03:17:05.460 align:start position:0%
Farms manufacturer in the state of New
 
03:17:07.550 --> 03:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and ask them for suppressors
 
03:17:13.070 --> 03:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
to uh lessen the the report and the uh
 
03:17:16.490 --> 03:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
Sonic noise of a firearm shot for our
 
03:17:20.150 --> 03:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
students and we were informed that there
 
03:17:22.550 --> 03:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
were two ways to do that one was we
 
03:17:26.929 --> 03:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
would go to the ATF and ask
 
03:17:29.990 --> 03:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
ask for permission to purchase them
 
03:17:34.370 --> 03:17:34.380 align:start position:0%
and pay a tax at 200 per device or
 
03:17:38.150 --> 03:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
and pay that once or we would go and
 
03:17:40.510 --> 03:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
form an LLC
 
03:17:44.809 --> 03:17:44.819 align:start position:0%
a point responsible persons
 
03:17:47.450 --> 03:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
under the atf's regulations
 
03:17:49.790 --> 03:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
purchased the items that we needed for a
 
03:17:52.429 --> 03:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
suppression of of the gunfire to save
 
03:17:56.630 --> 03:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
years and pay 200 blanket every year
 
03:17:56.640 --> 03:17:58.190 align:start position:0%
years and pay 200 blanket every year
thereafter

03:17:58.190 --> 03:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
thereafter
 
03:18:01.190 --> 03:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh so we looked at a cost benefit
 
03:18:03.410 --> 03:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
analysis and realized that it was
 
03:18:05.809 --> 03:18:05.819 align:start position:0%
cheaper to buy earplugs and earplugs
 
03:18:08.809 --> 03:18:08.819 align:start position:0%
again are not 100 foolproof if the
 
03:18:10.550 --> 03:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
student is not placing it in their ear
 
03:18:10.560 --> 03:18:11.990 align:start position:0%
student is not placing it in their ear
correctly

03:18:11.990 --> 03:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
03:18:12.000 --> 03:18:14.030 align:start position:0%
correctly
so

03:18:14.030 --> 03:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:18:16.969 --> 03:18:16.979 align:start position:0%
we did approach a firing manufacturer in
 
03:18:18.290 --> 03:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire I won't
 
03:18:20.210 --> 03:18:20.220 align:start position:0%
discuss who it was but they are in
 
03:18:20.220 --> 03:18:21.950 align:start position:0%
discuss who it was but they are in
Newington

03:18:21.950 --> 03:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
Newington
 
03:18:24.410 --> 03:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
and they do produce suppressors
 
03:18:27.349 --> 03:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
and they were willing to donate them to
 
03:18:29.210 --> 03:18:29.220 align:start position:0%
the non-profit camp that I was working
 
03:18:29.220 --> 03:18:30.290 align:start position:0%
the non-profit camp that I was working
for

03:18:30.290 --> 03:18:30.300 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:18:30.300 --> 03:18:31.969 align:start position:0%
for
and

03:18:31.969 --> 03:18:31.979 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:18:34.670 --> 03:18:34.680 align:start position:0%
we decided that cost benefit analysis it
 
03:18:37.910 --> 03:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
was easier for us to purchase your
 
03:18:41.150 --> 03:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
protection your earplugs under the cost
 
03:18:44.510 --> 03:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis because 200 a year may
 
03:18:46.250 --> 03:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
not sound like a lot to everybody in the
 
03:18:49.070 --> 03:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
room but for a non-profit it can be
 
03:18:54.110 --> 03:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
so we admittedly are placing our
 
03:18:56.929 --> 03:18:56.939 align:start position:0%
students at a disadvantage and maybe a
 
03:18:59.809 --> 03:18:59.819 align:start position:0%
risk of not having their ear protection
 
03:19:01.610 --> 03:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
correctly installed
 
03:19:04.730 --> 03:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it says if it's
 
03:19:06.410 --> 03:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
made in New Hampshire
 
03:19:09.650 --> 03:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
sold in New Hampshire and never leaves
 
03:19:12.290 --> 03:19:12.300 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire it is not
 
03:19:14.210 --> 03:19:14.220 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce
 
03:19:17.630 --> 03:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
I would also argue that
 
03:19:20.570 --> 03:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
whether it be a non-profit camp that I
 
03:19:25.010 --> 03:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
work at or a gun shooting range like
 
03:19:27.590 --> 03:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
white birch or one of these other places
 
03:19:30.170 --> 03:19:30.180 align:start position:0%
that offer these for rent
 
03:19:33.349 --> 03:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
making them pay a federal
 
03:19:36.830 --> 03:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
tax on an item that never leaves the
 
03:19:38.929 --> 03:19:38.939 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire violates the
 
03:19:42.170 --> 03:19:42.180 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce clause and therefore
 
03:19:43.910 --> 03:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
is no longer under the jurisdiction of
 
03:19:46.190 --> 03:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
the United States of America so that's
 
03:19:48.650 --> 03:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
why I decided that I would support this
 
03:19:51.650 --> 03:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
bill and become a co-sponsor for it
 
03:19:53.510 --> 03:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
those are the reasons why I'm supporting
 
03:19:57.469 --> 03:19:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:31.910 --> 03:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:31.920 --> 03:20:46.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:20:46.910 --> 03:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:46.920 --> 03:21:21.910 align:start position:0%
 
experience

03:21:21.910 --> 03:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:50.330 --> 03:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:50.340 --> 03:22:22.070 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:22:22.070 --> 03:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:22.080 --> 03:23:01.809 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:23:01.809 --> 03:23:01.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:15.290 --> 03:23:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:15.300 --> 03:23:39.370 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:23:39.370 --> 03:23:39.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:12.050 --> 03:24:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:12.060 --> 03:24:38.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:24:38.870 --> 03:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:38.880 --> 03:26:25.250 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:26:25.250 --> 03:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:31.190 --> 03:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:32.870 --> 03:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
don't make me pick up this Hammer I
 
03:26:47.630 --> 03:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:47.640 --> 03:26:50.349 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:26:50.349 --> 03:26:50.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:52.490 --> 03:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
with the sponsor
 
03:26:54.830 --> 03:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
um I am going to recess this hearing
 
03:26:58.550 --> 03:26:58.560 align:start position:0%

the opportunity to
um

03:27:03.710 --> 03:27:03.720 align:start position:0%

03:27:34.790 --> 03:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative Reed stepping up to the
 
03:27:36.950 --> 03:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
plate and again to the members of the
 
03:27:38.630 --> 03:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
public who sent us those gazillion
 
03:27:41.809 --> 03:27:41.819 align:start position:0%
emails we did see them I read many of
 
03:27:58.750 --> 03:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
