out her name's Jessica and just if
 
00:07:59.870 --> 00:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
you're on it this time I'm putting you
 
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
in as along okay so this what I had here
 
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:13.350 align:start position:0%
is a roll call sheet which is what Paul
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
sent me so I'm not sure how to handle
 
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:20.610 align:start position:0%
this but I think you tell me Paul will
 
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:22.650 align:start position:0%
check in with you and Jennifer will
 
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:25.260 align:start position:0%
check in with you after the meeting what
 
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:28.470 align:start position:0%
to do with with the records so I guess
 
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:29.540 align:start position:0%
to do with with the records so I guess
well

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:29.550 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:32.030 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking the role
 
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:37.230 align:start position:0%
and thank you all very very much for
 
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:39.930 align:start position:0%
doing this it is not the way we want to
 
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:43.650 align:start position:0%
meet but it's better than not meeting
 
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:47.090 align:start position:0%
and not attending to our legislative
 
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
responsibilities the matter before the
 
00:08:58.570 --> 00:08:58.580 align:start position:0%
committee today is House bill 1642 and
 
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes the prime sponsor
 
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:08.730 align:start position:0%
representative hopper you're on mute
 
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
again Paul I mean Gary there you go yeah
 
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:14.610 align:start position:0%
it automatically mutes me and then so i
 
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
okay so anyway I'm unmuted we are the
 
00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:23.730 align:start position:0%
second committee on this bill and so the
 
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:27.180 align:start position:0%
house is already passed
 
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:30.330 align:start position:0%
sorry passed it so what the bill
 
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
basically does is make it illegal for
 
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:37.470 align:start position:0%
any state agency police station police
 
00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:40.470 align:start position:0%
state police local police from using
 
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
facial recognition software to track
 
00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:46.830 align:start position:0%
people and I think it's entirely
 
00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:49.400 align:start position:0%
consistent with our recent
 
00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:51.870 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment that passed by
 
00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
80% of the New Hampshire residents which
 
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:00.210 align:start position:0%
was a right to privacy oh yeah I'm
 
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:03.750 align:start position:0%
representing Hillsborough County - where
 
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:09.390 align:start position:0%
endearing I forgot at that so so
 
00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:10.770 align:start position:0%
basically to me
 
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:15.090 align:start position:0%
it's very very fundamental that people
 
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
have a right to be secure wherever
 
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
they're going that they're not being
 
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:23.370 align:start position:0%
observed by officials by police or
 
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:24.210 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:27.110 align:start position:0%
and or not anybody else by police
 
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:32.370 align:start position:0%
specifically by the state and so we're
 
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:37.050 align:start position:0%
playing catch-up in in 1928 there was a
 
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:38.460 align:start position:0%
case that went to the United States
 
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and if I could read my own
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
olmstead it was on sted case where I
 
00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:55.340 align:start position:0%
believe those police were using
 
00:10:58.820 --> 00:10:58.830 align:start position:0%
wiretapping to catch a criminal and that
 
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
went to the United States Supreme Court
 
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:03.330 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court said well you're not
 
00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:04.830 align:start position:0%
really violating the Fourth Amendment
 
00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:07.020 align:start position:0%
because there you weren't actually
 
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:08.730 align:start position:0%
intruding on their papers or in their
 
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:11.730 align:start position:0%
building or anything else so the Supreme
 
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
Court said that that was okay and I
 
00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:17.790 align:start position:0%
think any rational person today realizes
 
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
that tapping people's private
 
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:23.130 align:start position:0%
conversation is absolutely a violation
 
00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:26.029 align:start position:0%
of their fundamental right to be secure
 
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
maybe not specifically in their papers
 
00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:32.430 align:start position:0%
but still as it's a security issue so it
 
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
took about six years until the United
 
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:36.570 align:start position:0%
States Congress stepped up to the plate
 
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:39.560 align:start position:0%
and made that illegal wiretapping and
 
00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
wiretapping to me is a good example of
 
00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:46.070 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do here
 
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:49.710 align:start position:0%
obviously in wiretapping if police were
 
00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:52.950 align:start position:0%
able to tap all all the phones and all
 
00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:55.110 align:start position:0%
the cell phones anytime they felt like
 
00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:58.170 align:start position:0%
it I am quite positive the police could
 
00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:01.620 align:start position:0%
solve a lot more crime cases and I am
 
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:05.010 align:start position:0%
absolutely positive if they could use
 
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:07.910 align:start position:0%
facial recognition software along with
 
00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:10.710 align:start position:0%
cameras on every street corner they
 
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
could catch a lot more criminals but the
 
00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:16.290 align:start position:0%
the fundamental question to me in
 
00:12:20.329 --> 00:12:20.339 align:start position:0%
regards to this bill is how much Liberty
 
00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:22.290 align:start position:0%
are you willing to concede so the police
 
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
can catch more criminals and to me I
 
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a it's a fair trade-off
 
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
I don't think as I'm walking down the
 
00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
street the police should be able to
 
00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:36.030 align:start position:0%
collect that image of me and compare it
 
00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:37.740 align:start position:0%
electronically with something else and
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
no Gary Harper's walking down Elm Street
 
00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:43.230 align:start position:0%
Manchester at any given time I don't
 
00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
think it's any of their business where
 
00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:46.740 align:start position:0%
I'm walking in any given time unless I'm
 
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
in in the unless I'm committing a crime
 
00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:51.810 align:start position:0%
in which case they have other means by
 
00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:54.150 align:start position:0%
which to catch me for doing that so
 
00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
that's I'm not going to belabor this
 
00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:57.290 align:start position:0%
because it's too
 
00:13:00.639 --> 00:13:00.649 align:start position:0%
it's too tedious to do this on this way
 
00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:04.130 align:start position:0%
I really like talking you guys and at
 
00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:07.430 align:start position:0%
the meeting so that's basically it it
 
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
just if I think we can see where this
 
00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:17.180 align:start position:0%
issue would go if left unchecked all you
 
00:13:19.389 --> 00:13:19.399 align:start position:0%
have to do is look at places like China
 
00:13:21.309 --> 00:13:21.319 align:start position:0%
right now and they have facial
 
00:13:23.199 --> 00:13:23.209 align:start position:0%
recognition software they can actually
 
00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:25.730 align:start position:0%
recognize people even if they're wearing
 
00:13:27.579 --> 00:13:27.589 align:start position:0%
a mask
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
they keep constant tabs on all their
 
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:33.170 align:start position:0%
citizens they get millions and millions
 
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:36.290 align:start position:0%
of cameras all over China and you have
 
00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:41.740 align:start position:0%
no liberty at all in China and and I I
 
00:13:44.559 --> 00:13:44.569 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we never get there
 
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:46.610 align:start position:0%
and that's that's that's all I got
 
00:13:50.189 --> 00:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
Thanks thank you very much
 
00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:52.790 align:start position:0%
representative will you be willing to
 
00:13:55.449 --> 00:13:55.459 align:start position:0%
answer any questions from your fellow
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
committee members yes
 
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now yes if I can just
 
00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
butt in I apologized just so you know
 
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:18.380 align:start position:0%
we've got to take time to unmute you so
 
00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:20.910 align:start position:0%
just kind of look at that little red
 
00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:23.370 align:start position:0%
symbol or icon and you'll see when
 
00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:25.290 align:start position:0%
you're ready to go okay so you'll do
 
00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
that okay represent a 'king my question
 
00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
represented hopper um it was interesting
 
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
that you brought up China because
 
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:35.700 align:start position:0%
there's a case that just came out in the
 
00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:38.300 align:start position:0%
news today where there was a kidnapping
 
00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:42.270 align:start position:0%
in China 32 years ago and they use
 
00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
facial recognition technology to
 
00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:48.030 align:start position:0%
identify the person who's now 32 years
 
00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:51.450 align:start position:0%
old and to help solve the crime so if
 
00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:54.150 align:start position:0%
this was implemented in the United
 
00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:57.150 align:start position:0%
States would would that prohibit us from
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
being able to accomplish the same kind
 
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:03.270 align:start position:0%
of thing and would it mean that that
 
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
Jennifer could you are you represented
 
00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:15.150 align:start position:0%
Harper please yes yes that would go
 
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
unsolved the that's why I'm saying it's
 
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:21.900 align:start position:0%
a trade off if we allowed the police to
 
00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:24.180 align:start position:0%
wiretap for the last 80 years or
 
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:27.660 align:start position:0%
whatever 100 years there's a lot of
 
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
crimes that they could have solved had
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
they been allowed to just tap every
 
00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:35.790 align:start position:0%
conversation we've ever had so yes
 
00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:41.300 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a lot of crimes that
 
00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:44.460 align:start position:0%
would have been able to be prevented or
 
00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:46.950 align:start position:0%
solved with facial recognition software
 
00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:49.890 align:start position:0%
it's just a fundamental question of
 
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
whether you're willing to concede that
 
00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
much Liberty for that much security it's
 
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
a trade off and I think the people of
 
00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:01.230 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire a few years ago clearly
 
00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:04.350 align:start position:0%
said 80% of them that they believe they
 
00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:07.470 align:start position:0%
have a right to privacy so I think yes
 
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
that you could have solved that crime
 
00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:12.020 align:start position:0%
but I don't believe the trade-off is is
 
00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
fair if I can interrupt for just one
 
00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.460 align:start position:0%
fair if I can interrupt for just one
moment

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:18.470 align:start position:0%
moment
 
00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:21.300 align:start position:0%
representative Kenny has
 
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:26.490 align:start position:0%
arrived and the clerk should I guess
 
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
technically call on him to report that
 
00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:35.579 align:start position:0%
he's here so I've Kurt if can it well /
 
00:16:40.929 --> 00:16:40.939 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:43.009 --> 00:16:43.019 align:start position:0%
representative Kenny could you report
 
00:16:45.819 --> 00:16:45.829 align:start position:0%
where you are and whether you're alone
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
yes hello everyone I apologize for being
 
00:16:52.249 --> 00:16:52.259 align:start position:0%
tardy I'm in my apartment in Durham um
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
and I am alone thank you thank you very
 
00:16:59.119 --> 00:16:59.129 align:start position:0%
much now
 
00:17:02.499 --> 00:17:02.509 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander has a question
 
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:08.220 align:start position:0%
for representative Harper good thank you
 
00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you represent
 
00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:12.620 align:start position:0%
hopper for taking my questions so I have
 
00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:15.419 align:start position:0%
really two if that's okay
 
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
when reading the text of the bill it
 
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
says it's only a state or like
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
government entity is that correct yeah
 
00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
okay and if I can follow up like why was
 
00:17:31.039 --> 00:17:31.049 align:start position:0%
there any consideration to like Dan even
 
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:33.770 align:start position:0%
private entities from using the software
 
00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:37.230 align:start position:0%
I think I I didn't consider it because
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's a private company and I don't
 
00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:42.110 align:start position:0%
think the state has any right to
 
00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:44.370 align:start position:0%
interfere with them I mean if Walmart
 
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
wants to use facial recognition software
 
00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
so that when you walk in there they can
 
00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:51.510 align:start position:0%
send you a text that their fishing
 
00:17:54.889 --> 00:17:54.899 align:start position:0%
equipment is on sale that's that's kind
 
00:17:57.769 --> 00:17:57.779 align:start position:0%
of intrusive but it's up to them okay
 
00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:04.850 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:07.030 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question so
 
00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
I understand what you're saying when you
 
00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:15.290 align:start position:0%
know there are trade-offs and I don't
 
00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:19.190 align:start position:0%
know that have had the trade-offs then
 
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:24.940 align:start position:0%
put so specifically everyone would agree
 
00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
nor I do I think that 80% of the people
 
00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:31.790 align:start position:0%
who voted for the constitutional
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
amendment would necessarily consider
 
00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:40.100 align:start position:0%
this to be a logical next step there has
 
00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:42.680 align:start position:0%
been just I know that representative
 
00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:45.470 align:start position:0%
burrows talked about a case in China and
 
00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:47.930 align:start position:0%
I'm very interested in that but I would
 
00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:51.890 align:start position:0%
like to bring up a case in the United
 
00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
States and just last August in New York
 
00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:58.130 align:start position:0%
police were able to use facial
 
00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:01.070 align:start position:0%
recognition to track down an accused
 
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
rapist and apprehend him within 24 hours
 
00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:08.870 align:start position:0%
of an attack that he perpetrated at
 
00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:13.100 align:start position:0%
knifepoint and so if for instance that
 
00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:16.180 align:start position:0%
same perpetrator were to cross borders
 
00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
in trying to evade law enforcement and
 
00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:24.050 align:start position:0%
were to say come to New Hampshire then I
 
00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:25.730 align:start position:0%
think what you're I think what this bill
 
00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:28.190 align:start position:0%
would be saying is that we would not be
 
00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:31.370 align:start position:0%
able to use those tools to apprehend
 
00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:36.380 align:start position:0%
this person and I'm concerned that there
 
00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:37.660 align:start position:0%
are already
 
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
facial-recognition being used for
 
00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:45.650 align:start position:0%
instance in social media that law
 
00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:48.170 align:start position:0%
enforcement uses right now and I'll give
 
00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:50.330 align:start position:0%
you a specific example is that when
 
00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:54.260 align:start position:0%
children are being abused sexually and
 
00:19:58.690 --> 00:19:58.700 align:start position:0%
physically as part of you know
 
00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
for-profit and that is something that
 
00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:04.190 align:start position:0%
happens with regularity documented on
 
00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:07.550 align:start position:0%
for instance pornhub which has offered
 
00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
all kinds of free incentives here in the
 
00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:14.740 align:start position:0%
in the states during this kovat 19
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
quarantine time
 
00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:22.910 align:start position:0%
they actually broadcast video where you
 
00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:27.140 align:start position:0%
can ask for someone to abuse a child in
 
00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
front of the camera and the National
 
00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:32.390 align:start position:0%
centers for Missing and Exploited
 
00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:36.170 align:start position:0%
Children and our New Hampshire I catch
 
00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:40.370 align:start position:0%
are able to use clues from those videos
 
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:43.930 align:start position:0%
and hopefully facial recognition if
 
00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:46.700 align:start position:0%
screenshots are posted on social media
 
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:48.590 align:start position:0%
and it would be it's hard to imagine
 
00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:51.820 align:start position:0%
that someone would do that but they do
 
00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:55.580 align:start position:0%
to identify the children the location
 
00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:57.950 align:start position:0%
and who the perpetrators are and I I
 
00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
don't I would absolutely not support
 
00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:06.790 align:start position:0%
that being a trade-off for hampering
 
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:08.420 align:start position:0%
investigations with a really really
 
00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:11.930 align:start position:0%
important tool and on page two of the
 
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:17.240 align:start position:0%
bill in line lines one through three I'm
 
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:19.210 align:start position:0%
really really uncomfortable with
 
00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:21.170 align:start position:0%
particularly line two data or
 
00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:23.060 align:start position:0%
information in violation of this
 
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:24.680 align:start position:0%
subdivision shall be considered
 
00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:27.250 align:start position:0%
unlawfully obtained and shall be
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
irretrievably deleted from any document
 
00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:33.230 align:start position:0%
in possession of the state or any court
 
00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
file or filing upon discovery I know
 
00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:40.330 align:start position:0%
that as an advocate for victims of crime
 
00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:43.700 align:start position:0%
to find out that the state would be in
 
00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:47.950 align:start position:0%
the position of having to destroy
 
00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:51.110 align:start position:0%
potential leads and evidence against a
 
00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:54.500 align:start position:0%
perpetrator would be a crushing crushing
 
00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:01.190 align:start position:0%
blow and I think that while I understand
 
00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:02.660 align:start position:0%
some of the motivations for this
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
legislation the way that this is written
 
00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
out instead throws every opportunity to
 
00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:13.190 align:start position:0%
use this tool appropriately with just
 
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:18.010 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:19.790 align:start position:0%
representative Harper do you want to
 
00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:23.540 align:start position:0%
reply yes I do
 
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:30.650 align:start position:0%
so I I understand that I if years ago
 
00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:42.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:47.210 align:start position:0%
so sorry about the interruption so years
 
00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:49.340 align:start position:0%
ago when I first became was in the
 
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:51.400 align:start position:0%
legislature I passed bills to help
 
00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:55.550 align:start position:0%
victim of victims of sexual abuse having
 
00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:57.860 align:start position:0%
things happen in my own family I'm
 
00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:03.470 align:start position:0%
acutely aware of the problem but you
 
00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:05.660 align:start position:0%
could get using your same argument you
 
00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:08.930 align:start position:0%
could go one step further I believe it
 
00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:12.230 align:start position:0%
was Bill Gates was on a TED talk spoke
 
00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:17.090 align:start position:0%
of electronically chipping people and in
 
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
doing so you'd be able to you know keep
 
00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:21.800 align:start position:0%
track of where they were all the time
 
00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:24.140 align:start position:0%
you would be able to find you would know
 
00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:27.560 align:start position:0%
if somebody had had a had Cove in
 
00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:29.150 align:start position:0%
nineteen and whether or not they could
 
00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:31.100 align:start position:0%
freely go to another country because
 
00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:36.980 align:start position:0%
they had shots for it and then if
 
00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:38.330 align:start position:0%
everybody was chipped you would
 
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:40.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely know where everybody was at
 
00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:42.910 align:start position:0%
all times and if a child was abducted
 
00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:45.950 align:start position:0%
you could actually track who they were
 
00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
with just before the abduction and where
 
00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:51.710 align:start position:0%
they were once they were abducted so
 
00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
there are tools to make sure that bad
 
00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:55.580 align:start position:0%
things never happen again
 
00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:02.360 align:start position:0%
and facial recognition software is one
 
00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:05.860 align:start position:0%
of those tools to keep everybody safe
 
00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:09.530 align:start position:0%
but my my threshold the way I look at
 
00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:13.940 align:start position:0%
things is I try because we were our as
 
00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:16.250 align:start position:0%
legislators most of us are old enough to
 
00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:18.470 align:start position:0%
see the winds of politics switch back
 
00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:22.430 align:start position:0%
and forth Gerry rapidly and people get
 
00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:24.260 align:start position:0%
elected that we're just surprised even
 
00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:27.860 align:start position:0%
got elected yet almost instantaneously
 
00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
the people are very fickle and will just
 
00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:32.780 align:start position:0%
kick the bums out and hire and hire new
 
00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:36.020 align:start position:0%
people at a at a moment's notice and in
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
doing so the possibility of getting
 
00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:40.430 align:start position:0%
somebody in office
 
00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:43.820 align:start position:0%
it wants to abuse these tools that we
 
00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
now are
 
00:24:47.649 --> 00:24:47.659 align:start position:0%
would be using for good against us is
 
00:24:53.169 --> 00:24:53.179 align:start position:0%
very very possible and so on on tools
 
00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:55.490 align:start position:0%
that the government has access to I
 
00:25:00.129 --> 00:25:00.139 align:start position:0%
always think of you know wwhd what would
 
00:25:02.169 --> 00:25:02.179 align:start position:0%
Hitler do what would Hitler do with
 
00:25:05.019 --> 00:25:05.029 align:start position:0%
those tools if he were elected as
 
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
remember he was elected in in Germany
 
00:25:11.139 --> 00:25:11.149 align:start position:0%
and German people were not stupid people
 
00:25:15.399 --> 00:25:15.409 align:start position:0%
they are very bright people and so when
 
00:25:17.889 --> 00:25:17.899 align:start position:0%
we allow police to access all these
 
00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
tools facial recognition software video
 
00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:24.200 align:start position:0%
cameras everywhere microchips yes it
 
00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:27.230 align:start position:0%
would keep us safer but how much Liberty
 
00:25:29.139 --> 00:25:29.149 align:start position:0%
are you willing to concede for that and
 
00:25:32.909 --> 00:25:32.919 align:start position:0%
to me we it's better to stop it before
 
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
it gets to a point where it's abused and
 
00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:39.830 align:start position:0%
then then wait until afterwards because
 
00:25:43.169 --> 00:25:43.179 align:start position:0%
then it's too late the chair recognizes
 
00:25:45.879 --> 00:25:45.889 align:start position:0%
representative Woodberry to be followed
 
00:25:47.769 --> 00:25:47.779 align:start position:0%
by representative MacLean and then
 
00:25:49.869 --> 00:25:49.879 align:start position:0%
representative birch representative
 
00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:56.860 align:start position:0%
Woodbury thank you thank you madam chair
 
00:25:59.950 --> 00:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
Thank You representative Harper for
 
00:26:05.999 --> 00:26:06.009 align:start position:0%
taking my question I am is still unmuted
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yes okay you you you
 
00:26:14.049 --> 00:26:14.059 align:start position:0%
explain to us that this bill is
 
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
necessary because it's very much like a
 
00:26:20.139 --> 00:26:20.149 align:start position:0%
bill which should have taken place 100
 
00:26:22.889 --> 00:26:22.899 align:start position:0%
years ago to prevent wiretapping I
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
wonder placing placing this bill in the
 
00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:30.710 align:start position:0%
wiretapping context wouldn't it be more
 
00:26:33.999 --> 00:26:34.009 align:start position:0%
accurate to say that instead of
 
00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
preventing surveillance what it actually
 
00:26:43.659 --> 00:26:43.669 align:start position:0%
does is to prevent a tool useful to make
 
00:26:46.119 --> 00:26:46.129 align:start position:0%
surveillance sensible and wouldn't that
 
00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
be the essential equivalent of saying in
 
00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:52.730 align:start position:0%
the wiretap situation not that you
 
00:26:55.419 --> 00:26:55.429 align:start position:0%
couldn't wiretap but that you couldn't
 
00:26:58.390 --> 00:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
use voice recognition software to
 
00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:01.610 align:start position:0%
establish whose voice it was so that
 
00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:04.550 align:start position:0%
instead of preventing instead of
 
00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:07.430 align:start position:0%
preventing the evil of unregulated
 
00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:11.150 align:start position:0%
surveillance this bill simply limits the
 
00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:16.540 align:start position:0%
ability to make a sensible use of that I
 
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:19.010 align:start position:0%
guess I've said enough I hope you're
 
00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:24.410 align:start position:0%
gonna respond representative hopper yeah
 
00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:27.980 align:start position:0%
I kind of get the analogy but to me I
 
00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:32.900 align:start position:0%
think be using that same analogy the
 
00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:35.330 align:start position:0%
police can still wiretap but they have
 
00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:40.100 align:start position:0%
to get a warrant to do so and but facial
 
00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
recognition software my understanding is
 
00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:47.210 align:start position:0%
it's it's kind of like the same analogy
 
00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:50.420 align:start position:0%
would mean that they could wiretap
 
00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:54.260 align:start position:0%
everybody and then only use that part of
 
00:27:58.210 --> 00:27:58.220 align:start position:0%
a criminal that was talking on a phone
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
in a court case
 
00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:02.660 align:start position:0%
so because the facial recognition kind
 
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:05.210 align:start position:0%
of is too broad a spectrum so it can it
 
00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
just identifies everybody as they're
 
00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:09.710 align:start position:0%
walking down the street so I think
 
00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:11.540 align:start position:0%
that's the difference a wiretap is that
 
00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:14.540 align:start position:0%
specific is targeted and that's why you
 
00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:20.770 align:start position:0%
can get a get a warrant for a wiretap on
 
00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:24.410 align:start position:0%
Gary Harper's phone because it's
 
00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:27.380 align:start position:0%
specific and it's a specific crime but I
 
00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:28.670 align:start position:0%
don't think they shall recognition
 
00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
software works like that and I could be
 
00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:34.910 align:start position:0%
totally wrong but I don't believe so so
 
00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:36.950 align:start position:0%
I think it's I think the analogy falls
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
short Thank You representative mcclain
 
00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:44.810 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair can you hear me
 
00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:46.310 align:start position:0%
okay absolutely
 
00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:48.950 align:start position:0%
all right great representative Haas for
 
00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:50.870 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my questions so I
 
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
just kind of I'm going to try to get it
 
00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
all in because of the muting and the
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
unmuting so I'll do the best job that I
 
00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
can but to kind of follow up on a
 
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander's tread
 
00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:05.570 align:start position:0%
we did get some testimony from the New
 
00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:07.430 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of Chiefs of
 
00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
Police and I think the bill addresses
 
00:29:12.159 --> 00:29:12.169 align:start position:0%
the bulk of the concerns
 
00:29:14.049 --> 00:29:14.059 align:start position:0%
put forth by the Bedford police chief
 
00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:18.710 align:start position:0%
but item three in his submitted
 
00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:21.830 align:start position:0%
testimony was that the bill as written
 
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
would not allow law enforcement to use a
 
00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:28.580 align:start position:0%
store camera to identify the subject and
 
00:29:30.399 --> 00:29:30.409 align:start position:0%
you were you are talking about you know
 
00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:33.980 align:start position:0%
that a Walmart camera would be okay so
 
00:29:37.149 --> 00:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
but this bill as it's written I think
 
00:29:39.609 --> 00:29:39.619 align:start position:0%
that while Walmart would be able to take
 
00:29:42.129 --> 00:29:42.139 align:start position:0%
or the the store would be able to tape
 
00:29:45.399 --> 00:29:45.409 align:start position:0%
or I can even have a camera like one of
 
00:29:48.519 --> 00:29:48.529 align:start position:0%
those ring cameras on my door the police
 
00:29:51.879 --> 00:29:51.889 align:start position:0%
would not be able to make use of it and
 
00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:55.190 align:start position:0%
so I think you know as I look at the
 
00:29:59.649 --> 00:29:59.659 align:start position:0%
actual bill itself line 16 it says that
 
00:30:02.169 --> 00:30:02.179 align:start position:0%
they cannot use any facial recognition
 
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
system so I think as written it doesn't
 
00:30:08.409 --> 00:30:08.419 align:start position:0%
allow you to use even the private stuff
 
00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:10.850 align:start position:0%
so I guess my question would be would
 
00:30:15.009 --> 00:30:15.019 align:start position:0%
you be open to modifying maybe line 16
 
00:30:17.799 --> 00:30:17.809 align:start position:0%
on the bill to say any government
 
00:30:19.599 --> 00:30:19.609 align:start position:0%
operated facial recognition system
 
00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:21.950 align:start position:0%
because if somebody broke into my house
 
00:30:24.519 --> 00:30:24.529 align:start position:0%
I would certainly want to be able to
 
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
give the police the data from my ring
 
00:30:29.349 --> 00:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
camera or something to help them find
 
00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:31.820 align:start position:0%
out who broke into my house so I guess
 
00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:33.320 align:start position:0%
that was my question that just would
 
00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:35.830 align:start position:0%
welcome your thoughts on that
 
00:30:39.729 --> 00:30:39.739 align:start position:0%
representative Harper yeah I believe I
 
00:30:42.099 --> 00:30:42.109 align:start position:0%
understand the concept
 
00:30:44.979 --> 00:30:44.989 align:start position:0%
I believe the previous committee fixed
 
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:47.210 align:start position:0%
that but I'll let them speak to that
 
00:30:48.999 --> 00:30:49.009 align:start position:0%
because I believe the my understanding
 
00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:51.980 align:start position:0%
is the facial recognition software
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
is a technological ability to look at
 
00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:00.799 align:start position:0%
that picture and digitally identify the
 
00:31:03.879 --> 00:31:03.889 align:start position:0%
person and compared to other photographs
 
00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:06.710 align:start position:0%
whereas what you're talking about is I
 
00:31:09.999 --> 00:31:10.009 align:start position:0%
get videotape chocolate lifting again in
 
00:31:15.879 --> 00:31:15.889 align:start position:0%
me and Walmart and they use just my
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
picture which somebody says oh yeah
 
00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:22.220 align:start position:0%
that's Gary Harper that's okay but using
 
00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:25.940 align:start position:0%
it digitally to identify me
 
00:31:27.759 --> 00:31:27.769 align:start position:0%
compared to say for instance my driver's
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
license that would be illegal under this
 
00:31:33.749 --> 00:31:33.759 align:start position:0%
so I don't I don't think it prohibits I
 
00:31:38.769 --> 00:31:38.779 align:start position:0%
think that is is is unfounded but I will
 
00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:43.100 align:start position:0%
let represent and the Schmidt talk about
 
00:31:45.519 --> 00:31:45.529 align:start position:0%
that when he gets on is he I think the
 
00:31:47.519 --> 00:31:47.529 align:start position:0%
previous committee dealt with that
 
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
Thank You representative birch thank you
 
00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair Thank You representative I
 
00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:55.460 align:start position:0%
want to go back to the concerns raised
 
00:31:58.629 --> 00:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
by representative all Schiller because I
 
00:32:03.159 --> 00:32:03.169 align:start position:0%
share those concerns I've been involved
 
00:32:08.399 --> 00:32:08.409 align:start position:0%
in my past life with both training and
 
00:32:12.159 --> 00:32:12.169 align:start position:0%
actual legal work representing
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
individuals charged with child
 
00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:18.700 align:start position:0%
pornography and similar offenses and
 
00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:22.750 align:start position:0%
what I know in general is when a
 
00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:26.740 align:start position:0%
computer is seized from a suspect and
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
there are images on that computer let's
 
00:32:34.509 --> 00:32:34.519 align:start position:0%
say it's a it's a naked person and a
 
00:32:39.639 --> 00:32:39.649 align:start position:0%
suggestive pose there is a big
 
00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:42.679 align:start position:0%
difference in terms of consequences
 
00:32:46.539 --> 00:32:46.549 align:start position:0%
whether that individual is let's say 20
 
00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:48.710 align:start position:0%
years old or that individual is 14 years
 
00:32:52.659 --> 00:32:52.669 align:start position:0%
old and one of the ways that crucial
 
00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:56.330 align:start position:0%
question is answered is the effort to
 
00:32:59.529 --> 00:32:59.539 align:start position:0%
determine who is that person in that
 
00:33:05.799 --> 00:33:05.809 align:start position:0%
image and the way that is done is to run
 
00:33:10.649 --> 00:33:10.659 align:start position:0%
that image through databases of known
 
00:33:15.159 --> 00:33:15.169 align:start position:0%
Exploited Children and when a match is
 
00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:19.940 align:start position:0%
reached and you know the age and
 
00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
identity of that person then you can
 
00:33:29.799 --> 00:33:29.809 align:start position:0%
easily determine the age of the the
 
00:33:34.149 --> 00:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
person involved so that is crucial to
 
00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:39.350 align:start position:0%
the apprehension of child predators in
 
00:33:41.799 --> 00:33:41.809 align:start position:0%
fact Interpol's child sexual
 
00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:45.770 align:start position:0%
exploitation database which again would
 
00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:49.460 align:start position:0%
be unavailable
 
00:33:52.919 --> 00:33:52.929 align:start position:0%
for use it would be in the band category
 
00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:56.360 align:start position:0%
has more than 1.5 million images of
 
00:33:58.450 --> 00:33:58.460 align:start position:0%
Exploited Children and has helped
 
00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
identify over 19,000 IDEX ployed
 
00:34:05.769 --> 00:34:05.779 align:start position:0%
children this bill would simply make
 
00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:08.149 align:start position:0%
that impossible and I'm wondering if
 
00:34:11.609 --> 00:34:11.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:16.329 --> 00:34:16.339 align:start position:0%
representative hopper yeah Thank You
 
00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:19.490 align:start position:0%
representative birch I don't think that
 
00:34:21.970 --> 00:34:21.980 align:start position:0%
was necessarily specifically taken into
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
consideration but I think my my previous
 
00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
answer still sit stands as to yes you
 
00:34:33.419 --> 00:34:33.429 align:start position:0%
there are many crimes you could solve by
 
00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:36.020 align:start position:0%
constant monitoring monitoring of
 
00:34:38.349 --> 00:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
everybody but how much Liberty are you
 
00:34:40.899 --> 00:34:40.909 align:start position:0%
willing to concede to get there and to
 
00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:43.220 align:start position:0%
me this is facial recognition software
 
00:34:45.490 --> 00:34:45.500 align:start position:0%
there's I was just reading it in another
 
00:34:50.619 --> 00:34:50.629 align:start position:0%
report this morning out of MIT and they
 
00:34:56.139 --> 00:34:56.149 align:start position:0%
referred to a Italian criminologist I
 
00:34:59.260 --> 00:34:59.270 align:start position:0%
believe who has determined that through
 
00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
facial recognition software he's pretty
 
00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:04.730 align:start position:0%
confident he can determine who is going
 
00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:09.820 align:start position:0%
to be a criminal because in his words
 
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
criminals have eight like features so I
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
don't know I just it did the technology
 
00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:23.810 align:start position:0%
itself is is frightening to me and it's
 
00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:26.930 align:start position:0%
it's it scares me for my children and
 
00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
grandchildren as to how much Liberty
 
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
they're gonna lose just for that that
 
00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:36.830 align:start position:0%
those cases where we can all see why
 
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:39.250 align:start position:0%
this this technology would be helpful
 
00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:43.580 align:start position:0%
but I think long term it is a is a
 
00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:46.190 align:start position:0%
threat to people's Liberty so I still I
 
00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:49.190 align:start position:0%
mean I'm willing to accept amendments to
 
00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:51.460 align:start position:0%
it or whatever to get it passed but I
 
00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:54.290 align:start position:0%
but it's not I don't I don't think
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
there's anything wrong with the bill
 
00:35:59.079 --> 00:35:59.089 align:start position:0%
itself anyway Thanks thank you are you
 
00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:00.550 align:start position:0%
still willing to take more questions
 
00:36:03.099 --> 00:36:03.109 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
00:36:12.839 --> 00:36:12.849 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:15.849 --> 00:36:15.859 align:start position:0%
okay now I'm unmuted sorry about that
 
00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:18.170 align:start position:0%
yes I did I remember a conversation I
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
had when would the bill was about to
 
00:36:23.319 --> 00:36:23.329 align:start position:0%
come to the house with the Manchester
 
00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:25.640 align:start position:0%
Police Chief and I guess what he said is
 
00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:27.319 align:start position:0%
the same as what the Bedford Police
 
00:36:30.339 --> 00:36:30.349 align:start position:0%
Chief said pretty much but he he he
 
00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:31.670 align:start position:0%
pointed out that like you know there's
 
00:36:33.519 --> 00:36:33.529 align:start position:0%
cameras all over the place almost all of
 
00:36:35.289 --> 00:36:35.299 align:start position:0%
which have can be used for facial
 
00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:37.700 align:start position:0%
recognition now all kinds of you
 
00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:39.230 align:start position:0%
mentioned Walmart for example with all
 
00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
kinds of other businesses and private
 
00:36:42.819 --> 00:36:42.829 align:start position:0%
individuals and they do use that video
 
00:36:45.339 --> 00:36:45.349 align:start position:0%
all the time to crime and he said if we
 
00:36:48.039 --> 00:36:48.049 align:start position:0%
pass this bill as is and everybody would
 
00:36:49.779 --> 00:36:49.789 align:start position:0%
be able to use this technology except
 
00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:52.730 align:start position:0%
the police force so he found that
 
00:36:55.269 --> 00:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
objectionable of course and I that is
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
that your question representative
 
00:36:59.410 --> 00:36:59.420 align:start position:0%
Corrigan yes I guess wherever comment of
 
00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
the would you believe so and so that was
 
00:37:06.609 --> 00:37:06.619 align:start position:0%
a someone say I've heard that from other
 
00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:08.930 align:start position:0%
police officers other than one from
 
00:37:12.609 --> 00:37:12.619 align:start position:0%
Bedford emailed us Thank You Jenny
 
00:37:15.849 --> 00:37:15.859 align:start position:0%
popper yeah yeah I heard that same thing
 
00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:17.990 align:start position:0%
too and I think if you folks remember
 
00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
earlier this year we had a Manchester
 
00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:23.740 align:start position:0%
policeman say basically saying that
 
00:37:26.079 --> 00:37:26.089 align:start position:0%
we're talking about surveilled video
 
00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:27.410 align:start position:0%
surveillance of the streets in
 
00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester and he conceded that you know
 
00:37:33.849 --> 00:37:33.859 align:start position:0%
if he had his way and had the money he
 
00:37:37.539 --> 00:37:37.549 align:start position:0%
has cameras everywhere and yes we could
 
00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:39.140 align:start position:0%
have surveillance cameras everywhere and
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
and we could have facial recognition
 
00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:45.020 align:start position:0%
software so that everybody coming in or
 
00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:47.270 align:start position:0%
out of a church or a synagogue could be
 
00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:49.460 align:start position:0%
recorded and police would know exactly
 
00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:52.220 align:start position:0%
who was going in or out and if they
 
00:37:55.089 --> 00:37:55.099 align:start position:0%
exceeded the ten person limit and that
 
00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:56.990 align:start position:0%
would that would be very effective law
 
00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement but to is to represent an
 
00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:05.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:11.130 align:start position:0%
yes Walmart can have this technology yes
 
00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:13.710 align:start position:0%
Sears good I guess we don't have scares
 
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
anywhere but the mall can have this
 
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:20.010 align:start position:0%
technology but the fact of the matter is
 
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
Walmart and Sears can't arrest me
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
Walmart and Sears can't investigate me
 
00:38:32.599 --> 00:38:32.609 align:start position:0%
for crime or possibly arrest me or sir
 
00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:36.450 align:start position:0%
you know be motivated to keep track of
 
00:38:38.329 --> 00:38:38.339 align:start position:0%
my whereabouts and things like that
 
00:38:43.609 --> 00:38:43.619 align:start position:0%
those those private entities can use
 
00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:45.750 align:start position:0%
this software whatever they they want
 
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
it's whether or not we want the state
 
00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:50.490 align:start position:0%
which has so much resources and so much
 
00:38:54.079 --> 00:38:54.089 align:start position:0%
power to have that additional power to
 
00:38:57.819 --> 00:38:57.829 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative Gordon wait wait
 
00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:08.970 align:start position:0%
representative Gordon you haven't been
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
unmuted yet wait trying I'm not sure
 
00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:22.490 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:28.010 align:start position:0%
can you unmute unmute on your own screen
 
00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:33.380 align:start position:0%
there we go good representative Gordon
 
00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:36.150 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:37.650 align:start position:0%
representative Potter for taking the
 
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
questions I I think I had maybe have two
 
00:39:43.309 --> 00:39:43.319 align:start position:0%
questions in the comments the first
 
00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:47.790 align:start position:0%
question I have goes to the issue I
 
00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
think that's been raised by other
 
00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
committee members and that is that it
 
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
seems to me and I think you've
 
00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:54.780 align:start position:0%
acknowledged the fact that facial
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
recognition could serve a valuable prize
 
00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:05.270 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:08.660 align:start position:0%
to be committed in certain circumstances
 
00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:23.150 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.849 --> 00:40:25.859 align:start position:0%
and people's homes can be searched for
 
00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:29.270 align:start position:0%
example but there are exceptions and
 
00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:31.980 align:start position:0%
specifically exceptions made so that the
 
00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:36.210 align:start position:0%
police can get a warrant and if they do
 
00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:41.730 align:start position:0%
later to go to a court could be
 
00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:48.810 align:start position:0%
committed they could to undertake
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
activities with privacy and I guess the
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
question did you consider it putting
 
00:40:59.210 --> 00:40:59.220 align:start position:0%
this bill together that law enforcement
 
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
will be able to get warrants in order to
 
00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:17.490 align:start position:0%
use that's a good point I don't know how
 
00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:23.780 align:start position:0%
you how you I would be certainly a
 
00:41:28.579 --> 00:41:28.589 align:start position:0%
amendable to an amendment did that allow
 
00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
that but I'm not sure how technically
 
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:33.210 align:start position:0%
you get there so I don't know enough
 
00:41:34.279 --> 00:41:34.289 align:start position:0%
about it to know
 
00:41:37.729 --> 00:41:37.739 align:start position:0%
that that's doable but if it is that
 
00:41:42.609 --> 00:41:42.619 align:start position:0%
seems totally reasonable and it might
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
help with representative all shall it
 
00:41:49.969 --> 00:41:49.979 align:start position:0%
serve and representative birches issues
 
00:41:52.249 --> 00:41:52.259 align:start position:0%
with the bill too but I don't know how
 
00:41:54.159 --> 00:41:54.169 align:start position:0%
you get there
 
00:42:03.739 --> 00:42:03.749 align:start position:0%
Thank You representative dilorenzo Inc
 
00:42:05.299 --> 00:42:05.309 align:start position:0%
if it take my question representative
 
00:42:05.309 --> 00:42:06.469 align:start position:0%
if it take my question representative
Harper

00:42:06.469 --> 00:42:06.479 align:start position:0%
Harper
 
00:42:09.319 --> 00:42:09.329 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any New Hampshire state
 
00:42:13.039 --> 00:42:13.049 align:start position:0%
agencies for departments law enforcement
 
00:42:15.679 --> 00:42:15.689 align:start position:0%
or otherwise who currently use a
 
00:42:22.549 --> 00:42:22.559 align:start position:0%
spectrum recognition technology no I'm
 
00:42:22.559 --> 00:42:28.419 align:start position:0%
spectrum recognition technology no I'm
not

00:42:28.419 --> 00:42:28.429 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:36.410 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin Thank You
 
00:42:40.699 --> 00:42:40.709 align:start position:0%
representative Harper section 2 of the
 
00:42:45.249 --> 00:42:45.259 align:start position:0%
bill makes a change to motor vehicle
 
00:42:50.779 --> 00:42:50.789 align:start position:0%
statutes line 22 page 2 provides that
 
00:42:53.599 --> 00:42:53.609 align:start position:0%
there's a modification to a section of
 
00:42:59.929 --> 00:42:59.939 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses and it deletes the
 
00:43:04.189 --> 00:43:04.199 align:start position:0%
words for purposes of this chapter in
 
00:43:07.759 --> 00:43:07.769 align:start position:0%
that particular provision there is a
 
00:43:10.429 --> 00:43:10.439 align:start position:0%
specific reference to the department
 
00:43:12.019 --> 00:43:12.029 align:start position:0%
being prohibited from using facial
 
00:43:14.149 --> 00:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
recognition technology in connection
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
with taking or retaining any photograph
 
00:43:19.279 --> 00:43:19.289 align:start position:0%
or digital image I would like to know
 
00:43:22.219 --> 00:43:22.229 align:start position:0%
what the purpose of deleting that is and
 
00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:24.630 align:start position:0%
I expect the answer is so that it
 
00:43:28.159 --> 00:43:28.169 align:start position:0%
doesn't keep it as to the driver's
 
00:43:30.919 --> 00:43:30.929 align:start position:0%
license chapter it would be under this
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
new provision that you're providing but
 
00:43:36.949 --> 00:43:36.959 align:start position:0%
when you answer it could you explain how
 
00:43:40.249 --> 00:43:40.259 align:start position:0%
you balance that with the fact that the
 
00:43:42.559 --> 00:43:42.569 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle statute has a specific
 
00:43:46.489 --> 00:43:46.499 align:start position:0%
provision that allows individuals to
 
00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:48.170 align:start position:0%
make the choice
 
00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:52.100 align:start position:0%
to not have their image retained in the
 
00:43:58.930 --> 00:43:58.940 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle database representative
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
hopper am I still am i unmuted you're
 
00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:06.950 align:start position:0%
ready to go okay I don't have a good
 
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:10.010 align:start position:0%
answer for that I just I was reading
 
00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:11.510 align:start position:0%
over the bill again today and I didn't
 
00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:15.080 align:start position:0%
pick up on that so I I'm choking on that
 
00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:28.280 align:start position:0%
one representative Jan I didn't realize
 
00:44:29.530 --> 00:44:29.540 align:start position:0%
it was gonna pop up and say do you want
 
00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:30.020 align:start position:0%
on you
 
00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:39.140 align:start position:0%
last year I was 20 18 we had a bill come
 
00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
through a concurrent resolution came
 
00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:43.310 align:start position:0%
through the House and Senate was passed
 
00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:46.130 align:start position:0%
on to the voters to amend the
 
00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:47.900 align:start position:0%
Constitution and I just want to read
 
00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:51.710 align:start position:0%
that amendment that was made it added
 
00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
the words an individual's right to live
 
00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:55.610 align:start position:0%
free from government intrusion in
 
00:44:57.700 --> 00:44:57.710 align:start position:0%
private or personal information is a
 
00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:02.030 align:start position:0%
natural essential and inherent so we've
 
00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:06.110 align:start position:0%
had a few bills this year that seek to
 
00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:09.740 align:start position:0%
define what that meant I'm assuming your
 
00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:13.220 align:start position:0%
bill that you're proposing here whether
 
00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:18.940 align:start position:0%
it's amended or not is in fact defining
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
that inherent right to privacy that's in
 
00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
the Constitution rather than allowing
 
00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:30.770 align:start position:0%
court cases to go to a court to be
 
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
adjudicated to further define this
 
00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:35.180 align:start position:0%
amendment made for the Constitution is
 
00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:41.000 align:start position:0%
that correct yeah yeah thank you for the
 
00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:41.900 align:start position:0%
question yeah
 
00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
if basically the the amendment that we
 
00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:47.980 align:start position:0%
just passed by 80% of the population
 
00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:51.590 align:start position:0%
basically I think the voters of New
 
00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:54.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire my constituents said that they
 
00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
believe they have a right to privacy
 
00:45:58.930 --> 00:45:58.940 align:start position:0%
without government intrusion and I think
 
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
this is just putting I think meat on the
 
00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:02.110 align:start position:0%
this is just putting I think meat on the
bones

00:46:02.110 --> 00:46:02.120 align:start position:0%
bones
 
00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:05.020 align:start position:0%
somebody phrased it earlier this year
 
00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:09.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I have three people
 
00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:10.820 align:start position:0%
who want to speak a 2nd time
 
00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:13.880 align:start position:0%
representatives burrows aisle chiller
 
00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:18.250 align:start position:0%
and Gordon would it be all raw and birch
 
00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:23.540 align:start position:0%
would it be all right if we put those on
 
00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:29.090 align:start position:0%
hold and hear from the chair of the
 
00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:32.930 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and EDA perhaps or would
 
00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:35.180 align:start position:0%
you rather I continue with taking
 
00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:39.770 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee who would
 
00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:41.410 align:start position:0%
you like to recognize representative
 
00:46:44.650 --> 00:46:44.660 align:start position:0%
well I would like to recognize if
 
00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:47.300 align:start position:0%
there's no objection to recognize
 
00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:50.120 align:start position:0%
Peterson I would like to recognize Peter
 
00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:03.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:08.390 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt I'm here good go
 
00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:12.500 align:start position:0%
for it okay well I certainly appreciated
 
00:47:15.130 --> 00:47:15.140 align:start position:0%
the colloquy that I've been listening to
 
00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:20.120 align:start position:0%
since the end of the roll call anyway
 
00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:23.240 align:start position:0%
excellent questions that by and large
 
00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:26.390 align:start position:0%
the EDA committee did not consider
 
00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:28.970 align:start position:0%
because it's not part of our expertise
 
00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:32.180 align:start position:0%
and purview so we were looking at the
 
00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:34.690 align:start position:0%
aspects of the bill to which we were
 
00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:39.050 align:start position:0%
invited to participate we heard very
 
00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:41.630 align:start position:0%
excellent an expert testimony with
 
00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:46.490 align:start position:0%
regard to the dangers of effectively of
 
00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:50.450 align:start position:0%
facial recognition technology so there
 
00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:53.020 align:start position:0%
are several aspects to discuss here
 
00:47:57.820 --> 00:47:57.830 align:start position:0%
first of all this bill as I think has
 
00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:00.140 align:start position:0%
been remarked on doesn't do anything to
 
00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:04.750 align:start position:0%
private businesses right to employ
 
00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
cameras in their stores and and we know
 
00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:13.810 align:start position:0%
that they they many of the stores do
 
00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:15.810 align:start position:0%
virtually all of my
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
probably I don't look in every store I
 
00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:20.190 align:start position:0%
go into it to see whether cameras up on
 
00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:22.590 align:start position:0%
the ceiling or in the corners but figure
 
00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:24.300 align:start position:0%
it's a fairly safe assumption that we
 
00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
are videotaped or photographed and in a
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
number of establishments that this bill
 
00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:35.370 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect that secondly one of the
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
one of the aspects that was troubling to
 
00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
us with regard to facial recognition
 
00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:44.550 align:start position:0%
technology is that it's not the same for
 
00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:49.410 align:start position:0%
everybody if you're a young white male
 
00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:54.810 align:start position:0%
the chances of accurate depiction are
 
00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:00.090 align:start position:0%
pretty good from there on up in age or
 
00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:05.220 align:start position:0%
away from white Caucasian members of
 
00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:09.090 align:start position:0%
society the quality of the reproduction
 
00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:13.380 align:start position:0%
or of the recognition deteriorates is
 
00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:16.050 align:start position:0%
decreasing anyway that's an issue that
 
00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
people won't want to give some
 
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
consideration to because to the degree
 
00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:23.610 align:start position:0%
that either somebody is recognized as
 
00:49:27.110 --> 00:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
being somebody that they aren't or that
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
the person who is that person is not
 
00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:31.590 align:start position:0%
recognized that's not a good thing in
 
00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:34.110 align:start position:0%
terms of being a reliable resource for
 
00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:38.070 align:start position:0%
law enforcement or any other purpose so
 
00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:39.870 align:start position:0%
that that that's one of the
 
00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:42.210 align:start position:0%
considerations but but facial
 
00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:45.210 align:start position:0%
recognition basically and that's why we
 
00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
switched because the original bill is
 
00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:50.090 align:start position:0%
you probably have seen talked about
 
00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:56.610 align:start position:0%
facial surveillance systems and we've
 
00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:00.450 align:start position:0%
seen that in the case of the tsarnaev
 
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:05.720 align:start position:0%
brothers the marathon Marathon bombers
 
00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:08.100 align:start position:0%
imagine virtually all of us saw the
 
00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
footage where the two brothers came
 
00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
marching into the you know focal range
 
00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:16.590 align:start position:0%
of the of the camera you could see them
 
00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
and then they disappeared from that
 
00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:23.460 align:start position:0%
cameras purview and it was picked up and
 
00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:25.100 align:start position:0%
the next cameras purview virtually
 
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
seamlessly so you saw many of the stores
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
on Newbury
 
00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:33.630 align:start position:0%
think had such capabilities so and you
 
00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:35.190 align:start position:0%
could see no they had the pressure
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
cookers in there in their backpacks or
 
00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:39.900 align:start position:0%
at least very large bulges and their
 
00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:44.330 align:start position:0%
backpacks so here the question was not
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
Mizzou bombers that case was made pretty
 
00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
quickly but the question was who are
 
00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:53.460 align:start position:0%
these people so facial surveillance is
 
00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:57.180 align:start position:0%
very valuable for capturing actions such
 
00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:02.180 align:start position:0%
as shoplifting or robbery or whatever
 
00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:05.820 align:start position:0%
but then the question is who is this
 
00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:08.340 align:start position:0%
individual or who are these individuals
 
00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
if it's more than what and then the
 
00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:16.830 align:start position:0%
reality is then the police have to go
 
00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:20.700 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out now who done it but
 
00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:25.740 align:start position:0%
who are the people and that that is one
 
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:29.010 align:start position:0%
of the advantages of facial recognition
 
00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:34.170 align:start position:0%
technology is that a the images are
 
00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:38.210 align:start position:0%
duplicate our sorry our digitalized
 
00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:41.940 align:start position:0%
and in that manner they can be
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
immediately compared to the database
 
00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:47.430 align:start position:0%
that exists everywhere in government's a
 
00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:52.470 align:start position:0%
la fingerprints okay so to the degree
 
00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:57.300 align:start position:0%
that the that the that the then the
 
00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:01.890 align:start position:0%
digitalized images can be compared and
 
00:52:05.599 --> 00:52:05.609 align:start position:0%
and and the the database of course would
 
00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:08.390 align:start position:0%
have a name associated with that
 
00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
identity with that individual and
 
00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:17.150 align:start position:0%
thereby you could almost instantaneously
 
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
to degree that the tech technology is as
 
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:23.010 align:start position:0%
accurately doing this already referenced
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's its flaws at the moment but to
 
00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
the degree that is recognized
 
00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
immediately it's a tremendous law
 
00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:33.630 align:start position:0%
enforcement tool there's no question
 
00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:34.140 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:52:37.690 --> 00:52:37.700 align:start position:0%
and I really welcome this committee's
 
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
expertise in dealing with the issues
 
00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:43.140 align:start position:0%
that have been raised a number of time
 
00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:46.140 align:start position:0%
you know in questions to represent
 
00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:49.230 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you very much
 
00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:52.710 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt representative
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
McGuire do you have anything that you
 
00:52:58.370 --> 00:52:58.380 align:start position:0%
want to add to what's been said so far
 
00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:00.390 align:start position:0%
representative acquire was on the
 
00:53:01.850 --> 00:53:01.860 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that dealt with this bill
 
00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:06.510 align:start position:0%
in edn a yes madam chair thank you very
 
00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:07.100 align:start position:0%
in edn a yes madam chair thank you very
much

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:07.110 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
one thing that I got from your questions
 
00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:13.470 align:start position:0%
and comments is there is a bit of
 
00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:16.530 align:start position:0%
confusion between the idea of a
 
00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
photograph and a facial recognition
 
00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
system there this bill does not ban
 
00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:25.380 align:start position:0%
anyone including the police from taking
 
00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:27.180 align:start position:0%
pictures of people whether they're
 
00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
suspect or they're just walking down Elm
 
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
Street in Manchester what it does is
 
00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:34.410 align:start position:0%
prevent them from maintaining a database
 
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
of pictures of faces with the Associated
 
00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
data and then using a computer to
 
00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:45.030 align:start position:0%
compare them if they want to get a photo
 
00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:47.070 align:start position:0%
from Walmart of a suspected shoplifter
 
00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:50.130 align:start position:0%
and they show it to the local police and
 
00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:52.050 align:start position:0%
they and the local police says oh yeah
 
00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:53.910 align:start position:0%
that's Gary hopper we know all about him
 
00:53:59.540 --> 00:53:59.550 align:start position:0%
or that they the owner of a store that
 
00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:01.110 align:start position:0%
was robbed looked at and said yeah that
 
00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
guy came in last he comes in twice a
 
00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:05.430 align:start position:0%
week.i I don't know his name but he
 
00:54:06.850 --> 00:54:06.860 align:start position:0%
lives around here somewhere
 
00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
people are still allowed to look at
 
00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:12.930 align:start position:0%
pictures and recognize them what we're
 
00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:15.930 align:start position:0%
prohibiting with this bill is the
 
00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:18.270 align:start position:0%
development of a database of pictures of
 
00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:23.220 align:start position:0%
people and the and their identities and
 
00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:29.700 align:start position:0%
so that is why we chose to ban the DMV
 
00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:31.410 align:start position:0%
from you from doing it because they have
 
00:54:34.310 --> 00:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
a database of pictures most people keep
 
00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:36.900 align:start position:0%
their pictures on file and that contains
 
00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
a great deal of information like your
 
00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
name your address your birth date some
 
00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:43.590 align:start position:0%
of them still probably have social
 
00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
security numbers you don't want that
 
00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:50.130 align:start position:0%
data stolen or used and so this bill
 
00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
does not prohibit them from keeping a
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
database it keeps them from using it in
 
00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
a facial
 
00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:00.030 align:start position:0%
recognition system which is a different
 
00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:03.950 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:08.090 --> 00:55:08.100 align:start position:0%
and as representative Schmidt said right
 
00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
now facial recognition has a lot of
 
00:55:13.099 --> 00:55:13.109 align:start position:0%
false positives and a lot of false
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
negatives it is not that useful unless
 
00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:21.150 align:start position:0%
you have a very large database and you
 
00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:24.330 align:start position:0%
have pictures of the people a large
 
00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:25.740 align:start position:0%
database of the people you want to
 
00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:29.910 align:start position:0%
compare to and nobody in New Hampshire
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
as far as we know has that the bill
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
specifically exempts law enforcement
 
00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:41.070 align:start position:0%
cooperation with federal agencies that
 
00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:45.650 align:start position:0%
have used facial recognition and in fact
 
00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:50.250 align:start position:0%
it would allow cooperation with other
 
00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:54.930 align:start position:0%
agencies as long as we don't use the the
 
00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:56.730 align:start position:0%
facial recognition ourselves we could
 
00:55:59.930 --> 00:55:59.940 align:start position:0%
still send photos from iraf a robbery in
 
00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:03.990 align:start position:0%
Salem to the Massachusetts police and if
 
00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:06.780 align:start position:0%
they say without telling us they have
 
00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
used facial recognition
 
00:56:13.099 --> 00:56:13.109 align:start position:0%
oh that's Joe Blow from Lawrence will
 
00:56:15.130 --> 00:56:15.140 align:start position:0%
arrest him and send him to you that's
 
00:56:18.070 --> 00:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
that was what we thought would be the
 
00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
appropriate use is that we use the
 
00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
pictures we have and we use people to
 
00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:27.270 align:start position:0%
recognize them but we do not allow law
 
00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:29.970 align:start position:0%
enforcement to maintain and use a
 
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:35.010 align:start position:0%
database of pictures there are that it
 
00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:38.190 align:start position:0%
would be possible if there were specific
 
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
cases where someone wanted to allow that
 
00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:44.250 align:start position:0%
for example that database of abuse
 
00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:49.710 align:start position:0%
children might be allowable but our
 
00:56:52.310 --> 00:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
victims of crimes whatever but right now
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
we don't want to maintain a general
 
00:56:58.790 --> 00:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
database of people partly their privacy
 
00:57:01.070 --> 00:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
and freedom partly because it would
 
00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:03.810 align:start position:0%
generate too many false positives and
 
00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:14.550 align:start position:0%
ah sorry distract that and it would all
 
00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:17.190 align:start position:0%
having such a database would also be a
 
00:57:20.599 --> 00:57:20.609 align:start position:0%
major incentive for a lot of people and
 
00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:23.550 align:start position:0%
agencies to invade our privacy by
 
00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:26.220 align:start position:0%
putting up for putting up cameras and
 
00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:27.810 align:start position:0%
more places than there are now and
 
00:57:30.910 --> 00:57:30.920 align:start position:0%
that's something that I'm concerned with
 
00:57:33.859 --> 00:57:33.869 align:start position:0%
as long as you can you only use a photo
 
00:57:36.859 --> 00:57:36.869 align:start position:0%
for to have a policeman look at it or an
 
00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:39.810 align:start position:0%
individual for that identity it's
 
00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:41.940 align:start position:0%
limited and how much invasion of your
 
00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:45.510 align:start position:0%
privacy they can do is limited if you
 
00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:48.450 align:start position:0%
can use a database of everybody in the
 
00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:52.230 align:start position:0%
country and and instantaneously say well
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's one of this dozen people that's an
 
00:57:56.410 --> 00:57:56.420 align:start position:0%
incentive for a lot of people and
 
00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
agencies to go out and put cameras in
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
more places and I don't believe that's
 
00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:03.900 align:start position:0%
something that that we want to have an
 
00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:06.180 align:start position:0%
answer and I'll be glad to answer any
 
00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:12.260 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions for
 
00:58:14.839 --> 00:58:14.849 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire I know you have
 
00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:16.710 align:start position:0%
general things any questions
 
00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
specifically for representative McGuire
 
00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:21.300 align:start position:0%
representative Woodbury has a question
 
00:58:29.809 --> 00:58:29.819 align:start position:0%
okay yep okay this actually is a
 
00:58:31.849 --> 00:58:31.859 align:start position:0%
question which might be answered either
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
by representative Schmidt or
 
00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:36.270 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire but I'd like to
 
00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
know in the edn a hearings whether or
 
00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
not there was a discussion comparing the
 
00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:45.930 align:start position:0%
accuracy of facial recognition software
 
00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:49.530 align:start position:0%
and the accuracy of in-person human to
 
00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:52.170 align:start position:0%
human identification which we have known
 
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
is very fallible over the years and I
 
00:58:58.849 --> 00:58:58.859 align:start position:0%
just wonder if there was a discussion as
 
00:59:05.359 --> 00:59:05.369 align:start position:0%
to which which came out on top yes we
 
00:59:07.819 --> 00:59:07.829 align:start position:0%
did talk a little bit about that we
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
didn't ourselves analyze it because
 
00:59:12.650 --> 00:59:12.660 align:start position:0%
we're not experts we had some people
 
00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:15.210 align:start position:0%
from the industry and some experts from
 
00:59:18.970 --> 00:59:18.980 align:start position:0%
UNH working with us and in general
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
people are better at facial recognition
 
00:59:21.359 --> 00:59:22.220 align:start position:0%
people are better at facial recognition
than

00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:22.230 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:26.130 align:start position:0%
machines and this that may not be that
 
00:59:28.849 --> 00:59:28.859 align:start position:0%
way for long but right now they are
 
00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:32.490 align:start position:0%
particularly with things like if you're
 
00:59:34.310 --> 00:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
dealing with people with beards you're
 
00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:36.150 align:start position:0%
dealing with older people you're dealing
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
with non-caucasians you're dealing with
 
00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
children or if you've changed your
 
00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:43.670 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:47.599 --> 00:59:47.609 align:start position:0%
we people are best better at dealing
 
00:59:53.650 --> 00:59:53.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:55.470 align:start position:0%
representative birch did you have a
 
01:00:00.290 --> 01:00:00.300 align:start position:0%
question for McGwire or Schmidt yes I
 
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:02.010 align:start position:0%
would follow up with representative why
 
01:00:04.609 --> 01:00:04.619 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned representative about your
 
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
last statement I've spent decades with
 
01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
people who look through mug shot books
 
01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:14.190 align:start position:0%
at picture after picture after the first
 
01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:18.180 align:start position:0%
20 or 30 or 50 mug shots they look at
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
their level of identification is almost
 
01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:25.260 align:start position:0%
nil and lineups are notorious for
 
01:00:28.690 --> 01:00:28.700 align:start position:0%
similar problems so we know that people
 
01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:31.290 align:start position:0%
identification and there are hundreds
 
01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
and hundreds of studies to show people
 
01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:37.470 align:start position:0%
identification of pictures and lineups
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
are one of the largest contributors to
 
01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
false convictions that we have in this
 
01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:47.340 align:start position:0%
country I have yet to see a single study
 
01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if you have seen a
 
01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:54.030 align:start position:0%
single study that supports a computer
 
01:00:58.790 --> 01:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
going through five hundred mug shots is
 
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
less accurate than a person going
 
01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:04.140 align:start position:0%
through five hundred mug shots because I
 
01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:09.210 align:start position:0%
simply don't believe that I haven't seen
 
01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:11.820 align:start position:0%
such a study exactly and as I said we
 
01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:14.310 align:start position:0%
didn't do that sort of study we don't
 
01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:18.330 align:start position:0%
have that information but the people who
 
01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:21.900 align:start position:0%
who were testified at our subcommittee
 
01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:26.780 align:start position:0%
he work sessions were positive that
 
01:01:29.599 --> 01:01:29.609 align:start position:0%
facial recognition systems had a very
 
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
high false positive rate they are not as
 
01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:36.350 align:start position:0%
but and that's something that
 
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
we need to deal with we need to realize
 
01:01:43.930 --> 01:01:43.940 align:start position:0%
when we're dealing with these systems
 
01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:46.710 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:49.530 align:start position:0%
I've looked at the attendees and I can't
 
01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:53.210 align:start position:0%
find whomever is on this list
 
01:01:59.530 --> 01:01:59.540 align:start position:0%
representing the police chiefs could you
 
01:02:04.370 --> 01:02:04.380 align:start position:0%
indicate who you are I think that would
 
01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:08.070 align:start position:0%
be Beth's argent is that correct yes
 
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
that would be good she is here I can't
 
01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:23.220 align:start position:0%
allow her to talk okay um you know yes
 
01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:26.990 align:start position:0%
yeah yes you're on now high rep I
 
01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:29.870 align:start position:0%
represented Smith it's Beth's urgent
 
01:02:35.690 --> 01:02:35.700 align:start position:0%
good old steamed up okay can I pass the
 
01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:37.770 align:start position:0%
baton to chief goldstein chief goldstein
 
01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:39.750 align:start position:0%
is on the line and prepared to speak and
 
01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
answer correctly certainly right well
 
01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:46.530 align:start position:0%
we'd love texting identified so you have
 
01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
to let us know who he is
 
01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:51.810 align:start position:0%
Jen how how can I let what do you need
 
01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:55.290 align:start position:0%
his what is his phone number yeah I need
 
01:02:57.350 --> 01:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
his the last four digits of his phone
 
01:03:09.110 --> 01:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:16.970 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:22.470 align:start position:0%
do not see okay hold on let me let me
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
just text him
 
01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:28.890 align:start position:0%
oh he's sending me a note I'll get you
 
01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:42.750 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:46.070 align:start position:0%
Oh hold on he's gonna send me the number
 
01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:48.500 align:start position:0%
unless if he's online
 
01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:52.310 align:start position:0%
Oh could pn6
 
01:03:57.170 --> 01:03:57.180 align:start position:0%
603 eight-six but you said he could see
 
01:03:58.670 --> 01:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
us so that means he was connected online
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
is that right yes
 
01:04:14.089 --> 01:04:14.099 align:start position:0%
is he guests Gao Gao baby let me let me
 
01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:26.150 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:30.750 align:start position:0%
why don't we see if that can be sorted
 
01:04:35.569 --> 01:04:35.579 align:start position:0%
out I don't want to take you all our
 
01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:38.970 align:start position:0%
time and maybe Brad can help go through
 
01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
those phone numbers to see yes you can
 
01:04:56.809 --> 01:04:56.819 align:start position:0%
email me okay okay I really didn't want
 
01:05:05.779 --> 01:05:05.789 align:start position:0%
them next okay I think what happens is
 
01:05:08.059 --> 01:05:08.069 align:start position:0%
the phone number that is the phone
 
01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
number that they were told to dial not
 
01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:12.630 align:start position:0%
necessarily what their phone number is
 
01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:15.750 align:start position:0%
because that's happened before and we do
 
01:05:19.009 --> 01:05:19.019 align:start position:0%
have what four people here who or five
 
01:05:23.930 --> 01:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
who have phone numbers so that's not
 
01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:30.690 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:37.249 --> 01:05:37.259 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes Jean Ruska hi
 
01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
everyone can you hear me all right
 
01:05:42.589 --> 01:05:42.599 align:start position:0%
yes good afternoon thank you for the
 
01:05:44.599 --> 01:05:44.609 align:start position:0%
opportunity to chime in I just want to
 
01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:48.630 align:start position:0%
underscore a couple points that one has
 
01:05:50.269 --> 01:05:50.279 align:start position:0%
been raised in a couple that haven't I
 
01:05:51.769 --> 01:05:51.779 align:start position:0%
would just underscore a representative
 
01:05:54.589 --> 01:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
McGuire's concerns about reliability we
 
01:05:56.599 --> 01:05:56.609 align:start position:0%
do not consider facial recognition a
 
01:05:58.579 --> 01:05:58.589 align:start position:0%
reliable technology and I'll note that
 
01:06:01.069 --> 01:06:01.079 align:start position:0%
the government agency that's actually in
 
01:06:03.799 --> 01:06:03.809 align:start position:0%
charge of evaluating new technologies
 
01:06:06.529 --> 01:06:06.539 align:start position:0%
NIST has also ruled that this technology
 
01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:09.450 align:start position:0%
is not reliable it's one of the reasons
 
01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:12.690 align:start position:0%
that certain companies are not using it
 
01:06:14.299 --> 01:06:14.309 align:start position:0%
right now because of the rate of false
 
01:06:16.970 --> 01:06:16.980 align:start position:0%
positives particularly because of the
 
01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:18.690 align:start position:0%
rate of false positives amongst people
 
01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
of color and I'll just note we know
 
01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:23.390 align:start position:0%
people of color are already
 
01:06:25.279 --> 01:06:25.289 align:start position:0%
disproportionately subjected to the
 
01:06:27.019 --> 01:06:27.029 align:start position:0%
criminal legal system so we're
 
01:06:28.849 --> 01:06:28.859 align:start position:0%
particularly concerned about using a
 
01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:32.250 align:start position:0%
technology that has that same disparity
 
01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
in its ability to identify people but I
 
01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:35.900 align:start position:0%
in its ability to identify people but I
also

01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:35.910 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:06:37.549 --> 01:06:37.559 align:start position:0%
go back a little bit and kind of explain
 
01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:40.260 align:start position:0%
why we support starting with a
 
01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:43.470 align:start position:0%
prohibition on this technology we have
 
01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:45.210 align:start position:0%
come before this committee before in
 
01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:47.130 align:start position:0%
support of legislation that is trying to
 
01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:50.130 align:start position:0%
create guardrails around a certain
 
01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
technology or a certain procedure that's
 
01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:54.030 align:start position:0%
already in robust use if you can
 
01:06:56.329 --> 01:06:56.339 align:start position:0%
remember last year there was a bill
 
01:06:59.240 --> 01:06:59.250 align:start position:0%
about DNA right and trying to create a
 
01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:02.190 align:start position:0%
privacy guardrail around the existing
 
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
use of DNA and what we know is once a
 
01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:07.470 align:start position:0%
technology is in rampant use it is
 
01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
really really hard to restrict it it's
 
01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:13.530 align:start position:0%
so hard if not impossible to put the
 
01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
genie back in the bottle and our concern
 
01:07:18.289 --> 01:07:18.299 align:start position:0%
is that this technology will become in
 
01:07:21.410 --> 01:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
such robust use that when if we try and
 
01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:24.210 align:start position:0%
go back afterwards and restrict it and
 
01:07:26.539 --> 01:07:26.549 align:start position:0%
contain it it'll be next to impossible
 
01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:29.430 align:start position:0%
and so the benefit for us with this bill
 
01:07:32.599 --> 01:07:32.609 align:start position:0%
is you start with a prohibition I think
 
01:07:35.779 --> 01:07:35.789 align:start position:0%
we fully expect that even as early as
 
01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:37.770 align:start position:0%
next year you could see bills that come
 
01:07:41.210 --> 01:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
in and try and create exceptions that
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
this legislature could consider on a
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
case-by-case basis
 
01:07:47.839 --> 01:07:47.849 align:start position:0%
you start with a prohibition and then
 
01:07:50.059 --> 01:07:50.069 align:start position:0%
allow people that come forward in a
 
01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:52.170 align:start position:0%
transparent public manner where the
 
01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:54.630 align:start position:0%
public can see how this technology might
 
01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:57.150 align:start position:0%
get used the reliability of this
 
01:07:59.510 --> 01:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
technology can be assessed and this
 
01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:02.130 align:start position:0%
legislature then on a case-by-case basis
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
can create exceptions can allow the
 
01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:06.150 align:start position:0%
technology whether it's with a warrant
 
01:08:08.809 --> 01:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
whether it's specifically in cases of
 
01:08:11.599 --> 01:08:11.609 align:start position:0%
lost children you can create those
 
01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:13.799 align:start position:0%
exceptions but it's so much easier to
 
01:08:16.519 --> 01:08:16.529 align:start position:0%
proactively do that on a case-by-case
 
01:08:19.849 --> 01:08:19.859 align:start position:0%
basis going forward than it is trying to
 
01:08:22.669 --> 01:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
establish privacy guardrails and
 
01:08:26.059 --> 01:08:26.069 align:start position:0%
restrict a privacy technology once it's
 
01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:28.290 align:start position:0%
already in robust use and I'll just note
 
01:08:31.579 --> 01:08:31.589 align:start position:0%
the example of whether eyewitness
 
01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
testimony is reliable or not
 
01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
eyewitness testimony is unreliable which
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
is one of the reasons why it has taken
 
01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:42.150 align:start position:0%
decades to try and establish very
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
specific procedures for how that process
 
01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:47.850 align:start position:0%
is done this legislature actually
 
01:08:49.689 --> 01:08:49.699 align:start position:0%
recently passed a bill
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
establishing guidelines on how
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
eyewitness identification is to be done
 
01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:56.250 align:start position:0%
because there are ways to make it more
 
01:09:00.289 --> 01:09:00.299 align:start position:0%
reliable than not there are no such
 
01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
guidelines right now with facial
 
01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:03.900 align:start position:0%
recognition there are no restrictions
 
01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
there are no regulations as to how to
 
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
use it properly or how to use it
 
01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:10.130 align:start position:0%
improperly how to make it more reliable
 
01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:13.170 align:start position:0%
it's it's no-man's land it's kind of a
 
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
free-for-all right now with this
 
01:09:17.329 --> 01:09:17.339 align:start position:0%
technology and so again the benefit of
 
01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:19.230 align:start position:0%
starting with a prohibition is you
 
01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:22.410 align:start position:0%
create you start with 100% civil liberty
 
01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
protection and then you allow this
 
01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:27.900 align:start position:0%
legislature to consider next year ways
 
01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:30.750 align:start position:0%
that this technology can be used and as
 
01:09:33.229 --> 01:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
you consider that you can then establish
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
procedures for how it can be used if
 
01:09:37.849 --> 01:09:37.859 align:start position:0%
it's a warrant what needs to be shown
 
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
how do you ensure that if a warrant is
 
01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:43.170 align:start position:0%
granted that by standards are not
 
01:09:45.559 --> 01:09:45.569 align:start position:0%
captured while you're trying to narrow
 
01:09:48.979 --> 01:09:48.989 align:start position:0%
in on a particular person and so right
 
01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:51.270 align:start position:0%
now the question was asked of whether
 
01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:52.980 align:start position:0%
there's any New Hampshire state agency
 
01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:54.780 align:start position:0%
that uses this technology and to be
 
01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:57.090 align:start position:0%
honest I'm not sure if there is because
 
01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:00.030 align:start position:0%
I'm not convinced that if a police
 
01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:01.590 align:start position:0%
department decided to use this
 
01:10:03.170 --> 01:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
technology that they would notify the
 
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
public we know that there are cases
 
01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
where law enforcement use technologies
 
01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:10.110 align:start position:0%
that that where the public is not
 
01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
notified where it's actually kept
 
01:10:13.370 --> 01:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
confidential that law enforcement is
 
01:10:15.979 --> 01:10:15.989 align:start position:0%
using that technology and so again I
 
01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:17.730 align:start position:0%
know I'm sounding like a broken record
 
01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:19.590 align:start position:0%
here but if you start with a prohibition
 
01:10:22.130 --> 01:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
and allow this legislative body to
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
consider individual uses going forward
 
01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:27.930 align:start position:0%
the public is notified that is a very
 
01:10:29.959 --> 01:10:29.969 align:start position:0%
transparent process you have public
 
01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:32.130 align:start position:0%
hearings the public is notified that
 
01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:34.170 align:start position:0%
this technology will be used they are
 
01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:36.690 align:start position:0%
allowed to chime in and speak up on
 
01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
whether they are comfortable with this
 
01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:41.910 align:start position:0%
technology being used right now I expect
 
01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:43.830 align:start position:0%
law enforcement are actually talking
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
with private companies who want to sell
 
01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:47.250 align:start position:0%
them this technology but we don't know
 
01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
that we're not a part of that
 
01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:51.150 align:start position:0%
conversation and we won't know the day
 
01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:53.610 align:start position:0%
that the technology is adopted and so
 
01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:55.350 align:start position:0%
for us it's not that we're looking to
 
01:10:57.380 --> 01:10:57.390 align:start position:0%
prohibit this technology completely
 
01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:00.330 align:start position:0%
forever with no exceptions the goal is
 
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
to start with a prohibition so
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
that we can then have an informed
 
01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:06.630 align:start position:0%
transparent conversation going forward
 
01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:09.390 align:start position:0%
about how maybe this technology can be
 
01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:12.330 align:start position:0%
used in limited capacities with very
 
01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
specific established procedures and
 
01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
guardrails and so those are the points I
 
01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to raise I'm happy to take
 
01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:28.770 align:start position:0%
questions represented Burroughs sorry
 
01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
right there yes um thank you for taking
 
01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:33.750 align:start position:0%
the question I was wondering if you
 
01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:36.510 align:start position:0%
might be able to respond I actually to a
 
01:11:38.330 --> 01:11:38.340 align:start position:0%
conversation that I had with the chief
 
01:11:41.450 --> 01:11:41.460 align:start position:0%
of police of Jackson New Hampshire who
 
01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:44.250 align:start position:0%
felt that the scientific efficacy
 
01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:47.190 align:start position:0%
validity and reliability of technology
 
01:11:50.450 --> 01:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
is something that should be handled in
 
01:11:52.670 --> 01:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
the court system rather than by the
 
01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:54.690 align:start position:0%
legislature and he he gave the example
 
01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:58.290 align:start position:0%
of dog sniffing dogs you know some of
 
01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:00.270 align:start position:0%
them are more reliable than others based
 
01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:03.270 align:start position:0%
on on the training that they get there's
 
01:12:06.050 --> 01:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
also been cases involving blood spatter
 
01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:09.030 align:start position:0%
and depending on who the expert is and
 
01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:12.630 align:start position:0%
and and also technology around bite
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
marks so I'm wondering if you could
 
01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:16.770 align:start position:0%
respond to the comments that he made
 
01:12:18.490 --> 01:12:18.500 align:start position:0%
which I thought were pretty interesting
 
01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:20.070 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:23.610 align:start position:0%
representative that I actually strongly
 
01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:25.470 align:start position:0%
disagree with that I I can't imagine
 
01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:28.830 align:start position:0%
that courts want to be the decider about
 
01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
whether technology is reliable and
 
01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:34.310 align:start position:0%
judges are not technological experts and
 
01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:36.270 align:start position:0%
obviously representatives aren't
 
01:12:38.530 --> 01:12:38.540 align:start position:0%
necessarily technological experts or not
 
01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:41.130 align:start position:0%
but to me it is actually the
 
01:12:43.490 --> 01:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
Legislature's job to kind of decide this
 
01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
sort of issue about whether certain
 
01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:47.940 align:start position:0%
technology should be used and and
 
01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
whether if they are allowed to be used
 
01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:52.950 align:start position:0%
what the procedures are I think this
 
01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:54.750 align:start position:0%
goes to a concern that representative
 
01:12:57.980 --> 01:12:57.990 align:start position:0%
hopper raised that the voters approved a
 
01:13:00.890 --> 01:13:00.900 align:start position:0%
very very broad constitutional amendment
 
01:13:02.930 --> 01:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
and I think one of the reasons you're
 
01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
seeing privacy bills is that voters have
 
01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
concerned and legislators have concerns
 
01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:09.870 align:start position:0%
about the court being left to try and
 
01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
figure out what part one article 2 B
 
01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:14.790 align:start position:0%
means I actually think it is the
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the ledges
 
01:13:18.379 --> 01:13:18.389 align:start position:0%
later to flesh out that constitutional
 
01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:20.630 align:start position:0%
amendment and to make a decision about
 
01:13:23.930 --> 01:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
what privacy rights mean it when it
 
01:13:25.899 --> 01:13:25.909 align:start position:0%
comes to informational privacy like this
 
01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
and so as a voter and as a somebody who
 
01:13:31.879 --> 01:13:31.889 align:start position:0%
cares deeply about privacy I'm very
 
01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:34.530 align:start position:0%
nervous about simply deferring to the
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
courts to make really complex decisions
 
01:13:40.339 --> 01:13:40.349 align:start position:0%
about whether technology is reliable or
 
01:13:42.290 --> 01:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
not they'll have to make case-by-case
 
01:13:46.669 --> 01:13:46.679 align:start position:0%
decisions obviously but I strongly
 
01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:48.630 align:start position:0%
encourage this legislature to be
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
proactive in considering individual
 
01:13:54.290 --> 01:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
privacy considerations because I would I
 
01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
would like to see part one article to be
 
01:13:59.180 --> 01:13:59.190 align:start position:0%
fleshed out and statute where rather
 
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
than waiting for the courts to do it in
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
response to you know whatever random
 
01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:05.810 align:start position:0%
case may come their way
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:14:10.399 --> 01:14:10.409 align:start position:0%
Jane have we been able to sort out the
 
01:14:15.319 --> 01:14:15.329 align:start position:0%
problem with the police chief we are
 
01:14:17.419 --> 01:14:17.429 align:start position:0%
still working on it whether he's going
 
01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:22.770 align:start position:0%
to file a Joe I do have I believe that
 
01:14:25.399 --> 01:14:25.409 align:start position:0%
it's the name David I just had him on
 
01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:29.190 align:start position:0%
the phone they believe he is David and
 
01:14:31.490 --> 01:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
if you're okay with it I can go ahead
 
01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:34.110 align:start position:0%
and just give the permission to talk and
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
I think that absolutely all right here
 
01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:37.710 align:start position:0%
we go we'll see if it's the correct
 
01:14:44.089 --> 01:14:44.099 align:start position:0%
person they became to you can you talk
 
01:14:44.099 --> 01:14:45.169 align:start position:0%
person they became to you can you talk
hello

01:14:45.169 --> 01:14:45.179 align:start position:0%
hello
 
01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:48.210 align:start position:0%
it is not me okay different Davis all
 
01:14:50.569 --> 01:14:50.579 align:start position:0%
right not the right one all right I will
 
01:14:59.950 --> 01:14:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:03.030 align:start position:0%
we can't just click on these telephone
 
01:15:04.819 --> 01:15:04.829 align:start position:0%
numbers and see who's on each one of
 
01:15:08.450 --> 01:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
them there were only what we could do is
 
01:15:11.839 --> 01:15:11.849 align:start position:0%
if you are chief goldstein calling from
 
01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
one from a telephone if you could press
 
01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:17.310 align:start position:0%
star nine to raise your hand we'll
 
01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
recognize you
 
01:15:23.149 --> 01:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:27.690 align:start position:0%
I don't see anyone
 
01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:32.290 align:start position:0%
I don't see anyone
[Music]

01:15:32.290 --> 01:15:32.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:34.729 --> 01:15:34.739 align:start position:0%
well this concerns me because I think
 
01:15:39.169 --> 01:15:39.179 align:start position:0%
it's important that we do hear from the
 
01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
individual who's representing the police
 
01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:44.610 align:start position:0%
chiefs I think it's an important part of
 
01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:49.710 align:start position:0%
of what we're trying to do let me then
 
01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:53.010 align:start position:0%
go back to the people who had I hope
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
you're all sort trying to sort that out
 
01:15:56.570 --> 01:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
let me go back to the people who had
 
01:15:58.189 --> 01:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
questions ah
 
01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:03.090 align:start position:0%
wait was that someone no representative
 
01:16:08.479 --> 01:16:08.489 align:start position:0%
al Schiller did you have something you
 
01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:18.850 --> 01:16:18.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
thank you so my question goes back to
 
01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire who were on the
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and I'm curious about
 
01:16:34.970 --> 01:16:34.980 align:start position:0%
whether you had during the
 
01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:37.830 align:start position:0%
subcommittee's time together
 
01:16:40.939 --> 01:16:40.949 align:start position:0%
have you considered some of the programs
 
01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:44.310 align:start position:0%
that we are currently using for instance
 
01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:46.350 align:start position:0%
the VIP the victim identification
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
program that is the program that we are
 
01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:54.330 align:start position:0%
using right now to combat child
 
01:16:57.770 --> 01:16:57.780 align:start position:0%
exploitation and was there consideration
 
01:17:00.649 --> 01:17:00.659 align:start position:0%
made for for instance the sex offender
 
01:17:05.629 --> 01:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
registry or for any of most-wanted lists
 
01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
that are done by municipalities who you
 
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
know put up pictures of people who have
 
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
committed you know who are you know
 
01:17:17.419 --> 01:17:17.429 align:start position:0%
known to law enforcement and they need
 
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
to let the couplet let the people know
 
01:17:22.370 --> 01:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
that there's someone at large who's a
 
01:17:26.450 --> 01:17:26.460 align:start position:0%
danger so had the committee considered
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
those three things that are being used
 
01:17:33.010 --> 01:17:33.020 align:start position:0%
right now and was it the committee's
 
01:17:36.329 --> 01:17:36.339 align:start position:0%
intention to throw away
 
01:17:38.939 --> 01:17:38.949 align:start position:0%
this tool altogether and only bring it
 
01:17:42.809 --> 01:17:42.819 align:start position:0%
back as an exception to a rule or you
 
01:17:45.449 --> 01:17:45.459 align:start position:0%
know had that had it not been phrased in
 
01:17:48.349 --> 01:17:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:50.849 --> 01:17:50.859 align:start position:0%
are we gonna direct representing mcguire
 
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
with that representative mcguire or
 
01:17:55.529 --> 01:17:55.539 align:start position:0%
schmidt I believe both were on that
 
01:17:59.209 --> 01:17:59.219 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so I'm open to either I
 
01:18:01.799 --> 01:18:01.809 align:start position:0%
don't see representative Schmidt on my
 
01:18:04.229 --> 01:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
screen anymore but I think he's still
 
01:18:09.959 --> 01:18:09.969 align:start position:0%
here okay are they still here yes okay
 
01:18:12.389 --> 01:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
Pete representative McGuire Schmidt can
 
01:18:18.079 --> 01:18:18.089 align:start position:0%
you answer that represented McGuire
 
01:18:21.179 --> 01:18:21.189 align:start position:0%
recognized yes I can she answer your
 
01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:23.050 align:start position:0%
question represented all show or no we
 
01:18:27.419 --> 01:18:27.429 align:start position:0%
do not consider those specific I'm not
 
01:18:30.179 --> 01:18:30.189 align:start position:0%
still muted again now we hear you we
 
01:18:33.119 --> 01:18:33.129 align:start position:0%
hear you we are not as familiar with
 
01:18:35.159 --> 01:18:35.169 align:start position:0%
them as you are because we're obviously
 
01:18:37.049 --> 01:18:37.059 align:start position:0%
a different committee that's why we're
 
01:18:39.569 --> 01:18:39.579 align:start position:0%
both committees are at it we have no
 
01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
this bill would not prohibit anyone
 
01:18:46.979 --> 01:18:46.989 align:start position:0%
posting information or pictures of
 
01:18:49.099 --> 01:18:49.109 align:start position:0%
people they are suspicious of
 
01:18:52.459 --> 01:18:52.469 align:start position:0%
most-wanted lists could could still be
 
01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:55.030 align:start position:0%
posted at the post office or Town Hall
 
01:18:58.739 --> 01:18:58.749 align:start position:0%
or whatever what it prohibits is having
 
01:19:01.709 --> 01:19:01.719 align:start position:0%
an automatic system that would compare
 
01:19:03.959 --> 01:19:03.969 align:start position:0%
those pictures to some other database
 
01:19:09.149 --> 01:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
it's not the use of photos of suspects
 
01:19:12.299 --> 01:19:12.309 align:start position:0%
or even of convicted sex offenders or
 
01:19:14.429 --> 01:19:14.439 align:start position:0%
whatever that is the issue it's the
 
01:19:18.689 --> 01:19:18.699 align:start position:0%
automatic matching of some photo of
 
01:19:20.909 --> 01:19:20.919 align:start position:0%
someone instantly from Stan's with that
 
01:19:23.339 --> 01:19:23.349 align:start position:0%
database that the bill would prohibit so
 
01:19:25.169 --> 01:19:25.179 align:start position:0%
I don't believe it would affect any of
 
01:19:27.809 --> 01:19:27.819 align:start position:0%
those systems you don't you mentioned or
 
01:19:30.509 --> 01:19:30.519 align:start position:0%
as they are in use right now although
 
01:19:32.579 --> 01:19:32.589 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure because I'm not familiar
 
01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:34.530 align:start position:0%
with the details
 
01:19:45.729 --> 01:19:45.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:52.959 --> 01:19:52.969 align:start position:0%
representative Gordon I think and I
 
01:19:56.419 --> 01:19:56.429 align:start position:0%
think representative McGuire could
 
01:19:59.319 --> 01:19:59.329 align:start position:0%
answer the question perhaps but I think
 
01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:03.290 align:start position:0%
the the the problem I'm having is that
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
getting back to the constitutional
 
01:20:09.310 --> 01:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
amendment the recently adopted and
 
01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
defining crisis because it seems to me
 
01:20:18.919 --> 01:20:18.929 align:start position:0%
that facial recognition is used as we've
 
01:20:21.919 --> 01:20:21.929 align:start position:0%
all been describing is used today by
 
01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:24.270 align:start position:0%
police to identify people because that's
 
01:20:26.419 --> 01:20:26.429 align:start position:0%
the way we identify people by virtue of
 
01:20:29.479 --> 01:20:29.489 align:start position:0%
their faces and we do that humanely with
 
01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:36.170 align:start position:0%
our eyes and the issue here is issue of
 
01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:38.550 align:start position:0%
not whether or not we can identify
 
01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:42.630 align:start position:0%
people it's the use of technology to do
 
01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:47.610 align:start position:0%
that in the law we the standard that's
 
01:20:49.879 --> 01:20:49.889 align:start position:0%
constantly used is expectation of
 
01:20:53.450 --> 01:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
privacy when people are out in public
 
01:20:58.939 --> 01:20:58.949 align:start position:0%
and they make themselves available in
 
01:21:01.729 --> 01:21:01.739 align:start position:0%
public they have no expectation of
 
01:21:06.530 --> 01:21:06.540 align:start position:0%
privacy so I'm trying to figure out how
 
01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:09.630 align:start position:0%
we apply the standard of expectation of
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
privacy to a facial recognition system
 
01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:17.070 align:start position:0%
and in that if people are out in public
 
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:19.010 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that they have an
 
01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:22.770 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy I think what
 
01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
really the bill gets said is we're just
 
01:21:27.290 --> 01:21:27.300 align:start position:0%
offended that technology is used being
 
01:21:32.050 --> 01:21:32.060 align:start position:0%
used to identify us and I and I think
 
01:21:34.450 --> 01:21:34.460 align:start position:0%
represented McGuire you specifically
 
01:21:37.010 --> 01:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
address that by saying hey what we
 
01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:38.610 align:start position:0%
really want to do with prohibit
 
01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:44.550 align:start position:0%
databases and so I I guess I'm trying to
 
01:21:46.729 --> 01:21:46.739 align:start position:0%
figure out how the legal standards in
 
01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:48.510 align:start position:0%
this particular case would be applied
 
01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:50.250 align:start position:0%
and whether we're really talking about
 
01:21:59.790 --> 01:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:05.330 align:start position:0%
representative DeLorenzo I'm just
 
01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:08.030 align:start position:0%
quickly I'm sorry to interrupt but we do
 
01:22:11.170 --> 01:22:11.180 align:start position:0%
have the chief on the line now all right
 
01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:12.410 align:start position:0%
if it's all right with everyone let's
 
01:22:24.570 --> 01:22:24.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:28.630 --> 01:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
chief goldstein yes did that work yes
 
01:22:32.130 --> 01:22:32.140 align:start position:0%
Oh wonderful good afternoon everybody
 
01:22:34.420 --> 01:22:34.430 align:start position:0%
good afternoon we'd love to hear what
 
01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:36.890 align:start position:0%
you have to say certainly and I
 
01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:39.410 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity as always I
 
01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:41.450 align:start position:0%
must tell you though that as a police
 
01:22:42.970 --> 01:22:42.980 align:start position:0%
officer I'm very worried about zoom
 
01:22:45.250 --> 01:22:45.260 align:start position:0%
because I've been in a lot of houses and
 
01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:47.030 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if I violated the Fourth
 
01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:50.690 align:start position:0%
Amendment over the last few weeks the
 
01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
number of houses I've been in that's a
 
01:22:56.350 --> 01:22:56.360 align:start position:0%
joke I'm sorry well I I knew you meant
 
01:22:59.410 --> 01:22:59.420 align:start position:0%
it as a joke but we're kind of or not in
 
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
an in an entertaining mood i think chief
 
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
broflovskis remarks pretty well
 
01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:09.560 align:start position:0%
underscore how the Chiefs feel about
 
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
this I took some notes on some of the
 
01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
comments that I did hear and I'd like to
 
01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:16.970 align:start position:0%
address just a couple of those for the
 
01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:20.150 align:start position:0%
committee's benefit first and foremost
 
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:22.010 align:start position:0%
to use wiretapping as an analogous
 
01:23:26.190 --> 01:23:26.200 align:start position:0%
situation is really well left-field
 
01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:28.490 align:start position:0%
wiretapping and since the beginning
 
01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
quite frankly has always been very very
 
01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:34.130 align:start position:0%
regulated by the courts in fact it's
 
01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
probably harder to get a wiretap warrant
 
01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:39.290 align:start position:0%
than a search warrant today and as an
 
01:23:41.470 --> 01:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
old-time undercover guy who did a lot of
 
01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:44.090 align:start position:0%
wiretaps I'm very familiar with that so
 
01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:45.410 align:start position:0%
I don't think that that particular
 
01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:48.290 align:start position:0%
argument holds a great deal of of
 
01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:51.560 align:start position:0%
credence relative to this counsel
 
01:23:52.690 --> 01:23:52.700 align:start position:0%
brought up a very interesting point
 
01:23:56.650 --> 01:23:56.660 align:start position:0%
about starting from a particular level
 
01:23:58.210 --> 01:23:58.220 align:start position:0%
where everything is prohibited and then
 
01:23:59.920 --> 01:23:59.930 align:start position:0%
we work from there we on the other hand
 
01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:02.450 align:start position:0%
we look at it just the opposite way we
 
01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:04.490 align:start position:0%
feel that by giving us the opportunity
 
01:24:05.409 --> 01:24:05.419 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
01:24:08.859 --> 01:24:08.869 align:start position:0%
as case law has developed over time we
 
01:24:11.379 --> 01:24:11.389 align:start position:0%
can certainly comply with that and we
 
01:24:12.850 --> 01:24:12.860 align:start position:0%
know that that will happen so we're
 
01:24:15.310 --> 01:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
looking at this kind of as a blank slate
 
01:24:18.729 --> 01:24:18.739 align:start position:0%
if you will I understand that people
 
01:24:20.799 --> 01:24:20.809 align:start position:0%
would like data-driven information I
 
01:24:22.989 --> 01:24:22.999 align:start position:0%
realize that there is not a lot but I
 
01:24:24.669 --> 01:24:24.679 align:start position:0%
will offer you this and this is from
 
01:24:26.859 --> 01:24:26.869 align:start position:0%
your own organization this is from a
 
01:24:29.529 --> 01:24:29.539 align:start position:0%
National Conference of State Legislators
 
01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:32.510 align:start position:0%
and I quote most biometric systems have
 
01:24:34.989 --> 01:24:34.999 align:start position:0%
a high accuracy rate more than 95
 
01:24:36.549 --> 01:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
percent when matching a biometric
 
01:24:39.399 --> 01:24:39.409 align:start position:0%
against a large database of biometrics
 
01:24:41.850 --> 01:24:41.860 align:start position:0%
or against the originally enrolled
 
01:24:44.350 --> 01:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
biometric and quite frankly the FBI
 
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
right now maintains a a repository of
 
01:24:52.929 --> 01:24:52.939 align:start position:0%
over 70 2.6 million records that can be
 
01:24:55.989 --> 01:24:55.999 align:start position:0%
accessed legally so I would offer that
 
01:24:57.850 --> 01:24:57.860 align:start position:0%
to the committee as well so there is
 
01:25:01.029 --> 01:25:01.039 align:start position:0%
some data that is being developed our
 
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:04.010 align:start position:0%
question really quite frankly is to have
 
01:25:06.129 --> 01:25:06.139 align:start position:0%
an outright ban right now we feel is
 
01:25:07.719 --> 01:25:07.729 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and that we can certainly
 
01:25:10.029 --> 01:25:10.039 align:start position:0%
work on this with the committee and with
 
01:25:12.159 --> 01:25:12.169 align:start position:0%
anybody else that's interested in trying
 
01:25:14.649 --> 01:25:14.659 align:start position:0%
to design some a parameter in which we
 
01:25:18.189 --> 01:25:18.199 align:start position:0%
can work and certainly to coin a phrase
 
01:25:20.770 --> 01:25:20.780 align:start position:0%
that I've heard many many times over the
 
01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:22.130 align:start position:0%
10 years that I've been coming to the
 
01:25:24.609 --> 01:25:24.619 align:start position:0%
legislature this particular bill we feel
 
01:25:27.699 --> 01:25:27.709 align:start position:0%
is not ready for primetime so we would
 
01:25:31.919 --> 01:25:31.929 align:start position:0%
like like that to be considered as well
 
01:25:36.879 --> 01:25:36.889 align:start position:0%
to exchange certain rights if you will
 
01:25:40.479 --> 01:25:40.489 align:start position:0%
for the commission of crimes I would ask
 
01:25:41.979 --> 01:25:41.989 align:start position:0%
the representative with all due respect
 
01:25:44.799 --> 01:25:44.809 align:start position:0%
to go to the families of the 9/11
 
01:25:46.810 --> 01:25:46.820 align:start position:0%
victims or go to the families of the
 
01:25:49.419 --> 01:25:49.429 align:start position:0%
Marathon bombing victims and see how
 
01:25:52.569 --> 01:25:52.579 align:start position:0%
they feel about that knowing how those
 
01:25:54.549 --> 01:25:54.559 align:start position:0%
systems work what happened actually
 
01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:57.050 align:start position:0%
being involved to some degree with those
 
01:25:59.439 --> 01:25:59.449 align:start position:0%
and with individuals who were victims of
 
01:26:02.799 --> 01:26:02.809 align:start position:0%
those particular situations certainly
 
01:26:04.479 --> 01:26:04.489 align:start position:0%
they would not agree that that's a
 
01:26:06.669 --> 01:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
trade-off and finally I would offer that
 
01:26:09.669 --> 01:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
yes China does were China wants to do we
 
01:26:11.469 --> 01:26:11.479 align:start position:0%
we certainly hear a great deal about
 
01:26:13.449 --> 01:26:13.459 align:start position:0%
that in news today but I would also
 
01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:16.130 align:start position:0%
refer you to England and Israel who have
 
01:26:18.159 --> 01:26:18.169 align:start position:0%
been using these systems for quite a
 
01:26:18.970 --> 01:26:18.980 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
and it's because of the Israeli system
 
01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:23.690 align:start position:0%
that we were able to find the true
 
01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:25.730 align:start position:0%
Marathon bombers as quickly as we did
 
01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:27.650 align:start position:0%
and certainly I'm open to any questions
 
01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:31.070 align:start position:0%
that the committee might have thank you
 
01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:33.470 align:start position:0%
very much chief we're always happy to
 
01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:41.650 align:start position:0%
hear from you thank you um okay
 
01:26:45.010 --> 01:26:45.020 align:start position:0%
it I want to just stop for a minute and
 
01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:48.290 align:start position:0%
take the committee's temperature we've
 
01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
been at this for an hour and a half and
 
01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:55.670 align:start position:0%
it is straining to try to go through
 
01:26:57.790 --> 01:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
this process it's difficult without us
 
01:26:59.290 --> 01:26:59.300 align:start position:0%
being in the same room and I'm
 
01:27:06.479 --> 01:27:06.489 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
where you want to go there are a couple
 
01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:15.350 align:start position:0%
of possibilities one is to keep on going
 
01:27:18.340 --> 01:27:18.350 align:start position:0%
for a while today if we think we're
 
01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:21.770 align:start position:0%
moving towards a point another is to see
 
01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:26.630 align:start position:0%
if we can schedule another work session
 
01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:31.610 align:start position:0%
and that is not in my control it's in
 
01:27:34.510 --> 01:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
the control of the wonderful staff who
 
01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
have have to do that we do have another
 
01:27:44.170 --> 01:27:44.180 align:start position:0%
session scheduled which I had listed as
 
01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:48.650 align:start position:0%
an executive session for May 28th which
 
01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:56.090 align:start position:0%
is a week from Thursday I guess I want
 
01:28:01.479 --> 01:28:01.489 align:start position:0%
to know whether we think that there is
 
01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:12.410 align:start position:0%
amendments I think it's clear we nobody
 
01:28:14.050 --> 01:28:14.060 align:start position:0%
seems to want to get to yes without
 
01:28:16.540 --> 01:28:16.550 align:start position:0%
amendments including the prime sponsor
 
01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:27.850 align:start position:0%
or I will not even pretend that we can
 
01:28:31.570 --> 01:28:31.580 align:start position:0%
that it would make any sense to do an
 
01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:32.750 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
01:28:35.050 --> 01:28:35.060 align:start position:0%
because there really aren't going to be
 
01:28:38.830 --> 01:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
working in term studies this summer
 
01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:46.930 align:start position:0%
so the choice that we have is basically
 
01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:55.270 align:start position:0%
yes yes with an amendment or no and is
 
01:28:59.860 --> 01:28:59.870 align:start position:0%
there some guidance I can get from you
 
01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:06.610 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:11.030 align:start position:0%
perhaps I've already put out my request
 
01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
through text to see if we could get
 
01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:16.490 align:start position:0%
another meeting before the 28th but I
 
01:29:18.490 --> 01:29:18.500 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten an answer so I don't know
 
01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:27.890 align:start position:0%
a representative would Barry give me a
 
01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:32.570 align:start position:0%
thumbs up okay Joanne yes I'd be glad to
 
01:29:34.150 --> 01:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
give you a sense of my temperature on
 
01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:40.850 align:start position:0%
this and I I'm not I'm not in favor of
 
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
this bill I'm not in favor of working
 
01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:46.490 align:start position:0%
toward an amendment for it and I am in
 
01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:48.890 align:start position:0%
favor of either ITL we're at the
 
01:29:50.830 --> 01:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate time laying it on the table
 
01:29:55.570 --> 01:29:55.580 align:start position:0%
and my reason is twofold first of all in
 
01:29:59.530 --> 01:29:59.540 align:start position:0%
this in this time a sort of special time
 
01:30:03.850 --> 01:30:03.860 align:start position:0%
that we have our ability to work is
 
01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:07.670 align:start position:0%
severely compromised not only in point
 
01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:10.550 align:start position:0%
of time but in point of efficiency and
 
01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:12.530 align:start position:0%
ability to get together and really
 
01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:16.130 align:start position:0%
communicate there is no particular need
 
01:30:18.250 --> 01:30:18.260 align:start position:0%
to rush this bill through this is not a
 
01:30:22.090 --> 01:30:22.100 align:start position:0%
bill that is on the forefront of
 
01:30:24.490 --> 01:30:24.500 align:start position:0%
anybody's I mean it's certainly on the
 
01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:26.630 align:start position:0%
forefront of that sponsors but it's
 
01:30:29.230 --> 01:30:29.240 align:start position:0%
certainly not in the forefront of where
 
01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:32.270 align:start position:0%
we're going it can certainly wait and it
 
01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:36.410 align:start position:0%
can certainly be done in a good thorough
 
01:30:39.820 --> 01:30:39.830 align:start position:0%
way there's nothing more clear to me
 
01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:41.870 align:start position:0%
from this afternoon's conversation that
 
01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:44.870 align:start position:0%
this bill is in total disarray and I
 
01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:46.050 align:start position:0%
mean that
 
01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:48.270 align:start position:0%
is is gently and as nicely to all
 
01:30:50.569 --> 01:30:50.579 align:start position:0%
concerned as I possibly can express it
 
01:30:53.569 --> 01:30:53.579 align:start position:0%
but we are not close to working this
 
01:30:58.419 --> 01:30:58.429 align:start position:0%
thing out and it just seems to me that
 
01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:03.750 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not fruitful to beat our
 
01:31:05.629 --> 01:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
heads against the stone on this with the
 
01:31:07.780 --> 01:31:07.790 align:start position:0%
limited time and resources that we have
 
01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
now the second point that I want to get
 
01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:14.250 align:start position:0%
to is that what we're dealing here with
 
01:31:16.819 --> 01:31:16.829 align:start position:0%
is whether or not we will accept or
 
01:31:20.089 --> 01:31:20.099 align:start position:0%
reject the simple element of science
 
01:31:22.339 --> 01:31:22.349 align:start position:0%
this is not this bill has nothing to do
 
01:31:24.979 --> 01:31:24.989 align:start position:0%
with whether or not there are more or
 
01:31:27.250 --> 01:31:27.260 align:start position:0%
less cameras set up and more or less
 
01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:30.210 align:start position:0%
miles of film taken of people walking
 
01:31:32.839 --> 01:31:32.849 align:start position:0%
around the streets this is about the
 
01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:36.230 align:start position:0%
science of what you do with that
 
01:31:41.390 --> 01:31:41.400 align:start position:0%
information I want to contrast the
 
01:31:44.419 --> 01:31:44.429 align:start position:0%
science of facial recognition with the
 
01:31:46.549 --> 01:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
idea of somebody sitting in front of a
 
01:31:49.419 --> 01:31:49.429 align:start position:0%
TV screen after an eight-hour shift and
 
01:31:53.899 --> 01:31:53.909 align:start position:0%
making judgment about who's who we don't
 
01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:56.610 align:start position:0%
know we have no way of knowing based on
 
01:31:58.970 --> 01:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
the record we have in front of us who
 
01:32:01.580 --> 01:32:01.590 align:start position:0%
who is better equipped to do that and we
 
01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:03.150 align:start position:0%
aren't going to know that between now
 
01:32:07.729 --> 01:32:07.739 align:start position:0%
and June 11th or whatever later date
 
01:32:09.649 --> 01:32:09.659 align:start position:0%
this bill comes up
 
01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not I I listen to scientists I
 
01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:16.590 align:start position:0%
I'm not a scientist I respect them if
 
01:32:18.919 --> 01:32:18.929 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that can be made if this
 
01:32:21.049 --> 01:32:21.059 align:start position:0%
is a science that can be made better so
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
be it fair enough
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
you certainly if you're going to use a
 
01:32:26.799 --> 01:32:26.809 align:start position:0%
science you want it to be accurate I
 
01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
don't I don't favor the idea of blanket
 
01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:33.570 align:start position:0%
prohibition and then working against it
 
01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:35.730 align:start position:0%
I think we can do this right the first
 
01:32:38.270 --> 01:32:38.280 align:start position:0%
time we don't have to do it today and we
 
01:32:39.919 --> 01:32:39.929 align:start position:0%
don't have to do it a week from today or
 
01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:42.030 align:start position:0%
a month from today it can be done in a
 
01:32:44.629 --> 01:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
regular business in the regular way when
 
01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:48.050 align:start position:0%
we're all back to business as usual I
 
01:32:51.379 --> 01:32:51.389 align:start position:0%
just want to end by saying I'm reminded
 
01:32:56.689 --> 01:32:56.699 align:start position:0%
of the old maxim the Mary Mary in haste
 
01:32:59.870 --> 01:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
repent at leisure and I
 
01:33:01.850 --> 01:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
think we're in danger of marrying in
 
01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:04.230 align:start position:0%
haste if we go just jam this thing
 
01:33:04.230 --> 01:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
haste if we go just jam this thing
forward

01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:04.770 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:33:07.580 --> 01:33:07.590 align:start position:0%
as best we can so that's those are my
 
01:33:10.370 --> 01:33:10.380 align:start position:0%
thoughts Thanks Thank You representative
 
01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:13.830 align:start position:0%
a representative Bertrand thank you
 
01:33:15.370 --> 01:33:15.380 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
I'm an agreement with representative
 
01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:19.850 align:start position:0%
I'm an agreement with representative
Woodbury

01:33:19.850 --> 01:33:19.860 align:start position:0%
Woodbury
 
01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:21.210 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to repeat what he said
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
because better than I I do want to
 
01:33:29.810 --> 01:33:29.820 align:start position:0%
observe just in passing since this
 
01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:32.370 align:start position:0%
questions come up a couple times that
 
01:33:35.689 --> 01:33:35.699 align:start position:0%
the most recent information from what's
 
01:33:38.810 --> 01:33:38.820 align:start position:0%
referred to as NIST National Institute
 
01:33:41.570 --> 01:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
of Standards and Technology has found
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
that the error rate is 0.08 percent in
 
01:33:49.399 --> 01:33:49.409 align:start position:0%
the algorithm use as opposed to four
 
01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:51.330 align:start position:0%
point one percent just a few years ago
 
01:33:55.189 --> 01:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
so the accuracy of the system has just
 
01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:01.370 align:start position:0%
skyrocketed courts have notoriously been
 
01:34:03.410 --> 01:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
notoriously the wrong where courts
 
01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:08.270 align:start position:0%
always pay attention to technology and
 
01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:10.830 align:start position:0%
should it be admissible or should it not
 
01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:12.650 align:start position:0%
be we have what's called the Dover test
 
01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:16.530 align:start position:0%
courts routinely evaluate whether
 
01:34:19.729 --> 01:34:19.739 align:start position:0%
technology is good technology or bad
 
01:34:21.950 --> 01:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
that's what they do every day of the
 
01:34:25.070 --> 01:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
week I the problem I have
 
01:34:27.709 --> 01:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
which representative Woodbury didn't
 
01:34:30.770 --> 01:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
mention is the difficulty built into
 
01:34:35.689 --> 01:34:35.699 align:start position:0%
this bill with any further legislative
 
01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:40.350 align:start position:0%
or court evaluation of facial
 
01:34:42.620 --> 01:34:42.630 align:start position:0%
recognition technology should we pass
 
01:34:45.379 --> 01:34:45.389 align:start position:0%
this bill there are two provisions one
 
01:34:48.970 --> 01:34:48.980 align:start position:0%
provision says any evidence collected
 
01:34:51.979 --> 01:34:51.989 align:start position:0%
relative to this program has to be
 
01:34:55.550 --> 01:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
immediately destroyed and then further
 
01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:00.150 align:start position:0%
commissioned say that no legislative
 
01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:06.750 align:start position:0%
committee nor court can utilize any data
 
01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:10.590 align:start position:0%
information or evidence derived from
 
01:35:13.490 --> 01:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
facial recognition technology so
 
01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:17.930 align:start position:0%
we wanted to evaluate two years from now
 
01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:21.210 align:start position:0%
is this program a good program is it a
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
bad program how does it work how is it
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
not we're gonna have a hard time as a
 
01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
legislative committee if this passes
 
01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:31.590 align:start position:0%
being able to deal with any data so I
 
01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:35.130 align:start position:0%
think this bill should be ITL and if
 
01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:38.010 align:start position:0%
it's taken up next year then fine it's
 
01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:41.130 align:start position:0%
also not an emergency covin related bill
 
01:35:43.130 --> 01:35:43.140 align:start position:0%
which I think what we're supposed to be
 
01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:46.530 align:start position:0%
trying to focus on on that last point I
 
01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:48.270 align:start position:0%
guess I would like to disagree with you
 
01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:53.190 align:start position:0%
and that is that I look back to what
 
01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:56.490 align:start position:0%
happened after 9/11 and I look back to
 
01:35:59.360 --> 01:35:59.370 align:start position:0%
the Patriot Act and I look back to how
 
01:36:02.210 --> 01:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
many of our civil liberties were
 
01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:06.450 align:start position:0%
willingly given up because of the
 
01:36:09.110 --> 01:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
emergency of the moment and I believe
 
01:36:13.250 --> 01:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
that we are in the same period where
 
01:36:16.130 --> 01:36:16.140 align:start position:0%
many of our civil liberties are going to
 
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
be challenged whether it's with facial
 
01:36:21.890 --> 01:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
recognition or something else they're
 
01:36:23.690 --> 01:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
going to be challenged we're going to be
 
01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:26.810 align:start position:0%
asked to agree to do things that
 
01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:30.210 align:start position:0%
philosophically I find offensive and
 
01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:32.250 align:start position:0%
then I actually think a number of you
 
01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
would would find offensive and that was
 
01:36:38.630 --> 01:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
why I thought it was very important that
 
01:36:41.570 --> 01:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
the committee have a chance to look at
 
01:36:46.130 --> 01:36:46.140 align:start position:0%
this bill and not because I knew where
 
01:36:49.180 --> 01:36:49.190 align:start position:0%
we would come out but because of
 
01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:52.110 align:start position:0%
believing that we have consistently
 
01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
tried to be sensitive to our role to
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
respect civil rights and civil and civil
 
01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:02.100 align:start position:0%
liberties I have listened carefully to
 
01:37:05.290 --> 01:37:05.300 align:start position:0%
what everyone has said I believe the
 
01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:07.950 align:start position:0%
exigencies of the time make it very very
 
01:37:11.810 --> 01:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
difficult for us to find a way to thread
 
01:37:16.570 --> 01:37:16.580 align:start position:0%
the needle to find what is the narrowest
 
01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:19.350 align:start position:0%
protection that we could put in
 
01:37:22.190 --> 01:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
legislation not to have it be too
 
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
expansive but but to have it important
 
01:37:27.260 --> 01:37:27.270 align:start position:0%
and I don't
 
01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:29.970 align:start position:0%
away for the committee to do that so
 
01:37:33.410 --> 01:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
while I think this is the time and I
 
01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:35.850 align:start position:0%
think the issue is incredibly important
 
01:37:38.690 --> 01:37:38.700 align:start position:0%
and I thank the prime sponsor for
 
01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:42.060 align:start position:0%
bringing the bill both through a DNA and
 
01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:46.650 align:start position:0%
to us now I personally don't see a way
 
01:37:53.410 --> 01:37:53.420 align:start position:0%
for the committee to get to yes and I
 
01:38:00.170 --> 01:38:00.180 align:start position:0%
guess what I would we do have we do have
 
01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:02.490 align:start position:0%
an executive session scheduled for 10
 
01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:04.410 align:start position:0%
o'clock on the 28th and I'm going to
 
01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:07.730 align:start position:0%
keep that because we're not voting today
 
01:38:13.900 --> 01:38:13.910 align:start position:0%
what I would like to propose is that we
 
01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:19.770 align:start position:0%
end this work session that if there are
 
01:38:23.690 --> 01:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
individuals or a number of people on the
 
01:38:26.450 --> 01:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
committee and those who aren't on the
 
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
committee who might want to but it would
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
not be people on the committee who would
 
01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
submit an amendment to see if there is a
 
01:38:38.150 --> 01:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
way that we could get to yes then this
 
01:38:40.730 --> 01:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
gives you 10 days to do it to do an
 
01:38:42.890 --> 01:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
amendment to propose to get to OLS and
 
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:46.010 align:start position:0%
time for them to do it and it might be
 
01:38:50.030 --> 01:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
that with Gary and others we might be
 
01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:53.970 align:start position:0%
able to find some small piece that makes
 
01:38:59.530 --> 01:38:59.540 align:start position:0%
sense and so my proposal would be that
 
01:39:02.330 --> 01:39:02.340 align:start position:0%
if the majority of the committee agree
 
01:39:05.540 --> 01:39:05.550 align:start position:0%
we end the work session now we come back
 
01:39:07.940 --> 01:39:07.950 align:start position:0%
at 10:00 a.m. on the 28th for an
 
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
executive session where we may or may
 
01:39:16.970 --> 01:39:16.980 align:start position:0%
not have an amendment to consider does
 
01:39:21.770 --> 01:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
that make sense to the group can you
 
01:39:27.149 --> 01:39:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:30.959 --> 01:39:30.969 align:start position:0%
I don't see thank you Gary I was looking
 
01:39:34.949 --> 01:39:34.959 align:start position:0%
for that I don't see another way and I
 
01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:36.130 align:start position:0%
don't know if we would have had a
 
01:39:38.459 --> 01:39:38.469 align:start position:0%
different outcome if we weren't sitting
 
01:39:40.799 --> 01:39:40.809 align:start position:0%
in 25 different locations without the
 
01:39:44.909 --> 01:39:44.919 align:start position:0%
ability to see each other to be in the
 
01:39:47.759 --> 01:39:47.769 align:start position:0%
same room to check body language to be
 
01:39:50.819 --> 01:39:50.829 align:start position:0%
informal all of that is missing from the
 
01:39:53.509 --> 01:39:53.519 align:start position:0%
great work that this committee does and
 
01:39:59.819 --> 01:39:59.829 align:start position:0%
this isn't the time for us to to do
 
01:40:02.909 --> 01:40:02.919 align:start position:0%
something that isn't that we don't all
 
01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:08.530 align:start position:0%
feel is right so if there no objections
 
01:40:15.509 --> 01:40:15.519 align:start position:0%
I would I would close well before I do
 
01:40:16.859 --> 01:40:16.869 align:start position:0%
that if there are people who are
 
01:40:20.399 --> 01:40:20.409 align:start position:0%
listening who would like to continue to
 
01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:23.050 align:start position:0%
either contact the entire committee or
 
01:40:26.189 --> 01:40:26.199 align:start position:0%
to contact one or two people on the
 
01:40:28.830 --> 01:40:28.840 align:start position:0%
committee to see about maybe if come up
 
01:40:31.549 --> 01:40:31.559 align:start position:0%
with something that would make sense I
 
01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:35.110 align:start position:0%
would urge everybody to do it
 
01:40:37.770 --> 01:40:37.780 align:start position:0%
we have almost this whole week it would
 
01:40:40.350 --> 01:40:40.360 align:start position:0%
I think probably be necessary if there
 
01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:44.050 align:start position:0%
is an amendment to have it go to OLS by
 
01:40:48.299 --> 01:40:48.309 align:start position:0%
Monday morning so they can have they
 
01:40:50.339 --> 01:40:50.349 align:start position:0%
need three days basically and they might
 
01:40:52.709 --> 01:40:52.719 align:start position:0%
need a little bit more to do the
 
01:40:54.810 --> 01:40:54.820 align:start position:0%
amendment and to get it out to the
 
01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
public so this is not the way I wanted
 
01:41:05.129 --> 01:41:05.139 align:start position:0%
to end our work and I don't know if
 
01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:06.610 align:start position:0%
we're ever going to have a chance to
 
01:41:09.330 --> 01:41:09.340 align:start position:0%
come back again and I'm not going to cry
 
01:41:12.750 --> 01:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
about it because they're more important
 
01:41:16.409 --> 01:41:16.419 align:start position:0%
things to cry about but if everybody's
 
01:41:22.589 --> 01:41:22.599 align:start position:0%
okay then I adjourn this and I will look
 
01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:27.130 align:start position:0%
forward to seeing all of you on the on
 
01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:30.070 align:start position:0%
the 28th of 10:00 and I cannot thank you
 
01:41:34.729 --> 01:41:34.739 align:start position:0%
enough for slogging through this for
 
01:41:37.469 --> 01:41:37.479 align:start position:0%
participating as well as you have it for
 
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
this to go as smoothly as it could go
 
01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
under these difficult circumstances
 
01:41:45.419 --> 01:41:45.429 align:start position:0%
so I will see you on the 24th Rosie
 
01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:47.230 align:start position:0%
there's there were two hands did you
 
01:41:50.250 --> 01:41:50.260 align:start position:0%
want to recognize them or no no I think
