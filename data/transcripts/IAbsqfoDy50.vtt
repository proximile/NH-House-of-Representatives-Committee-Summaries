00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
other revenues today in terms of making
 
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
any projections on the need to bring
 
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:10.980 align:start position:0%
anybody else back at a future date or
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
whatever else the committee might need
 
00:09:14.449 --> 00:09:14.459 align:start position:0%
and question for you so that the
 
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
presentation today the numbers that
 
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
she's giving us you're going to have
 
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
populated in that spreadsheet no no not
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
today no I will it will be at a future
 
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:26.220 align:start position:0%
date so excellent everything's moving
 
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
quickly for the Department as well as
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
our office so I didn't have an
 
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get it into the worksheet
 
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:34.500 align:start position:0%
for today but we don't yeah the whole
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
point is we don't have to take notes and
 
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
enter it into a spreadsheet ourselves
 
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:40.140 align:start position:0%
nope you you you can only I mean I'll
 
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
give you the worksheet if you want it um
 
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
if you want to take notes but you're
 
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
going to get a new one that's going to
 
00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
have the dra ranges on it you're going
 
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
to have the worksheet from dra today
 
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
that you may want to you know make some
 
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.430 align:start position:0%
that you may want to you know make some
notes

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
notes
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
um but yeah I think you should be fine
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
listening today when she's speaking and
 
00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
then you know addressing the questions
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
to who or that you have as it relates to
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
the various revenues excellent but I
 
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:03.660 align:start position:0%
think we're trying to make it very
 
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
straightforward for you yeah thank you
 
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair members of the
 
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
committee Lindsey stepp commissioner New
 
00:10:15.769 --> 00:10:15.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Revenue
 
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:17.940 align:start position:0%
Administration hopefully you're not
 
00:10:22.009 --> 00:10:22.019 align:start position:0%
tired of seeing me yet
 
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
no we really have been looking forward
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
to this actually because you're the nuts
 
00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839 align:start position:0%
and bolts of what we do so
 
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
all right so what you should have in
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
front of you as Chris mentioned is a
 
00:10:33.889 --> 00:10:33.899 align:start position:0%
10-page document that
 
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
I will go through with you this morning
 
00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:38.870 align:start position:0%
I will go through with you this morning
um

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:42.180 align:start position:0%
when we are assisting the Committees
 
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:44.700 align:start position:0%
with and the LBA with producing the
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates as I've mentioned
 
00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:50.459 align:start position:0%
previously we determine the base which
 
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
in this case will be fiscal year 2023
 
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
and then we look at growth rates
 
00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
year-over-year growth rates for 24 and
 
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
25. so we'll talk numbers for 23 and
 
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:03.660 align:start position:0%
then we'll talk growth rates for 24 and
 
00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:06.779 align:start position:0%
25. I've tried to keep it as simple as
 
00:11:06.779 --> 00:11:08.750 align:start position:0%
25. I've tried to keep it as simple as
possible

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:09.650 align:start position:0%
possible
um

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:09.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:12.660 align:start position:0%
to be determined if I was successful but
 
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:14.700 align:start position:0%
we will you know we'll spend as much
 
00:11:17.449 --> 00:11:17.459 align:start position:0%
time as you all need and get you as much
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
information as you're required to get
 
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
through this process
 
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
so starting on page one
 
00:11:26.569 --> 00:11:26.579 align:start position:0%
um we have developed fiscal year 23
 
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
through 25 Revenue estimate ranges for
 
00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
the major taxes that dra administers so
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
that's the business taxes the meals and
 
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
rentals tax tobacco tax interest and
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
dividends tax communication Services tax
 
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax and utility
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
the estimates were calculated by
 
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
adjusting fiscal year 23 Revenue based
 
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
on currently available data through
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
January expected monthly revenues and
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
considering the impacts of tax law
 
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.110 align:start position:0%
considering the impacts of tax law
changes

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:56.700 align:start position:0%
lastly as you can guess these estimates
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
are subject to change we will update
 
00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.870 align:start position:0%
are subject to change we will update
them

00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
each month when the final revenue for
 
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
the month is determined
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
and I'd also say these estimates are
 
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
probably wrong there are estimates but
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
we do our best to make them as accurate
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:16.820 align:start position:0%
so when we're determining fiscal year 23
 
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
the range that we use for the base we do
 
00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
that based on five different scenarios
 
00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
that you'll see on page one so the first
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
scenario is plan if Revenue was just
 
00:12:29.449 --> 00:12:29.459 align:start position:0%
equal to plan
 
00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
the second scenario takes actual
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
year-to-date Revenue through January the
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
first seven months and assumes plan
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
revenue for the last five months of 23
 
00:12:41.449 --> 00:12:41.459 align:start position:0%
based on the general and education trust
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
fund plan that the department of
 
00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
administrative Services produces
 
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
the third scenario takes actual revenue
 
00:12:50.449 --> 00:12:50.459 align:start position:0%
for the first seven months and we look
 
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
at what our percent difference from plan
 
00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
has been year to date and we assume that
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
that percentage difference will maintain
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
for the last five months so we're
 
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
currently 20 ahead of plan we assume
 
00:13:04.009 --> 00:13:04.019 align:start position:0%
that we'll remain 20 ahead of plan for
 
00:13:06.769 --> 00:13:06.779 align:start position:0%
the the remaining five months
 
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
the fourth scenario takes actual revenue
 
00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
for the first seven months of 23 and
 
00:13:13.009 --> 00:13:13.019 align:start position:0%
looks at the percentage difference
 
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
compared to Prior year so for 15 ahead
 
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
of Prior year we assume we will remain
 
00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:21.180 align:start position:0%
15 ahead of Prior year for the remaining
 
00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:22.740 align:start position:0%
five months
 
00:13:24.889 --> 00:13:24.899 align:start position:0%
and then the last scenario takes Revenue
 
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
to date for the first seven months and
 
00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
looks at what revenue for the last five
 
00:13:30.889 --> 00:13:30.899 align:start position:0%
months was in the immediate prior year
 
00:13:34.129 --> 00:13:34.139 align:start position:0%
so in this case in fiscal 22 and we just
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
add that to the revenue that we've
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
received to date
 
00:13:39.949 --> 00:13:39.959 align:start position:0%
we take these five scenarios and that's
 
00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
what we use to determine the ranges for
 
00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
23. we run all of the scenarios but
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
we're only going to present to you those
 
00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
that we feel are actually likely so for
 
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
instance with business taxes we are
 
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
significantly ahead of plan so the first
 
00:13:57.889 --> 00:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
scenario of just Revenue equaling plan
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
is very unlikely so we're not even going
 
00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
to give that to you as an option we ran
 
00:14:03.889 --> 00:14:03.899 align:start position:0%
the scenario we know what it looks like
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
but it's just not realistic so we
 
00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
basically take those five scenarios and
 
00:14:10.129 --> 00:14:10.139 align:start position:0%
say okay based on what we know what do
 
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
we feel like are likely high and low
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
ranges for what we'll see for 23. what
 
00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
we'll do in this presentation is we'll
 
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
just go tax by tax we will
 
00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:22.139 align:start position:0%
talk about the factors that we're
 
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
looking at or that we considered as part
 
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:27.180 align:start position:0%
of determining the ranges for 23 and
 
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
then the factors that we use to
 
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
determine the ranges for 24 and 25.
 
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
any questions on these scenarios that we
 
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
representative alming
 
00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering whether in a year like
 
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
we've got now if it would
 
00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:54.740 align:start position:0%
actually make a difference or be useful
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
if we also looked at the actual revenue
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
of seven months
 
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:04.740 align:start position:0%
of and
 
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:08.220 align:start position:0%
and the percentage
 
00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:10.569 align:start position:0%
and the percentage
above

00:15:10.569 --> 00:15:10.579 align:start position:0%
above
 
00:15:14.569 --> 00:15:14.579 align:start position:0%
prior Year from the last three months
 
00:15:14.579 --> 00:15:17.629 align:start position:0%
prior Year from the last three months
only

00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
so if we did
 
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
the first seven months year to date and
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
we applied the percent versus prior year
 
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:33.660 align:start position:0%
for the for the last three months what
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
would you want for an estimate for the
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
two months that are missing because we
 
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:39.660 align:start position:0%
need to estimate five more months of
 
00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.329 align:start position:0%
need to estimate five more months of
Revenue

00:15:41.329 --> 00:15:41.339 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:58.009 --> 00:15:58.019 align:start position:0%
oh cool a single percentage for those
 
00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:02.339 align:start position:0%
five months based on the three months
 
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:05.820 align:start position:0%
just to see if we're if we are slowing
 
00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I understand
 
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:16.740 align:start position:0%
how we would do that so
 
00:16:20.569 --> 00:16:20.579 align:start position:0%
right now what we've done in the
 
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
year-over-year growth scenario is we've
 
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:25.740 align:start position:0%
taken the seven months
 
00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
we've said that there are for instance
 
00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
20 percent ahead of Prior year and we've
 
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
applied that 20 percent growth to the
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
prior year actuals
 
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
if you only wanted to apply that growth
 
00:16:43.129 --> 00:16:43.139 align:start position:0%
to the last three months of the prior
 
00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:44.749 align:start position:0%
to the last three months of the prior
year

00:16:44.749 --> 00:16:44.759 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:16:47.449 --> 00:16:47.459 align:start position:0%
that would still leave a gap of two
 
00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:49.079 align:start position:0%
months because we need to estimate five
 
00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:52.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
we can't take the prior year of the five
 
00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:01.079 align:start position:0%
months times the increase
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
in the previous three months
 
00:17:05.809 --> 00:17:05.819 align:start position:0%
I understand what you're saying now so
 
00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:07.799 align:start position:0%
you're saying rather than taking year to
 
00:17:07.799 --> 00:17:08.770 align:start position:0%
you're saying rather than taking year to
date

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:08.780 align:start position:0%
date
 
00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
growth over prior year just take the
 
00:17:14.929 --> 00:17:14.939 align:start position:0%
last three months of growth
 
00:17:17.689 --> 00:17:17.699 align:start position:0%
compared to Prior year we can run that
 
00:17:17.699 --> 00:17:19.429 align:start position:0%
compared to Prior year we can run that
scenario

00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
scenario
 
00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:20.569 align:start position:0%
scenario
just

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:20.579 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:23.220 align:start position:0%
see what it looks like yeah more current
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
trends representative yes thank you
 
00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:27.959 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking my
 
00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:30.059 align:start position:0%
question Mr steppe
 
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
um do you have any scenarios showing
 
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
business taxes correlated with grocery
 
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
see when we get to the business attack
 
00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
Slide part of the
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
um one of the things we looked at in
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
terms of determining growth rates for
 
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal 24 and 25 was GDP anticipated GDP
 
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
growth in the past we have looked at a
 
00:17:57.289 --> 00:17:57.299 align:start position:0%
correlation between business taxes and
 
00:17:59.090 --> 00:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
state GDP
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
um total U.S GDP and we didn't find a
 
00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:06.179 align:start position:0%
very strong correlation I think it can
 
00:18:09.289 --> 00:18:09.299 align:start position:0%
inform your decision but it's not an
 
00:18:12.169 --> 00:18:12.179 align:start position:0%
exact correlation so we have not done
 
00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:15.260 align:start position:0%
that because based on historical data
 
00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
the strength of the correlation just
 
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
wasn't there if that makes sense but
 
00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:20.460 align:start position:0%
instead we kind of use it to inform the
 
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative again thank you madam
 
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.130 align:start position:0%
representative again thank you madam
chair

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:28.140 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
um back to representative almi's uh
 
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
point about the last three months I
 
00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
guess my concern slash question would be
 
00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
typically aren't the last three months
 
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
of a year pretty strong because
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
Christmas season is coming up spending
 
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:44.220 align:start position:0%
is higher and so we might actually that
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
actually might be higher than if you go
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
back five months
 
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
that's a good point and we
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
um did do somewhat of a version of of
 
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
that of the scenario that representative
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
Ami is describing with the real estate
 
00:18:59.330 --> 00:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
transfer tax because and we'll talk
 
00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:01.740 align:start position:0%
about that when we get there but
 
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
um the the growth in the real estate
 
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
transfer tax has been very different
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
over the last two months January and
 
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
February has been much slower than the
 
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
prior months of the fiscal year and so
 
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
we did account for it in that scenario
 
00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
um so to answer your question
 
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:19.740 align:start position:0%
representative Negan I think we would
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
want to consider it on a tax by tax
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
basis to see what makes sense so we can
 
00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
certainly run the scenarios and then we
 
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
can say it makes sense for this tax but
 
00:19:33.049 --> 00:19:33.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:33.059 --> 00:19:35.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:19:40.029 --> 00:19:40.039 align:start position:0%
okay on slide two page two
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
there is a list of adjustments that need
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
to be applied to fiscal 23 through 25
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
Revenue to account for various tax law
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
changes that are not fully accounted for
 
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
in the revenues that we've received so
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
these are changes that are existing in
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
current law
 
00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
pending legislation as we talked about
 
00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
on Monday will be included as Surplus
 
00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
statement items that the LBA will take
 
00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
care of so we don't need to right now
 
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
think about any of the bills that are
 
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
currently before this committee or other
 
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
committees in terms of their revenue
 
00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:17.220 align:start position:0%
impact Chris will work his magic on the
 
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
back end with those but what we do need
 
00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
to account for is changes that are
 
00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
existing in current law for which we
 
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
believe there will be an impact to
 
00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:28.740 align:start position:0%
revenue and we haven't seen that impact
 
00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.230 align:start position:0%
revenue and we haven't seen that impact
yet

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
so for business taxes there are four
 
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:35.220 align:start position:0%
items here
 
00:20:39.049 --> 00:20:39.059 align:start position:0%
um there were rate changes in hb2 from
 
00:20:39.059 --> 00:20:40.789 align:start position:0%
um there were rate changes in hb2 from
2021

00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
2021
 
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
and there is a rate change in 2022 HB
 
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:47.660 align:start position:0%
1221 so that's the first and third line
 
00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
on the business tax under business taxes
 
00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:56.700 align:start position:0%
so we will account for those in fiscal
 
00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.470 align:start position:0%
so we will account for those in fiscal
2024

00:20:59.470 --> 00:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
2024
 
00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:03.660 align:start position:0%
for hb2 credit carryover cap you'll see
 
00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:05.940 align:start position:0%
an amount in each of the three years
 
00:21:09.409 --> 00:21:09.419 align:start position:0%
that is the result of that 500 percent
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
cap that businesses will that will be
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
enforced on businesses in terms of their
 
00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:17.820 align:start position:0%
credit carryover for fiscal 23 that will
 
00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:19.740 align:start position:0%
likely come in the form of refunds
 
00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
starting in March and April so you see
 
00:21:26.029 --> 00:21:26.039 align:start position:0%
that 11 million dollars for fiscal 23 it
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
increases in 24 to 13.5 and then tails
 
00:21:33.529 --> 00:21:33.539 align:start position:0%
off in 25 to 3.8 million
 
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
and then the last change under business
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
taxes um was the result of a bill passed
 
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
last session Senate Bill 435 which
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
changes how net operating losses are
 
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
calculated for businesses and so that
 
00:21:48.529 --> 00:21:48.539 align:start position:0%
has an 8.6 million dollar impact in 23
 
00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
and then a 2.1 impact in 24.
 
00:21:56.049 --> 00:21:56.059 align:start position:0%
in total we're looking at a reduction of
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
19.6 million for business taxes in 23 25
 
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
million in 24 and 3.8 million in 25 so
 
00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
what we'll do is we'll estimate the
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
revenues and then we'll just take these
 
00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
off the bottom
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
the other change that we need to account
 
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
for is with the interest and dividends
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
tax this is the phase out the reduction
 
00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
in the IND tax rate that will be 6.3
 
00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
million this year 22.2 million next year
 
00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
and 23.4 million in 25. you'll see all
 
00:22:28.909 --> 00:22:28.919 align:start position:0%
of these these adjustments accounted for
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
in each of the taxes but I wanted to
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
provide them here as well so we could
 
00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:42.059 align:start position:0%
oh sorry representative thank you on I
 
00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:43.740 align:start position:0%
sometimes have trouble when I look at
 
00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
these things
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
the amount the taxes would go down
 
00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
each year and so their cumulative you
 
00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
have to add them together to get to the
 
00:22:59.570 --> 00:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
effect in 25. correct so these are
 
00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
what's listed here is year over year
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
changes because that's how we're
 
00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
estimating the revenue so we will
 
00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
determine the revenue apply the
 
00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
adjustment we will grow the revenue and
 
00:23:12.409 --> 00:23:12.419 align:start position:0%
apply the year-over-year change that's
 
00:23:12.419 --> 00:23:16.549 align:start position:0%
apply the year-over-year change that's
correct

00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:21.169 --> 00:23:21.179 align:start position:0%
okay okay so at the bottom of page two
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
considering the various scenarios and
 
00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
adjusting for the tax law changes that
 
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
are at the top of the page the dra
 
00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
determine the following ranges for
 
00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23 revenues again we'll walk
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
through these tax by tax on the
 
00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
remaining slides in the First Column
 
00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
you'll see the fiscal 23 plan
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
in the second and third columns you will
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
see our high and low ranges
 
00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
and then in the last columns you'll see
 
00:23:47.149 --> 00:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
how those ranges compare to plan so for
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
instance for business taxes we have a
 
00:23:54.049 --> 00:23:54.059 align:start position:0%
range of 1 billion 219 million 500 000
 
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
to 1 billion two hundred and fifty Seven
 
00:23:59.810 --> 00:23:59.820 align:start position:0%
million one hundred thousand and the low
 
00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.330 align:start position:0%
million one hundred thousand and the low
is

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:01.340 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
261.7 million ahead of plan or 27
 
00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:06.860 align:start position:0%
percent and the high is
 
00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
299.3 million or 31 ahead of plan
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
so this is just kind of a snapshot of
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
what our estimates look like in terms of
 
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:24.780 align:start position:0%
representative only has a question thank
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
you on
 
00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:30.470 align:start position:0%
you on
this

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
oh dear I
 
00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
have a chat heading out of my head
 
00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:39.649 align:start position:0%
have a chat heading out of my head
um

00:24:39.649 --> 00:24:39.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
yeah we can come back
 
00:24:45.529 --> 00:24:45.539 align:start position:0%
representative ulery yeah just
 
00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
just very briefly
 
00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.590 align:start position:0%
just very briefly
um

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:53.149 --> 00:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about playing you're
 
00:24:57.169 --> 00:24:57.179 align:start position:0%
talking about an estimate you're not
 
00:24:59.810 --> 00:24:59.820 align:start position:0%
talking about real money number one
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
number two
 
00:25:04.909 --> 00:25:04.919 align:start position:0%
when like to did today's Revenue came
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
out 58 Bill a million below plan that
 
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:10.980 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean anything
 
00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:14.470 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean anything
correct

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:17.460 align:start position:0%
that's a great point so
 
00:25:21.049 --> 00:25:21.059 align:start position:0%
um plan is that it is an estimate and
 
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
notably this estimate was done two years
 
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
ago so this was done in January through
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
June of 21. uh there was a lot of
 
00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
uncertainty uh during that time and so
 
00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:36.900 align:start position:0%
these plan numbers
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
um really were
 
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
the best information that the dra and
 
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
the legislature had at the time and they
 
00:25:45.169 --> 00:25:45.179 align:start position:0%
were anticipating a potential Fallout of
 
00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
revenues and they are very consistent
 
00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
with what plan was for a number of other
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
states revenues have performed better in
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of cases and so that's why you'll
 
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
see this pretty significant especially
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
with business taxes deviation from plan
 
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
in Prior years when we did not have
 
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
Global pandemics Etc and revenues were a
 
00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:08.820 align:start position:0%
little bit more normal you would see
 
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
plan and actuals closer together
 
00:26:14.649 --> 00:26:14.659 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:17.700 align:start position:0%
revenues that you see in our daily
 
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
revenue reports we are only just barely
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
at the midpoint of the month this is
 
00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:26.700 align:start position:0%
when we start reporting revenues to you
 
00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
so you can see where we are
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
um at this point in the month however to
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
representative uluri's point
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
it really isn't it's nothing to panic
 
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
about just yet you'll see revenues
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
continue to come in especially over the
 
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
next few days it's really not until we
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
get to the last few days of the month
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
that things kind of Trail off so it's
 
00:26:48.769 --> 00:26:48.779 align:start position:0%
really just meant to be informative not
 
00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:52.260 align:start position:0%
meant to spark any significant concerns
 
00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:53.700 align:start position:0%
at this point in the month and if there
 
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
was a reason for a significant concern I
 
00:26:57.409 --> 00:26:57.419 align:start position:0%
would let you know
 
00:26:57.419 --> 00:27:00.430 align:start position:0%
would let you know
foreign

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you I thought of my question on
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
take take the business taxes for
 
00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:10.919 align:start position:0%
instance on the credit carry over cap as
 
00:27:15.289 --> 00:27:15.299 align:start position:0%
you're calling calling in on why would a
 
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:19.740 align:start position:0%
business not on in
 
00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
March April on
 
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.289 align:start position:0%
March April on
just

00:27:24.289 --> 00:27:24.299 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of money that they had
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
to send you
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
instead of taking a refund
 
00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
um they may so there's really two ways
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
that this CCO cap could be felt in terms
 
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
of the impact on revenues if businesses
 
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
adjusted their estimates knowing that a
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
certain portion of the amount of credit
 
00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
that they had on on account was in
 
00:27:54.529 --> 00:27:54.539 align:start position:0%
excess of what they were going to be
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
able to keep they could essentially
 
00:27:58.490 --> 00:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
reduce their estimated payments and Via
 
00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:01.140 align:start position:0%
reduced estimates use up a portion of
 
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
their credit carry forward
 
00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:05.700 align:start position:0%
that's essentially foregone Revenue it's
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
Revenue that we just wouldn't receive in
 
00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
the course of processing the estimates
 
00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:13.860 align:start position:0%
if a business does not do that when they
 
00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
get to filing their return in March and
 
00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.090 align:start position:0%
get to filing their return in March and
April

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
April
 
00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:19.380 align:start position:0%
the return will essentially calculate
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
for them that they have exceeded their
 
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
CCO cap and will force them to take a
 
00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
refund for the excess amount
 
00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:29.820 align:start position:0%
those we will obviously pay out in
 
00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
refunds the reason why we're showing 11
 
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
million dollar impact in 23 is because
 
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing is that not all
 
00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:41.220 align:start position:0%
businesses have reflected the CCO cap in
 
00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
their estimated payments so we are
 
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
anticipating that this CCO cap will
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
result in a refund the reason why I
 
00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
think a number of businesses have not
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
accounted for this cap in their
 
00:28:57.289 --> 00:28:57.299 align:start position:0%
estimates is one the majority of our
 
00:28:59.390 --> 00:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
businesses with large credit carryovers
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
are large multinational businesses
 
00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:05.220 align:start position:0%
um I believe New Hampshire is the only
 
00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
state that has this sort of cap on a
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
credit carryover and so it's probably
 
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
something that's just not on the
 
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
businesses radar that's not something
 
00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:16.740 align:start position:0%
that they are actively planning for so
 
00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:19.140 align:start position:0%
instead it will just result as a refund
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
on their return
 
00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
00:29:23.159 --> 00:29:25.190 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
representative

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
um most of it okay
 
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
yeah but there won't be any way for us
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
to really tell that that's why they
 
00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:38.039 align:start position:0%
reduce their estimates next time or
 
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
whatever correct correct I mean we can
 
00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:44.820 align:start position:0%
um look at the the individual taxpayers
 
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
with the large credit carryovers and try
 
00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:50.039 align:start position:0%
to see if they've accounted for it in
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
their estimates but again
 
00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
um a reduction in their estimate just
 
00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
may be a reduction because that's the
 
00:29:57.649 --> 00:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
trend of their business and not a direct
 
00:29:59.930 --> 00:29:59.940 align:start position:0%
reflection of the potential cap on the
 
00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.130 align:start position:0%
reflection of the potential cap on the
CCO

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:01.140 align:start position:0%
CCO
 
00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
the other thing I will mention though
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
is that as we move through the remaining
 
00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:10.380 align:start position:0%
five months of fiscal 23
 
00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
these numbers in that column for
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
adjustments may change so if we get to
 
00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:20.940 align:start position:0%
March and April and we feel like we have
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
seen the impact of the CCO we won't have
 
00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:26.940 align:start position:0%
that 11 million dollars there anymore so
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
we are actively watching these
 
00:30:30.889 --> 00:30:30.899 align:start position:0%
adjustments to make sure that they are
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
in fact not accounted for in Revenue
 
00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
received to date if we get to a point
 
00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
where we believe the revenue received to
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
date does reflect this tax law change
 
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
this adjustment would would be removed
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
so we're kind of reevaluating it on an
 
00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
ongoing basis representative Southworth
 
00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:49.980 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question but
 
00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:51.659 align:start position:0%
either way you're going to see the
 
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
credit carryovers go down correct which
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
was our goal correct so no matter which
 
00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
way they do it you can track that
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
they're going down the way they're
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
supposed to correct okay thank you
 
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
and so you think you would see that
 
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
Trend in March April
 
00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
we would see in March and April the if
 
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
returns are filed granted they could
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
also be filed on extension and not come
 
00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:13.860 align:start position:0%
into the fall but if they're filed
 
00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
timely in March and April we would there
 
00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:18.539 align:start position:0%
is a line on the return where that CCO
 
00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
cap is applied so we would see it
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
to Representatives HealthWorks point we
 
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.470 align:start position:0%
to Representatives HealthWorks point we
will

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:31:30.649 --> 00:31:30.659 align:start position:0%
see that the cap has impacted certain
 
00:31:33.529 --> 00:31:33.539 align:start position:0%
businesses with large ccos
 
00:31:36.769 --> 00:31:36.779 align:start position:0%
it is likely to reduce the overall CCO
 
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
pool but there's also the potential that
 
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
there are other businesses that didn't
 
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
have a CCO that start generating a CCO
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
that may cause the total to stay at
 
00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:49.740 align:start position:0%
higher amounts I don't think it's until
 
00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
we get to the 250 and the 100 cap that
 
00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
will really start to see a significant
 
00:32:00.049 --> 00:32:00.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:00.059 --> 00:32:02.570 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:02.580 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
so we're going to dive right into
 
00:32:06.169 --> 00:32:06.179 align:start position:0%
business taxes
 
00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:08.039 align:start position:0%
on page three we're going to rip off the
 
00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:18.289 --> 00:32:18.299 align:start position:0%
okay so I will note that at this point
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
in the revenue estimating process we
 
00:32:24.049 --> 00:32:24.059 align:start position:0%
estimate business taxes as a whole we
 
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:26.220 align:start position:0%
don't need to worry about splitting out
 
00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:29.580 align:start position:0%
business taxes between bet and BPT Chris
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
and I will work on that as we get
 
00:32:33.769 --> 00:32:33.779 align:start position:0%
further along in the process so right
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
now we're just going to talk business
 
00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
taxes as a whole
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
factors to consider fiscal year to date
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
we are 146.5 million or 33 percent I had
 
00:32:48.889 --> 00:32:48.899 align:start position:0%
a plan and we are 26.1 million or 4.7
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
percent ahead of Prior year
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
we talked about the tax law changes and
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
I'll show you in in the chart below
 
00:32:58.250 --> 00:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
where we take those into account we
 
00:32:59.630 --> 00:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
talked about during the various
 
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
presentations the impact on inflation
 
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
um how that raises prices may cause the
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
economy to slow but higher prices might
 
00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
also mean higher profits so it's a
 
00:33:15.049 --> 00:33:15.059 align:start position:0%
little bit of a dance there in terms of
 
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
the actual impact and then obviously a
 
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
potential economic slowdown
 
00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
um I'm calling it a Slowdown at this
 
00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:24.169 align:start position:0%
um I'm calling it a Slowdown at this
point

00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:24.179 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:33:26.649 --> 00:33:26.659 align:start position:0%
I have not used the term recession
 
00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:29.640 align:start position:0%
you'll see with the growth rates at this
 
00:33:32.509 --> 00:33:32.519 align:start position:0%
point what we are anticipating is a
 
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
slowing of the economy we're not going
 
00:33:36.409 --> 00:33:36.419 align:start position:0%
to maybe see the year over year growth
 
00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:37.559 align:start position:0%
that we've seen over the past couple
 
00:33:37.559 --> 00:33:38.990 align:start position:0%
that we've seen over the past couple
years

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:41.700 align:start position:0%
um but at least at this point subject to
 
00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
change not forecasting an actual
 
00:33:47.389 --> 00:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
downturn in the revenue or in the growth
 
00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
rates you will see ultimately when Chris
 
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
produces the worksheets you may see a
 
00:33:54.409 --> 00:33:54.419 align:start position:0%
reduction in the revenue
 
00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
um but that would be the result of the
 
00:33:58.610 --> 00:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
tax law changes not necessarily a
 
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:06.169 --> 00:34:06.179 align:start position:0%
looking at the chart or I'm sorry I
 
00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:08.940 align:start position:0%
apologize represent all me oh no perhaps
 
00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:11.700 align:start position:0%
Mr representative Roche or had to say I
 
00:34:14.109 --> 00:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
apologize staring at the numbers
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
that doesn't matter I I just uh before
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
we go on too far I'm looking at the
 
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
factors consider I'm looking at your
 
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
ranges the zero to two percent I mean
 
00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:25.609 align:start position:0%
ranges the zero to two percent I mean
that's

00:34:25.609 --> 00:34:25.619 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:27.300 align:start position:0%
give me that that's a real big slowdown
 
00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:29.460 align:start position:0%
I think I mean yeah that's reflective of
 
00:34:31.849 --> 00:34:31.859 align:start position:0%
a pretty dramatic slowdown uh based on
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
what we've seen over the last few years
 
00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
um correct and I understand the the
 
00:34:39.649 --> 00:34:39.659 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of factors in there now
 
00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
the things that you put in there as
 
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
factors to consider the impact of
 
00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
inflation are you considering inflation
 
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
when you give us that maximum growth of
 
00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
two percent
 
00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
that is you know one of the one of the
 
00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
things that kind of goes into the range
 
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
so I don't have a specific you know the
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
impact of inflation is X percent on the
 
00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
growth rate but it is something that
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
we've considered as part of determining
 
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
the growth rate okay so it's not a
 
00:35:11.329 --> 00:35:11.339 align:start position:0%
specific formula it's more just
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
informing the the ranges that we're
 
00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
providing okay so the two percent is
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
factoring in already comprehensively
 
00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
correct right my goal is to give you a
 
00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:24.599 align:start position:0%
range that factors into you know
 
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
anticipated GDP growth
 
00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
um the any influx effects of inflation
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
any historical trends that we've seen
 
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
and how business taxes operate so that
 
00:35:36.109 --> 00:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
you have a range that kind of
 
00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
encompasses all of that and you don't
 
00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
need to necessarily parse out you know
 
00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
we're going to do this because of
 
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
inflation and this percent because of
 
00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
GDP my goal is to kind of get it all the
 
00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
Easy Button into yes yes into a package
 
00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
for you great thank you representative
 
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
alright do you have a question yeah just
 
00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:54.900 align:start position:0%
briefly uh
 
00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:58.140 align:start position:0%
commissioner when you said take into
 
00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:01.310 align:start position:0%
commissioner when you said take into
consideration

00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:07.849 --> 00:36:07.859 align:start position:0%
that's a rather nebulous terminology or
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
term uh I mean last month the uh in the
 
00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:14.940 align:start position:0%
CPI was something like 6.7
 
00:36:17.329 --> 00:36:17.339 align:start position:0%
um I think overall we're looking at
 
00:36:22.089 --> 00:36:22.099 align:start position:0%
maybe eight or nine uh going towards ten
 
00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:24.660 align:start position:0%
that devalues
 
00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
yeah which then means
 
00:36:35.089 --> 00:36:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:35.099 --> 00:36:36.310 align:start position:0%
 
together

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:36:41.569 --> 00:36:41.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
and we're looking at a downturn that
 
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
it's got to happen sometime
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
um I mean how long have we've been
 
00:36:53.089 --> 00:36:53.099 align:start position:0%
saying for about two years yeah more
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
than that yeah
 
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.710 align:start position:0%
than that yeah
um

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:59.630 --> 00:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
yeah well it depends on the money market
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
who gives it and how many Monopoly
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
dollars are floating around it depends
 
00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
on understand the question I'm getting
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
what numbers should we look at the low
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
range is not a conservative number the
 
00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
high range is not a con a liberal number
 
00:37:20.569 --> 00:37:20.579 align:start position:0%
and vice versa
 
00:37:20.579 --> 00:37:22.069 align:start position:0%
and vice versa
so

00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
so again these are well two points one
 
00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
these are our ranges that we feel are
 
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable at this point in time the
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
committee may feel differently and that
 
00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
has has happened in the past you you may
 
00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:38.220 align:start position:0%
decide that our ranges are too
 
00:37:41.329 --> 00:37:41.339 align:start position:0%
optimistic and that maybe it's negative
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
two to two and maybe you go with
 
00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
negative two we're just trying to
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
provide you our general feelings at this
 
00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
to your earlier comment about inflation
 
00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:55.740 align:start position:0%
you're correct we numbers are hovering
 
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
around six percent the latest
 
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
um release that came out it's down from
 
00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
the eight to nine percent that we've
 
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
seen you know we've seen a number of
 
00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
months of inflation but it's not
 
00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
continuing to grow if the number that
 
00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
came out in the last week or so was
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
showing 8 9 10 continued growing of
 
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
inflation this range might look
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
different we might say okay maybe it's
 
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
negative five maybe it's negative 10
 
00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
because inflation doesn't seem to to be
 
00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
under control we're at least seeing some
 
00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
tempering of the inflation and
 
00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
inflationary pressures it is not where
 
00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:32.460 align:start position:0%
anyone wants it to be but it is not
 
00:38:35.329 --> 00:38:35.339 align:start position:0%
continuing to grow if it was this range
 
00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:41.460 align:start position:0%
representative ORS
 
00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
taking my question how many years have
 
00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:51.260 align:start position:0%
do you want the full you know
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
too many yes there you go that's good
 
00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:56.900 align:start position:0%
enough for me thank you that's too many
 
00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
or not that many
 
00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:02.940 align:start position:0%
you've been at the dra what I've
 
00:39:05.329 --> 00:39:05.339 align:start position:0%
essentially I've essentially been at the
 
00:39:07.849 --> 00:39:07.859 align:start position:0%
dra since
 
00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:10.740 align:start position:0%
um 2010 I took a brief Hiatus for about
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
18 months but I've essentially been at
 
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
the dra since August of 2010.
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you madam chair so
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
having done the same work that you're
 
00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:23.220 align:start position:0%
doing I have no doubt that you're you're
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
sure of what you're doing do you have
 
00:39:26.089 --> 00:39:26.099 align:start position:0%
any doubts that you're sure of what
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
you haven't you've you've looked at New
 
00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire tax law changes you haven't is
 
00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
there anybody that has tried to
 
00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.150 align:start position:0%
there anybody that has tried to
summarize

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
summarize
 
00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
the impact of the stimulus spending and
 
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
so there's obviously Federal data for
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
that you know what the
 
00:40:11.089 --> 00:40:11.099 align:start position:0%
OMB has estimated what the impact will
 
00:40:11.099 --> 00:40:12.410 align:start position:0%
OMB has estimated what the impact will
be

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:12.420 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
I think at this point my thought process
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
subject to criticism comment Etc is that
 
00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
again we're trying to estimate fiscal
 
00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
year 23 to then grow or decline for 24
 
00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
and 25 and so a fair amount of the
 
00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
stimulus money is in the economy and
 
00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
therefore I believe in the revenues that
 
00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:43.079 align:start position:0%
we've received in 22 and 23. if there
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
was a large you know
 
00:40:45.119 --> 00:40:45.770 align:start position:0%
was a large you know
um

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
additional amount of stimulus that I
 
00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:50.700 align:start position:0%
felt like had not been
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
working its way through the economy then
 
00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
yes we may have wanted to make an
 
00:40:59.450 --> 00:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
adjustment for that but thinking about
 
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
the base that we're trying to estimate
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
my feeling was that
 
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
either most of the money is in the
 
00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
economy or some of it may already have
 
00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
come out have already been spent but
 
00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
there's more that's
 
00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:16.310 align:start position:0%
there's more that's
um

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
the potential still to be spent and they
 
00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
kind of would offset each other
 
00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:22.190 align:start position:0%
kind of would offset each other
that

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
kind of makes sense so again just trying
 
00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:26.220 align:start position:0%
to think about what the base is I'm
 
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
looking at 22 and 23 do I feel like the
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
impact of the stimulus is probably in
 
00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
the revenues
 
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
based on the growth we've seen in the
 
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
past couple years I would say yes you
 
00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:40.220 align:start position:0%
know we saw
 
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
44.6 percent growth in 21 23 growth in
 
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
22 and we're seeing five percent growth
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
this year so that growth has started to
 
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
slow so that would kind of tell me the
 
00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
majority of the impact of the stimulus
 
00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
is felt in the revenues that we're using
 
00:41:58.849 --> 00:41:58.859 align:start position:0%
as our base
 
00:42:01.609 --> 00:42:01.619 align:start position:0%
so could I have a follow-up
 
00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe it's because
 
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
as much about the consumers that are
 
00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
buying things in our economy as I do
 
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
about the companies on
 
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:19.380 align:start position:0%
is there
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
there isn't anything out there in the
 
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
literature about
 
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
um a negative effect of the removal of
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
the stimulus money we can look into that
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
first look at consumers but then also is
 
00:42:36.349 --> 00:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
happening with the businesses
 
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
and some of the businesses on the edge
 
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
may not survive that
 
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
that certainly happened in the Great
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
Recession why it took so long to get out
 
00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:50.460 align:start position:0%
of it yeah we'll do some research and
 
00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:52.740 align:start position:0%
see if we if we can find any comments
 
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
about that that's a good point
 
00:42:58.130 --> 00:42:58.140 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
 
00:42:59.450 --> 00:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
um if it the committee would like I
 
00:43:02.569 --> 00:43:02.579 align:start position:0%
could also ask Des Brian Gottlieb to
 
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:04.740 align:start position:0%
consider that question as well in their
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
presentation to you on the 28th
 
00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:09.180 align:start position:0%
um they may actually have some other
 
00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.210 align:start position:0%
um they may actually have some other
information

00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:11.220 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
um that may get Lindsay off the hook
 
00:43:18.589 --> 00:43:18.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
Brian may not yeah
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay so looking at the chart on the
 
00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
middle of the page
 
00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
you'll see
 
00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
a high low range for 23 you'll see an
 
00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:34.380 align:start position:0%
impact of that 19.6 million in the tax
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
law changes resulting in a net range
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
at the bottom that's the same range that
 
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
shows on the prior Slide the net amount
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
is what we're showing on the prior slide
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
we then as we've already kind of or
 
00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
actually I'll hold for one second
 
00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
how did we come up with those ranges
 
00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
so the low range takes actual
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
year-to-date revenue and then assumes
 
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
plan for the remainder of the year so
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
although we are significantly ahead of
 
00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
plan to representative almi's point at
 
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:10.260 align:start position:0%
the beginning there is a chance that we
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
may start to see a Slowdown so let's say
 
00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%
okay take year-to-date revenue and let's
 
00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
assume that slowdown let's just assume
 
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
we we're at plan for the rest of the
 
00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:20.569 align:start position:0%
we we're at plan for the rest of the
year

00:44:20.569 --> 00:44:20.579 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
that's what produces the 1.2 billion
 
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
minus the 19.6 million arriving at the 1
 
00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
billion 219 million five hundred
 
00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:32.329 align:start position:0%
billion 219 million five hundred
thousand

00:44:32.329 --> 00:44:32.339 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
the high range
 
00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
basically says take the first seven
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
months of the year and apply that 33.3
 
00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
percent ahead of plan that we've been
 
00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:45.470 align:start position:0%
percent ahead of plan that we've been
year-to-date

00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
year-to-date
 
00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
let's assume we stay there for the rest
 
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
of the year so that the high essentially
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
assumes we don't see any slowing things
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
just kind of continue on the way they've
 
00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:57.300 align:start position:0%
been happening for the first seven
 
00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
months that produces the 1 billion 276
 
00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:04.140 align:start position:0%
million seven hundred thousand minus the
 
00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
19.6 million and the tax law changes
 
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:09.300 align:start position:0%
resulting in the 1 billion 257 million
 
00:45:11.329 --> 00:45:11.339 align:start position:0%
one hundred thousand
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
so that's how we come up with the range
 
00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
the low is essentially yep we're gonna
 
00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:19.140 align:start position:0%
see some slowdown here the high says
 
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
nope we're just going to keep trekking
 
00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
on the way we've been going
 
00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
then it's we've already kind of talked
 
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
about we have a zero to two percent
 
00:45:28.609 --> 00:45:28.619 align:start position:0%
growth rate for 25. again that's a
 
00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:30.300 align:start position:0%
year-over-year growth rate so you would
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
apply that two percent say to the 23
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
amount and then you would apply the 25
 
00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
two percent say to the 24 amount so
 
00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:42.300 align:start position:0%
these are year-over-year growth rates
 
00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:44.460 align:start position:0%
these are taking into accounts the
 
00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:45.660 align:start position:0%
things that we've already talked about
 
00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
and just the general prediction that GDP
 
00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:51.060 align:start position:0%
growth is going to slow
 
00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:51.950 align:start position:0%
growth is going to slow
um but

00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
what we've seen is that the growth will
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
potentially remain positive and not yet
 
00:45:59.390 --> 00:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
any estimates that it will slip negative
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
so we have the growth rates and then the
 
00:46:12.589 --> 00:46:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
okay on to page four meals and rentals
 
00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.130 align:start position:0%
okay on to page four meals and rentals
tax

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
so year to date we are 50.6 or 33.5
 
00:46:28.609 --> 00:46:28.619 align:start position:0%
percent ahead of plan for 6.4 million or
 
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
3.3 percent ahead of Prior year as
 
00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
representative uluri mentioned earlier
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
remember when plan was done we're
 
00:46:37.849 --> 00:46:37.859 align:start position:0%
significantly ahead of plan but plan was
 
00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
done at a time when we were just coming
 
00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:43.079 align:start position:0%
off of stay-at-home orders restaurant
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
closures Etc and we were anticipating if
 
00:46:47.809 --> 00:46:47.819 align:start position:0%
those maintained that there would be a
 
00:46:50.569 --> 00:46:50.579 align:start position:0%
significant impact to m r
 
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
however post-pandemic activity has shown
 
00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
us that there was essentially pent-up
 
00:46:57.530 --> 00:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
demand for dining out going on vacations
 
00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
traveling as I've said before I think we
 
00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
all realized how much we enjoyed eating
 
00:47:05.809 --> 00:47:05.819 align:start position:0%
out when we couldn't eat out it's really
 
00:47:05.819 --> 00:47:07.130 align:start position:0%
out when we couldn't eat out it's really
hard

00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:07.140 align:start position:0%
hard
 
00:47:08.809 --> 00:47:08.819 align:start position:0%
um especially in my house with two
 
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
adults and two little kids to make three
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
meals a day at home so we certainly
 
00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
realized that eating out is something
 
00:47:18.109 --> 00:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
that we would like to do and have done
 
00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
more of I think post pandemic because we
 
00:47:24.829 --> 00:47:24.839 align:start position:0%
realize how important it is to us
 
00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:27.660 align:start position:0%
um other things to consider transfers to
 
00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:29.220 align:start position:0%
the municipal Revenue fund this is the
 
00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
funds that we've talked about
 
00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
in Prior presentations where 30 percent
 
00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
of m r revenue is going into a dedicated
 
00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
fund to go back to the municipalities
 
00:47:41.569 --> 00:47:41.579 align:start position:0%
and also the school building Aid Debt
 
00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
Service we provided the chart for how
 
00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:45.660 align:start position:0%
that debt service is being paid out
 
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
through 2030.
 
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
so for fiscal year 23 this is an
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
instance where we are going to look at
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
the gross amounts and we would then
 
00:48:01.309 --> 00:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
apply any growth rates to those gross
 
00:48:02.569 --> 00:48:02.579 align:start position:0%
amounts so we're going to apply any
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
growth rates to the total revenue
 
00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
collected before the transfer to the
 
00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:09.060 align:start position:0%
municipal fund because it is revenue in
 
00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
the door we're just going to send a
 
00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:14.220 align:start position:0%
portion of it into a dedicated fund
 
00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
so our estimates
 
00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:16.309 align:start position:0%
so our estimates
[Music]

00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:48:16.319 --> 00:48:17.329 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:48:17.329 --> 00:48:17.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:21.309 --> 00:48:21.319 align:start position:0%
for 2023 gross amounts of
 
00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:24.260 align:start position:0%
323.9 million to
 
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
455.5 million the reduction of the 128
 
00:48:31.069 --> 00:48:31.079 align:start position:0%
million is the municipal Revenue
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
transfer plus the school building Aid
 
00:48:36.309 --> 00:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
Debt Service arriving at the net of
 
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
295.9 million to
 
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
327.5 so the 295.9 and the 327.5 those
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
numbers are what you would compare to
 
00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
plan because plan takes out the
 
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
municipal Revenue transfer those are
 
00:48:53.569 --> 00:48:53.579 align:start position:0%
also the amounts that you would see in
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
the revenue Focus
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
because the revenue Focus amounts are
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
going to be net of those transfers
 
00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
the low range assumes that m r performs
 
00:49:07.309 --> 00:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
at plan for the last five months of 23
 
00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:09.180 align:start position:0%
so we take year-to-date Revenue through
 
00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:12.180 align:start position:0%
January and we assume plan for the
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
remaining five months similar to
 
00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:17.460 align:start position:0%
business taxes although we are 33.5
 
00:49:19.609 --> 00:49:19.619 align:start position:0%
percent ahead of plan
 
00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
in the event that this economy does
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
start to slow there and there is an
 
00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:26.700 align:start position:0%
impact to the meals and rentals tax or
 
00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
the fact that prices are higher and
 
00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
therefore people don't eat out or can't
 
00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
afford to eat out or take vacations as
 
00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:35.150 align:start position:0%
afford to eat out or take vacations as
much

00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:37.380 align:start position:0%
and or we see staffing issues
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
restaurants are not able to be open as
 
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
frequently or for as many hours as they
 
00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
were previously
 
00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:46.140 align:start position:0%
if all of those things kind of come
 
00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:48.180 align:start position:0%
together we would see a slowing in the m
 
00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:50.220 align:start position:0%
r tax for the remaining five months of
 
00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
the year so that's what the low scenario
 
00:49:55.309 --> 00:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
is assuming that we just meet plan for
 
00:49:57.770 --> 00:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
the rest of the year and that slowing is
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
seen in the economy
 
00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:03.800 align:start position:0%
Baha'i assumes that we remain
 
00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
34.34 ahead of plan so the year-to-date
 
00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:10.140 align:start position:0%
um growth over plan that we have seen
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
remains through the end of the year we
 
00:50:15.770 --> 00:50:15.780 align:start position:0%
do not see any impact or any slowing as
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
a result of any of the the economy the
 
00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:21.180 align:start position:0%
prices the Staffing Etc so that's how we
 
00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:23.220 align:start position:0%
arrive at the range for 23.
 
00:50:25.069 --> 00:50:25.079 align:start position:0%
representative do you have a question I
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
do thank you madam chair
 
00:50:28.079 --> 00:50:28.609 align:start position:0%
do thank you madam chair
um

00:50:28.609 --> 00:50:28.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
not just meals on rentals tax but all of
 
00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
them you apparently you don't take into
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
we're going to again kind of take into
 
00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
account inflation
 
00:50:44.809 --> 00:50:44.819 align:start position:0%
as a result of the various scenarios
 
00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at so inflation May
 
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
inform where we think the tax is going
 
00:50:54.049 --> 00:50:54.059 align:start position:0%
to go but remember we are using as a
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
base Revenue year to date so there is
 
00:50:58.849 --> 00:50:58.859 align:start position:0%
inflation already baked the impact of
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
inflation already baked into that
 
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
Revenue that we're using year to date as
 
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
the base so the only thing we really
 
00:51:09.250 --> 00:51:09.260 align:start position:0%
need to account for is additional
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
impacts that we have not already seen
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
from inflation or other factors that we
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
may see in the last five months of the
 
00:51:16.559 --> 00:51:17.930 align:start position:0%
may see in the last five months of the
year

00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:17.940 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:51:20.089 --> 00:51:20.099 align:start position:0%
so again not that we're not accounting
 
00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
for it we just don't have a line item
 
00:51:26.569 --> 00:51:26.579 align:start position:0%
that says inflation minus 5 million
 
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
actually it could go the other way could
 
00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:30.900 align:start position:0%
it or it all it could because the prices
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
are higher it's a percent of meal prices
 
00:51:37.609 --> 00:51:37.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
so it's a positive until it reaches the
 
00:51:41.329 --> 00:51:41.339 align:start position:0%
Tipping Point when prices get too high
 
00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:43.559 align:start position:0%
the demand Falls
 
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
representative Ames
 
00:51:49.609 --> 00:51:49.619 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you good morning
 
00:51:49.619 --> 00:51:50.569 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you good morning
um

00:51:50.569 --> 00:51:50.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:52.849 --> 00:51:52.859 align:start position:0%
actually this may be a question more for
 
00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:54.300 align:start position:0%
Chris uh
 
00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:56.220 align:start position:0%
or other
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
here with this presentation we are
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
seeing lows and highs in the end
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
at least historically we've had to
 
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
pick a number
 
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:16.380 align:start position:0%
so we've got to do
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
you know we've got to jump out on a limb
 
00:52:21.049 --> 00:52:21.059 align:start position:0%
at zero percent or five percent we we
 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
can't do that is that correct
 
00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:26.220 align:start position:0%
that's correct representative Ames and
 
00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
at the end of this process this
 
00:52:29.329 --> 00:52:29.339 align:start position:0%
committee will come to some agreement on
 
00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
a single number as your Revenue
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
projection for each of these taxes or
 
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
each of these Revenue sources
 
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
so that as the dra um is typically comes
 
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:41.700 align:start position:0%
in and presents a range because of I
 
00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
think the types of questions that are
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
being asked the factors that you want to
 
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
consider when you're doing these
 
00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:49.559 align:start position:0%
estimates be it inflation be it a
 
00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
potential slowdown or recession be it
 
00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:53.460 align:start position:0%
some sort of a boom because of a
 
00:52:57.290 --> 00:52:57.300 align:start position:0%
stimulus so this committee will take all
 
00:52:58.370 --> 00:52:58.380 align:start position:0%
that knowledge that you've been
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
presented through the economic briefings
 
00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:02.460 align:start position:0%
and the agency presentations and you'll
 
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
come up with a single number that's your
 
00:53:06.109 --> 00:53:06.119 align:start position:0%
best estimate or best guess as to what
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
the revenue will be in 24 and then again
 
00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:10.740 align:start position:0%
in 25.
 
00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:13.140 align:start position:0%
and you know do that based on your
 
00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:15.900 align:start position:0%
adjustments for 23. so you often use
 
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
your 23 as your base number to kind of
 
00:53:20.569 --> 00:53:20.579 align:start position:0%
grow into 24 and 25.
 
00:53:23.329 --> 00:53:23.339 align:start position:0%
so what Lindsay's doing today is giving
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
you a range of numbers for each of these
 
00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources
 
00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
and telling her how telling you how she
 
00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:31.500 align:start position:0%
got to those numbers with her team it's
 
00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:32.819 align:start position:0%
up to the committee to decide whether
 
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
you want to stay within the within those
 
00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
ranges go outside those ranges make
 
00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
so that's a long-winded answer to I
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
think your question representative Ames
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so today we're just trying to get
 
00:53:48.109 --> 00:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
inside the head of our expert and
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
understand where she's coming from but
 
00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
then we will do our own discussion with
 
00:53:53.809 --> 00:53:53.819 align:start position:0%
our expertise to see if we agree with
 
00:53:55.130 --> 00:53:55.140 align:start position:0%
some of the assumptions or we're
 
00:53:58.250 --> 00:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
slightly off from them oh great yeah and
 
00:53:59.690 --> 00:53:59.700 align:start position:0%
representative Sanborn if I just might
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
as well the commissioner and her team or
 
00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
some parts of her team will be available
 
00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
as we move forward through this process
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
so as the committee gets to making some
 
00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:09.660 align:start position:0%
of its final decisions if you want to
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
bounce questions off from dra to say
 
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
we're thinking this does that seem
 
00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable with this Revenue stream you
 
00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:18.660 align:start position:0%
can do that so you won't be in isolation
 
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative Army
 
00:54:27.609 --> 00:54:27.619 align:start position:0%
thank you and I think Beyond Beyond
 
00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:32.460 align:start position:0%
sorry our personal expertise if we can
 
00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:33.349 align:start position:0%
sorry our personal expertise if we can
think

00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:54:37.549 --> 00:54:37.559 align:start position:0%
of questions like the one about
 
00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
what is it going to do if the Consumer
 
00:54:44.290 --> 00:54:44.300 align:start position:0%
Debt starts to slow down the spending on
 
00:54:48.829 --> 00:54:48.839 align:start position:0%
and we can think of people outside of
 
00:54:51.910 --> 00:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
this body that like Phil sletton as well
 
00:54:55.790 --> 00:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
that may be able to find studies that
 
00:54:59.210 --> 00:54:59.220 align:start position:0%
have are being done now that that could
 
00:55:02.569 --> 00:55:02.579 align:start position:0%
help us try to triangulate down to
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
something that I don't think we're going
 
00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
to be comfortable when we finish this I
 
00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
don't think you ever are comfortable no
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
but this is the worst I think except for
 
00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:15.180 align:start position:0%
the Great Recession when every year we
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
had to readjust the budget
 
00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:19.559 align:start position:0%
and we've mentioned this previously that
 
00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:21.780 align:start position:0%
the house is in the you know next
 
00:55:23.329 --> 00:55:23.339 align:start position:0%
hardest position after the governor
 
00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
because your base is the most uncertain
 
00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
um so with every month that goes by it
 
00:55:29.809 --> 00:55:29.819 align:start position:0%
gets a little bit easier because we get
 
00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
further and further to knowing actual
 
00:55:31.319 --> 00:55:32.750 align:start position:0%
further and further to knowing actual
revenues

00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:41.720 align:start position:0%
no 24.
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury has a question
 
00:55:47.930 --> 00:55:47.940 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'm going to make a couple of
 
00:55:52.609 --> 00:55:52.619 align:start position:0%
observations and see whether you are in
 
00:55:56.690 --> 00:55:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:59.950 --> 00:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
taxes if you look across the board
 
00:56:02.569 --> 00:56:02.579 align:start position:0%
greatly in their trend line relative to
 
00:56:04.849 --> 00:56:04.859 align:start position:0%
the prior year and relative to the plan
 
00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:07.380 align:start position:0%
but it strikes me as being an odd
 
00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:09.530 align:start position:0%
but it strikes me as being an odd
coincidence

00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
coincidence
 
00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
that our two biggest ones business taxes
 
00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
and meals and rooms
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
both are essentially 33
 
00:56:21.410 --> 00:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
and the third percent over plan
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm I guess the first question
 
00:56:26.930 --> 00:56:26.940 align:start position:0%
from that observation is I
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
is that more than coincidence do we see
 
00:56:30.829 --> 00:56:30.839 align:start position:0%
a correlation
 
00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
that would tend to drive them ahead of
 
00:56:35.930 --> 00:56:35.940 align:start position:0%
plan at the same rate but let me just go
 
00:56:38.809 --> 00:56:38.819 align:start position:0%
to the second observation first
 
00:56:42.049 --> 00:56:42.059 align:start position:0%
plan of course is just a measure of how
 
00:56:43.849 --> 00:56:43.859 align:start position:0%
good we were at guessing two years ago
 
00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
in the same process
 
00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
and it's easy to get caught up in how
 
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
far over planned we are
 
00:56:52.130 --> 00:56:52.140 align:start position:0%
and it seems like spectacular
 
00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:54.660 align:start position:0%
performance but it may also be that we
 
00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:56.700 align:start position:0%
just simply anticipated that downturn
 
00:56:58.790 --> 00:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
that didn't materialize
 
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
what's probably much more important to
 
00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:57:06.109 --> 00:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
is that business taxes are only 4.7
 
00:57:06.119 --> 00:57:07.250 align:start position:0%
is that business taxes are only 4.7
percent

00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
ahead of Prior year
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
and meals and rooms tax serve two-thirds
 
00:57:14.089 --> 00:57:14.099 align:start position:0%
of that at 3.3 percent had a prior year
 
00:57:17.089 --> 00:57:17.099 align:start position:0%
so when we focus
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
on the the performance relative to Prior
 
00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:22.190 align:start position:0%
on the the performance relative to Prior
year

00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:24.780 align:start position:0%
it mitigates that impression of
 
00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:26.940 align:start position:0%
spectacular Revenue growth or
 
00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:28.210 align:start position:0%
spectacular Revenue growth or
performance

00:57:28.210 --> 00:57:28.220 align:start position:0%
performance
 
00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
and it's not difficult to see
 
00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
that if the downturn finally does come
 
00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
and parenthetically it seems to me that
 
00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
the Federal Reserve is virtually
 
00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:40.460 align:start position:0%
committed in getting us there
 
00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
uh it doesn't take much of a downward
 
00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:45.589 align:start position:0%
uh it doesn't take much of a downward
adjustment

00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
adjustment
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
to move to zero to two or zero to five
 
00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:50.210 align:start position:0%
to move to zero to two or zero to five
percent

00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:50.220 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:54.180 align:start position:0%
um so I I don't find your
 
00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
your estimates of growth
 
00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:57.589 align:start position:0%
your estimates of growth
um

00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:01.069 --> 00:58:01.079 align:start position:0%
to be wildly optimistic I think they're
 
00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:02.700 align:start position:0%
very realistic and could even be a
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
to your first point about
 
00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:10.980 align:start position:0%
um business taxes being 33.3 ahead of
 
00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
plan and m r being 33.5 percent ahead of
 
00:58:16.609 --> 00:58:16.619 align:start position:0%
plan I triple checked that number
 
00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:19.380 align:start position:0%
because I was like it must be a typo so
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
I noticed the same thing you did I have
 
00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
not wrapped my head around
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not there is any correlation
 
00:58:32.329 --> 00:58:32.339 align:start position:0%
between the two I I think it may just be
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
a coincidence
 
00:58:34.319 --> 00:58:35.270 align:start position:0%
a coincidence
um

00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:37.140 align:start position:0%
in terms of your comment about the
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
deviation from plan versus the deviation
 
00:58:44.210 --> 00:58:44.220 align:start position:0%
from prior year you were correct that
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
um the the deviation from plan was due
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
to a cautious Revenue estimating process
 
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
during a time of a lot of uncertainty
 
00:58:56.690 --> 00:58:56.700 align:start position:0%
two years ago
 
00:59:00.289 --> 00:59:00.299 align:start position:0%
if you I believe if my memory serves me
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
correctly if you look back to revenue
 
00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:03.470 align:start position:0%
correctly if you look back to revenue
estimating

00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
estimating
 
00:59:06.890 --> 00:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
prior to covid you wouldn't see these
 
00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
sorts of deviations typically Revenue
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
estimates or revenues perform much much
 
00:59:14.809 --> 00:59:14.819 align:start position:0%
closer to plan if you saw deviations
 
00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:17.220 align:start position:0%
like this it would be because of a
 
00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
significant tax change that hadn't been
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
accounted for in plan or something like
 
00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
that so typically and maybe this is just
 
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
optimistic memory but I believe we tend
 
00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:30.420 align:start position:0%
to be a lot closer between actuals and
 
00:59:32.329 --> 00:59:32.339 align:start position:0%
plan it's really just a sign of the
 
00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
times and what we were all going through
 
00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:36.500 align:start position:0%
at that point and not wanting to
 
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
overestimate revenues during a time when
 
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
we could potentially see see a downturn
 
00:59:44.329 --> 00:59:44.339 align:start position:0%
it's you always want the estimates to be
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
correct but if if you have to be wrong
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
many cases it's it's better to be a
 
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
little bit more conservative than overly
 
00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:53.630 align:start position:0%
little bit more conservative than overly
optimistic

00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
optimistic
 
00:59:55.549 --> 00:59:55.559 align:start position:0%
um especially with revenues
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
00:59:59.210 --> 00:59:59.220 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
so if if we go back and if we look at at
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
estimates that were made you know for
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
the last
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
12 years or 10 10 years before covid at
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
that time inflation was quite low it was
 
01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
like one to two you know two percent a
 
01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:16.569 align:start position:0%
like one to two you know two percent a
year

01:00:16.569 --> 01:00:16.579 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:19.980 align:start position:0%
and then you know during for the last
 
01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
two years we've been dealing with
 
01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:24.180 align:start position:0%
significant inflation
 
01:00:27.289 --> 01:00:27.299 align:start position:0%
and that's not gonna it's not gonna shut
 
01:00:27.299 --> 01:00:28.549 align:start position:0%
and that's not gonna it's not gonna shut
off

01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
so can you help me understand how
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
how your estimates are impacted or are
 
01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:39.900 align:start position:0%
not reflecting
 
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
what I believe is is that inflation I
 
01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:44.700 align:start position:0%
think it's going to go down but I think
 
01:00:48.289 --> 01:00:48.299 align:start position:0%
it's going to be well above two percent
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
which it would have been kind of what
 
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
was going on up until
 
01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:55.010 align:start position:0%
was going on up until
um

01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
the prior estimates were made
 
01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:00.500 align:start position:0%
so I again I think the thing to remember
 
01:01:05.589 --> 01:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
is you're using a base of fiscal 23
 
01:01:08.329 --> 01:01:08.339 align:start position:0%
Revenue year to date
 
01:01:11.809 --> 01:01:11.819 align:start position:0%
so again to the extent that inflationary
 
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
impacts are showing in that Revenue
 
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
you're accounting for it in your
 
01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.430 align:start position:0%
you're accounting for it in your
estimates

01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
the times when you need to account for
 
01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
inflation or any other changes the tax
 
01:01:27.049 --> 01:01:27.059 align:start position:0%
law changes being a good example is when
 
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
that impact is not in your current
 
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
revenues so where we've seen now to your
 
01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:33.890 align:start position:0%
revenues so where we've seen now to your
point

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:33.900 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
Rising inflation over a period of time
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's not like it just started last month
 
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
if anything hopefully we've reached the
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
peak and we're going down
 
01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
it is likely accounted for in the
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
so I don't think I don't think you need
 
01:01:57.170 --> 01:01:57.180 align:start position:0%
to worry that it inflation was different
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
10 years ago
 
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
because that's not impacting the revenue
 
01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
estimating you're doing now if if I said
 
01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:08.940 align:start position:0%
okay your growth rate should be the same
 
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
as it was 10 years ago then you might
 
01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:12.839 align:start position:0%
have a point well ten years ago you
 
01:02:14.329 --> 01:02:14.339 align:start position:0%
didn't have inflation the same
 
01:02:17.089 --> 01:02:17.099 align:start position:0%
inflationary pressures so that's not a
 
01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:20.220 align:start position:0%
good comparison that would be
 
01:02:22.609 --> 01:02:22.619 align:start position:0%
something to consider
 
01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
but the fact that inflation didn't exist
 
01:02:28.730 --> 01:02:28.740 align:start position:0%
at the same levels 10 years ago where
 
01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
we're using year-to-date revenue and
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
we're projecting the remainder of the
 
01:02:33.119 --> 01:02:33.950 align:start position:0%
we're projecting the remainder of the
year

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:02:36.589 --> 01:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
I think we just need to think about how
 
01:02:38.329 --> 01:02:38.339 align:start position:0%
inflation is going to change between now
 
01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:39.660 align:start position:0%
and the end of the year or how inflation
 
01:02:41.089 --> 01:02:41.099 align:start position:0%
is going to change between this fiscal
 
01:02:43.370 --> 01:02:43.380 align:start position:0%
year and next fiscal year I don't think
 
01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
it matters what it was 10 years ago
 
01:02:47.089 --> 01:02:47.099 align:start position:0%
because that's 10 years ago is not at
 
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
the moment informing anything that's
 
01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth
 
01:02:57.710 --> 01:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question comment
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
as you look at the 33 It just strikes me
 
01:03:04.370 --> 01:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
that those two areas meals and room and
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
business tax affect almost every single
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
consumer in terms of spending whereas a
 
01:03:11.089 --> 01:03:11.099 align:start position:0%
lot of the others are much narrower and
 
01:03:13.069 --> 01:03:13.079 align:start position:0%
maybe due to anomalies or other kinds of
 
01:03:13.079 --> 01:03:14.329 align:start position:0%
maybe due to anomalies or other kinds of
things

01:03:14.329 --> 01:03:14.339 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:15.839 align:start position:0%
um you know like something like tobacco
 
01:03:17.450 --> 01:03:17.460 align:start position:0%
everyone doesn't participate in but
 
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
correct as you said I think both could
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
be uh pent-up demand sure
 
01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
I I agree with with your comment where
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
my mind kind of went first is knowing
 
01:03:30.829 --> 01:03:30.839 align:start position:0%
based on the information we presented
 
01:03:32.569 --> 01:03:32.579 align:start position:0%
um earlier this week and at prior
 
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
presentations the majority of our
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
business tax revenue is kind of paid by
 
01:03:38.569 --> 01:03:38.579 align:start position:0%
a few number of very large multinational
 
01:03:38.579 --> 01:03:41.089 align:start position:0%
a few number of very large multinational
corporations

01:03:41.089 --> 01:03:41.099 align:start position:0%
corporations
 
01:03:44.349 --> 01:03:44.359 align:start position:0%
um those are not the same
 
01:03:47.470 --> 01:03:47.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayers as the meals and rentals tax
 
01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:50.220 align:start position:0%
but I hadn't gone the level further that
 
01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
you just brought up which is consumers
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
are actually at the bottom of both of
 
01:03:58.250 --> 01:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
those I was thinking you know Acme
 
01:04:00.349 --> 01:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
Corporation very large multinational
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
corporation versus your neighborhood
 
01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
pizza shop there was a those are not the
 
01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:06.890 align:start position:0%
pizza shop there was a those are not the
same

01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
but at the bottom are consumers buying
 
01:04:10.849 --> 01:04:10.859 align:start position:0%
products from Acme or services and
 
01:04:13.609 --> 01:04:13.619 align:start position:0%
buying pizzas at the pizza shop so yes I
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
agree with your point
 
01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
representative Ulrich
 
01:04:21.410 --> 01:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
acne Staples in Franklin is a large
 
01:04:24.589 --> 01:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
multinational I get it we got to come up
 
01:04:26.690 --> 01:04:26.700 align:start position:0%
with a name that we all know is just me
 
01:04:29.569 --> 01:04:29.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:33.839 --> 01:04:35.329 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:04:35.329 --> 01:04:35.339 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
so that's how we came up with our low
 
01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
and high so again we assumed m r might
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
start to temper a little bit that we
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
would just be at plan for the rest of
 
01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
the year versus kind of continuing the
 
01:04:49.849 --> 01:04:49.859 align:start position:0%
growth that we've seen year to date
 
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
and then we're looking at between a zero
 
01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
and five percent growth for 24 and again
 
01:04:57.410 --> 01:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
for 25.
 
01:05:00.349 --> 01:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
for 24 that zero percent kind of assumes
 
01:05:02.450 --> 01:05:02.460 align:start position:0%
that the impact of inflation and or
 
01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
slowing of the economy does keep in keep
 
01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
m r flat to represent a plett's point
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
earlier where inflation drives prices to
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
a point the demand starts to decrease
 
01:05:14.329 --> 01:05:14.339 align:start position:0%
because obviously to a point higher
 
01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
prices just produces higher tax revenue
 
01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:19.140 align:start position:0%
but if we get to a point where that
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
starts to impact demand
 
01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
we would see m r kind of remain flat and
 
01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:26.099 align:start position:0%
then the high just kind of assumes that
 
01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
we keep
 
01:05:29.329 --> 01:05:29.339 align:start position:0%
um trekking along and we continue to see
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
increases generally consistent where
 
01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
we're seeing uh true representative
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
spillsbury's Point what we're seeing
 
01:05:38.450 --> 01:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
compared to Prior year right so not what
 
01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
we're seeing compared to plan but we're
 
01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
about three percent ahead of Prior year
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
and so our high assumes that we continue
 
01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
on that Trend if not a little bit more
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
and then for 25 again that zero to five
 
01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:54.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic MNR generally grew around
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
five percent a year so five percent is
 
01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
kind of a historic growth rate for m r
 
01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:07.980 align:start position:0%
so the 25 growth rate kind of returns to
 
01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
a more normal year-over-year growth but
 
01:06:13.730 --> 01:06:13.740 align:start position:0%
obviously on this new
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:20.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:06:24.529 --> 01:06:24.539 align:start position:0%
page five tobacco taxes
 
01:06:27.289 --> 01:06:27.299 align:start position:0%
so fiscal year to date we are 12.8
 
01:06:31.069 --> 01:06:31.079 align:start position:0%
million or 8.9 percent below plan
 
01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
or 8.9 million or 6.3 percent below
 
01:06:37.069 --> 01:06:37.079 align:start position:0%
prior year this really is the result of
 
01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
a decline in our tobacco tax stamp sales
 
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
those are the stamps that go on the
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
packages of cigarettes
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
other tobacco products that portion
 
01:06:48.829 --> 01:06:48.839 align:start position:0%
um of the revenue is growing but is a
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
much smaller portion of Revenue than
 
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax than tobacco stamp sales
 
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
the other thing to consider is a ban on
 
01:06:59.150 --> 01:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
mentholated products and other flavored
 
01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:00.839 align:start position:0%
tobacco products like we've seen in
 
01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:04.140 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that has kind of driven at
 
01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
least at some point an increase in our
 
01:07:07.609 --> 01:07:07.619 align:start position:0%
Revenue here in New Hampshire as people
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
came across the border
 
01:07:09.599 --> 01:07:10.370 align:start position:0%
came across the border
um

01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:13.309 --> 01:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
to buy those products if other bands
 
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
like that continue that could impact
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
revenues in a positive way if we see a
 
01:07:19.849 --> 01:07:19.859 align:start position:0%
ban at the federal level that would
 
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
obviously have a negative impact
 
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
for our 23 range it's 217 to
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
222.8 million the low assumes that our
 
01:07:35.569 --> 01:07:35.579 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to date percentage of 6.3
 
01:07:37.730 --> 01:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
percent below prior year we just
 
01:07:39.730 --> 01:07:39.740 align:start position:0%
maintain that for the rest of the year
 
01:07:43.849 --> 01:07:43.859 align:start position:0%
our high assumes that we have actual
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
year-to-date Revenue but for the
 
01:07:47.569 --> 01:07:47.579 align:start position:0%
remainder of the year we actually equal
 
01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
prior year so that the the decline that
 
01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
we've seen over prior year kind of stops
 
01:07:55.490 --> 01:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
and we rebound a little bit that's how
 
01:07:57.289 --> 01:07:57.299 align:start position:0%
we get to the range the range is
 
01:07:59.809 --> 01:07:59.819 align:start position:0%
relatively small for this tax it might
 
01:08:01.130 --> 01:08:01.140 align:start position:0%
be a welcome
 
01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
um observation for folks as your
 
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
thinking about how you're going to go
 
01:08:07.549 --> 01:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
through this process
 
01:08:10.970 --> 01:08:10.980 align:start position:0%
in terms of 24 and 25 growth rates we
 
01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
have a minus five percent to zero
 
01:08:16.610 --> 01:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
percent growth rate for 24.
 
01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
um historic year rear reductions in
 
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
cigarette stamp sales due to cessation
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
efforts this is kind of a normalizing of
 
01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:25.789 align:start position:0%
efforts this is kind of a normalizing of
the

01:08:25.789 --> 01:08:25.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
um tobacco tax stamp sales
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
normalizing from the the covet levels
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
that we saw where a lot of people
 
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
um did not stop smoking during covid if
 
01:08:39.410 --> 01:08:39.420 align:start position:0%
anything we saw a lot of rates
 
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
increasing across the country so the
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
minus five percent to zero kind of
 
01:08:43.679 --> 01:08:44.870 align:start position:0%
minus five percent to zero kind of
assumes

01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
assumes
 
01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
that we start to see those secession
 
01:08:50.090 --> 01:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
cessation efforts increase again with a
 
01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
little bit of the tempering of the
 
01:08:53.689 --> 01:08:53.699 align:start position:0%
increase in the other tobacco products
 
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
and then 25 we're saying minus three to
 
01:08:58.370 --> 01:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
zero folks that have been on this
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
committee for a while will know minus
 
01:09:02.150 --> 01:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
three percent year-over-year growth is
 
01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:03.900 align:start position:0%
kind of the historic Trend with Tobacco
 
01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
on average we do see a year-over-year
 
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
decline in tobacco as people stop
 
01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:11.699 align:start position:0%
smoking but again if they switch to you
 
01:09:13.729 --> 01:09:13.739 align:start position:0%
know e-cigarettes
 
01:09:15.169 --> 01:09:15.179 align:start position:0%
um we will pick up a little bit of
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
revenue from that but again the majority
 
01:09:18.769 --> 01:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
of the revenue is driven by the stamp
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
sales so when those go down the revenue
 
01:09:23.809 --> 01:09:23.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:26.689 --> 01:09:26.699 align:start position:0%
representative Ames you're just a minor
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
question but what what is the revenue
 
01:09:49.329 --> 01:09:49.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
hold on I'm having a chart I have it
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
visually but I need just want to check
 
01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
and see if I have the number for you if
 
01:09:58.250 --> 01:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:06.729 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:10:06.729 --> 01:10:06.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:11.810 --> 01:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
so e-cigarettes in fiscal year 21 in
 
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
total produced 5 million dollars of
 
01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:15.410 align:start position:0%
total produced 5 million dollars of
Revenue

01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
in 22 we saw 7.9 million in Revenue
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
um and year-to-date through December we
 
01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
saw 22 increase over last year so so
 
01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
e-cigarette revenue is increasing but
 
01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
again you know you're looking at
 
01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
seven million dollars out of
 
01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:38.890 align:start position:0%
seven million dollars out of
200

01:10:38.890 --> 01:10:38.900 align:start position:0%
200
 
01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
220 million dollars so it is it's
 
01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
increasing but it's a very small portion
 
01:10:47.530 --> 01:10:47.540 align:start position:0%
of the revenue
 
01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
follow up and then representative Oliver
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
after that yeah
 
01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.310 align:start position:0%
after that yeah
um

01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
so that's interesting and that
 
01:10:58.130 --> 01:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
shows that this new brand of uh
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
nicotine is popular or is selling anyway
 
01:11:07.390 --> 01:11:07.400 align:start position:0%
um and the revenue is positive unlike
 
01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
cigarettes correct and um
 
01:11:14.209 --> 01:11:14.219 align:start position:0%
yet it's very small but I suppose it
 
01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
could expand is there anything else that
 
01:11:20.090 --> 01:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
is moving in the up Direction rather
 
01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
than in the other tobacco products
 
01:11:24.169 --> 01:11:24.179 align:start position:0%
category I guess
 
01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
I would say the I mean there at least 21
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
to 22 the majority of the increase in
 
01:11:34.010 --> 01:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
other tobacco products was driven by
 
01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
e-cigarettes the remainder of OTP was
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
relatively flat so it really is
 
01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:41.390 align:start position:0%
relatively flat so it really is
e-cigarettes

01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
e-cigarettes
 
01:11:44.270 --> 01:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
um and E-cigarettes are not taxed the
 
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
same way as cigarettes are so in
 
01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
if there was a world where everybody
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
that stopped smoking shifted to
 
01:11:58.250 --> 01:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
e-cigarettes so if you didn't smoke
 
01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
cigarettes anymore but everyone shifted
 
01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
to e-cigarettes and E-cigarettes were
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
taxed exactly the same way as cigarettes
 
01:12:07.970 --> 01:12:07.980 align:start position:0%
were you wouldn't see an impact to the
 
01:12:10.850 --> 01:12:10.860 align:start position:0%
revenue right but because some people do
 
01:12:12.169 --> 01:12:12.179 align:start position:0%
just quit
 
01:12:14.209 --> 01:12:14.219 align:start position:0%
you see a reduction and then the people
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
that do switch over to e-cigarettes
 
01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
because the tax rate is not comparable
 
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:27.709 --> 01:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
01:12:27.719 --> 01:12:29.510 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
um

01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:31.729 --> 01:12:31.739 align:start position:0%
I've been sitting next to this guy for
 
01:12:32.810 --> 01:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
too long
 
01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:41.209 --> 01:12:41.219 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about e-cigarettes or
 
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
other tobacco products we've got a
 
01:12:45.950 --> 01:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
competitor to the South uh that
 
01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
continually raises rates
 
01:12:53.810 --> 01:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
how of our sales gone according to their
 
01:12:56.270 --> 01:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
rate increases or does your department
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
even bother with that
 
01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
I would say we haven't tracked it or
 
01:13:03.410 --> 01:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
correlated it specifically but when we
 
01:13:06.050 --> 01:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
do see the rate increases around all of
 
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
our neighboring states New Hampshire has
 
01:13:10.729 --> 01:13:10.739 align:start position:0%
by far the lowest tax rate out of all of
 
01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
the New England states New York New
 
01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
Jersey et cetera so anytime their rates
 
01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:16.550 align:start position:0%
Jersey et cetera so anytime their rates
increase

01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
um we see an increase in our sales when
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
our when Massachusetts straight up
 
01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
banned the menthol cigarettes we saw a
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
significant increase in those products
 
01:13:28.010 --> 01:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
purchased here in New Hampshire so there
 
01:13:29.950 --> 01:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
is definitely an impact
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
on any bans increases in tax changes Etc
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and for the record I take
 
01:13:43.370 --> 01:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
Southwest thank you for follow-up I
 
01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
think in your other presentation you
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
actually told us the percent that we're
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
out of state uh for the tobacco tax we
 
01:13:55.250 --> 01:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
yes there are there are studies done by
 
01:13:57.050 --> 01:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
the tax Foundation you're correct we did
 
01:13:58.850 --> 01:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
provide that information
 
01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
um so we know how much is moving out of
 
01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:02.450 align:start position:0%
um so we know how much is moving out of
state

01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:14:03.530 --> 01:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
um you know cigarettes purchase here
 
01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
that are consumed out of state I just
 
01:14:06.530 --> 01:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
don't know you know if Massachusetts
 
01:14:09.290 --> 01:14:09.300 align:start position:0%
raises their tax rate by five percent
 
01:14:11.149 --> 01:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
what is the increase or change here in
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:14:12.719 --> 01:14:14.630 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
sure

01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:16.910 align:start position:0%
sure
representative

01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'm not sure this
 
01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
is within your purview we'll try
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
but I wonder whether New Hampshire
 
01:14:26.450 --> 01:14:26.460 align:start position:0%
specifically has done any um studies
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
about the impact of the cost of health
 
01:14:33.169 --> 01:14:33.179 align:start position:0%
care for uh tobacco use and the change
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
in those costs relative to the lower use
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
of tobacco sure I don't have that
 
01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:40.910 align:start position:0%
of tobacco sure I don't have that
information

01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
um but there I'm sure there are
 
01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
organizations tobacco-free kids is one
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
that comes to mind other groups that may
 
01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
may have that information specifically
 
01:14:54.770 --> 01:14:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:58.490 --> 01:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
okay good and tobacco hey interest in
 
01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
dividends tax on Page Six
 
01:15:04.729 --> 01:15:04.739 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to date we're basically
 
01:15:07.850 --> 01:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
right at plan where the 300 000 or 0.6
 
01:15:13.149 --> 01:15:13.159 align:start position:0%
below print plan or 8.8 million or 14.9
 
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
below prior year IND is a tax that can
 
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
have year-over-year swings
 
01:15:22.130 --> 01:15:22.140 align:start position:0%
um stock market performance interest
 
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
rates distribution of profits all of the
 
01:15:25.729 --> 01:15:25.739 align:start position:0%
things that we talked about in our prior
 
01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
presentations can drive IND Revenue
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
um and then I mentioned the effect of
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
the tax law changes because the rate is
 
01:15:36.649 --> 01:15:36.659 align:start position:0%
decreasing and again just as a reminder
 
01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
um you're in a tough place because the
 
01:15:41.930 --> 01:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
majority of IND revenue does not come in
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
until April so you're you're attempting
 
01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
to forecast Revenue at a time where we
 
01:15:47.689 --> 01:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
haven't even probably seen half of the
 
01:15:48.890 --> 01:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
amount that we're going to get for the
 
01:15:50.270 --> 01:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
year so
 
01:15:51.709 --> 01:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
um it's not the easiest tax at this
 
01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
point in the year to estimate
 
01:15:59.570 --> 01:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
in terms of a low for 23 we assume that
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
the seven percent
 
01:16:01.679 --> 01:16:05.149 align:start position:0%
the seven percent
um

01:16:05.149 --> 01:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
sorry the 14.9 percent that we are below
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
prior year will be maintained through
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
the rest of the year and then we take
 
01:16:15.950 --> 01:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
out the 6.3 million for the rate
 
01:16:18.649 --> 01:16:18.659 align:start position:0%
reduction that we anticipate will impact
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
our revenues in April and in June
 
01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
and then for the high we assume
 
01:16:28.490 --> 01:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
year-to-date revenue and then we just
 
01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
add the remaining five months of last
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
year so we essentially assume that the
 
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
reduction that we've seen to Prior year
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
will go away and we'll see
 
01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
um revenues equal prior year in the last
 
01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
five months and again we subtract the
 
01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
rate reduction so you'll see on a net
 
01:16:48.250 --> 01:16:48.260 align:start position:0%
basis this range is
 
01:16:51.070 --> 01:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
126.9 million to
 
01:16:53.890 --> 01:16:53.900 align:start position:0%
141.3 million so again
 
01:16:58.250 --> 01:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
15 million dollar range for this year
 
01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
that range will obviously tighten once
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
we get more revenue for IND but again
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
just the impact of the fact that we
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
don't have the majority of the revenue
 
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative Ellery
 
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
in our neighbors to the South have got a
 
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
new tax that they put in they do
 
01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure how you would track that
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
except by new IND taxpayers
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
correct and we wouldn't have that
 
01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:31.550 align:start position:0%
information yet
 
01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:33.110 align:start position:0%
information yet
[Music]

01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
because the IND returns that we are
 
01:17:38.689 --> 01:17:38.699 align:start position:0%
going to receive in April will be for
 
01:17:42.130 --> 01:17:42.140 align:start position:0%
the tax year ending 12 31
 
01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
22. so it'll be prior to the
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
millionaires tax if you will in
 
01:17:49.610 --> 01:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts going into account into
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
effect but that is something that we can
 
01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
certainly track we can look at
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me that we would before
 
01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
this uh tax disappears and you're no
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
longer tracking it we would have two
 
01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:08.940 align:start position:0%
good years of data to show I would at
 
01:18:13.130 --> 01:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
least yeah yep thank you yes
 
01:18:15.169 --> 01:18:15.179 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis thank you madam
 
01:18:17.689 --> 01:18:17.699 align:start position:0%
chair I need some help understanding
 
01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
what these different taxes are and
 
01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
including the one you I I don't
 
01:18:25.370 --> 01:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
understand how the Millionaire's tax in
 
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts would impact New Hampshire
 
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
so there's an increased taxes
 
01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
millionaires tax in New Hampshire is an
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
additional income tax on top of the
 
01:18:37.370 --> 01:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
amount that's already paid for those
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
High net worth individuals I believe
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative uluri's point is to the
 
01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
extent that those individuals decide to
 
01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
move to New Hampshire where we have no
 
01:18:49.310 --> 01:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
broad-based income tax and our tax is
 
01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
only on interest and dividends that
 
01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
would be a significant tax savings
 
01:18:56.930 --> 01:18:56.940 align:start position:0%
potentially to those individuals and so
 
01:18:59.630 --> 01:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
we may see some people move to New
 
01:19:02.450 --> 01:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in order to avoid that
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
additional tax burden in Massachusetts
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
so so the main part of my question was
 
01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:10.140 align:start position:0%
help me understand what the ones that
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
are in this I'm looking at the top of
 
01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
the page and it tells me the percentage
 
01:19:17.090 --> 01:19:17.100 align:start position:0%
that are from taxable annuities
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
which I I think I know what those are
 
01:19:22.189 --> 01:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure actual cash and
 
01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
property distributions is that that's
 
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
like one big category
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
correct and that tell me what all of
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
those things are that tracks back to the
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
slides that we've presented in Prior
 
01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
presentations where we break down the
 
01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
percent of interest in dividends revenue
 
01:19:38.990 --> 01:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
between interest dividends and
 
01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
distributions and we're kind of showing
 
01:19:45.050 --> 01:19:45.060 align:start position:0%
over time how the percent that was
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
attributable to interest has kind of
 
01:19:50.030 --> 01:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
decreased in recent years where the
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
percent attributable to distributions
 
01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
has increased so those are kind of the
 
01:19:58.970 --> 01:19:58.980 align:start position:0%
main categories of Revenue that make up
 
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
so I you have to explain what what our
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
actual cash and property distribution or
 
01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
give me an example so to the extent that
 
01:20:14.330 --> 01:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
an individual receives a distribution
 
01:20:17.209 --> 01:20:17.219 align:start position:0%
um from a corporation that it's taxable
 
01:20:21.169 --> 01:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:24.410 --> 01:20:24.420 align:start position:0%
similar to if you received a dividend or
 
01:20:26.689 --> 01:20:26.699 align:start position:0%
interest income on you know bank
 
01:20:28.850 --> 01:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
accounts those are all things that are
 
01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
taxable under the interest and dividends
 
01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
tax and you will see the last point or
 
01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
the last item mentioned here the 7.3
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
percent federal tax exempt interest
 
01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
income there is interest income that is
 
01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
tax that is tax exempt under the federal
 
01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
level that is taxable here in New
 
01:20:47.689 --> 01:20:47.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire bonds
 
01:20:49.729 --> 01:20:49.739 align:start position:0%
um it's a variety of things we can
 
01:20:51.169 --> 01:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
provide you with additional information
 
01:20:53.090 --> 01:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
on that there's a whole checklist that's
 
01:20:55.490 --> 01:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
on our website of the various components
 
01:20:56.810 --> 01:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
that fall under the interest and
 
01:20:59.149 --> 01:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
dividends tax
 
01:21:02.090 --> 01:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
representative ulery I think yeah just
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
to follow up on that that would include
 
01:21:06.050 --> 01:21:06.060 align:start position:0%
the rmds that uh
 
01:21:07.850 --> 01:21:07.860 align:start position:0%
certain people receive from their
 
01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
Pension funds the required minimum
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
distribution potentially and but then
 
01:21:14.630 --> 01:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
there's a threshold in New Hampshire so
 
01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
if you get less than that you don't pay
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
the tax but if you get more than that
 
01:21:19.970 --> 01:21:19.980 align:start position:0%
then you have to pay the tax on
 
01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
everything over that so if you're one of
 
01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:24.290 align:start position:0%
everything over that so if you're one of
the

01:21:24.290 --> 01:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:28.370 --> 01:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
um numerous now uh very wealthy people
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
that have Pension funds or
 
01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:32.990 align:start position:0%
that have Pension funds or
um

01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:34.850 --> 01:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
well yeah I don't want to use the
 
01:21:37.370 --> 01:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
derogatory tone pension fund babies but
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
trust fund babies rather they uh they
 
01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
have to take some money
 
01:21:45.410 --> 01:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
yes to a degree but the amount of money
 
01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
that you take out of and that is is this
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
as an example but it you have to meet
 
01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
the threshold first and uh We've set the
 
01:22:01.370 --> 01:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
Threshold at the threshold is twenty
 
01:22:03.410 --> 01:22:03.420 align:start position:0%
four hundred dollars for a single filer
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
or 4 800 for joint filers and then
 
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
there's various exemptions as well so if
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
you're over 65 if you're blind if you're
 
01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
disabled before your 65th birthday etc
 
01:22:15.709 --> 01:22:15.719 align:start position:0%
those are all exemptions that are
 
01:22:19.090 --> 01:22:19.100 align:start position:0%
available in the tax as well
 
01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
representative only
 
01:22:27.649 --> 01:22:27.659 align:start position:0%
yes on where can we find a definition of
 
01:22:31.070 --> 01:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
distribution as versus dividend we can
 
01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
get that to you again there's a
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
checklist that's available
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
um in the instructions for our forums so
 
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
we can we can provide that to give
 
01:22:40.610 --> 01:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
additional clarity
 
01:22:42.410 --> 01:22:42.420 align:start position:0%
and we can certainly ask maybe if we
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
have the CPA Society or some of those
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
folks come back and flesh out some of
 
01:22:47.810 --> 01:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
these things for us we can do that any
 
01:22:49.729 --> 01:22:49.739 align:start position:0%
other questions right now
 
01:22:49.739 --> 01:22:53.350 align:start position:0%
other questions right now
okay

01:22:53.350 --> 01:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:56.630 --> 01:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
defines it out true but if you want more
 
01:22:58.250 --> 01:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
practical real world you know how is
 
01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
this impacting New Hampshire people I
 
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
think maybe the accountants would be
 
01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
able to or maybe ask your own accountant
 
01:23:06.770 --> 01:23:06.780 align:start position:0%
um sure that would be helpful okay
 
01:23:10.610 --> 01:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
um so once we have the range for 23 we
 
01:23:13.370 --> 01:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
have um growth rates again for 24 and 25
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
we're looking at zero to two percent in
 
01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
each year
 
01:23:20.689 --> 01:23:20.699 align:start position:0%
um again this tax can fluctuate over
 
01:23:20.699 --> 01:23:22.310 align:start position:0%
um again this tax can fluctuate over
time

01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
um this one is a bit hard as I mentioned
 
01:23:27.770 --> 01:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
at this point in the year to estimate
 
01:23:30.110 --> 01:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
um but we're essentially showing flat or
 
01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
minimal growth and then you will see the
 
01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
22.2 million in 24 and the 23.4 million
 
01:23:41.209 --> 01:23:41.219 align:start position:0%
in 25 that is the result of the decrease
 
01:23:43.370 --> 01:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
in the tax rate
 
01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
so those are tax law changes change
 
01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:49.070 align:start position:0%
so those are tax law changes change
impacts

01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:52.669 --> 01:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
okay moving on page seven communication
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
Services tax
 
01:23:56.209 --> 01:23:56.219 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to date were five and a half
 
01:24:00.050 --> 01:24:00.060 align:start position:0%
million or 24.1 million below plan
 
01:24:03.169 --> 01:24:03.179 align:start position:0%
um we are 0.6 million or 3.4 percent
 
01:24:05.209 --> 01:24:05.219 align:start position:0%
below prior year
 
01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
we've talked about this tax before but
 
01:24:09.490 --> 01:24:09.500 align:start position:0%
increased use of video conferencing
 
01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
decreased use of VoIP or traditional
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
landlines or telephones and then shifts
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
in the allocation of building for what
 
01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
billing for Wireless plans from voice to
 
01:24:21.290 --> 01:24:21.300 align:start position:0%
data those are all things that impact
 
01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:23.689 align:start position:0%
data those are all things that impact
CST

01:24:23.689 --> 01:24:23.699 align:start position:0%
CST
 
01:24:26.689 --> 01:24:26.699 align:start position:0%
for 23 we have a pretty tight range
 
01:24:29.630 --> 01:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
we're looking at 28.8 million to 29.9
 
01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:31.030 align:start position:0%
we're looking at 28.8 million to 29.9
million

01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:24:35.930 --> 01:24:35.940 align:start position:0%
the low estimate assumes that we receive
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
2.3 million a month for the remainder of
 
01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
the Year why 2.3 million that is the
 
01:24:44.570 --> 01:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
most common amount that we have received
 
01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
in recent times for a monthly Revenue
 
01:24:49.610 --> 01:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
amount so if you told me today how much
 
01:24:51.050 --> 01:24:51.060 align:start position:0%
if you asked me today how much revenue
 
01:24:52.189 --> 01:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
do you think you're going to receive for
 
01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
CST this month I would say 2.3 million
 
01:24:57.050 --> 01:24:57.060 align:start position:0%
so we take that amount and we just plug
 
01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
it in for the rest of the year
 
01:25:01.550 --> 01:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
and the high assumes that our sustaining
 
01:25:05.149 --> 01:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
percent compared to Prior year is
 
01:25:08.209 --> 01:25:08.219 align:start position:0%
maintained through the end of the year
 
01:25:10.490 --> 01:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
this tax we have a negative growth rate
 
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
minus three percent to zero that's just
 
01:25:15.229 --> 01:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
generally the trend that we've been
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
seeing with this tax again it's a
 
01:25:19.790 --> 01:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
relatively small tax relatively small
 
01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
range that we're looking at for
 
01:25:23.159 --> 01:25:26.930 align:start position:0%
range that we're looking at for
CSD

01:25:26.930 --> 01:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:29.450 --> 01:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
representative Ames
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
on the increased use of video
 
01:25:33.649 --> 01:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
conferencing which I guess is mostly
 
01:25:36.290 --> 01:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
Zoom or that kind of thing
 
01:25:39.130 --> 01:25:39.140 align:start position:0%
um what's what are the figures there
 
01:25:41.630 --> 01:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
I don't have those
 
01:25:44.450 --> 01:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
um readily available because there is
 
01:25:48.370 --> 01:25:48.380 align:start position:0%
not a specific line on the CST return
 
01:25:52.850 --> 01:25:52.860 align:start position:0%
for video conferencing versus landline
 
01:25:55.729 --> 01:25:55.739 align:start position:0%
telephone versus Wireless talk
 
01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
um so the extent that you have a
 
01:25:59.149 --> 01:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
provider that is
 
01:26:01.250 --> 01:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
um performing any number of those
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
Services the amount is kind of all
 
01:26:04.149 --> 01:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
bundled together
 
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
so I don't have a breakout for each of
 
01:26:09.649 --> 01:26:09.659 align:start position:0%
those Individual Services unfortunately
 
01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
it would just it's more anecdotal as the
 
01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
result of audits and reviews of tax
 
01:26:18.649 --> 01:26:18.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:18.659 --> 01:26:20.209 align:start position:0%
 
um and

01:26:20.209 --> 01:26:20.219 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:26:22.129 --> 01:26:22.139 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering about to other people
 
01:26:24.890 --> 01:26:24.900 align:start position:0%
who should be paying or not paying is
 
01:26:27.709 --> 01:26:27.719 align:start position:0%
that an issue uh because this is sort of
 
01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:30.540 align:start position:0%
Novel and uh maybe unknown or maybe it's
 
01:26:32.689 --> 01:26:32.699 align:start position:0%
purposeful I don't know we have Auditors
 
01:26:34.850 --> 01:26:34.860 align:start position:0%
that are assigned to this this tax who
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
do reach out to businesses and um who
 
01:26:40.010 --> 01:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
operate in this Communications world to
 
01:26:41.689 --> 01:26:41.699 align:start position:0%
make sure that they are collecting and
 
01:26:44.570 --> 01:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:46.729 --> 01:26:46.739 align:start position:0%
representative homie
 
01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:50.639 align:start position:0%
thank you on the shift in allocation of
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
building billing of Wireless plans from
 
01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
voice to data on
 
01:26:57.950 --> 01:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
do you
 
01:27:00.649 --> 01:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that when you look into
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
that it when at least when I've drilled
 
01:27:07.370 --> 01:27:07.380 align:start position:0%
down six layers in Comcast spill to find
 
01:27:12.649 --> 01:27:12.659 align:start position:0%
how much I'm paying for voice that
 
01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
on they have shifted
 
01:27:20.450 --> 01:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
a lot more voice costs a awful lot less
 
01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
according to them than it used to do
 
01:27:27.530 --> 01:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
correct and that on they've been doing
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
that ever since
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
since they started combining into to
 
01:27:41.209 --> 01:27:41.219 align:start position:0%
Cable plus Everything Burns uh so do you
 
01:27:45.110 --> 01:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
are you able do you try to contest with
 
01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:46.189 align:start position:0%
are you able do you try to contest with
them

01:27:46.189 --> 01:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:27:48.649 --> 01:27:48.659 align:start position:0%
in terms of what they're actually
 
01:27:51.770 --> 01:27:51.780 align:start position:0%
charging for voice sure so you're
 
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
correct that the bundling of charges
 
01:27:57.050 --> 01:27:57.060 align:start position:0%
right so voice and data oh you can have
 
01:27:59.270 --> 01:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
your home phone and your cable and your
 
01:28:01.250 --> 01:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
internet access all on one bill and
 
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
here's one amount right that then needs
 
01:28:06.890 --> 01:28:06.900 align:start position:0%
to be split so that we know what portion
 
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
and the provider knows what portion is
 
01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
um relative to voice and therefore
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
subject to the tax
 
01:28:14.639 --> 01:28:15.189 align:start position:0%
subject to the tax
um

01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
it is difficult at times to see how that
 
01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:21.060 align:start position:0%
breakdown is done on your bill and
 
01:28:24.050 --> 01:28:24.060 align:start position:0%
you're correct that as time has gone on
 
01:28:26.990 --> 01:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
um people or the the allocation is less
 
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
towards voice and more towards internet
 
01:28:31.490 --> 01:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
access cable Etc
 
01:28:33.709 --> 01:28:33.719 align:start position:0%
um we do audit we do engage in
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
discussions with the providers about the
 
01:28:38.990 --> 01:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
amount that they're allocating between
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
those various buckets
 
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
and do you get anywhere it depends
 
01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
representative fellows are are there
 
01:28:51.050 --> 01:28:51.060 align:start position:0%
rules that govern how they do their
 
01:28:54.169 --> 01:28:54.179 align:start position:0%
allocation not necessarily
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
um so the the Only Rule really that
 
01:28:59.330 --> 01:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
we're following is that internet access
 
01:29:02.750 --> 01:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
is not subject to tax under the CST and
 
01:29:06.169 --> 01:29:06.179 align:start position:0%
cannot be subject to tax under CST so
 
01:29:10.430 --> 01:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
the portion that is data is not CST but
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
how they decide to allocate is really to
 
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
a large extent up to them we can
 
01:29:18.110 --> 01:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
challenge them on their reasonableness
 
01:29:21.410 --> 01:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
of that allocation if it were to say
 
01:29:24.890 --> 01:29:24.900 align:start position:0%
nothing is voice yet you're providing a
 
01:29:27.229 --> 01:29:27.239 align:start position:0%
landline that wouldn't be reasonable so
 
01:29:28.189 --> 01:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
that's where the kind of the
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
negotiations come in but there's nothing
 
01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
that says certain amounts have to go
 
01:29:33.649 --> 01:29:33.659 align:start position:0%
into each bucket
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
yes Phillip so are are there actual
 
01:29:41.090 --> 01:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
um regulations or rules that cover the
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
communications tax
 
01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
their statute and rules that cover it
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
yes statutes and rules yep okay
 
01:29:51.290 --> 01:29:51.300 align:start position:0%
okay under does it come under Department
 
01:29:54.229 --> 01:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
of Revenue Administration okay thanks
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
yeah and we would be the committee that
 
01:29:57.470 --> 01:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
would make those
 
01:29:59.090 --> 01:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
determinations if we wanted to change
 
01:30:03.410 --> 01:30:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:04.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
so fiscal year to date we are 28.6
 
01:30:17.330 --> 01:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
million or 23.8 percent ahead of plan or
 
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
2.8 million or 1.8 percent below prior
 
01:30:22.610 --> 01:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
year so to represent a spillsbury's
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
earlier Point again plan assumed
 
01:30:28.010 --> 01:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
um a real decline in the real estate
 
01:30:31.129 --> 01:30:31.139 align:start position:0%
market after we kind of saw a covid boom
 
01:30:32.810 --> 01:30:32.820 align:start position:0%
where a lot of people were moving to New
 
01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:34.250 align:start position:0%
where a lot of people were moving to New
Hampshire

01:30:34.250 --> 01:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
um so that's why we're so far ahead of
 
01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
plan but we are you know basically flat
 
01:30:40.970 --> 01:30:40.980 align:start position:0%
with with prior year
 
01:30:43.310 --> 01:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal year-to-date amounts are net of a
 
01:30:44.810 --> 01:30:44.820 align:start position:0%
five million dollar transfer to the
 
01:30:46.970 --> 01:30:46.980 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund that occurs in
 
01:30:50.810 --> 01:30:50.820 align:start position:0%
October of each year so we will estimate
 
01:30:53.629 --> 01:30:53.639 align:start position:0%
the gross grow the gross amount and then
 
01:30:55.129 --> 01:30:55.139 align:start position:0%
subtract the five million dollars
 
01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
because the five million dollars is
 
01:30:58.250 --> 01:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
money that we receive it just goes into
 
01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%
a dedicated fund
 
01:31:02.810 --> 01:31:02.820 align:start position:0%
things to consider mortgage rates of
 
01:31:05.149 --> 01:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
increase as we know median sale prices
 
01:31:09.050 --> 01:31:09.060 align:start position:0%
do remain high however the inventory is
 
01:31:12.290 --> 01:31:12.300 align:start position:0%
slowing significantly
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
um cost of building supplies and just
 
01:31:17.209 --> 01:31:17.219 align:start position:0%
the fact that homes are quite difficult
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
to afford for many people at this point
 
01:31:21.890 --> 01:31:21.900 align:start position:0%
the real estate market Peak was likely
 
01:31:25.850 --> 01:31:25.860 align:start position:0%
seen earlier this year we have seen a
 
01:31:27.649 --> 01:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
decline in the real estate transfer tax
 
01:31:30.890 --> 01:31:30.900 align:start position:0%
in January and February year-to-date
 
01:31:32.930 --> 01:31:32.940 align:start position:0%
amounts are showing a decline as well
 
01:31:35.629 --> 01:31:35.639 align:start position:0%
and I'll talk about those when we talk
 
01:31:39.050 --> 01:31:39.060 align:start position:0%
about the ranges for 23.
 
01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
but I'll pause for a second before I do
 
01:31:43.010 --> 01:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
this I see Hands representative ulery
 
01:31:45.470 --> 01:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
yeah just following up on your your
 
01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:48.179 align:start position:0%
comments about the the the percentage
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
decrease with the reevaluation that took
 
01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:51.709 align:start position:0%
decrease with the reevaluation that took
place

01:31:51.709 --> 01:31:51.719 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
that means that
 
01:32:00.050 --> 01:32:00.060 align:start position:0%
a 25 uh 25 uh 250 000 home is now worth
 
01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:01.390 align:start position:0%
a 25 uh 25 uh 250 000 home is now worth
roughly

01:32:01.390 --> 01:32:01.400 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
275 300 000 uh in broad spectrum sure
 
01:32:09.410 --> 01:32:09.420 align:start position:0%
which then inflates this number
 
01:32:13.250 --> 01:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
right regarding the housing market this
 
01:32:18.290 --> 01:32:18.300 align:start position:0%
is all an inflationary number
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
potentially so when we talk about Rhett
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
remember we're going to talk about the
 
01:32:25.310 --> 01:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
number of transactions right you need
 
01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:27.719 align:start position:0%
the sales to occur in order to collect
 
01:32:28.729 --> 01:32:28.739 align:start position:0%
the tax
 
01:32:31.850 --> 01:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
but you can have fewer sales at a much
 
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
higher value much higher amount and
 
01:32:37.790 --> 01:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
still see the tax either stay the same
 
01:32:41.090 --> 01:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
or increase and so to your point as as
 
01:32:43.490 --> 01:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
the values get driven up you don't need
 
01:32:45.950 --> 01:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
as many sales to generate the same
 
01:32:48.169 --> 01:32:48.179 align:start position:0%
amount of Revenue what we're likely
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
starting to see is that the number of
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
sales just is not enough anymore to keep
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
the revenue increasing those values have
 
01:33:01.189 --> 01:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
gotten too high other pressures have
 
01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
really cooled the real estate market and
 
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
so you need both the sale and the value
 
01:33:10.490 --> 01:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
but when they both start to have a
 
01:33:15.070 --> 01:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:17.810 --> 01:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
I think I saw you representative plett
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
and then we'll go to representative
 
01:33:21.890 --> 01:33:21.900 align:start position:0%
Southworth yeah uh this is one I'm more
 
01:33:24.590 --> 01:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
pessimistic than you are for Real Estate
 
01:33:27.010 --> 01:33:27.020 align:start position:0%
transfer attacks because the market
 
01:33:29.689 --> 01:33:29.699 align:start position:0%
rank considerably in the in the last few
 
01:33:32.450 --> 01:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
months within higher interest rates the
 
01:33:34.189 --> 01:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
start to reflect a little bit in the
 
01:33:37.070 --> 01:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
price of homes just a little bit but the
 
01:33:39.290 --> 01:33:39.300 align:start position:0%
slowdown in sales has been huge we'll
 
01:33:42.110 --> 01:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
talk about that in in a minute I I agree
 
01:33:45.050 --> 01:33:45.060 align:start position:0%
with you I may be cautiously optimistic
 
01:33:46.430 --> 01:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
for a couple of reasons and I'll talk
 
01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
about when we get to the ranges
 
01:33:51.410 --> 01:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
Ruby and self-rath
 
01:33:53.930 --> 01:33:53.940 align:start position:0%
um just to correct myself is this mainly
 
01:33:55.970 --> 01:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
connect um collected at the county level
 
01:33:57.890 --> 01:33:57.900 align:start position:0%
but you can see the communities where
 
01:33:59.629 --> 01:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
the properties were sold so you can do
 
01:34:01.370 --> 01:34:01.380 align:start position:0%
it both ways correct so the
 
01:34:03.169 --> 01:34:03.179 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth is correct
 
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
this tax is collected by the counties at
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
the time that they put the stamp on your
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
tax deed
 
01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
um or your transfer deed and then they
 
01:34:13.550 --> 01:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
remit it to us on a monthly basis so we
 
01:34:16.250 --> 01:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
know the amount for each County so we
 
01:34:17.870 --> 01:34:17.880 align:start position:0%
can look at County to County comparison
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
which we've done in some prior
 
01:34:19.199 --> 01:34:22.250 align:start position:0%
which we've done in some prior
presentations

01:34:22.250 --> 01:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:31.790 align:start position:0%
 
do

01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:34:34.250 --> 01:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
do we
 
01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:37.189 align:start position:0%
do we
um

01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
do we know on whether
 
01:34:47.110 --> 01:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
the people who are really afraid of uh
 
01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
large corporations coming in and buying
 
01:34:53.930 --> 01:34:53.940 align:start position:0%
up a lot of Housing and then turning it
 
01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
into high-level rentals that used to be
 
01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
for the residents on if that is actually
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
not happening in New Hampshire at all I
 
01:35:06.169 --> 01:35:06.179 align:start position:0%
don't have any information on that on
 
01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
the realtors association might that's
 
01:35:11.390 --> 01:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
not any data that we would have but I I
 
01:35:14.270 --> 01:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
have heard that concern as well if that
 
01:35:16.370 --> 01:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
concern was correct and it may be that
 
01:35:18.169 --> 01:35:18.179 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's Market is not terribly
 
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
attractive at National levels but on
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
that would be a counter effect correct
 
01:35:30.890 --> 01:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:34.729 --> 01:35:34.739 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis so I'm I one of
 
01:35:37.729 --> 01:35:37.739 align:start position:0%
the things like you would track on the
 
01:35:40.250 --> 01:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
municipal level would be the number of
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
building permits issued is do you are
 
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
you taking
 
01:35:47.090 --> 01:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
um that into account so we don't have
 
01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
data for this specific number of
 
01:35:51.229 --> 01:35:51.239 align:start position:0%
building permits issued but you know
 
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
when you see cost of building supplies
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
um that just the number of new builds
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
that's something anecdotally that we
 
01:36:00.890 --> 01:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
hear about in the market and certainly
 
01:36:03.110 --> 01:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
if Builders are not building new homes
 
01:36:06.110 --> 01:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
then those sales cannot occur so it's
 
01:36:07.550 --> 01:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
definitely something I think that is
 
01:36:10.010 --> 01:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
impacting Rhett
 
01:36:12.649 --> 01:36:12.659 align:start position:0%
um but we again don't have that specific
 
01:36:15.050 --> 01:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
building permit data it's more just
 
01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:23.390 --> 01:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
representative Olney
 
01:36:26.330 --> 01:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
could I just add to that that
 
01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
building permits per se are not a very
 
01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
good indicator at this point we've lost
 
01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
at least 40 percent of the builders that
 
01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
we're going to build that had permits in
 
01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
the last six months
 
01:36:42.050 --> 01:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
so your point being that the permit may
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
be pulled but the build may never happen
 
01:36:47.649 --> 01:36:47.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:53.390 --> 01:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
okay so range for fiscal year 23.
 
01:36:55.450 --> 01:36:55.460 align:start position:0%
so the low
 
01:36:58.669 --> 01:36:58.679 align:start position:0%
assumes that fiscal year-to-date Revenue
 
01:37:03.290 --> 01:37:03.300 align:start position:0%
through Monday so taking basically as
 
01:37:05.629 --> 01:37:05.639 align:start position:0%
much revenue as we can
 
01:37:05.639 --> 01:37:07.189 align:start position:0%
much revenue as we can
um

01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:11.450 --> 01:37:11.460 align:start position:0%
is 3.4 percent below prior year and so
 
01:37:13.250 --> 01:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
we assume that that's going to be
 
01:37:15.410 --> 01:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
maintained through the rest of the year
 
01:37:18.890 --> 01:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
so we have as I mentioned seen a decline
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
compared to Prior year in both January
 
01:37:25.490 --> 01:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
and now February revenues and so we're
 
01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
kind of assuming that that we are on the
 
01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
downward Trend and that remains through
 
01:37:33.530 --> 01:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
the rest of the year the high assumes
 
01:37:35.810 --> 01:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
that the fiscal year-to-date percentage
 
01:37:38.209 --> 01:37:38.219 align:start position:0%
that we saw at the end of December which
 
01:37:41.209 --> 01:37:41.219 align:start position:0%
was a 5.4 percent increase over prior
 
01:37:44.090 --> 01:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
year is maintained through the rest of
 
01:37:45.770 --> 01:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
the year so at the end of December we
 
01:37:49.550 --> 01:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
were 5.4 percent ahead of Prior year but
 
01:37:52.850 --> 01:37:52.860 align:start position:0%
through Monday we were 3.4 percent below
 
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
so that's the kind of shift that we
 
01:37:57.410 --> 01:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
think we're seeing
 
01:38:00.410 --> 01:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
the reason why I included the amounts
 
01:38:03.470 --> 01:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
through December as the high option is
 
01:38:06.530 --> 01:38:06.540 align:start position:0%
because January and February tend to be
 
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
very low ret months anyway it's you know
 
01:38:12.590 --> 01:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
not a lot of people are searching for
 
01:38:14.810 --> 01:38:14.820 align:start position:0%
homes around the holidays it's the dead
 
01:38:17.450 --> 01:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
of winter maybe you're looking for a ski
 
01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
condo but you know for a lot of people
 
01:38:20.750 --> 01:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
it's not the time of year that they come
 
01:38:22.490 --> 01:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
looking to buy a beautiful lake house
 
01:38:26.169 --> 01:38:26.179 align:start position:0%
for instance so I'm cautiously
 
01:38:30.370 --> 01:38:30.380 align:start position:0%
optimistic that the decline that we see
 
01:38:34.850 --> 01:38:34.860 align:start position:0%
in January and February is really just a
 
01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
normal decline it's a normal slowing
 
01:38:39.890 --> 01:38:39.900 align:start position:0%
that happens this time of year
 
01:38:42.770 --> 01:38:42.780 align:start position:0%
and that it may be by taking the
 
01:38:45.050 --> 01:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
year-to-date data through Monday maybe a
 
01:38:47.090 --> 01:38:47.100 align:start position:0%
little bit too optimistic so that's why
 
01:38:49.729 --> 01:38:49.739 align:start position:0%
I gave kind of both options
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
um the range is again still relatively
 
01:38:56.689 --> 01:38:56.699 align:start position:0%
tight 225 million to 232 million
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
for 24 and 25 we assume 24 will be a
 
01:39:05.090 --> 01:39:05.100 align:start position:0%
negative five percent to zero growth so
 
01:39:07.370 --> 01:39:07.380 align:start position:0%
we do we are assuming that we have seen
 
01:39:10.610 --> 01:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
a peak and we are going to decline
 
01:39:13.129 --> 01:39:13.139 align:start position:0%
um but then 25 is negative two percent
 
01:39:15.649 --> 01:39:15.659 align:start position:0%
to two percent negative 2 to positive
 
01:39:15.659 --> 01:39:17.689 align:start position:0%
to two percent negative 2 to positive
two

01:39:17.689 --> 01:39:17.699 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:39:19.610 --> 01:39:19.620 align:start position:0%
um that assumes that we may continue to
 
01:39:22.310 --> 01:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
decline from our Peak but also you know
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
anecdotally we are hearing there are
 
01:39:26.330 --> 01:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
people that do want to buy houses
 
01:39:27.709 --> 01:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
um they're waiting for the market to
 
01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
cool they're waiting for those prices to
 
01:39:31.729 --> 01:39:31.739 align:start position:0%
come down so those prices come down and
 
01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
the Tran the volume of transaction goes
 
01:39:36.709 --> 01:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
up that's okay that might produce growth
 
01:39:39.110 --> 01:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
because the prices are so high they can
 
01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
come down as long as the transactions
 
01:39:43.129 --> 01:39:43.139 align:start position:0%
are happening we could still see growth
 
01:39:44.750 --> 01:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
so that's how we kind of get to the
 
01:39:52.189 --> 01:39:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:52.199 --> 01:39:53.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:39:57.649 --> 01:39:57.659 align:start position:0%
last one utility property tax on page
 
01:39:57.659 --> 01:39:58.669 align:start position:0%
last one utility property tax on page
nine

01:39:58.669 --> 01:39:58.679 align:start position:0%
nine
 
01:40:01.250 --> 01:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
we are one hundred thousand or half a
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
percent ahead of plan we're basically
 
01:40:04.669 --> 01:40:04.679 align:start position:0%
right on plan for the year we are
 
01:40:06.890 --> 01:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
slightly below prior year at two hundred
 
01:40:10.970 --> 01:40:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:12.890 --> 01:40:12.900 align:start position:0%
um we can see fluctuations in property
 
01:40:15.290 --> 01:40:15.300 align:start position:0%
value new taxable property can be
 
01:40:18.410 --> 01:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
destructed constructed and to the extent
 
01:40:21.050 --> 01:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
that taxpayers have a credit
 
01:40:22.910 --> 01:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
um on file they can utilize those
 
01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
credits and that can impact the revenues
 
01:40:30.110 --> 01:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
our range for upt for 23 is 40.7 million
 
01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
to 44.9
 
01:40:35.570 --> 01:40:35.580 align:start position:0%
the low is actual year to date with plan
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
for the remainder of the year and the
 
01:40:41.149 --> 01:40:41.159 align:start position:0%
high assumes year-to-date uh Revenue
 
01:40:44.149 --> 01:40:44.159 align:start position:0%
with sustaining percent versus prior
 
01:40:47.149 --> 01:40:47.159 align:start position:0%
year maintained through the end of the
 
01:40:47.159 --> 01:40:50.030 align:start position:0%
year maintained through the end of the
year

01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:52.250 --> 01:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
growth range small
 
01:40:54.410 --> 01:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
zero to three percent
 
01:40:57.129 --> 01:40:57.139 align:start position:0%
um this tax performs pretty consistently
 
01:41:01.209 --> 01:41:01.219 align:start position:0%
around the 40 to 45
 
01:41:04.850 --> 01:41:04.860 align:start position:0%
million dollar range so I'm not a lot of
 
01:41:07.790 --> 01:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
fluctuation in this tax from year to
 
01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:11.270 align:start position:0%
fluctuation in this tax from year to
year

01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:15.709 --> 01:41:15.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:19.010 --> 01:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
did you say you just mentioned not a lot
 
01:41:21.770 --> 01:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
of change yeah a lot of change has taken
 
01:41:23.930 --> 01:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
place the
 
01:41:26.350 --> 01:41:26.360 align:start position:0%
uh I forget the name of the Northeast
 
01:41:28.729 --> 01:41:28.739 align:start position:0%
sustainability project or whatever it's
 
01:41:28.739 --> 01:41:30.050 align:start position:0%
sustainability project or whatever it's
called

01:41:30.050 --> 01:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
called
 
01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
um changing the size of the cables
 
01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
they're going up which should have uh
 
01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
increased the par the upt substantially
 
01:41:42.590 --> 01:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
because a 10 kilowatt or kilovolt cable
 
01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
is this big and the other one's this big
 
01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:46.370 align:start position:0%
is this big and the other one's this big
um

01:41:46.370 --> 01:41:46.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
that's a good point I guess my point is
 
01:41:51.770 --> 01:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
maybe as overall the taxes is fairly
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
consistent in 40 to 45 million but the
 
01:41:57.050 --> 01:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
tax is made up of a variety of entity
 
01:41:59.870 --> 01:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
types or utility types right so you may
 
01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
see one entity type that has an increase
 
01:42:05.330 --> 01:42:05.340 align:start position:0%
in value while another entity or another
 
01:42:09.229 --> 01:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
utility type is falling in value so you
 
01:42:11.209 --> 01:42:11.219 align:start position:0%
know if I'm not saying that every
 
01:42:14.090 --> 01:42:14.100 align:start position:0%
utility utility property every year is
 
01:42:17.390 --> 01:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
seeing the same value but as a whole the
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
values have been roughly consistent year
 
01:42:22.250 --> 01:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
to year but yes you can see individual
 
01:42:23.930 --> 01:42:23.940 align:start position:0%
fluctuations based on the type of
 
01:42:25.189 --> 01:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
utility or service that they're
 
01:42:25.199 --> 01:42:29.109 align:start position:0%
utility or service that they're
providing

01:42:29.109 --> 01:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:31.490 --> 01:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
representative almi
 
01:42:34.370 --> 01:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
thank you I thought
 
01:42:37.729 --> 01:42:37.739 align:start position:0%
that I remembered that the
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
utility property tax is based on
 
01:42:44.870 --> 01:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
assessments that are done every year
 
01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
from the dra on and that it's relatively
 
01:42:53.689 --> 01:42:53.699 align:start position:0%
easy to track especially this late in
 
01:42:54.729 --> 01:42:54.739 align:start position:0%
the year
 
01:42:59.450 --> 01:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
how much is actually going to come in so
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
at this point in the year
 
01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
um generally yes we have issued our
 
01:43:05.810 --> 01:43:05.820 align:start position:0%
values we determine the values for all
 
01:43:08.570 --> 01:43:08.580 align:start position:0%
these utilities so we know what Revenue
 
01:43:10.490 --> 01:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
should come in based on on our
 
01:43:12.290 --> 01:43:12.300 align:start position:0%
assessments every year we have a number
 
01:43:14.270 --> 01:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
of utilities that challenge those values
 
01:43:16.250 --> 01:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
that appeal those values and so we have
 
01:43:18.229 --> 01:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
to work through that appeal process so
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
that's kind of what we're getting at
 
01:43:21.050 --> 01:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
with the credits
 
01:43:23.629 --> 01:43:23.639 align:start position:0%
um that sort of thing if so that's some
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
way that the fluctuation exists and why
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
we don't always know exactly the amount
 
01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
of money that we will bring in about
 
01:43:35.570 --> 01:43:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:37.790 --> 01:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative fellows did you
 
01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
I was going to try to look it up but
 
01:43:46.970 --> 01:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
what exactly what is covered by the
 
01:43:50.689 --> 01:43:50.699 align:start position:0%
utility tax obviously polls and so it's
 
01:43:52.850 --> 01:43:52.860 align:start position:0%
it's all utility property
 
01:43:54.590 --> 01:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
um the rate is six dollars and sixty
 
01:43:58.250 --> 01:43:58.260 align:start position:0%
cents per thousand dollars of value we
 
01:44:00.109 --> 01:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
determine the value as representative
 
01:44:02.689 --> 01:44:02.699 align:start position:0%
Ami mentioned at the dra so it's
 
01:44:05.930 --> 01:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
everything from hydroelectric dams
 
01:44:08.510 --> 01:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
um to your large
 
01:44:11.530 --> 01:44:11.540 align:start position:0%
um you know generation facilities
 
01:44:14.990 --> 01:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
to gas pipelines any sort of utility
 
01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.850 align:start position:0%
to gas pipelines any sort of utility
value

01:44:16.850 --> 01:44:16.860 align:start position:0%
value
 
01:44:19.070 --> 01:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
or utility property excuse me
 
01:44:21.530 --> 01:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
representative plut yes how do you set
 
01:44:23.330 --> 01:44:23.340 align:start position:0%
that value is it a combination of
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
netbook and replacement or whatever tell
 
01:44:29.390 --> 01:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
me correct it can depend on the utility
 
01:44:32.510 --> 01:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
and the the area that they operate in
 
01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
the utilities in May of every year
 
01:44:36.770 --> 01:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
provide us
 
01:44:39.109 --> 01:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
um with their financial information and
 
01:44:41.330 --> 01:44:41.340 align:start position:0%
we use that financial information to
 
01:44:43.010 --> 01:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
come up with the values whether we use
 
01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
Netbook book discounted cash flow Etc
 
01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
the combination can depend on the type
 
01:44:50.450 --> 01:44:50.460 align:start position:0%
of utility but we value each utility
 
01:44:50.460 --> 01:44:52.070 align:start position:0%
of utility but we value each utility
individually

01:44:52.070 --> 01:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
individually
 
01:44:55.010 --> 01:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
yes uh if you have a
 
01:44:57.470 --> 01:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
two billion dollars on a plant
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
but it's not producing a kilowatt hour
 
01:45:01.370 --> 01:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
because it's not competitive what's the
 
01:45:04.729 --> 01:45:04.739 align:start position:0%
value so the potential for Revenue to be
 
01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
generated is part of what goes into the
 
01:45:09.649 --> 01:45:09.659 align:start position:0%
value which is why we have the utilities
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
provide us with their financial
 
01:45:12.530 --> 01:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
information so we do take that into
 
01:45:14.330 --> 01:45:14.340 align:start position:0%
account in the values
 
01:45:16.729 --> 01:45:16.739 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg thank you madam
 
01:45:18.410 --> 01:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking this question
 
01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
uh you say they send your reports do you
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
do actual visual
 
01:45:26.810 --> 01:45:26.820 align:start position:0%
uh assessments going out
 
01:45:28.970 --> 01:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
not unless sometimes the utilities ask
 
01:45:31.129 --> 01:45:31.139 align:start position:0%
us to come and view
 
01:45:33.229 --> 01:45:33.239 align:start position:0%
um especially during uh maybe an appeal
 
01:45:35.810 --> 01:45:35.820 align:start position:0%
of their valuation but typically we
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
would use the information the financial
 
01:45:39.530 --> 01:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
information and other information that's
 
01:45:42.890 --> 01:45:42.900 align:start position:0%
provided to us so we do not go out and
 
01:45:45.290 --> 01:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
visually inspect every year but um from
 
01:45:47.109 --> 01:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
time to time we will go out and visit
 
01:45:50.030 --> 01:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative already has a question on
 
01:45:52.669 --> 01:45:52.679 align:start position:0%
the statement first in that question
 
01:45:54.649 --> 01:45:54.659 align:start position:0%
um this committee worked very very hard
 
01:45:57.590 --> 01:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
to take the evaluation of the utilities
 
01:46:00.890 --> 01:46:00.900 align:start position:0%
away from local properties because we
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
had a situation in New Hampshire where
 
01:46:07.010 --> 01:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
town a was valuing a telephone pole that
 
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
costs twenty six thousand dollars to put
 
01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
in some of them were charging twenty six
 
01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year for the poll and
 
01:46:16.010 --> 01:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
the town a hundred yards away over the
 
01:46:18.890 --> 01:46:18.900 align:start position:0%
Town Line was charging zero so we
 
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
leveled it out that's one thing uh so
 
01:46:24.890 --> 01:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
that everyone understands the
 
01:46:27.709 --> 01:46:27.719 align:start position:0%
second issue is you're doing property
 
01:46:30.649 --> 01:46:30.659 align:start position:0%
this is a property evaluation
 
01:46:32.930 --> 01:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
they have an appeal to you to determine
 
01:46:35.090 --> 01:46:35.100 align:start position:0%
whether you did or do they have an
 
01:46:37.550 --> 01:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
appeal to the land use Court
 
01:46:39.770 --> 01:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
so they have an appeal to us first if
 
01:46:41.209 --> 01:46:41.219 align:start position:0%
they're not satisfied with the results
 
01:46:43.189 --> 01:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
here then they can go to the board of
 
01:46:44.990 --> 01:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
tax and land appeals or to Superior
 
01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.510 align:start position:0%
tax and land appeals or to Superior
Court

01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:49.609 --> 01:46:49.619 align:start position:0%
and that's how it works for all of our
 
01:46:51.790 --> 01:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayers if you appeal a business tax
 
01:46:54.590 --> 01:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
assessment you start with our
 
01:46:56.450 --> 01:46:56.460 align:start position:0%
Administrative Hearings process within
 
01:46:59.390 --> 01:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
dra which yes sits at dra but we work
 
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
very hard to keep them walled off
 
01:47:03.530 --> 01:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
um and then if you're not satisfied
 
01:47:05.209 --> 01:47:05.219 align:start position:0%
there then you have the opportunity to
 
01:47:05.219 --> 01:47:13.129 align:start position:0%
there then you have the opportunity to
proceed

01:47:13.129 --> 01:47:13.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
new Superior Court judge on land use is
 
01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:17.209 align:start position:0%
new Superior Court judge on land use is
approved

01:47:17.209 --> 01:47:17.219 align:start position:0%
approved
 
01:47:19.550 --> 01:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
another field of expertise needs to be
 
01:47:22.609 --> 01:47:22.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:24.590 --> 01:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
with our purview so I cannot answer that
 
01:47:26.810 --> 01:47:26.820 align:start position:0%
question however representative
 
01:47:29.090 --> 01:47:29.100 align:start position:0%
Schamberg has a question if I could
 
01:47:30.709 --> 01:47:30.719 align:start position:0%
interrupt for just one minute just to
 
01:47:32.570 --> 01:47:32.580 align:start position:0%
address representative uluri's point
 
01:47:36.290 --> 01:47:36.300 align:start position:0%
about the local values so the dra your
 
01:47:38.810 --> 01:47:38.820 align:start position:0%
correct assesses the utility property
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
value for all of the utilities in the
 
01:47:44.450 --> 01:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
state some municipalities utilize our
 
01:47:47.810 --> 01:47:47.820 align:start position:0%
values others decide to assess their own
 
01:47:49.910 --> 01:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
values and use their own contract
 
01:47:52.609 --> 01:47:52.619 align:start position:0%
assessor or in-house assessor to perform
 
01:47:55.550 --> 01:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
that work you mentioned earlier this
 
01:47:57.410 --> 01:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
week the work that representative abrami
 
01:48:01.310 --> 01:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
did with a commission that developed HB
 
01:48:04.149 --> 01:48:04.159 align:start position:0%
700 commission
 
01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
that was to make the valuation of
 
01:48:13.790 --> 01:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
transmission facilities
 
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
or transmission property uniform
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
there was additional work done that is
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
still in a study committee I believe to
 
01:48:24.890 --> 01:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
look at making the valuation of
 
01:48:27.229 --> 01:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
generation and
 
01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
distribution I might be mixing up
 
01:48:32.209 --> 01:48:32.219 align:start position:0%
distribution and transmission but anyway
 
01:48:34.370 --> 01:48:34.380 align:start position:0%
to make that more uniform that work
 
01:48:36.410 --> 01:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
hasn't concluded yet but so you can
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
still see different values from town to
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
town and Between the States state and
 
01:48:44.930 --> 01:48:44.940 align:start position:0%
the municipalities in those areas but
 
01:48:48.050 --> 01:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:52.129 --> 01:48:52.139 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh uh just
 
01:48:55.430 --> 01:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
in the dra does
 
01:48:57.470 --> 01:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
Town evaluations of real estate
 
01:49:00.790 --> 01:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
properties right every year we review
 
01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
the reassessments and reappraisals that
 
01:49:06.350 --> 01:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
are done in the municipalities and we
 
01:49:09.890 --> 01:49:09.900 align:start position:0%
ensure that the municipalities are
 
01:49:11.810 --> 01:49:11.820 align:start position:0%
meeting the Constitutional requirement
 
01:49:14.810 --> 01:49:14.820 align:start position:0%
to fully reevaluate all property every
 
01:49:16.010 --> 01:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
five years
 
01:49:17.629 --> 01:49:17.639 align:start position:0%
but we don't actually do the work the
 
01:49:20.030 --> 01:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
work is done at the Town level
 
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
we just monitor it representative yes
 
01:49:26.689 --> 01:49:26.699 align:start position:0%
this utility property tax
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
is passed on to electric rate payers
 
01:49:32.030 --> 01:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
right so it's paid by rate payers likely
 
01:49:33.530 --> 01:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
it's likely that the business passes
 
01:49:35.390 --> 01:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
that on that that is something that
 
01:49:37.370 --> 01:49:37.380 align:start position:0%
could happen yes
 
01:49:39.050 --> 01:49:39.060 align:start position:0%
representative Phillips
 
01:49:42.410 --> 01:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
uh thank you is this utility tax is this
 
01:49:45.649 --> 01:49:45.659 align:start position:0%
the tax that was developed in
 
01:49:50.030 --> 01:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the education lawsuit
 
01:49:53.570 --> 01:49:53.580 align:start position:0%
or that is before my time but to your
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
point this tax goes 100 into the
 
01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
education trust fund so these utilities
 
01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
do not pay at this local level they do
 
01:50:07.070 --> 01:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
not pay the Statewide education property
 
01:50:08.810 --> 01:50:08.820 align:start position:0%
taxes because that's that's where it
 
01:50:12.109 --> 01:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
came from okay thank you 20 years ago
 
01:50:14.570 --> 01:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
representative Bowman
 
01:50:17.090 --> 01:50:17.100 align:start position:0%
thank you it was part of the original
 
01:50:21.050 --> 01:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
and it went in there and got forgotten
 
01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative Britain
 
01:50:29.330 --> 01:50:29.340 align:start position:0%
I think Madam chair so regarding the um
 
01:50:31.790 --> 01:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
assessment uh I know we were involved in
 
01:50:35.209 --> 01:50:35.219 align:start position:0%
a a rather large uh lawsuit by two
 
01:50:35.219 --> 01:50:36.530 align:start position:0%
a a rather large uh lawsuit by two
generators

01:50:36.530 --> 01:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
generators
 
01:50:40.669 --> 01:50:40.679 align:start position:0%
um and we had a an assessor that most of
 
01:50:42.910 --> 01:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
the other towns that already had as well
 
01:50:46.010 --> 01:50:46.020 align:start position:0%
and apparently he didn't do a very great
 
01:50:48.169 --> 01:50:48.179 align:start position:0%
job on on doing that we ended up like
 
01:50:50.330 --> 01:50:50.340 align:start position:0%
with a multi-town
 
01:50:52.910 --> 01:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
um settlement so that was simply because
 
01:50:58.370 --> 01:50:58.380 align:start position:0%
we ignored the assessments that dra did
 
01:51:01.729 --> 01:51:01.739 align:start position:0%
yes so municipalities have the option to
 
01:51:04.850 --> 01:51:04.860 align:start position:0%
use our assessed value for the utility
 
01:51:06.570 --> 01:51:06.580 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
01:51:06.580 --> 01:51:06.890 align:start position:0%
property tax
[Music]

01:51:06.890 --> 01:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:51:06.900 --> 01:51:09.050 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:51:09.050 --> 01:51:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:11.570 --> 01:51:11.580 align:start position:0%
many towns do not
 
01:51:11.580 --> 01:51:12.470 align:start position:0%
many towns do not
um

01:51:12.470 --> 01:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:14.050 --> 01:51:14.060 align:start position:0%
in general
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
the amounts that are the assessed value
 
01:51:20.689 --> 01:51:20.699 align:start position:0%
amounts that are determined by a
 
01:51:22.729 --> 01:51:22.739 align:start position:0%
contract assessor or a local assessor
 
01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
employed by the town that the
 
01:51:26.810 --> 01:51:26.820 align:start position:0%
municipality may use they tend to be
 
01:51:29.810 --> 01:51:29.820 align:start position:0%
higher than the amounts that the dra has
 
01:51:33.290 --> 01:51:33.300 align:start position:0%
determined so there's pluses and minuses
 
01:51:35.390 --> 01:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
to to that
 
01:51:37.129 --> 01:51:37.139 align:start position:0%
thank you I would say there's a lot of
 
01:51:39.770 --> 01:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
minuses actually
 
01:51:41.330 --> 01:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
they put an r in your name for some
 
01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
reason I've been saying it wrong I
 
01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:43.970 align:start position:0%
reason I've been saying it wrong I
apologize

01:51:43.970 --> 01:51:43.980 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
any other questions right now
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
representative this covers more than
 
01:51:51.109 --> 01:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
just electric facilities does it not
 
01:51:53.209 --> 01:51:53.219 align:start position:0%
does the planet of gas as well correct
 
01:51:56.090 --> 01:51:56.100 align:start position:0%
and anything else correct yep gas
 
01:51:58.129 --> 01:51:58.139 align:start position:0%
electric transmission generation coal
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
generation nuclear
 
01:52:03.229 --> 01:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
um but gas you said gas pipelines yep
 
01:52:06.109 --> 01:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
gas as well okay and any other form of
 
01:52:06.119 --> 01:52:07.129 align:start position:0%
gas as well okay and any other form of
energy

01:52:07.129 --> 01:52:07.139 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:52:07.139 --> 01:52:08.930 align:start position:0%
energy
wind

01:52:08.930 --> 01:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
wind
 
01:52:16.370 --> 01:52:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:18.890 --> 01:52:18.900 align:start position:0%
one more apologize representative Army
 
01:52:23.330 --> 01:52:23.340 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you on solar is there a
 
01:52:25.370 --> 01:52:25.380 align:start position:0%
floor on on
 
01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
when you have to start paying that so it
 
01:52:31.310 --> 01:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
would just be very large solar
 
01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:33.169 align:start position:0%
would just be very large solar
um

01:52:33.169 --> 01:52:33.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:34.609 --> 01:52:34.619 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer to that at the
 
01:52:37.129 --> 01:52:37.139 align:start position:0%
time somebody with it on their rooftop
 
01:52:39.890 --> 01:52:39.900 align:start position:0%
it would not be it would not be someone
 
01:52:42.050 --> 01:52:42.060 align:start position:0%
with it on their rooftop they would it
 
01:52:43.609 --> 01:52:43.619 align:start position:0%
would need to be a larger scale but I
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:54.229 --> 01:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:57.229 --> 01:52:57.239 align:start position:0%
okay any other
 
01:53:00.410 --> 01:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
okay last page page 10 it's just a
 
01:53:01.550 --> 01:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
summary of everything that we went
 
01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:02.750 align:start position:0%
summary of everything that we went
through

01:53:02.750 --> 01:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:53:07.490 --> 01:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
so it's One Stop Shop to look at the dra
 
01:53:09.709 --> 01:53:09.719 align:start position:0%
high and lows for 23 and then the high
 
01:53:13.129 --> 01:53:13.139 align:start position:0%
and low growth ranges for 24 and 25 so
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's really just meant to be a reference
 
01:53:17.629 --> 01:53:17.639 align:start position:0%
for you we talked about all the
 
01:53:22.750 --> 01:53:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
excellent presentation we have a lot to
 
01:53:27.530 --> 01:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
think about I'm sure we'll have
 
01:53:29.930 --> 01:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
questions but thank you this is very
 
01:53:32.030 --> 01:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
easy for me to read at least and I
 
01:53:34.490 --> 01:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
learned a lot so thank you okay we can
 
01:53:36.590 --> 01:53:36.600 align:start position:0%
take a break I think Chris want to come
 
01:53:39.290 --> 01:53:39.300 align:start position:0%
back at one that works for me okay you
 
01:53:40.490 --> 01:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
can start with the worksheet I can go
 
01:53:42.290 --> 01:53:42.300 align:start position:0%
over what that the function of that will
 
01:53:44.030 --> 01:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
be for this committee
 
01:53:45.770 --> 01:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
um and maybe there's some taxes or some
 
01:53:48.709 --> 01:53:48.719 align:start position:0%
revenues we can discuss as maybe getting
 
01:53:50.810 --> 01:53:50.820 align:start position:0%
done today that would be a good thing
 
01:53:52.490 --> 01:53:52.500 align:start position:0%
about fish and game and Highway funds
 
01:53:54.770 --> 01:53:54.780 align:start position:0%
since those tend to be two of the
 
01:53:57.590 --> 01:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
revenue areas that come last let's get
 
01:53:59.689 --> 01:53:59.699 align:start position:0%
them out of the way first
 
01:54:01.070 --> 01:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
um so we have a sense of arrangement
 
01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
today we can check something off the
 
01:54:04.669 --> 01:54:04.679 align:start position:0%
list is that the goal and swept I think
 
01:54:06.169 --> 01:54:06.179 align:start position:0%
maybe swept might be another one we
 
01:54:07.970 --> 01:54:07.980 align:start position:0%
could address today you'll have to help
 
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
me understand parliamentarian do we just
 
01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
do straw votes at this point or do we
 
01:54:16.070 --> 01:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
actually have to go into an executive
 
01:54:18.410 --> 01:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
session or there's no executive session
 
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
necessary it's just if the committee can
 
01:54:22.970 --> 01:54:22.980 align:start position:0%
come to a straw poll agreement we'll put
 
01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
the whatever you agree to we'll put into
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
the resolution
 
01:54:27.950 --> 01:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
that this committee will look at make
 
01:54:29.450 --> 01:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
sure it's what you've all agreed to and
 
01:54:31.550 --> 01:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
then you move forward to the full full
 
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
floor okay oh representative what are
 
01:54:38.050 --> 01:54:38.060 align:start position:0%
you saying are budgets based on straw
 
01:54:41.810 --> 01:54:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:44.030 --> 01:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
question oh representative aim sorry
 
01:54:46.310 --> 01:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
sorry just uh
 
01:54:48.770 --> 01:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
what is your plan for the rest of the
 
01:54:52.070 --> 01:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:54.590 --> 01:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
I think we had planned to go from like
 
01:54:58.310 --> 01:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
one to 2 30 ish does that sound it
 
01:54:59.930 --> 01:54:59.940 align:start position:0%
depends on how long the committee wants
 
01:55:01.370 --> 01:55:01.380 align:start position:0%
to stay I'll be giving you either
 
01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
worksheet it's going to be really driven
 
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
by where you're ready to do some of the
 
01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
work in deciding some of the revenues
 
01:55:09.649 --> 01:55:09.659 align:start position:0%
how does that sound one to two thirty
 
01:55:11.570 --> 01:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
sound reasonable try to get something
 
01:55:14.570 --> 01:55:14.580 align:start position:0%
done yeah yes representative spilsbury
 
01:55:17.689 --> 01:55:17.699 align:start position:0%
is it an option to just carry on and
 
01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
break by 130.
 
01:55:24.890 --> 01:55:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
hey that's just my vote what do you guys
 
01:55:27.950 --> 01:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
think do you want to keep going and we
 
01:55:28.970 --> 01:55:28.980 align:start position:0%
could just take a five minute bathroom
 
01:55:31.129 --> 01:55:31.139 align:start position:0%
break or do you want to take lunch for
 
01:55:33.530 --> 01:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
half an hour tell me well I was gonna
 
01:55:35.450 --> 01:55:35.460 align:start position:0%
say about the other straw polls work
 
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
well but they might work well right this
 
01:55:39.189 --> 01:55:39.199 align:start position:0%
moment right absolutely
 
01:55:42.169 --> 01:55:42.179 align:start position:0%
tell me your thoughts folks about 12 30
 
01:55:43.790 --> 01:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
to 2.
 
01:55:49.209 --> 01:55:49.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:52.010 --> 01:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:55:54.649 --> 01:55:54.659 align:start position:0%
all right so the sensim hearing is that
 
01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
lunch is actually important and we'll
 
01:56:00.830 --> 01:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
come back at one and we'll go to 2 or 2
 
01:56:04.250 --> 01:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
30 depending on how we feel but no later
 
01:56:07.609 --> 01:56:07.619 align:start position:0%

welcome back Chris Shea is going to lead
 
03:12:14.330 --> 03:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:16.670 --> 03:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
jumping right in huh
 
03:12:18.710 --> 03:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
so everybody should have a document that
 
03:12:22.610 --> 03:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:25.250 --> 03:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
basically the organization sheet for
 
03:12:27.410 --> 03:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
03:12:31.010 --> 03:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
so each time start after today each time
 
03:12:32.750 --> 03:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
this committee meets and makes decisions
 
03:12:35.330 --> 03:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
I'll update this document and then
 
03:12:37.250 --> 03:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
you'll get a new version of it
 
03:12:38.690 --> 03:12:38.700 align:start position:0%
the version will be sent to you
 
03:12:40.849 --> 03:12:40.859 align:start position:0%
electronically as well as I'll provide
 
03:12:42.550 --> 03:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
the hard copies
 
03:12:44.750 --> 03:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
and it will also be available on our
 
03:12:46.910 --> 03:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
website every
 
03:12:48.650 --> 03:12:48.660 align:start position:0%
piece of information that has come
 
03:12:50.389 --> 03:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
through the to this committee related to
 
03:12:52.809 --> 03:12:52.819 align:start position:0%
revenues so all the economic briefings
 
03:12:55.790 --> 03:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
all the agency presentations that you've
 
03:12:58.010 --> 03:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
heard over the last couple of weeks all
 
03:12:59.929 --> 03:12:59.939 align:start position:0%
that information has been loaded onto
 
03:13:02.510 --> 03:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
our website so if you're remembering or
 
03:13:04.670 --> 03:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
recalling you know an agency said X in
 
03:13:06.170 --> 03:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
their presentation but you can't put
 
03:13:08.450 --> 03:13:08.460 align:start position:0%
your hands on your paper copy it is on
 
03:13:10.849 --> 03:13:10.859 align:start position:0%
our website and I'll send the link out a
 
03:13:12.830 --> 03:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
little later again today just to remind
 
03:13:12.840 --> 03:13:15.309 align:start position:0%
little later again today just to remind
people

03:13:15.309 --> 03:13:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:18.050 --> 03:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
this doesn't say Millions I assume it is
 
03:13:18.060 --> 03:13:21.710 align:start position:0%
this doesn't say Millions I assume it is
though

03:13:21.710 --> 03:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:23.929 --> 03:13:23.939 align:start position:0%
excuse me act to what what's your the
 
03:13:23.939 --> 03:13:25.250 align:start position:0%
excuse me act to what what's your the
numbers

03:13:25.250 --> 03:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
03:13:26.990 --> 03:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
so pay if you look right on the front
 
03:13:27.000 --> 03:13:30.889 align:start position:0%
so pay if you look right on the front
page

03:13:30.889 --> 03:13:30.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:33.230 --> 03:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
right at the bottom it says in millions
 
03:13:36.769 --> 03:13:36.779 align:start position:0%
I'll increase the font if you would like
 
03:13:43.250 --> 03:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:45.290 --> 03:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
so the document's broken into basically
 
03:13:47.389 --> 03:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
three sections you get your general fund
 
03:13:49.370 --> 03:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
and education trust funds your Highway
 
03:13:52.790 --> 03:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
funds and your fish and game funds that
 
03:13:53.990 --> 03:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
this committee is responsible for
 
03:13:56.210 --> 03:13:56.220 align:start position:0%
providing unrestricted Revenue estimates
 
03:13:56.220 --> 03:13:57.610 align:start position:0%
providing unrestricted Revenue estimates
for

03:13:57.610 --> 03:13:57.620 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:14:00.830 --> 03:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
the most of the play occurs in the
 
03:14:02.269 --> 03:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
general funds in the education trust
 
03:14:04.190 --> 03:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
fund that's where there's I would say a
 
03:14:05.330 --> 03:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
little bit more debate a little bit more
 
03:14:05.340 --> 03:14:06.950 align:start position:0%
little bit more debate a little bit more
questions

03:14:06.950 --> 03:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:14:14.630 --> 03:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:16.490 --> 03:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
you're going to see across the top
 
03:14:19.790 --> 03:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
you'll see column headings A B C D and
 
03:14:22.849 --> 03:14:22.859 align:start position:0%
just above that you'll see gen ETF
 
03:14:24.290 --> 03:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
that's just telling you that that
 
03:14:26.030 --> 03:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue source
 
03:14:28.130 --> 03:14:28.140 align:start position:0%
where it's deposited
 
03:14:30.410 --> 03:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
so if it's the business taxes it goes to
 
03:14:32.150 --> 03:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
the general fund and the education trust
 
03:14:34.610 --> 03:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
fund for the work you're doing at the
 
03:14:36.950 --> 03:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
start of this process you don't have to
 
03:14:38.150 --> 03:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
be concerned with that you're just
 
03:14:40.250 --> 03:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
coming up with a total number
 
03:14:42.290 --> 03:14:42.300 align:start position:0%
once you guys have some estimates made
 
03:14:46.370 --> 03:14:46.380 align:start position:0%
I'll do a split into those various funds
 
03:14:48.830 --> 03:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
and then provide back to you you know
 
03:14:50.210 --> 03:14:50.220 align:start position:0%
how much is going to education trust
 
03:14:51.650 --> 03:14:51.660 align:start position:0%
fund how much is going to the general
 
03:14:51.660 --> 03:14:54.410 align:start position:0%
fund how much is going to the general
fund

03:14:54.410 --> 03:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:56.570 --> 03:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
when you do your house resolution for
 
03:14:59.570 --> 03:14:59.580 align:start position:0%
revenues it's still combined
 
03:15:01.490 --> 03:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
but when we do the revenues in house
 
03:15:03.710 --> 03:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
bill one it splits It Out by education
 
03:15:05.570 --> 03:15:05.580 align:start position:0%
trust fund and
 
03:15:08.929 --> 03:15:08.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:11.570 --> 03:15:11.580 align:start position:0%
so moving down the sheet going down the
 
03:15:15.410 --> 03:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
rows so you get your various revenues
 
03:15:17.269 --> 03:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
in the headers so business taxes meals
 
03:15:19.010 --> 03:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
and rooms Tobacco liquor Etc going
 
03:15:19.020 --> 03:15:20.150 align:start position:0%
and rooms Tobacco liquor Etc going
across

03:15:20.150 --> 03:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
across
 
03:15:23.750 --> 03:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
Row one is fiscal year 2022.
 
03:15:25.550 --> 03:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
it gives you what the official plan was
 
03:15:28.309 --> 03:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 2022.
 
03:15:30.710 --> 03:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
and then what was actually collected and
 
03:15:33.170 --> 03:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
reported in the akfer
 
03:15:39.410 --> 03:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:41.570 --> 03:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
you move down to row eight
 
03:15:44.929 --> 03:15:44.939 align:start position:0%
you have the official plan again
 
03:15:46.730 --> 03:15:46.740 align:start position:0%
but now you have the governor's estimate
 
03:15:49.309 --> 03:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
which just came out yesterday the day
 
03:15:49.319 --> 03:15:50.990 align:start position:0%
which just came out yesterday the day
before

03:15:50.990 --> 03:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:15:53.690 --> 03:15:53.700 align:start position:0%
then you have a rows 11 and 12 it says
 
03:15:57.170 --> 03:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
agencies low and high estimates
 
03:15:59.150 --> 03:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
that's there due to what you saw today
 
03:16:02.809 --> 03:16:02.819 align:start position:0%
with dra where they give you a range
 
03:16:05.630 --> 03:16:05.640 align:start position:0%
once we have that range I will plug the
 
03:16:07.969 --> 03:16:07.979 align:start position:0%
range into these cells so that the
 
03:16:10.010 --> 03:16:10.020 align:start position:0%
committee has it in front of them
 
03:16:12.650 --> 03:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
and then row 13 would be where you would
 
03:16:14.750 --> 03:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
make your final estimates as to what you
 
03:16:17.330 --> 03:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
think the revenue might be
 
03:16:20.870 --> 03:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
you can see that under column D which is
 
03:16:23.210 --> 03:16:23.220 align:start position:0%
liquor transfer there's already a number
 
03:16:25.670 --> 03:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
in there of 130 million for for liquor
 
03:16:27.650 --> 03:16:27.660 align:start position:0%
because when they came to you
 
03:16:29.330 --> 03:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
they presented that as what they
 
03:16:35.030 --> 03:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:38.330 --> 03:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
that same exercise is done for 24 and
 
03:16:40.250 --> 03:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
fiscal 25.
 
03:16:42.950 --> 03:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
all these numbers
 
03:16:46.190 --> 03:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
will be based on current law
 
03:16:47.990 --> 03:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
so fortunately
 
03:16:50.870 --> 03:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
the governor didn't propose rate changes
 
03:16:53.510 --> 03:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
he didn't propose
 
03:16:55.370 --> 03:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
um you know other changes to the
 
03:16:56.809 --> 03:16:56.819 align:start position:0%
business tax such as there was last
 
03:16:56.819 --> 03:16:58.790 align:start position:0%
business tax such as there was last
biennium

03:16:58.790 --> 03:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
03:17:00.889 --> 03:17:00.899 align:start position:0%
so you don't see a lot of we won't have
 
03:17:02.570 --> 03:17:02.580 align:start position:0%
a lot of changes from what the governor
 
03:17:05.750 --> 03:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
said to what is in this document the
 
03:17:07.190 --> 03:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
only place you're going to see a change
 
03:17:09.410 --> 03:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
is in the CST
 
03:17:11.630 --> 03:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
the communication Services tax where the
 
03:17:13.790 --> 03:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
governor has said or has proposed that
 
03:17:16.250 --> 03:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
he believes that should be repealed in
 
03:17:17.450 --> 03:17:17.460 align:start position:0%
this document
 
03:17:19.190 --> 03:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's not there today but when you get it
 
03:17:20.690 --> 03:17:20.700 align:start position:0%
next time you'll see a number that would
 
03:17:22.490 --> 03:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
have been the base number the reason
 
03:17:23.990 --> 03:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
it's not there today is that I didn't
 
03:17:26.929 --> 03:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
have it yet from the governor's office
 
03:17:30.290 --> 03:17:30.300 align:start position:0%
so if you look at column G
 
03:17:31.910 --> 03:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
hou for fiscal year 24 you're going to
 
03:17:33.469 --> 03:17:33.479 align:start position:0%
see there's nothing there and the same
 
03:17:37.010 --> 03:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
for 25. uh yeah fiscal year 25.
 
03:17:38.870 --> 03:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
I'll populate that with a number which
 
03:17:41.210 --> 03:17:41.220 align:start position:0%
would be the base number
 
03:17:44.450 --> 03:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
and then if the house agrees that you
 
03:17:46.309 --> 03:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
think removing or repealing the
 
03:17:48.230 --> 03:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax is a good
 
03:17:48.240 --> 03:17:49.849 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax is a good
idea

03:17:49.849 --> 03:17:49.859 align:start position:0%
idea
 
03:17:51.830 --> 03:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
we would reflect that on the Surplus
 
03:17:51.840 --> 03:17:52.969 align:start position:0%
we would reflect that on the Surplus
statement

03:17:52.969 --> 03:17:52.979 align:start position:0%
statement
 
03:17:54.950 --> 03:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
so we would make a negative adjustment
 
03:18:00.710 --> 03:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:04.309 --> 03:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:06.830 --> 03:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
so in order to have an Apples to Apples
 
03:18:06.840 --> 03:18:08.090 align:start position:0%
so in order to have an Apples to Apples
comparison

03:18:08.090 --> 03:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
comparison
 
03:18:10.070 --> 03:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
we take the governor's Revenue estimates
 
03:18:12.830 --> 03:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
and we put the base revenues back in so
 
03:18:14.570 --> 03:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
whatever the governor's base revenues
 
03:18:18.650 --> 03:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
were before he made final decisions on
 
03:18:18.660 --> 03:18:19.309 align:start position:0%
were before he made final decisions on
um

03:18:19.309 --> 03:18:19.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:21.110 --> 03:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
changes that he might want to make to
 
03:18:22.790 --> 03:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
revenue such as repealing the
 
03:18:25.429 --> 03:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax so on this
 
03:18:25.439 --> 03:18:26.510 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax so on this
document

03:18:26.510 --> 03:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
document
 
03:18:28.690 --> 03:18:28.700 align:start position:0%
in column G
 
03:18:31.670 --> 03:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
row 16 there's going to be a number
 
03:18:33.769 --> 03:18:33.779 align:start position:0%
there it's not there today because I
 
03:18:35.090 --> 03:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
didn't have it when I put this together
 
03:18:37.610 --> 03:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
I got it now I just don't didn't have it
 
03:18:39.830 --> 03:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
when I put this document together
 
03:18:41.690 --> 03:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
that number
 
03:18:43.969 --> 03:18:43.979 align:start position:0%
will be used as you do your estimates
 
03:18:46.849 --> 03:18:46.859 align:start position:0%
based on current law
 
03:18:49.309 --> 03:18:49.319 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day if the house
 
03:18:52.429 --> 03:18:52.439 align:start position:0%
as a body says we don't want the
 
03:18:54.170 --> 03:18:54.180 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax we want to
 
03:18:55.910 --> 03:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
repeal that
 
03:18:58.370 --> 03:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
the LBA would carry a negative
 
03:19:00.530 --> 03:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
adjustment on the Surplus statement so
 
03:19:01.910 --> 03:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
we would make sure that your
 
03:19:04.429 --> 03:19:04.439 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenues reflected that
 
03:19:06.349 --> 03:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
so that when the budget's being prepared
 
03:19:13.610 --> 03:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:17.330 --> 03:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
anybody else with a question
 
03:19:17.340 --> 03:19:20.389 align:start position:0%
anybody else with a question
yep

03:19:20.389 --> 03:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:23.570 --> 03:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
see akfer is the annual comprehensive
 
03:19:33.849 --> 03:19:33.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:38.510 --> 03:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:40.010 --> 03:19:40.020 align:start position:0%
yeah the the
 
03:19:40.020 --> 03:19:40.490 align:start position:0%
yeah the the
um

03:19:40.490 --> 03:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:40.500 --> 03:19:41.870 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

03:19:41.870 --> 03:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:19:44.929 --> 03:19:44.939 align:start position:0%
the board that oversees the the
 
03:19:47.030 --> 03:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
annual report that requires it as part
 
03:19:48.769 --> 03:19:48.779 align:start position:0%
of their standards
 
03:19:51.889 --> 03:19:51.899 align:start position:0%
apparently kafir has some uh negative
 
03:19:54.230 --> 03:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
meaning to it potentially
 
03:19:56.330 --> 03:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
I'm not I I don't have enough to say
 
03:19:58.429 --> 03:19:58.439 align:start position:0%
other than that
 
03:20:01.010 --> 03:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:04.910 --> 03:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
that that some some buddy was insulted
 
03:20:06.590 --> 03:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
by the use of kafir so they can change
 
03:20:08.090 --> 03:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
it to akver
 
03:20:10.670 --> 03:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
okay all right we've got an hour so
 
03:20:16.010 --> 03:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:18.170 --> 03:20:18.180 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could start working from the
 
03:20:20.570 --> 03:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
back forwards because it's small or
 
03:20:22.550 --> 03:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
steady well that was something that
 
03:20:23.929 --> 03:20:23.939 align:start position:0%
Chris mentioned that maybe we could take
 
03:20:25.790 --> 03:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
a look at fish and game and
 
03:20:27.050 --> 03:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
see if we can do something there which
 
03:20:29.870 --> 03:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
is on the back end of the presentation
 
03:20:31.490 --> 03:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
what do you think so yeah that's fine if
 
03:20:36.250 --> 03:20:36.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:40.130 --> 03:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
yes uh just do a confirm or whatever I
 
03:20:41.630 --> 03:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
think what was said is he was going to
 
03:20:43.490 --> 03:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
start this afternoon on the ones where
 
03:20:45.950 --> 03:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
there's almost no variability so that
 
03:20:47.750 --> 03:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
way it's not going to take much time for
 
03:20:49.190 --> 03:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
us to do those doesn't really matter
 
03:20:50.990 --> 03:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
where they are in the packet it's just
 
03:20:54.170 --> 03:20:54.180 align:start position:0%
the ones we can easily do yes
 
03:20:56.570 --> 03:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
well so if you look at we can start with
 
03:20:58.370 --> 03:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
fishing game because it's I think fairly
 
03:20:58.380 --> 03:20:59.870 align:start position:0%
fishing game because it's I think fairly
straightforward

03:20:59.870 --> 03:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
straightforward
 
03:21:03.050 --> 03:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
if you look at the um
 
03:21:04.550 --> 03:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
basically there's two categories of
 
03:21:05.990 --> 03:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue and the unrestricted fishing
 
03:21:08.690 --> 03:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
game they have fishing game licenses and
 
03:21:10.429 --> 03:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
then all other
 
03:21:12.170 --> 03:21:12.180 align:start position:0%
the fish and game licenses has been
 
03:21:14.030 --> 03:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
estimated to be about 9.8 million
 
03:21:17.210 --> 03:21:17.220 align:start position:0%
dollars the agency recommended that the
 
03:21:19.070 --> 03:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
governor has agreed with that
 
03:21:21.950 --> 03:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
the official plan for 23 was 9.8 million
 
03:21:23.450 --> 03:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
so they don't expect a lot of
 
03:21:25.010 --> 03:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
fluctuations and if you recall the
 
03:21:25.020 --> 03:21:26.630 align:start position:0%
fluctuations and if you recall the
director

03:21:26.630 --> 03:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
director
 
03:21:28.070 --> 03:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
um I think there was a question about
 
03:21:30.110 --> 03:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
during covet how there was a spike with
 
03:21:32.030 --> 03:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
licenses and now it's coming back to
 
03:21:34.070 --> 03:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
more of the norm of what they expected
 
03:21:36.769 --> 03:21:36.779 align:start position:0%
but when people were home they saw an
 
03:21:38.929 --> 03:21:38.939 align:start position:0%
influx of a fishing license people
 
03:21:40.490 --> 03:21:40.500 align:start position:0%
buying their fishing licenses that maybe
 
03:21:42.349 --> 03:21:42.359 align:start position:0%
hadn't done it for many years and
 
03:21:44.510 --> 03:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
getting out in the woods so that they're
 
03:21:46.490 --> 03:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
away from people
 
03:21:48.410 --> 03:21:48.420 align:start position:0%
um but that seems to be bouncing back
 
03:21:50.929 --> 03:21:50.939 align:start position:0%
out or they're anticipating bouncing
 
03:21:56.090 --> 03:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:58.550 --> 03:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
the governor and the official plan for
 
03:22:00.710 --> 03:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 for the other Revenue had
 
03:22:02.809 --> 03:22:02.819 align:start position:0%
3.5 million
 
03:22:04.550 --> 03:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
part of the difference there is if you
 
03:22:07.010 --> 03:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
recall fish and game came in and they
 
03:22:08.809 --> 03:22:08.819 align:start position:0%
said we actually know how much we're
 
03:22:11.690 --> 03:22:11.700 align:start position:0%
getting in the um
 
03:22:13.429 --> 03:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
those two Revenue sources they got just
 
03:22:15.290 --> 03:22:15.300 align:start position:0%
over a million dollars each related to
 
03:22:17.650 --> 03:22:17.660 align:start position:0%
transfers from other agencies for the
 
03:22:23.030 --> 03:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
ohrv and um unrefunded road toll ohrv
 
03:22:25.910 --> 03:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
and snowmobiles so they had gotten that
 
03:22:27.530 --> 03:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
amount so that's what makes up the
 
03:22:29.090 --> 03:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
difference between the three five and
 
03:22:30.710 --> 03:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
the three nine that you see for fiscal
 
03:22:34.370 --> 03:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:37.730 --> 03:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
24 and 25 you can see that the governor
 
03:22:40.130 --> 03:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
and the agency are basically giving you
 
03:22:41.150 --> 03:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
the same
 
03:22:46.010 --> 03:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:47.809 --> 03:22:47.819 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth
 
03:22:49.730 --> 03:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
um maybe you said this when I was a so
 
03:22:53.090 --> 03:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
are we doing a similar process where you
 
03:22:55.330 --> 03:22:55.340 align:start position:0%
would just make a motion to accept
 
03:22:58.190 --> 03:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
the ones for fish and game then it would
 
03:22:59.929 --> 03:22:59.939 align:start position:0%
be seconded any discussion and then we
 
03:23:01.969 --> 03:23:01.979 align:start position:0%
would vote is it going to be like that
 
03:23:05.450 --> 03:23:05.460 align:start position:0%
that would be my thought uh but I want
 
03:23:06.769 --> 03:23:06.779 align:start position:0%
to just hear if you know if there's a
 
03:23:08.389 --> 03:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
thousand questions and we realize oh
 
03:23:10.610 --> 03:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
well we have we really can't decide but
 
03:23:12.469 --> 03:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
we would start with a motion so we get
 
03:23:14.990 --> 03:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
it on the table so yeah yeah I'd be glad
 
03:23:17.330 --> 03:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
to make a motion okay to accept the
 
03:23:22.010 --> 03:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
estimates uh from Fish and Game second
 
03:23:22.020 --> 03:23:24.290 align:start position:0%
estimates uh from Fish and Game second
yeah

03:23:24.290 --> 03:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:23:27.710 --> 03:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
um for 24 and 25. the agency runs for 24
 
03:23:31.490 --> 03:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:35.090 --> 03:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
for 23 24 and 25
 
03:23:37.130 --> 03:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
that's good school year that's three
 
03:23:39.170 --> 03:23:39.180 align:start position:0%
years yeah yeah definitely I guess we
 
03:23:41.210 --> 03:23:41.220 align:start position:0%
would have to do all three yes I agree
 
03:23:43.309 --> 03:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
and we could do them one at a time I'm
 
03:23:45.110 --> 03:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
just trying to see what we want exactly
 
03:23:46.910 --> 03:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
this is a great place to start second
 
03:23:48.950 --> 03:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
motion is okay second in by
 
03:23:50.570 --> 03:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
representative Platt
 
03:23:54.590 --> 03:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh any discussion about that
 
03:23:57.769 --> 03:23:57.779 align:start position:0%
yes representative so I had one one
 
03:24:00.110 --> 03:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
question I have is we you know we have
 
03:24:02.990 --> 03:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
all these handouts did we get one from
 
03:24:06.530 --> 03:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:08.570 --> 03:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
so see it
 
03:24:11.870 --> 03:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
yeah it was quite a while ago oh
 
03:24:17.389 --> 03:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:21.769 --> 03:24:21.779 align:start position:0%
and it was the unrefunded road toll
 
03:24:24.590 --> 03:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
for ohrv and Marine that came in at a
 
03:24:26.630 --> 03:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
million when it was budgeted for 800 000
 
03:24:28.429 --> 03:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
and a million won when it was budget for
 
03:24:32.210 --> 03:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
the 900 so that's for 23 that's the the
 
03:24:33.950 --> 03:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
difference that you see about the 400
 
03:24:35.570 --> 03:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
000 difference you see between what the
 
03:24:37.849 --> 03:24:37.859 align:start position:0%
governor had what the plan had and what
 
03:24:41.150 --> 03:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
the agency came in with for 23.
 
03:24:41.160 --> 03:24:45.849 align:start position:0%
the agency came in with for 23.
foreign

03:24:45.849 --> 03:24:45.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:48.349 --> 03:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative jewelry
 
03:24:50.929 --> 03:24:50.939 align:start position:0%
yeah and representative fellows that
 
03:24:53.450 --> 03:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
number will re remain the same or
 
03:24:55.250 --> 03:24:55.260 align:start position:0%
increase as more people from
 
03:24:57.349 --> 03:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts come up here and don't pay
 
03:24:59.809 --> 03:24:59.819 align:start position:0%
or don't ask for a refund on the road
 
03:25:02.030 --> 03:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
toll when they get gasoline for their
 
03:25:04.429 --> 03:25:04.439 align:start position:0%
ATVs and their snowmobiles
 
03:25:06.229 --> 03:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
because they no one tells them they
 
03:25:10.070 --> 03:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:11.570 --> 03:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
in the grand scheme of things it is like
 
03:25:13.190 --> 03:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
one million dollars
 
03:25:18.469 --> 03:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:21.290 --> 03:25:21.300 align:start position:0%
okay so uh the Strava we have on the
 
03:25:24.769 --> 03:25:24.779 align:start position:0%
table is to accept the agency estimates
 
03:25:29.990 --> 03:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
for fish and game fund for 2023 2024 and
 
03:25:30.000 --> 03:25:31.969 align:start position:0%
for fish and game fund for 2023 2024 and
2025.

03:25:31.969 --> 03:25:31.979 align:start position:0%
2025.
 
03:25:34.610 --> 03:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
all those a favor just
 
03:25:34.620 --> 03:25:35.929 align:start position:0%
all those a favor just
representative

03:25:35.929 --> 03:25:35.939 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:25:40.750 --> 03:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:44.269 --> 03:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
usually we we
 
03:25:44.279 --> 03:25:45.309 align:start position:0%
usually we we
um

03:25:45.309 --> 03:25:45.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:48.710 --> 03:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
abbreviate these numbers
 
03:25:51.889 --> 03:25:51.899 align:start position:0%
we we round the numbers
 
03:25:57.110 --> 03:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
on rather than do what what
 
03:25:59.389 --> 03:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
they've done here every dollar does
 
03:26:02.269 --> 03:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
count for them but
 
03:26:04.910 --> 03:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
but on sometimes we've had discussions
 
03:26:08.269 --> 03:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
of okay are we going to on in 23 are we
 
03:26:12.050 --> 03:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
going to 13.8 or are we going to
 
03:26:15.830 --> 03:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:18.530 --> 03:26:18.540 align:start position:0%
but we do round the numbers yep that's
 
03:26:18.540 --> 03:26:19.550 align:start position:0%
but we do round the numbers yep that's
correct

03:26:19.550 --> 03:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:26:22.309 --> 03:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
so if you you can see how the nine eight
 
03:26:24.170 --> 03:26:24.180 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of the typical way
 
03:26:25.729 --> 03:26:25.739 align:start position:0%
that you would come through with this
 
03:26:27.590 --> 03:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
committee so you would look at the 3964
 
03:26:30.710 --> 03:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
and you might say let's leave before or
 
03:26:32.450 --> 03:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
leave it at three nine you make a
 
03:26:33.650 --> 03:26:33.660 align:start position:0%
decision on what you're comfortable with
 
03:26:36.650 --> 03:26:36.660 align:start position:0%
and this agency's uh example I would say
 
03:26:37.729 --> 03:26:37.739 align:start position:0%
you're probably more comfortable going
 
03:26:39.050 --> 03:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
to four because they've said they've
 
03:26:41.389 --> 03:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
gotten in those two large revenues that
 
03:26:44.150 --> 03:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
bump it up by 400 000. slightly over
 
03:26:46.130 --> 03:26:46.140 align:start position:0%
four hundred thousand dollars
 
03:26:49.130 --> 03:26:49.140 align:start position:0%
um more than what they'd anticipated
 
03:26:51.950 --> 03:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
and then on for 24 and 25 you got three
 
03:26:53.690 --> 03:26:53.700 align:start position:0%
five seven you could round up to three
 
03:26:56.330 --> 03:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
six and then from there we would total
 
03:26:59.750 --> 03:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:03.349 --> 03:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
good yeah go ahead are we do we have to
 
03:27:06.889 --> 03:27:06.899 align:start position:0%
estimate column A and B or just do we do
 
03:27:08.929 --> 03:27:08.939 align:start position:0%
only C
 
03:27:11.630 --> 03:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
I would ask you to do anything that
 
03:27:13.429 --> 03:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
isn't already if you're comfortable with
 
03:27:14.870 --> 03:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
nine eight you leave nine eight but if
 
03:27:17.210 --> 03:27:17.220 align:start position:0%
it's three five seven the committee
 
03:27:18.710 --> 03:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
should direct me as to whether you want
 
03:27:20.929 --> 03:27:20.939 align:start position:0%
it to go up to three six or stay at
 
03:27:22.130 --> 03:27:22.140 align:start position:0%
three five
 
03:27:24.490 --> 03:27:24.500 align:start position:0%
so so you
 
03:27:26.389 --> 03:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
there's there are times when the
 
03:27:29.809 --> 03:27:29.819 align:start position:0%
committee's um it's this isn't a great
 
03:27:32.330 --> 03:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
example but we'll say like the business
 
03:27:34.670 --> 03:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
taxes where you maybe you come in with a
 
03:27:36.349 --> 03:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
a high and a low and you do an average
 
03:27:39.889 --> 03:27:39.899 align:start position:0%
and it's 0.5 and then you say okay we're
 
03:27:41.269 --> 03:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
going to go to the higher number or the
 
03:27:43.010 --> 03:27:43.020 align:start position:0%
lower number but it's an agreement that
 
03:27:44.150 --> 03:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
the committee makes because that's what
 
03:27:45.889 --> 03:27:45.899 align:start position:0%
you're comfortable with so let me just
 
03:27:46.910 --> 03:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
check back with representative
 
03:27:48.650 --> 03:27:48.660 align:start position:0%
Southworth who made the motion for the
 
03:27:50.809 --> 03:27:50.819 align:start position:0%
straw vote uh were you saying that you
 
03:27:54.110 --> 03:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
want us to accept the total like column
 
03:27:54.120 --> 03:27:55.490 align:start position:0%
want us to accept the total like column
C

03:27:55.490 --> 03:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
C
 
03:27:57.650 --> 03:27:57.660 align:start position:0%
for each of the fiscal years or did you
 
03:27:59.570 --> 03:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
want to
 
03:28:01.550 --> 03:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
amend that
 
03:28:05.030 --> 03:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you what I believe is I wanted to
 
03:28:06.710 --> 03:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
get the discussion going so I want to
 
03:28:08.570 --> 03:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
get the discussion part but I think
 
03:28:11.450 --> 03:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
amending it as several have suggested to
 
03:28:13.670 --> 03:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
3.6 I think we can go through each of
 
03:28:16.370 --> 03:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
those numbers and pretty easily agree on
 
03:28:19.790 --> 03:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
what to do so okay sounds good I was
 
03:28:22.610 --> 03:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
flexible all right so all of those in
 
03:28:26.450 --> 03:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
favor of accepting these as rounded
 
03:28:29.630 --> 03:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
um just raise your hand or say aye one
 
03:28:32.330 --> 03:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
two three four five six seven eight nine
 
03:28:35.389 --> 03:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
ten okay everyone anyone opposed
 
03:28:38.150 --> 03:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
okay so it looks good to just race down
 
03:28:42.729 --> 03:28:42.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:45.650 --> 03:28:45.660 align:start position:0%
so that for so that Chris knows whether
 
03:28:48.950 --> 03:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 0.5 or 0.6 yes I can
 
03:28:50.630 --> 03:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
say what I think you wanted if that
 
03:28:53.269 --> 03:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
would be easier yes so fiscal year 23
 
03:28:56.690 --> 03:28:56.700 align:start position:0%
you would have 9.8 under the fish and
 
03:28:58.030 --> 03:28:58.040 align:start position:0%
game licenses
 
03:29:02.090 --> 03:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
4.0 for all other and the total would be
 
03:29:02.100 --> 03:29:04.969 align:start position:0%
4.0 for all other and the total would be
13.8

03:29:04.969 --> 03:29:04.979 align:start position:0%
13.8
 
03:29:08.690 --> 03:29:08.700 align:start position:0%
okay under fiscal year 24 row 16 you
 
03:29:11.050 --> 03:29:11.060 align:start position:0%
would have 9.8
 
03:29:11.060 --> 03:29:12.950 align:start position:0%
would have 9.8
3.6

03:29:12.950 --> 03:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
3.6
 
03:29:14.630 --> 03:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
under the next column and then your
 
03:29:17.389 --> 03:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
total would be 13.4
 
03:29:18.889 --> 03:29:18.899 align:start position:0%
and that would be the same for fiscal
 
03:29:23.090 --> 03:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:24.590 --> 03:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
03:29:26.090 --> 03:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
so we had unanimous I don't know how
 
03:29:28.490 --> 03:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
many people we have here one two three
 
03:29:30.849 --> 03:29:30.859 align:start position:0%
three seven eight nine ten eleven
 
03:29:34.130 --> 03:29:34.140 align:start position:0%
so sixteen to oh on our Scrabble okay
 
03:29:34.140 --> 03:29:36.910 align:start position:0%
so sixteen to oh on our Scrabble okay
great

03:29:36.910 --> 03:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:39.530 --> 03:29:39.540 align:start position:0%
okay now uh back to representative
 
03:29:41.210 --> 03:29:41.220 align:start position:0%
southward's point it's not we're not
 
03:29:43.370 --> 03:29:43.380 align:start position:0%
just going in order here we're going in
 
03:29:47.150 --> 03:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
terms of maybe Simplicity of numbers so
 
03:29:48.950 --> 03:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
what would you point us to next if you
 
03:29:50.269 --> 03:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
want to take a look at the highway fund
 
03:29:51.469 --> 03:29:51.479 align:start position:0%
we can see if you're comfortable with
 
03:29:52.610 --> 03:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
that if you're
 
03:29:54.590 --> 03:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
I'll point to places but you need to
 
03:29:58.729 --> 03:29:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:07.330 --> 03:30:07.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:10.370 --> 03:30:10.380 align:start position:0%
I'm working on that
 
03:30:13.250 --> 03:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
representative Army thank you I'm not
 
03:30:15.710 --> 03:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
comfortable with this I'd like to see
 
03:30:20.389 --> 03:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
what the the numbers of Highway users
 
03:30:23.690 --> 03:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
has gone up to I've been I followed the
 
03:30:26.510 --> 03:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
turnpike numbers but that leaves out
 
03:30:29.870 --> 03:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
everybody coming from Canada and
 
03:30:32.570 --> 03:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
a lot of the ones in Vermont coming
 
03:30:35.290 --> 03:30:35.300 align:start position:0%
through and such
 
03:30:39.650 --> 03:30:39.660 align:start position:0%
so um I think during the pandemic they
 
03:30:43.670 --> 03:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
did actually produce numbers that that
 
03:30:45.969 --> 03:30:45.979 align:start position:0%
the dot
 
03:30:50.389 --> 03:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
or D.O.T I think dot collects the
 
03:30:52.370 --> 03:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
turnpike information well not just the
 
03:30:56.469 --> 03:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
turnpike information but the the miles
 
03:31:01.370 --> 03:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:03.410 --> 03:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
they they gave that to us during the
 
03:31:05.750 --> 03:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic yeah and I'm I just don't
 
03:31:07.729 --> 03:31:07.739 align:start position:0%
remember if it was safe I think it's a
 
03:31:10.309 --> 03:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
D.O.T puts it together safety may have
 
03:31:12.590 --> 03:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
gotten that from dot but I'd have to
 
03:31:15.590 --> 03:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
double check with them I believe it it
 
03:31:18.050 --> 03:31:18.060 align:start position:0%
was somehow they were doing traffic
 
03:31:18.060 --> 03:31:19.670 align:start position:0%
was somehow they were doing traffic
checks

03:31:19.670 --> 03:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
checks
 
03:31:26.210 --> 03:31:26.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:28.790 --> 03:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
and this is an example of we really
 
03:31:31.729 --> 03:31:31.739 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten the governor's
 
03:31:33.950 --> 03:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
thinking behind this and why his numbers
 
03:31:36.229 --> 03:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
are changing over the years uh
 
03:31:38.150 --> 03:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative who else has the hand
 
03:31:38.160 --> 03:31:39.530 align:start position:0%
representative who else has the hand
representative

03:31:39.530 --> 03:31:39.540 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:31:42.050 --> 03:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
yes and representative Army I think I
 
03:31:44.030 --> 03:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
forgot my question for a moment so
 
03:31:46.849 --> 03:31:46.859 align:start position:0%
you're not alone we were talking about
 
03:31:48.650 --> 03:31:48.660 align:start position:0%
getting old
 
03:31:48.660 --> 03:31:50.590 align:start position:0%
getting old
foreign

03:31:50.590 --> 03:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:31:53.269 --> 03:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
is this an area where we want to wait
 
03:31:55.130 --> 03:31:55.140 align:start position:0%
until the the governor's budget person
 
03:31:57.530 --> 03:31:57.540 align:start position:0%
comes and explains a little bit more or
 
03:31:59.990 --> 03:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
what do you think guys
 
03:32:01.790 --> 03:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
oh do you know anything that you want to
 
03:32:04.010 --> 03:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
share well I would just point out that
 
03:32:06.530 --> 03:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
um the total
 
03:32:09.229 --> 03:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
um for 24 and 25 the governor and the
 
03:32:12.290 --> 03:32:12.300 align:start position:0%
agency are the same it's 23 that there's
 
03:32:14.389 --> 03:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
a slight variation
 
03:32:16.130 --> 03:32:16.140 align:start position:0%
and it's related to the motor vehicle
 
03:32:16.140 --> 03:32:18.110 align:start position:0%
and it's related to the motor vehicle
fees

03:32:18.110 --> 03:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
fees
 
03:32:19.610 --> 03:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
um but
 
03:32:19.620 --> 03:32:20.990 align:start position:0%
um but
here

03:32:20.990 --> 03:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:32:21.000 --> 03:32:22.790 align:start position:0%
here
yeah

03:32:22.790 --> 03:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:32:24.769 --> 03:32:24.779 align:start position:0%
and I think Steve might have talked some
 
03:32:26.870 --> 03:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
about that when he came in
 
03:32:31.010 --> 03:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:33.170 --> 03:32:33.180 align:start position:0%
yeah represent a question I forgotten
 
03:32:36.710 --> 03:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
remembered is uh when do the uh electric
 
03:32:39.950 --> 03:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle Deluge when's that going to hit
 
03:32:42.050 --> 03:32:42.060 align:start position:0%
so you have a choice between electric
 
03:32:44.229 --> 03:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
vehicle and an electric vehicle
 
03:32:47.290 --> 03:32:47.300 align:start position:0%
that's good
 
03:32:49.910 --> 03:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh yeah well just they're pushing it
 
03:32:52.370 --> 03:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
like crazy for a couple of years yeah
 
03:32:52.380 --> 03:32:54.710 align:start position:0%
like crazy for a couple of years yeah
yeah

03:32:54.710 --> 03:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:59.090 --> 03:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
well well so Chris is this am I hearing
 
03:33:00.769 --> 03:33:00.779 align:start position:0%
that the committee would like to hold on
 
03:33:00.779 --> 03:33:01.610 align:start position:0%
that the committee would like to hold on
this

03:33:01.610 --> 03:33:01.620 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:33:03.410 --> 03:33:03.420 align:start position:0%
wait for the Governor's budget director
 
03:33:05.210 --> 03:33:05.220 align:start position:0%
and would you like safety to come back
 
03:33:07.370 --> 03:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
in to answer any questions
 
03:33:08.990 --> 03:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
well I'm looking at it you're right it's
 
03:33:10.910 --> 03:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
not that different from the agency's
 
03:33:13.729 --> 03:33:13.739 align:start position:0%
estimate um it looked more up different
 
03:33:16.490 --> 03:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
for the first year
 
03:33:18.229 --> 03:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
but thoughts around the room
 
03:33:22.190 --> 03:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
representative Ami yeah it it does look
 
03:33:24.769 --> 03:33:24.779 align:start position:0%
about the same between them but they're
 
03:33:28.190 --> 03:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
both assuming that the amount of money
 
03:33:30.229 --> 03:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
coming into the highway fund is going to
 
03:33:33.349 --> 03:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
be growing oh very slowly but growing
 
03:33:36.590 --> 03:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
rather than Contracting we do have more
 
03:33:36.600 --> 03:33:37.849 align:start position:0%
rather than Contracting we do have more
hybrids

03:33:37.849 --> 03:33:37.859 align:start position:0%
hybrids
 
03:33:40.729 --> 03:33:40.739 align:start position:0%
on the road all the time
 
03:33:44.510 --> 03:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
as well as the the much smaller number
 
03:33:47.750 --> 03:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
of electric cars and the hybrids are
 
03:33:51.410 --> 03:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
getting much better mileage than when it
 
03:33:53.450 --> 03:33:53.460 align:start position:0%
was down at
 
03:33:56.269 --> 03:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
minus 20 I was getting 35 miles to the
 
03:33:59.929 --> 03:33:59.939 align:start position:0%
gallon going over the hills well
 
03:34:01.429 --> 03:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
representative ulry did you have
 
03:34:01.439 --> 03:34:03.050 align:start position:0%
representative ulry did you have
something

03:34:03.050 --> 03:34:03.060 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:34:05.150 --> 03:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
going over the hills going up the hill
 
03:34:07.910 --> 03:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
she was only getting 10. no
 
03:34:07.920 --> 03:34:09.349 align:start position:0%
she was only getting 10. no
no

03:34:09.349 --> 03:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:34:11.450 --> 03:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
already over the hill
 
03:34:11.460 --> 03:34:12.650 align:start position:0%
already over the hill
but

03:34:12.650 --> 03:34:12.660 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:34:12.660 --> 03:34:15.410 align:start position:0%
but
what

03:34:15.410 --> 03:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:21.290 --> 03:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:22.790 --> 03:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
that they're going to be increasing its
 
03:34:23.990 --> 03:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
slower numbers
 
03:34:27.469 --> 03:34:27.479 align:start position:0%
not the hybrids uh no perhaps not the
 
03:34:29.690 --> 03:34:29.700 align:start position:0%
hybrids but we do have a one cent gas
 
03:34:32.809 --> 03:34:32.819 align:start position:0%
tax increase coming up
 
03:34:36.290 --> 03:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
remember the four years the planet just
 
03:34:39.229 --> 03:34:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:42.590 --> 03:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
under Jasper we increase the gas tax
 
03:34:45.889 --> 03:34:45.899 align:start position:0%
on yes but didn't we we increased it
 
03:34:49.070 --> 03:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
four cents all at once no didn't we I
 
03:34:51.469 --> 03:34:51.479 align:start position:0%
don't think so the the last increase to
 
03:34:54.170 --> 03:34:54.180 align:start position:0%
the gas tax was I believe was 4.2 cents
 
03:34:56.269 --> 03:34:56.279 align:start position:0%
but that was restricted
 
03:34:58.969 --> 03:34:58.979 align:start position:0%
so it's money that's not what you're
 
03:35:02.090 --> 03:35:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:04.070 --> 03:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative I think had
 
03:35:06.110 --> 03:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
I think I answered it I think Chris I'm
 
03:35:08.389 --> 03:35:08.399 align:start position:0%
on page 151 of the act for I think
 
03:35:09.769 --> 03:35:09.779 align:start position:0%
that's where we have our 10-year
 
03:35:09.779 --> 03:35:12.410 align:start position:0%
that's where we have our 10-year
historical

03:35:12.410 --> 03:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
historical
 
03:35:14.870 --> 03:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
of the gas tax I believe that's what I'm
 
03:35:23.290 --> 03:35:23.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:26.870 --> 03:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
so it looks like going back I mean take
 
03:35:29.889 --> 03:35:29.899 align:start position:0%
aside from the pandemic
 
03:35:34.790 --> 03:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
124 125 is pretty consistent with
 
03:35:37.670 --> 03:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
regular road traffic not not assuming
 
03:35:40.969 --> 03:35:40.979 align:start position:0%
any type of electric vehicle or
 
03:35:43.429 --> 03:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
anything else okay thank you
 
03:35:44.750 --> 03:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
representative orrs and then
 
03:35:46.370 --> 03:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth
 
03:35:49.490 --> 03:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh Chris maybe you
 
03:35:52.309 --> 03:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
could uh verify this and having done
 
03:35:53.929 --> 03:35:53.939 align:start position:0%
this kind of work I mean I'm looking at
 
03:35:55.670 --> 03:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
it's like this isn't even a rounding
 
03:35:58.429 --> 03:35:58.439 align:start position:0%
error the differences in 2022 and the
 
03:36:00.469 --> 03:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
fact that they're all so close
 
03:36:04.250 --> 03:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
uh could you imagine us exceeding these
 
03:36:06.170 --> 03:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
like this number where it's even in our
 
03:36:08.929 --> 03:36:08.939 align:start position:0%
favor in 2022 if there was even a
 
03:36:10.969 --> 03:36:10.979 align:start position:0%
rounding error in this
 
03:36:14.150 --> 03:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh no we didn't so I think what again
 
03:36:15.469 --> 03:36:15.479 align:start position:0%
you've heard some of the discussion when
 
03:36:17.090 --> 03:36:17.100 align:start position:0%
dra was here
 
03:36:18.830 --> 03:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
at the time these estimates were being
 
03:36:21.469 --> 03:36:21.479 align:start position:0%
made we were just coming out of um covet
 
03:36:23.870 --> 03:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
hibernation people were coming back to
 
03:36:25.309 --> 03:36:25.319 align:start position:0%
the offices but they weren't sure how
 
03:36:26.570 --> 03:36:26.580 align:start position:0%
quickly people were going to be back in
 
03:36:28.250 --> 03:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
the offices people started traveling a
 
03:36:30.830 --> 03:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
little bit more so I think when
 
03:36:34.130 --> 03:36:34.140 align:start position:0%
um safety made its estimates they were a
 
03:36:35.750 --> 03:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
little bit conservative because of some
 
03:36:37.190 --> 03:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
of those concerns
 
03:36:40.610 --> 03:36:40.620 align:start position:0%
and fortunately we exceeded what they
 
03:36:45.610 --> 03:36:45.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:48.590 --> 03:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
yes yeah my focus is on the agency
 
03:36:50.990 --> 03:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
estimates which look pretty consistent
 
03:36:55.490 --> 03:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
for 23 24 and 25. so my sense is if we
 
03:36:56.990 --> 03:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
don't approve it today
 
03:36:58.849 --> 03:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
are there real questions that would
 
03:37:01.910 --> 03:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
change our minds if we waited and I
 
03:37:03.950 --> 03:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to lose questions but that's
 
03:37:05.330 --> 03:37:05.340 align:start position:0%
what I'm always thinking we can always
 
03:37:07.670 --> 03:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
keep Gathering more information but are
 
03:37:09.650 --> 03:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
there really any things here that we
 
03:37:11.690 --> 03:37:11.700 align:start position:0%
would change our mind about so maybe
 
03:37:11.700 --> 03:37:12.889 align:start position:0%
would change our mind about so maybe
it's

03:37:12.889 --> 03:37:12.899 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:37:14.450 --> 03:37:14.460 align:start position:0%
do you always want to make a motion
 
03:37:20.929 --> 03:37:20.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:22.790 --> 03:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
I'm just thinking of a system but yeah I
 
03:37:24.769 --> 03:37:24.779 align:start position:0%
know I know I'm not sure what works best
 
03:37:26.269 --> 03:37:26.279 align:start position:0%
actually yet
 
03:37:27.889 --> 03:37:27.899 align:start position:0%
we can certainly do the motion thing
 
03:37:29.630 --> 03:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
just like we did last time okay you want
 
03:37:31.790 --> 03:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
to do that yeah I'll make a motion to
 
03:37:36.170 --> 03:37:36.180 align:start position:0%
accept the agency figures for 23 24 and
 
03:37:39.889 --> 03:37:39.899 align:start position:0%
25 for the highway fund
 
03:37:45.710 --> 03:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:48.229 --> 03:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
okay honey do you want to just take a
 
03:37:49.969 --> 03:37:49.979 align:start position:0%
vote real quick on that and then we can
 
03:37:51.590 --> 03:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
go from there or do you want to discuss
 
03:37:53.690 --> 03:37:53.700 align:start position:0%
it some more
 
03:37:56.630 --> 03:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
up representative fellows we'll get into
 
03:37:58.969 --> 03:37:58.979 align:start position:0%
a rhythm I just want to feel it I like
 
03:38:01.670 --> 03:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
to slow down a little bit here so if
 
03:38:04.550 --> 03:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about
 
03:38:07.490 --> 03:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
um the highway fund I'd really like an
 
03:38:10.670 --> 03:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity for everybody to look in the
 
03:38:13.969 --> 03:38:13.979 align:start position:0%
annual financial report and to get the
 
03:38:17.330 --> 03:38:17.340 align:start position:0%
you know handouts that that agency gave
 
03:38:21.050 --> 03:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
us so we can so I can like see my notes
 
03:38:23.510 --> 03:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
and just see
 
03:38:26.269 --> 03:38:26.279 align:start position:0%
what they told us about factors that
 
03:38:27.889 --> 03:38:27.899 align:start position:0%
would influence
 
03:38:31.190 --> 03:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
you know some adjustment to projections
 
03:38:33.229 --> 03:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
because I just think we're moving really
 
03:38:36.170 --> 03:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
too fast here that's you're moving too
 
03:38:37.849 --> 03:38:37.859 align:start position:0%
fast for me I can tell you that right
 
03:38:40.729 --> 03:38:40.739 align:start position:0%
okay representative only yeah I'd just
 
03:38:43.250 --> 03:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
like to concur with that
 
03:38:48.950 --> 03:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
I think that on this is a little bit
 
03:38:48.960 --> 03:38:50.750 align:start position:0%
I think that on this is a little bit
difficult

03:38:50.750 --> 03:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
03:38:55.309 --> 03:38:55.319 align:start position:0%
to predict and they did give us some
 
03:38:56.870 --> 03:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
more information
 
03:39:00.830 --> 03:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
that we should look at and there are
 
03:39:04.370 --> 03:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
more consequences I think than fish and
 
03:39:08.990 --> 03:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
game if we say that they're getting in
 
03:39:12.010 --> 03:39:12.020 align:start position:0%
more than they do get in
 
03:39:15.349 --> 03:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
because the budget is frequently having
 
03:39:19.210 --> 03:39:19.220 align:start position:0%
to backfill the department at this point
 
03:39:21.650 --> 03:39:21.660 align:start position:0%
representative someone have a hand up
 
03:39:24.950 --> 03:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
over here yes representative Bolton
 
03:39:27.170 --> 03:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
thank you chair chairwoman um I just got
 
03:39:28.849 --> 03:39:28.859 align:start position:0%
the question like where does the
 
03:39:30.229 --> 03:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
governor get his estimates if not from
 
03:39:34.610 --> 03:39:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:36.530 --> 03:39:36.540 align:start position:0%
the governor works with the agencies to
 
03:39:38.809 --> 03:39:38.819 align:start position:0%
get his estimates and so they will meet
 
03:39:40.790 --> 03:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
with the governor's budget director
 
03:39:42.889 --> 03:39:42.899 align:start position:0%
they'll go through a process of you know
 
03:39:45.050 --> 03:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
maybe there's some guidance that the
 
03:39:46.790 --> 03:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
governor's office has that says you know
 
03:39:48.830 --> 03:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue seems to be doing X and Y so
 
03:39:50.510 --> 03:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
when you give me estimates incorporate
 
03:39:50.520 --> 03:39:51.889 align:start position:0%
when you give me estimates incorporate
that

03:39:51.889 --> 03:39:51.899 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:39:53.990 --> 03:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't know for Highway funds if
 
03:39:56.150 --> 03:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
there was anything specific or if they
 
03:39:58.370 --> 03:39:58.380 align:start position:0%
just said safety you're the expert
 
03:40:00.710 --> 03:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
because you collect the road toll what
 
03:40:02.570 --> 03:40:02.580 align:start position:0%
are you seeing for trends
 
03:40:05.389 --> 03:40:05.399 align:start position:0%
thank you you know I I can't that's
 
03:40:08.150 --> 03:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
where uh director Gary would be able to
 
03:40:09.830 --> 03:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
ask answer some of those questions in
 
03:40:11.450 --> 03:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
terms of what their office did with the
 
03:40:11.460 --> 03:40:14.530 align:start position:0%
terms of what their office did with the
agency

03:40:14.530 --> 03:40:14.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:16.190 --> 03:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
representative Platt and then
 
03:40:17.809 --> 03:40:17.819 align:start position:0%
representative Spielberg Madam chair I
 
03:40:19.370 --> 03:40:19.380 align:start position:0%
want to understand this process there
 
03:40:22.130 --> 03:40:22.140 align:start position:0%
was a motion made and we could vote it
 
03:40:25.370 --> 03:40:25.380 align:start position:0%
up or down uh but if it's a straw poll
 
03:40:27.290 --> 03:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
so that's not binding us to anything
 
03:40:29.510 --> 03:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
until we take a final vote right we
 
03:40:30.950 --> 03:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
could come back and change them we could
 
03:40:32.269 --> 03:40:32.279 align:start position:0%
definitely come back this is just get a
 
03:40:33.830 --> 03:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
sense of where the committee is and I
 
03:40:35.150 --> 03:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
haven't really I don't think we
 
03:40:36.710 --> 03:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
fine-tune the process quite yet we'll
 
03:40:38.570 --> 03:40:38.580 align:start position:0%
get to a rhythm but I just kind of want
 
03:40:39.830 --> 03:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
to see where the committee wants to go
 
03:40:41.150 --> 03:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
on this
 
03:40:42.830 --> 03:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
um at some point we know we do have a
 
03:40:45.290 --> 03:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
motion for a straw vote on the table so
 
03:40:46.670 --> 03:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
we'll just at least see where we're at
 
03:40:49.190 --> 03:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
if we're 50 50 obviously we're not going
 
03:40:50.809 --> 03:40:50.819 align:start position:0%
to go forward yet
 
03:40:52.370 --> 03:40:52.380 align:start position:0%
um and we'll see what we need to do next
 
03:40:55.790 --> 03:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
if we're you know 19-1 then we'll go
 
03:40:57.469 --> 03:40:57.479 align:start position:0%
from there I guess as we're just kind of
 
03:41:00.110 --> 03:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
getting a sense of the committee today I
 
03:41:01.070 --> 03:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
had recognized representative
 
03:41:02.630 --> 03:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
spillsbridge will do that and then we'll
 
03:41:04.130 --> 03:41:04.140 align:start position:0%
go around the room
 
03:41:06.769 --> 03:41:06.779 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'm prepared to
 
03:41:09.469 --> 03:41:09.479 align:start position:0%
support the motion but I'm curious the
 
03:41:12.650 --> 03:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
discrepancies are very minor
 
03:41:17.210 --> 03:41:17.220 align:start position:0%
in 24 and 25 it's 200 up 200 down comes
 
03:41:20.090 --> 03:41:20.100 align:start position:0%
out in the wash in the total up
 
03:41:24.229 --> 03:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
are the discrepancies based on different
 
03:41:26.389 --> 03:41:26.399 align:start position:0%
points in time for the Viewpoint is
 
03:41:28.729 --> 03:41:28.739 align:start position:0%
there a different date at which the
 
03:41:30.830 --> 03:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
governor's estimate was made in
 
03:41:33.710 --> 03:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
conjunction with his agencies versus the
 
03:41:35.929 --> 03:41:35.939 align:start position:0%
agency presentation we have
 
03:41:39.950 --> 03:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
I don't think so I think it may be um if
 
03:41:41.510 --> 03:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
you look at the sheet that department of
 
03:41:43.010 --> 03:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
safety provided you
 
03:41:45.110 --> 03:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
when you look at the road toll
 
03:41:45.120 --> 03:41:46.729 align:start position:0%
when you look at the road toll
there's

03:41:46.729 --> 03:41:46.739 align:start position:0%
there's
 
03:41:49.070 --> 03:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
um three lines that fall under that I
 
03:41:51.170 --> 03:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
suspect that they included two lines and
 
03:41:52.849 --> 03:41:52.859 align:start position:0%
not all three I checked with Department
 
03:41:54.889 --> 03:41:54.899 align:start position:0%
of Safety last night because I was
 
03:41:56.389 --> 03:41:56.399 align:start position:0%
curious as to why there was a difference
 
03:41:57.889 --> 03:41:57.899 align:start position:0%
and if they had done something different
 
03:42:00.710 --> 03:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
with the governor and Steve suggested no
 
03:42:02.389 --> 03:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
and he suggested that
 
03:42:06.050 --> 03:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
The Gray Line that gets you to 125
 
03:42:10.250 --> 03:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
actually 124 3 125 and 126 for your road
 
03:42:11.690 --> 03:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
toll is the number they would support
 
03:42:11.700 --> 03:42:17.510 align:start position:0%
toll is the number they would support
125.6

03:42:17.510 --> 03:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:19.550 --> 03:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
I haven't had a chance to talk to the
 
03:42:21.769 --> 03:42:21.779 align:start position:0%
governor's budget director as you might
 
03:42:22.969 --> 03:42:22.979 align:start position:0%
guess he was being pulled in many
 
03:42:24.469 --> 03:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
directions yesterday
 
03:42:26.330 --> 03:42:26.340 align:start position:0%
so we've we've emailed some but I
 
03:42:28.790 --> 03:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
haven't had a conversation yet
 
03:42:30.769 --> 03:42:30.779 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis
 
03:42:33.729 --> 03:42:33.739 align:start position:0%
so my other question is
 
03:42:36.229 --> 03:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering why we don't have somebody
 
03:42:38.389 --> 03:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
you know if we knew ahead of time which
 
03:42:40.849 --> 03:42:40.859 align:start position:0%
agencies we were going to discuss why we
 
03:42:42.710 --> 03:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
don't have somebody from that agency
 
03:42:45.410 --> 03:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
just sitting here so you know when we
 
03:42:47.750 --> 03:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
have questions we could just ask
 
03:42:49.550 --> 03:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
somebody that knows it today we're just
 
03:42:50.809 --> 03:42:50.819 align:start position:0%
kind of getting a feel for where the
 
03:42:52.729 --> 03:42:52.739 align:start position:0%
committee is there may be some like we
 
03:42:54.349 --> 03:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
found with fish and game that we are
 
03:42:56.330 --> 03:42:56.340 align:start position:0%
pretty comfortable with what we had for
 
03:42:57.530 --> 03:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
information we've already had the
 
03:42:59.809 --> 03:42:59.819 align:start position:0%
presentation but in a case like this if
 
03:43:02.030 --> 03:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
we if the straw poll ends up showing us
 
03:43:05.210 --> 03:43:05.220 align:start position:0%
that we're we're not ready yet we know
 
03:43:07.490 --> 03:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
when our next uh Revenue estimate
 
03:43:10.610 --> 03:43:10.620 align:start position:0%
meetings are and we can certainly ask
 
03:43:14.030 --> 03:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
those okay people to come back if we
 
03:43:16.849 --> 03:43:16.859 align:start position:0%
need that's what we can decide yeah
 
03:43:18.950 --> 03:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
basically we should be doing that right
 
03:43:20.929 --> 03:43:20.939 align:start position:0%
now because we've got like
 
03:43:23.150 --> 03:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
less than an hour to go so we just
 
03:43:25.610 --> 03:43:25.620 align:start position:0%
should be saying we're really solid on
 
03:43:27.469 --> 03:43:27.479 align:start position:0%
this one and we can say something or
 
03:43:29.990 --> 03:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
else we need to skip this one and have
 
03:43:31.790 --> 03:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
right we're using this as a test we're
 
03:43:34.610 --> 03:43:34.620 align:start position:0%
just getting started and you know some
 
03:43:36.050 --> 03:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
of you are new to this committee I don't
 
03:43:37.550 --> 03:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
know your decision making Styles I don't
 
03:43:39.349 --> 03:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
know how much information you need or
 
03:43:41.030 --> 03:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
want I'm just trying to get a feel for
 
03:43:43.309 --> 03:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
it I'm at your service so we'll we'll do
 
03:43:45.110 --> 03:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
whatever the committee feels we need
 
03:43:47.870 --> 03:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
well that's where but we do have a
 
03:43:49.190 --> 03:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
motion on the table so let's just get a
 
03:43:51.170 --> 03:43:51.180 align:start position:0%
sense what is the vote we have a straw
 
03:43:54.889 --> 03:43:54.899 align:start position:0%
vote uh to accept the agency total
 
03:43:58.490 --> 03:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
estimates for 23 24 and 25. all those in
 
03:44:01.309 --> 03:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
favor please raise your hand one two
 
03:44:05.330 --> 03:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
three four five six seven eight nine
 
03:44:08.750 --> 03:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
ten eleven twelve so we have twelve for
 
03:44:11.330 --> 03:44:11.340 align:start position:0%
that and how many opposed raise your
 
03:44:14.330 --> 03:44:14.340 align:start position:0%
hand one two three four so it's a twelve
 
03:44:16.010 --> 03:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
to four
 
03:44:19.190 --> 03:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
um I want you guys to be comfortable
 
03:44:21.769 --> 03:44:21.779 align:start position:0%
so let's let's hold off on this you know
 
03:44:23.510 --> 03:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
at least we made a note of that and if
 
03:44:25.429 --> 03:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
we can we can go back let's go back to
 
03:44:28.190 --> 03:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
it on the 27th I believe it's the next
 
03:44:29.590 --> 03:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
time we get together
 
03:44:32.809 --> 03:44:32.819 align:start position:0%
and uh how about this why don't you look
 
03:44:34.269 --> 03:44:34.279 align:start position:0%
through your notes
 
03:44:38.210 --> 03:44:38.220 align:start position:0%
and see if you can understand it
 
03:44:40.550 --> 03:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
yourselves look at or go online and look
 
03:44:42.650 --> 03:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
at the presentations online
 
03:44:44.450 --> 03:44:44.460 align:start position:0%
um and if you still feel like you have
 
03:44:46.130 --> 03:44:46.140 align:start position:0%
burning questions either send those
 
03:44:47.570 --> 03:44:47.580 align:start position:0%
questions to us
 
03:44:50.150 --> 03:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
or we'll invite the agency head to come
 
03:44:52.849 --> 03:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
out does that sound reasonable
 
03:44:55.790 --> 03:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
okay representative question for Chris
 
03:44:59.990 --> 03:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
Chris what page on our official
 
03:45:03.530 --> 03:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
financial report would we find the
 
03:45:07.490 --> 03:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2022 Highway fund or Road
 
03:45:13.670 --> 03:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:17.690 --> 03:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
all right is on page 151 151 yeah and
 
03:45:19.910 --> 03:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
what column so you're going to go down
 
03:45:23.570 --> 03:45:23.580 align:start position:0%
to the experiment Dave
 
03:45:25.550 --> 03:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
gas tax
 
03:45:27.110 --> 03:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
all right but I'm looking at this number
 
03:45:29.690 --> 03:45:29.700 align:start position:0%
here oh yeah that's different it is
 
03:45:32.809 --> 03:45:32.819 align:start position:0%
different I I just want just any idea
 
03:45:38.950 --> 03:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:42.290 --> 03:45:42.300 align:start position:0%
well maybe you can look at that okay
 
03:45:45.250 --> 03:45:45.260 align:start position:0%
it's the 123.9 is different than the
 
03:45:48.710 --> 03:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
122.1 I see on the official
 
03:45:52.130 --> 03:45:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:59.929 --> 03:45:59.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:01.910 --> 03:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
we can continue on I just want to see if
 
03:46:05.030 --> 03:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
Chris can somehow okay drive together
 
03:46:08.030 --> 03:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
yeah good question okay so we'll we will
 
03:46:09.349 --> 03:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
this will be on the list I'm going to
 
03:46:11.269 --> 03:46:11.279 align:start position:0%
make a list here things we can check off
 
03:46:13.429 --> 03:46:13.439 align:start position:0%
things that uh we want to maybe revisit
 
03:46:14.929 --> 03:46:14.939 align:start position:0%
but you guys are gonna have to do your
 
03:46:17.570 --> 03:46:17.580 align:start position:0%
own personal homework go back read your
 
03:46:18.950 --> 03:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
stuff see if you can answer your own
 
03:46:21.469 --> 03:46:21.479 align:start position:0%
questions or see what really remains and
 
03:46:22.910 --> 03:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
we will get those questions answered
 
03:46:22.920 --> 03:46:24.050 align:start position:0%
we will get those questions answered
okay

03:46:24.050 --> 03:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:46:24.060 --> 03:46:26.210 align:start position:0%
okay
so

03:46:26.210 --> 03:46:26.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:46:30.469 --> 03:46:30.479 align:start position:0%
yes I've posted notes everywhere
 
03:46:34.070 --> 03:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
so Chris is there another agency you
 
03:46:44.090 --> 03:46:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:50.450 --> 03:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:55.130 --> 03:46:55.140 align:start position:0%
you have the swept the column p
 
03:46:58.910 --> 03:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
I mean it's statutorily driven to be 263
 
03:47:02.630 --> 03:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
1 and 23 and then it goes back up to 363
 
03:47:07.190 --> 03:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:10.790 --> 03:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
so it's it's an easy one I think again
 
03:47:10.800 --> 03:47:16.550 align:start position:0%
so it's it's an easy one I think again
it's

03:47:16.550 --> 03:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:19.550 --> 03:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
representative Platinum I move 2631 for
 
03:47:20.710 --> 03:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
03:47:24.650 --> 03:47:24.660 align:start position:0%
2023 and 360.
 
03:47:24.660 --> 03:47:28.729 align:start position:0%
2023 and 360.
huh

03:47:28.729 --> 03:47:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:28.739 --> 03:47:34.269 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:47:34.269 --> 03:47:34.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:36.530 --> 03:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
can you clarify your motion are you
 
03:47:38.269 --> 03:47:38.279 align:start position:0%
simply moving
 
03:47:41.150 --> 03:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
um swept right now column p
 
03:47:43.309 --> 03:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
yeah that's all I'm doing okay yep and
 
03:47:46.910 --> 03:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
so I moved 263 one like I said in in uh
 
03:47:51.710 --> 03:47:51.720 align:start position:0%
pistol 23 and 363 one for 24 and 25.
 
03:47:55.130 --> 03:47:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:56.870 --> 03:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
is there a second second
 
03:47:56.880 --> 03:47:59.510 align:start position:0%
is there a second second
okay

03:47:59.510 --> 03:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:48:02.510 --> 03:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh more discussion on that
 
03:48:06.110 --> 03:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
okay uh all those in favor of accepting
 
03:48:10.490 --> 03:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
the agency estimates for swept for 23 24
 
03:48:13.250 --> 03:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
and 25 raise your hand
 
03:48:15.410 --> 03:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
two three
 
03:48:17.990 --> 03:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay everyone great thank you okay so
 
03:48:19.790 --> 03:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
that one we can check off on that list
 
03:48:24.530 --> 03:48:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:26.750 --> 03:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
can I make a motion for Medicaid
 
03:48:29.210 --> 03:48:29.220 align:start position:0%
recoveries yes please and I explained it
 
03:48:32.769 --> 03:48:32.779 align:start position:0%
on that we accept the
 
03:48:36.110 --> 03:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
uh that's the same page it's right next
 
03:48:38.929 --> 03:48:38.939 align:start position:0%
to column Q
 
03:48:38.939 --> 03:48:41.269 align:start position:0%
to column Q
yeah

03:48:41.269 --> 03:48:41.279 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:48:41.279 --> 03:48:41.830 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah

03:48:41.830 --> 03:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:48:46.309 --> 03:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
M8 recoveries that's Medicaid recoveries
 
03:48:46.319 --> 03:48:47.330 align:start position:0%
M8 recoveries that's Medicaid recoveries
um

03:48:47.330 --> 03:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:49.610 --> 03:48:49.620 align:start position:0%
oh except I just no they're they're
 
03:48:53.030 --> 03:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
doing high and low is the same so uh
 
03:48:57.710 --> 03:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
that we accept the agency numbers of 2.6
 
03:49:02.570 --> 03:49:02.580 align:start position:0%
million and 23 2 million and 24 and 2.1
 
03:49:05.870 --> 03:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
million and 25.
 
03:49:08.750 --> 03:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm doing that
 
03:49:11.570 --> 03:49:11.580 align:start position:0%
because they may be off by a hundred
 
03:49:13.610 --> 03:49:13.620 align:start position:0%
thousand or so
 
03:49:17.389 --> 03:49:17.399 align:start position:0%
but they they are not getting very much
 
03:49:19.370 --> 03:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
money out of this it's a tiny amount of
 
03:49:21.950 --> 03:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
money relative to their overall budget
 
03:49:25.130 --> 03:49:25.140 align:start position:0%
and vintesimal amount of money
 
03:49:25.140 --> 03:49:26.450 align:start position:0%
and vintesimal amount of money
and

03:49:26.450 --> 03:49:26.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:49:26.460 --> 03:49:28.130 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:49:28.130 --> 03:49:28.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:31.010 --> 03:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
and I think we should just go with that
 
03:49:32.510 --> 03:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get any more
 
03:49:32.520 --> 03:49:34.190 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get any more
information

03:49:34.190 --> 03:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:49:37.490 --> 03:49:37.500 align:start position:0%
okay we have a motion to accept Medicaid
 
03:49:40.729 --> 03:49:40.739 align:start position:0%
recoveries uh agency estimates right so
 
03:49:44.710 --> 03:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
do we have a second on that yes Beverly
 
03:49:47.510 --> 03:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative Ames and the
 
03:49:47.520 --> 03:49:48.590 align:start position:0%
uh representative Ames and the
representation

03:49:48.590 --> 03:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
representation
 
03:49:51.110 --> 03:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
um I say that the governor's estimate oh
 
03:49:53.750 --> 03:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
for these is 2.5
 
03:50:02.630 --> 03:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:04.610 --> 03:50:04.620 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
03:50:06.650 --> 03:50:06.660 align:start position:0%
my question's the same I'm wondering why
 
03:50:10.610 --> 03:50:10.620 align:start position:0%
the governor's estimate is so low at 1.8
 
03:50:15.170 --> 03:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if that's a typo or
 
03:50:15.180 --> 03:50:17.710 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if that's a typo or
um

03:50:17.710 --> 03:50:17.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:20.929 --> 03:50:20.939 align:start position:0%
and then it yeah it evens out when you
 
03:50:23.210 --> 03:50:23.220 align:start position:0%
look at three years combined
 
03:50:23.220 --> 03:50:25.190 align:start position:0%
look at three years combined
yeah

03:50:25.190 --> 03:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:50:28.010 --> 03:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I guess maybe we need to ask
 
03:50:30.530 --> 03:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
the governor's person
 
03:50:33.349 --> 03:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
all right so we have a motion
 
03:50:36.650 --> 03:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
any more discussion on that oh and I am
 
03:50:38.150 --> 03:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
in the motion
 
03:50:41.030 --> 03:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
sure that we wait until the 27th when we
 
03:50:43.010 --> 03:50:43.020 align:start position:0%
can listen to the governor's first so
 
03:50:45.710 --> 03:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
we're basically not doing that all right
 
03:50:48.229 --> 03:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
well hold off so that'll be on the
 
03:50:52.309 --> 03:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
January 27th list kind of order yes
 
03:50:54.710 --> 03:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
um for a simple one like that doesn't
 
03:50:57.410 --> 03:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
make more sense to Simply email him we
 
03:50:59.450 --> 03:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
might have the answer tomorrow it may be
 
03:51:01.309 --> 03:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
a very simple thing I love it I mean
 
03:51:02.510 --> 03:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
it's still I'd like to have the person
 
03:51:04.429 --> 03:51:04.439 align:start position:0%
here on the 27th but some of these
 
03:51:06.050 --> 03:51:06.060 align:start position:0%
questions might be able to be answered
 
03:51:07.729 --> 03:51:07.739 align:start position:0%
really quickly
 
03:51:09.349 --> 03:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
like you said the other was like an
 
03:51:11.870 --> 03:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
anomaly that it wasn't the same so right
 
03:51:14.389 --> 03:51:14.399 align:start position:0%
and I'll happily reach out and try to
 
03:51:16.130 --> 03:51:16.140 align:start position:0%
get answers so yeah we'll have a lot of
 
03:51:17.870 --> 03:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
questions today and then if you send us
 
03:51:19.849 --> 03:51:19.859 align:start position:0%
say these are the five questions and we
 
03:51:21.830 --> 03:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
are it's easy to answer these three but
 
03:51:23.450 --> 03:51:23.460 align:start position:0%
they'll come for these two yes if it's
 
03:51:25.130 --> 03:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
something simple like that doesn't that
 
03:51:27.050 --> 03:51:27.060 align:start position:0%
doesn't require like discussion then
 
03:51:28.610 --> 03:51:28.620 align:start position:0%
let's just get a quick answer to the
 
03:51:30.830 --> 03:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
question we'll do another straw poll on
 
03:51:32.870 --> 03:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
the 27th see where we're at from there
 
03:51:35.870 --> 03:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
okay I saw a hand up over here saying
 
03:51:39.410 --> 03:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
these numbers are so small yeah to try
 
03:51:41.570 --> 03:51:41.580 align:start position:0%
to finagle them so what what are we
 
03:51:47.090 --> 03:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:49.070 --> 03:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
well we haven't we had a motion that was
 
03:51:50.809 --> 03:51:50.819 align:start position:0%
amended to hold off basically so you
 
03:51:54.710 --> 03:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:54.720 --> 03:51:56.090 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:51:56.090 --> 03:51:56.100 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:51:57.710 --> 03:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
was there is someone else would like to
 
03:52:00.170 --> 03:52:00.180 align:start position:0%
make a motion
 
03:52:02.269 --> 03:52:02.279 align:start position:0%
uh does someone want to propose
 
03:52:03.530 --> 03:52:03.540 align:start position:0%
something I'll make the motion to
 
03:52:06.349 --> 03:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
restore the motion
 
03:52:06.359 --> 03:52:08.929 align:start position:0%
restore the motion
okay

03:52:08.929 --> 03:52:08.939 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:52:11.170 --> 03:52:11.180 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna go with
 
03:52:16.630 --> 03:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:19.510 --> 03:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
2024 2 million
 
03:52:23.269 --> 03:52:23.279 align:start position:0%
2025 2.1 million
 
03:52:25.790 --> 03:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
03:52:28.309 --> 03:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
03:52:29.510 --> 03:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
all right all right let's just do a vote
 
03:52:31.550 --> 03:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
on that all those in favor of supporting
 
03:52:34.190 --> 03:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
those numbers raise your hand one two
 
03:52:35.750 --> 03:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
three four five
 
03:52:37.849 --> 03:52:37.859 align:start position:0%
eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen
 
03:52:40.309 --> 03:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
fourteen everyone so okay uh that one
 
03:52:43.130 --> 03:52:43.140 align:start position:0%
worked and I'll still reach out to the
 
03:52:45.110 --> 03:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
director to see why there's a slight
 
03:52:45.120 --> 03:52:46.309 align:start position:0%
director to see why there's a slight
variation

03:52:46.309 --> 03:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
variation
 
03:52:46.319 --> 03:52:47.510 align:start position:0%
variation
yeah

03:52:47.510 --> 03:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:52:49.729 --> 03:52:49.739 align:start position:0%
you can always have a motion to read Etc
 
03:52:51.650 --> 03:52:51.660 align:start position:0%
well absolutely again this is trying to
 
03:52:53.389 --> 03:52:53.399 align:start position:0%
get a feel for Where We Are
 
03:52:55.550 --> 03:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
today again if you go back over the
 
03:52:57.830 --> 03:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
weekend and you want to do the Deep dive
 
03:52:59.750 --> 03:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
on these presentations again go for it
 
03:53:01.250 --> 03:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
is maybe you see something that you want
 
03:53:04.670 --> 03:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
to talk about again okay so how about on
 
03:53:05.929 --> 03:53:05.939 align:start position:0%
page four
 
03:53:07.790 --> 03:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
tobacco settlement
 
03:53:14.090 --> 03:53:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:17.809 --> 03:53:17.819 align:start position:0%
you'll see that the governor accepted
 
03:53:19.550 --> 03:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
the agency's estimates that were
 
03:53:21.769 --> 03:53:21.779 align:start position:0%
presented before this committee
 
03:53:25.429 --> 03:53:25.439 align:start position:0%
January 25th I think it was or maybe
 
03:53:38.809 --> 03:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:40.550 --> 03:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
but representative Ames
 
03:53:42.410 --> 03:53:42.420 align:start position:0%
hi Chris
 
03:53:45.910 --> 03:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that there is a periodic
 
03:53:49.729 --> 03:53:49.739 align:start position:0%
events with the settlement money that
 
03:53:51.650 --> 03:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
sometimes make a difference I mean
 
03:53:53.690 --> 03:53:53.700 align:start position:0%
they're on an unexpected
 
03:53:56.090 --> 03:53:56.100 align:start position:0%
happenings and I know that's happened in
 
03:53:59.450 --> 03:53:59.460 align:start position:0%
the past and is there a
 
03:54:01.550 --> 03:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
is there a time when they do an update
 
03:54:03.769 --> 03:54:03.779 align:start position:0%
on this or maybe we should check on that
 
03:54:05.809 --> 03:54:05.819 align:start position:0%
I don't know because we can it can
 
03:54:08.990 --> 03:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes be multiple millions and it
 
03:54:11.570 --> 03:54:11.580 align:start position:0%
has been in the past
 
03:54:14.150 --> 03:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
so the short answer is no they find out
 
03:54:16.370 --> 03:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
in April when the settlement's
 
03:54:16.380 --> 03:54:18.290 align:start position:0%
in April when the settlement's
distributed

03:54:18.290 --> 03:54:18.300 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
03:54:18.300 --> 03:54:19.010 align:start position:0%
distributed
um

03:54:19.010 --> 03:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:21.469 --> 03:54:21.479 align:start position:0%
they'll it usually come not usually it
 
03:54:24.410 --> 03:54:24.420 align:start position:0%
has come in in two payments
 
03:54:26.150 --> 03:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
um and then they'll get a final number
 
03:54:28.010 --> 03:54:28.020 align:start position:0%
for the current year you're in so in
 
03:54:30.050 --> 03:54:30.060 align:start position:0%
April you'll know 23
 
03:54:32.030 --> 03:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
there may be something
 
03:54:34.189 --> 03:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
um that doj is aware of that could
 
03:54:35.689 --> 03:54:35.699 align:start position:0%
influence slightly what they've
 
03:54:38.389 --> 03:54:38.399 align:start position:0%
suggested for 24 and 25 but I believe
 
03:54:41.150 --> 03:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
when the attorney was here
 
03:54:42.590 --> 03:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
um he talked about that there's there's
 
03:54:45.469 --> 03:54:45.479 align:start position:0%
a lot of unpredictables that get mixed
 
03:54:47.689 --> 03:54:47.699 align:start position:0%
into this that they just can't consider
 
03:54:49.490 --> 03:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
03:54:50.870 --> 03:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
um so when they do their estimates they
 
03:54:52.550 --> 03:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
tend to be fairly conservative so that
 
03:54:55.370 --> 03:54:55.380 align:start position:0%
they don't give you too much idea of an
 
03:54:57.530 --> 03:54:57.540 align:start position:0%
influx of money
 
03:54:59.030 --> 03:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
um but I would say that you know in
 
03:55:01.969 --> 03:55:01.979 align:start position:0%
April when you see what they get
 
03:55:04.790 --> 03:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
if they don't come back to um Senate
 
03:55:06.889 --> 03:55:06.899 align:start position:0%
ways and means that this committee may
 
03:55:09.110 --> 03:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
have them come in and just say where you
 
03:55:10.790 --> 03:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
at today and has that changed anything
 
03:55:13.010 --> 03:55:13.020 align:start position:0%
you gave us so another way of answering
 
03:55:15.050 --> 03:55:15.060 align:start position:0%
that is that there may be that kind of
 
03:55:16.550 --> 03:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
new information but it's going to be too
 
03:55:18.229 --> 03:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
late for us that would be good to go
 
03:55:21.050 --> 03:55:21.060 align:start position:0%
with these numbers right
 
03:55:22.729 --> 03:55:22.739 align:start position:0%
yes representative Southworth
 
03:55:25.010 --> 03:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
so from my perspective really these
 
03:55:26.689 --> 03:55:26.699 align:start position:0%
numbers are just for budgeting purposes
 
03:55:28.130 --> 03:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
and that's something that could happen
 
03:55:31.309 --> 03:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
it's kind of what they said no I I was
 
03:55:34.070 --> 03:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
asked um no I mean these numbers here
 
03:55:36.229 --> 03:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
are for budgeting purposes but in terms
 
03:55:37.729 --> 03:55:37.739 align:start position:0%
of what the settlement actually does
 
03:55:39.349 --> 03:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
they said it real basically was
 
03:55:42.229 --> 03:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
unpredictable that's correct and in
 
03:55:45.469 --> 03:55:45.479 align:start position:0%
response to that uh one of the represent
 
03:55:48.170 --> 03:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
fellows maybe asked for the
 
03:55:50.510 --> 03:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
10-year period of getting the you know
 
03:55:52.370 --> 03:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
what was predicted or planned for and
 
03:55:53.689 --> 03:55:53.699 align:start position:0%
what was the actual payment or maybe
 
03:55:55.910 --> 03:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
those reps involve me I sent that to the
 
03:55:58.070 --> 03:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
committee members and you'll see that it
 
03:55:58.080 --> 03:55:59.389 align:start position:0%
committee members and you'll see that it
fluctuates

03:55:59.389 --> 03:55:59.399 align:start position:0%
fluctuates
 
03:55:59.399 --> 03:56:00.110 align:start position:0%
fluctuates
um

03:56:00.110 --> 03:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:02.870 --> 03:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
by a few million almost every year
 
03:56:05.150 --> 03:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
so you get you may get a few million
 
03:56:06.769 --> 03:56:06.779 align:start position:0%
more or less than what's been budgeted
 
03:56:09.410 --> 03:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
and again it depends on factors that the
 
03:56:10.729 --> 03:56:10.739 align:start position:0%
attorney suggests that he has no
 
03:56:12.110 --> 03:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
influence over
 
03:56:12.120 --> 03:56:14.929 align:start position:0%
influence over
representative

03:56:14.929 --> 03:56:14.939 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:56:19.070 --> 03:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
yes and as I remember the one huge
 
03:56:22.189 --> 03:56:22.199 align:start position:0%
variation that we had was at the time
 
03:56:24.530 --> 03:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
when they finally were settling cases
 
03:56:26.990 --> 03:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
that they'd been arguing over for four
 
03:56:29.510 --> 03:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
or five years and almost all of them got
 
03:56:33.110 --> 03:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
settled the same year in fiscal 2013 and
 
03:56:34.969 --> 03:56:34.979 align:start position:0%
he doesn't believe there's much like
 
03:56:38.630 --> 03:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
that out there now right in fiscal 2013
 
03:56:38.640 --> 03:56:39.410 align:start position:0%
that out there now right in fiscal 2013
um

03:56:39.410 --> 03:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:43.250 --> 03:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
the plan had called for 42.4 million
 
03:56:46.070 --> 03:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
you actually got 63.2 million in and
 
03:56:47.929 --> 03:56:47.939 align:start position:0%
it's as a result of what rev savomi's
 
03:56:49.210 --> 03:56:49.220 align:start position:0%
talking about there was a number of
 
03:56:51.229 --> 03:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
issues in the master settlement
 
03:56:52.670 --> 03:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
agreement that hadn't been fully
 
03:56:54.229 --> 03:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
resolved many of those were finally
 
03:56:56.809 --> 03:56:56.819 align:start position:0%
resolved and as a as a result of that
 
03:56:58.309 --> 03:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
the states were trued up in what was
 
03:56:59.809 --> 03:56:59.819 align:start position:0%
owed to them
 
03:57:01.729 --> 03:57:01.739 align:start position:0%
since then
 
03:57:04.910 --> 03:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
you've seen fluctuations uh
 
03:57:08.290 --> 03:57:08.300 align:start position:0%
as high as 10.9 million above the plan
 
03:57:11.870 --> 03:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
or 2.6 million below the plan
 
03:57:14.389 --> 03:57:14.399 align:start position:0%
since 2017 everything has been slightly
 
03:57:16.969 --> 03:57:16.979 align:start position:0%
above the plan or significantly above
 
03:57:20.210 --> 03:57:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:20.220 --> 03:57:21.469 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:57:21.469 --> 03:57:21.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:57:23.689 --> 03:57:23.699 align:start position:0%
I don't think based on the testimony we
 
03:57:25.550 --> 03:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
heard and the numbers that we saw I mean
 
03:57:26.570 --> 03:57:26.580 align:start position:0%
I really
 
03:57:28.610 --> 03:57:28.620 align:start position:0%
I don't think we have a whole lot of
 
03:57:31.429 --> 03:57:31.439 align:start position:0%
basis within this committee to tweak
 
03:57:33.469 --> 03:57:33.479 align:start position:0%
these numbers all that much I mean even
 
03:57:37.070 --> 03:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
even the testimony we heard was
 
03:57:39.889 --> 03:57:39.899 align:start position:0%
he throws darts every year and uh for
 
03:57:42.469 --> 03:57:42.479 align:start position:0%
lack of a better description so I mean I
 
03:57:45.370 --> 03:57:45.380 align:start position:0%
would be willing to accept these numbers
 
03:57:47.269 --> 03:57:47.279 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that there's really
 
03:57:49.729 --> 03:57:49.739 align:start position:0%
not much we could do with that and even
 
03:57:53.150 --> 03:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
the agency was unsure where we go from
 
03:57:54.710 --> 03:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
one year to the next
 
03:57:56.570 --> 03:57:56.580 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury
 
03:57:58.790 --> 03:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty much echoing what's been said
 
03:58:01.309 --> 03:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
but what I recall the testimony is he
 
03:58:03.349 --> 03:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
said the only thing he's sure of is that
 
03:58:04.910 --> 03:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
the number is wrong
 
03:58:08.689 --> 03:58:08.699 align:start position:0%
and so from a budgeting perspective we
 
03:58:10.610 --> 03:58:10.620 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be budgeting for an unforeseen
 
03:58:10.620 --> 03:58:11.809 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be budgeting for an unforeseen
bonus

03:58:11.809 --> 03:58:11.819 align:start position:0%
bonus
 
03:58:14.030 --> 03:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
what he was really forecasting is a
 
03:58:17.570 --> 03:58:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:21.170 --> 03:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:29.030 --> 03:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:31.910 --> 03:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay is there a second
 
03:58:34.670 --> 03:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
chamber okay excellent okay so the
 
03:58:36.710 --> 03:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
motion on the table or as a straw vote
 
03:58:39.650 --> 03:58:39.660 align:start position:0%
is that we accept the agency estimate
 
03:58:39.660 --> 03:58:41.510 align:start position:0%
is that we accept the agency estimate
for

03:58:41.510 --> 03:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:58:43.969 --> 03:58:43.979 align:start position:0%
23 24 and 25 all those a favor raise
 
03:58:46.849 --> 03:58:46.859 align:start position:0%
your arm please thank you looks like
 
03:58:50.110 --> 03:58:50.120 align:start position:0%
it's unanimous yeah
 
03:58:54.530 --> 03:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
okay so uh we will continue on and we
 
03:58:56.210 --> 03:58:56.220 align:start position:0%
won't need to revisit that unless you
 
03:58:59.150 --> 03:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
come up with a reason why we need to
 
03:59:03.050 --> 03:59:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:04.729 --> 03:59:04.739 align:start position:0%
the the next one I'm going to point you
 
03:59:06.290 --> 03:59:06.300 align:start position:0%
to I'm not suggesting that you need to
 
03:59:07.969 --> 03:59:07.979 align:start position:0%
act on it today but I just need to know
 
03:59:09.889 --> 03:59:09.899 align:start position:0%
if there's any questions is the lottery
 
03:59:14.389 --> 03:59:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:16.550 --> 03:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
so I just if they're I think there was
 
03:59:18.170 --> 03:59:18.180 align:start position:0%
some questions the other day and if
 
03:59:19.849 --> 03:59:19.859 align:start position:0%
there's certain questions that I need to
 
03:59:21.530 --> 03:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
ask the Lottery Commission to let me
 
03:59:23.330 --> 03:59:23.340 align:start position:0%
know what those are
 
03:59:25.610 --> 03:59:25.620 align:start position:0%
I definitely got the sense that we
 
03:59:28.790 --> 03:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
needed to hear more from them
 
03:59:30.590 --> 03:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure I have a list of
 
03:59:33.710 --> 03:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
questions yet but please speak up folks
 
03:59:38.389 --> 03:59:38.399 align:start position:0%
yes representative Ames all me sorry
 
03:59:41.510 --> 03:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh yes on the one that I was most
 
03:59:44.990 --> 03:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
interested in was a breakdown which that
 
03:59:47.870 --> 03:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
he'd always given us before a breakdown
 
03:59:52.370 --> 03:59:52.380 align:start position:0%
by game type of game on and the trend
 
03:59:55.309 --> 03:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
the trend in scratch tickets the trend
 
03:59:58.670 --> 03:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
in in Super Bowl
 
04:00:02.030 --> 04:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
Powerball not Super Bowl
 
04:00:04.849 --> 04:00:04.859 align:start position:0%
and the rest of them on
 
04:00:08.570 --> 04:00:08.580 align:start position:0%
Powerball and Mega Millions are are
 
04:00:11.030 --> 04:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
pretty much
 
04:00:13.250 --> 04:00:13.260 align:start position:0%
like putting your money in a slot
 
04:00:14.809 --> 04:00:14.819 align:start position:0%
machine you might win or you might not
 
04:00:16.790 --> 04:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
but but
 
04:00:20.150 --> 04:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
on but the scratch tickets are are
 
04:00:22.189 --> 04:00:22.199 align:start position:0%
fairly consistent
 
04:00:24.710 --> 04:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
one way or another and
 
04:00:24.720 --> 04:00:25.969 align:start position:0%
one way or another and
um

04:00:25.969 --> 04:00:25.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:25.979 --> 04:00:27.469 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

04:00:27.469 --> 04:00:27.479 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:00:30.349 --> 04:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
and the the charitable gaming money we
 
04:00:32.990 --> 04:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
spending a lot of time on as money is
 
04:00:36.650 --> 04:00:36.660 align:start position:0%
not much representative Southworth I
 
04:00:38.809 --> 04:00:38.819 align:start position:0%
guess just double checking
 
04:00:41.030 --> 04:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
um was there somewhat of an anomaly for
 
04:00:43.610 --> 04:00:43.620 align:start position:0%
2023 whether it was a big pot or
 
04:00:45.410 --> 04:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
something like that the Senate seems
 
04:00:48.650 --> 04:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
steady it was there's been several
 
04:00:51.410 --> 04:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
um Powerball Mega Millions 2023 was
 
04:00:53.030 --> 04:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
higher it wasn't enough that's some of
 
04:00:55.969 --> 04:00:55.979 align:start position:0%
it yes yes thank you but I to represent
 
04:00:57.769 --> 04:00:57.779 align:start position:0%
almi's point I think the committee does
 
04:00:59.689 --> 04:00:59.699 align:start position:0%
deserve the breakdown by the various
 
04:01:01.790 --> 04:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources so I will reach out to
 
04:01:04.010 --> 04:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
the Lottery Commission to ask for that
 
04:01:05.750 --> 04:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
and then ask them to come in either on
 
04:01:08.210 --> 04:01:08.220 align:start position:0%
the 27th or 28th and then the sports
 
04:01:10.070 --> 04:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
betting is
 
04:01:13.870 --> 04:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
I think one of the just taking off
 
04:01:16.269 --> 04:01:16.279 align:start position:0%
which is unfortunate but anyway
 
04:01:19.849 --> 04:01:19.859 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis yeah I I remember
 
04:01:22.670 --> 04:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
that um the commissioner didn't bring
 
04:01:24.950 --> 04:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
something with him to the presentation
 
04:01:26.570 --> 04:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
that we had because he'd been on
 
04:01:29.330 --> 04:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
vacation so I don't know if we got that
 
04:01:32.030 --> 04:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
presentation but I I think I'd like to
 
04:01:34.429 --> 04:01:34.439 align:start position:0%
go through the whole thing again just
 
04:01:36.590 --> 04:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
that his you know not asking him about
 
04:01:39.469 --> 04:01:39.479 align:start position:0%
what the lottery does anymore but just
 
04:01:43.070 --> 04:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
focusing on why are these why are these
 
04:01:45.950 --> 04:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
your estimates because some things are
 
04:01:48.950 --> 04:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
volatile and there are some things that
 
04:01:51.290 --> 04:01:51.300 align:start position:0%
I believe he probably is taking into
 
04:01:55.309 --> 04:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
account the activity in other states so
 
04:01:58.429 --> 04:01:58.439 align:start position:0%
we may lose some some of those programs
 
04:02:00.229 --> 04:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
like the you know he's talking he was
 
04:02:01.969 --> 04:02:01.979 align:start position:0%
talking about like betting on your
 
04:02:04.070 --> 04:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
telephone you know that
 
04:02:05.929 --> 04:02:05.939 align:start position:0%
so I don't do any of that so I don't
 
04:02:07.550 --> 04:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
know very well but that that
 
04:02:10.969 --> 04:02:10.979 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts picking that up means we
 
04:02:13.130 --> 04:02:13.140 align:start position:0%
probably will go down so I that that's
 
04:02:14.809 --> 04:02:14.819 align:start position:0%
the part I would like to hear all over
 
04:02:16.550 --> 04:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
again yeah so it sounds like we should
 
04:02:19.130 --> 04:02:19.140 align:start position:0%
request uh someone from the lottery to
 
04:02:21.349 --> 04:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
come back and explain that in more depth
 
04:02:23.929 --> 04:02:23.939 align:start position:0%
yep that'd be great anyone else yes
 
04:02:25.550 --> 04:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
representative orrs
 
04:02:27.650 --> 04:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:02:30.769 --> 04:02:30.779 align:start position:0%
Brett fellows for bringing that up I
 
04:02:32.450 --> 04:02:32.460 align:start position:0%
mean that was a disaster I couldn't
 
04:02:35.630 --> 04:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
believe it so yes I think we need every
 
04:02:35.640 --> 04:02:37.510 align:start position:0%
believe it so yes I think we need every
yes

04:02:37.510 --> 04:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:02:39.889 --> 04:02:39.899 align:start position:0%
representative all me and then flood
 
04:02:43.969 --> 04:02:43.979 align:start position:0%
yeah um but that remind we did ask for a
 
04:02:47.750 --> 04:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on a bill I think last time
 
04:02:52.729 --> 04:02:52.739 align:start position:0%
that hasn't come yet it has oh good and
 
04:02:56.510 --> 04:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
I didn't see it represent a put
 
04:02:59.929 --> 04:02:59.939 align:start position:0%
yes uh they got a plethora
 
04:03:02.570 --> 04:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
of games out there scratch cards and all
 
04:03:04.670 --> 04:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
that stuff is there a saturation point
 
04:03:06.290 --> 04:03:06.300 align:start position:0%
where they add one more it doesn't grow
 
04:03:08.210 --> 04:03:08.220 align:start position:0%
the pot
 
04:03:10.370 --> 04:03:10.380 align:start position:0%
yeah I think
 
04:03:12.530 --> 04:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
a good question for
 
04:03:14.210 --> 04:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
um the director
 
04:03:15.769 --> 04:03:15.779 align:start position:0%
I mean what we've heard him talk about
 
04:03:17.450 --> 04:03:17.460 align:start position:0%
in this committee before scratch tickets
 
04:03:19.070 --> 04:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
seem to be
 
04:03:21.590 --> 04:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
steady you know that seems to be a very
 
04:03:24.410 --> 04:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
reliable Revenue Source it's your Mega
 
04:03:27.650 --> 04:03:27.660 align:start position:0%
Millions and powerballs and and those
 
04:03:29.630 --> 04:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
types of games that sometimes fluctuate
 
04:03:31.429 --> 04:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
because people
 
04:03:32.929 --> 04:03:32.939 align:start position:0%
um tend to play those when there's
 
04:03:34.729 --> 04:03:34.739 align:start position:0%
bigger jackpots and may not play them as
 
04:03:36.710 --> 04:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
often when there's not and then you have
 
04:03:39.889 --> 04:03:39.899 align:start position:0%
the sports betting issue that is
 
04:03:41.870 --> 04:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
taking off a little bit more quickly
 
04:03:44.090 --> 04:03:44.100 align:start position:0%
than I think they anticipated and maybe
 
04:03:45.590 --> 04:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's leveling out I don't know but I
 
04:03:47.570 --> 04:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
think these are all appropriate
 
04:03:49.849 --> 04:03:49.859 align:start position:0%
questions for Charlie and his his team
 
04:03:49.859 --> 04:03:50.870 align:start position:0%
questions for Charlie and his his team
to

04:03:50.870 --> 04:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:03:54.110 --> 04:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
discuss with this group
 
04:03:57.410 --> 04:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
representative ulrey yeah could you talk
 
04:03:59.290 --> 04:03:59.300 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner as well and ask him
 
04:04:03.830 --> 04:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
the question is uh fiscal year 2023 he's
 
04:04:07.250 --> 04:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
got an anomaly coming in but we've had
 
04:04:09.530 --> 04:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
two Within
 
04:04:13.010 --> 04:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
eight weeks 10 weeks of each other of a
 
04:04:14.929 --> 04:04:14.939 align:start position:0%
half billion well one was a billion
 
04:04:17.090 --> 04:04:17.100 align:start position:0%
dollars and the other was a half billion
 
04:04:20.450 --> 04:04:20.460 align:start position:0%
the take to New Hampshire was relatively
 
04:04:23.950 --> 04:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
large in both of those and I is that
 
04:04:28.550 --> 04:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
2023 year or is it 2024 year on those
 
04:04:31.670 --> 04:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure where it splits it
 
04:04:34.309 --> 04:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
should be 23. I believe it's all 23 that
 
04:04:36.590 --> 04:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
you're referencing but again
 
04:04:38.090 --> 04:04:38.100 align:start position:0%
we would need to just confirm with
 
04:04:40.309 --> 04:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
Charlie yeah that's that's how much is
 
04:04:40.319 --> 04:04:42.469 align:start position:0%
Charlie yeah that's that's how much is
and

04:04:42.469 --> 04:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:04:45.410 --> 04:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
for some members of the committee just
 
04:04:46.670 --> 04:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
to regard
 
04:04:46.680 --> 04:04:48.710 align:start position:0%
to regard
ah

04:04:48.710 --> 04:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
ah
 
04:04:50.750 --> 04:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
the list of the different programs that
 
04:04:52.849 --> 04:04:52.859 align:start position:0%
are out there and which one and two
 
04:04:56.530 --> 04:04:56.540 align:start position:0%
dollar tickets pay out the best would be
 
04:04:59.030 --> 04:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
and where the prize tickets still reside
 
04:05:01.429 --> 04:05:01.439 align:start position:0%
where's the fellows
 
04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
um yes I'm also you may know the answer
 
04:05:06.530 --> 04:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
to this I thought
 
04:05:10.070 --> 04:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
for sure the scratch tickets and the the
 
04:05:12.590 --> 04:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
you know the the Powerball all those
 
04:05:14.929 --> 04:05:14.939 align:start position:0%
kinds of games definitely went to the
 
04:05:17.210 --> 04:05:17.220 align:start position:0%
trust fund education trust fund I
 
04:05:19.010 --> 04:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
thought the sports betting was different
 
04:05:21.110 --> 04:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
but is that not correct is everything
 
04:05:24.410 --> 04:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
that everything any anything
 
04:05:24.420 --> 04:05:25.130 align:start position:0%
that everything any anything
um

04:05:25.130 --> 04:05:25.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:25.140 --> 04:05:26.389 align:start position:0%
um
the

04:05:26.389 --> 04:05:26.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:05:28.870 --> 04:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission
 
04:05:31.010 --> 04:05:31.020 align:start position:0%
overseas all of that goes to the
 
04:05:33.170 --> 04:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
education that's correct okay thank you
 
04:05:35.929 --> 04:05:35.939 align:start position:0%
yeah so they they have the lottery fund
 
04:05:37.550 --> 04:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
which is what they do their day-to-day
 
04:05:40.490 --> 04:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
business out of and at the end of
 
04:05:42.050 --> 04:05:42.060 align:start position:0%
I think it's that every month they do a
 
04:05:43.790 --> 04:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
transfer not think I know and every
 
04:05:45.050 --> 04:05:45.060 align:start position:0%
month at the end of every month they do
 
04:05:48.410 --> 04:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
a transfer and that transfers the
 
04:05:50.389 --> 04:05:50.399 align:start position:0%
revenue or profit that they don't need
 
04:05:51.889 --> 04:05:51.899 align:start position:0%
for their day-to-day business that goes
 
04:05:58.370 --> 04:05:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:00.050 --> 04:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming
 
04:06:00.060 --> 04:06:03.010 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming
yes

04:06:03.010 --> 04:06:03.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's in the Constitution I mean all
 
04:06:10.929 --> 04:06:10.939 align:start position:0%
the lottery uh Revenue defined as net of
 
04:06:14.929 --> 04:06:14.939 align:start position:0%
costs and maybe and set aside for
 
04:06:17.389 --> 04:06:17.399 align:start position:0%
uh problem gaming fund and that kind of
 
04:06:20.150 --> 04:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
thing all the revenue has to go pour
 
04:06:22.790 --> 04:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
into the education in into the education
 
04:06:25.130 --> 04:06:25.140 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
04:06:26.389 --> 04:06:26.399 align:start position:0%
all right we'll definitely have a
 
04:06:27.849 --> 04:06:27.859 align:start position:0%
lottery come back with more information
 
04:06:30.889 --> 04:06:30.899 align:start position:0%
uh a lot more information and I just
 
04:06:33.590 --> 04:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify too that the lottery
 
04:06:35.570 --> 04:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
did come in with a presentation they
 
04:06:37.250 --> 04:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
didn't have Revenue information in it it
 
04:06:38.570 --> 04:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
was just an overview of their department
 
04:06:41.389 --> 04:06:41.399 align:start position:0%
but they did give us an email based on a
 
04:06:43.070 --> 04:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
question of what their projections were
 
04:06:45.170 --> 04:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
that I forwarded to the committee and
 
04:06:46.610 --> 04:06:46.620 align:start position:0%
that's how we have the numbers in there
 
04:06:50.689 --> 04:06:50.699 align:start position:0%
for the 170.8 158 and 163. and we just
 
04:06:52.610 --> 04:06:52.620 align:start position:0%
need to have that fleshed out so we can
 
04:06:54.710 --> 04:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
ask questions no understood I just
 
04:06:56.630 --> 04:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to to give Charlie a little bit
 
04:06:58.490 --> 04:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
of credit for something yeah you know he
 
04:06:59.809 --> 04:06:59.819 align:start position:0%
did do that and we appreciate that it's
 
04:07:01.490 --> 04:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
just we obviously have a lot more
 
04:07:03.229 --> 04:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
questions I'm sorry uh representative
 
04:07:04.910 --> 04:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
and then representative yeah ask them
 
04:07:11.630 --> 04:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:16.030 --> 04:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
yes on somebody mentioned saturation
 
04:07:21.469 --> 04:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
saturation is a cultural number on in
 
04:07:24.349 --> 04:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts when Charlie joined us
 
04:07:30.849 --> 04:07:30.859 align:start position:0%
about 10 years ago on the amount per
 
04:07:34.429 --> 04:07:34.439 align:start position:0%
capita including the babies that was
 
04:07:38.210 --> 04:07:38.220 align:start position:0%
being gambled in the counties on
 
04:07:40.729 --> 04:07:40.739 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts counties next to New
 
04:07:40.739 --> 04:07:41.710 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts counties next to New
Hampshire

04:07:41.710 --> 04:07:41.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:07:44.929 --> 04:07:44.939 align:start position:0%
was one thousand one hundred dollars and
 
04:07:44.939 --> 04:07:45.830 align:start position:0%
was one thousand one hundred dollars and
something

04:07:45.830 --> 04:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:07:45.840 --> 04:07:48.969 align:start position:0%
something
mm-hmm

04:07:48.969 --> 04:07:48.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:52.670 --> 04:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
so uh and New Hampshire was Way Beyond
 
04:07:55.010 --> 04:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
behind that I didn't see a number but
 
04:07:59.269 --> 04:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
but on and in looking at the big casinos
 
04:08:01.550 --> 04:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
in Casino studies that were done by a
 
04:08:06.830 --> 04:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
pro Casino paid Casino person on the New
 
04:08:10.610 --> 04:08:10.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was the lowest spending in in
 
04:08:11.990 --> 04:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
the region
 
04:08:15.349 --> 04:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
now we are being set they are increasing
 
04:08:19.550 --> 04:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
our saturation levels right now so so we
 
04:08:21.650 --> 04:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
could have considerable growth in this
 
04:08:23.809 --> 04:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
not that I would like it but we could
 
04:08:26.210 --> 04:08:26.220 align:start position:0%
have considerable growth in this still
 
04:08:28.429 --> 04:08:28.439 align:start position:0%
to come
 
04:08:28.439 --> 04:08:29.650 align:start position:0%
to come
okay

04:08:29.650 --> 04:08:29.660 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:08:32.809 --> 04:08:32.819 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:08:35.450 --> 04:08:35.460 align:start position:0%
that would also bring up the question
 
04:08:38.269 --> 04:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
regarding our sports betting and how
 
04:08:40.849 --> 04:08:40.859 align:start position:0%
much that will decline
 
04:08:43.429 --> 04:08:43.439 align:start position:0%
uh with Massachusetts developing their
 
04:08:46.490 --> 04:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
sports betting uh again
 
04:08:49.490 --> 04:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
as an estimate but Charlie's pretty good
 
04:08:49.500 --> 04:08:50.750 align:start position:0%
as an estimate but Charlie's pretty good
at

04:08:50.750 --> 04:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:08:53.330 --> 04:08:53.340 align:start position:0%
estimating he did warn us off the 50
 
04:08:56.990 --> 04:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
tickets that cost Massachusetts a whole
 
04:08:59.750 --> 04:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:59.760 --> 04:09:01.849 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:09:01.849 --> 04:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:09:03.410 --> 04:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
but that's
 
04:09:06.170 --> 04:09:06.180 align:start position:0%
you know that's going to be an assault
 
04:09:09.250 --> 04:09:09.260 align:start position:0%
on revenue from that particular aspect
 
04:09:11.630 --> 04:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
although so far it doesn't look like the
 
04:09:14.530 --> 04:09:14.540 align:start position:0%
sports betting has done anything in Mass
 
04:09:17.269 --> 04:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
7 500 dollars
 
04:09:19.910 --> 04:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
I have no idea
 
04:09:21.889 --> 04:09:21.899 align:start position:0%
all right so we we obviously need a
 
04:09:23.510 --> 04:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
presentation from them we didn't get the
 
04:09:24.950 --> 04:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
full-fledged one so we'll we'll
 
04:09:28.010 --> 04:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
definitely schedule that for the 27th uh
 
04:09:29.929 --> 04:09:29.939 align:start position:0%
there may be a few other small
 
04:09:32.330 --> 04:09:32.340 align:start position:0%
categories we could take a look at in
 
04:09:34.490 --> 04:09:34.500 align:start position:0%
our short amount of time on this page I
 
04:09:36.769 --> 04:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
see maybe uh column I
 
04:09:45.590 --> 04:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:54.610 --> 04:09:54.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:57.170 --> 04:09:57.180 align:start position:0%
the governor's estimate there's a tiny
 
04:10:00.950 --> 04:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
one I guess but actually
 
04:10:05.210 --> 04:10:05.220 align:start position:0%
I take that backs the in O3 the agency
 
04:10:07.370 --> 04:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
thinks it's getting in more than the
 
04:10:10.130 --> 04:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
governor but in general the courts have
 
04:10:12.110 --> 04:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
usually gotten in less than we tell them
 
04:10:13.910 --> 04:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
that we're going to get in
 
04:10:17.090 --> 04:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
when we try to increase them
 
04:10:20.630 --> 04:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
a question for representative Southworth
 
04:10:22.910 --> 04:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
yes I do notice and I wonder again if
 
04:10:25.250 --> 04:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
it's anomaly type stuff that often the
 
04:10:27.950 --> 04:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
governor is a little different in 23 but
 
04:10:30.590 --> 04:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
then he's exactly the same in 24 and 25.
 
04:10:33.530 --> 04:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering if that's really a big
 
04:10:36.590 --> 04:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
issue exactly what happened in 23 if by
 
04:10:41.330 --> 04:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:43.670 --> 04:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
again I would need to confirm with the
 
04:10:46.010 --> 04:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
governor's budget director but I suspect
 
04:10:48.650 --> 04:10:48.660 align:start position:0%
it's maybe some of its rounding when
 
04:10:51.469 --> 04:10:51.479 align:start position:0%
they were putting together their numbers
 
04:10:55.370 --> 04:10:55.380 align:start position:0%
they didn't go out to the the 10th you
 
04:10:55.380 --> 04:10:56.630 align:start position:0%
they didn't go out to the the 10th you
know

04:10:56.630 --> 04:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:10:59.269 --> 04:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
all right representative ulery then aims
 
04:11:00.349 --> 04:11:00.359 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:11:02.870 --> 04:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
we need to remember that on court fees
 
04:11:06.530 --> 04:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
uh that a good portion of that is split
 
04:11:08.750 --> 04:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
with motor vehicle because mailing goes
 
04:11:12.170 --> 04:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
to department for some unknown reason
 
04:11:14.330 --> 04:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
mailings go to the Department of Safety
 
04:11:17.090 --> 04:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
and don't get counted in the General
 
04:11:19.070 --> 04:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue but get
 
04:11:22.490 --> 04:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
put in the General Revenue wow if you go
 
04:11:25.370 --> 04:11:25.380 align:start position:0%
to court it goes in through and is
 
04:11:28.130 --> 04:11:28.140 align:start position:0%
recorded as Court piece
 
04:11:29.809 --> 04:11:29.819 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how to correct that and
 
04:11:32.510 --> 04:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
I and I know that safety doesn't want to
 
04:11:35.510 --> 04:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
correct it because I have a
 
04:11:37.670 --> 04:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
I have a fish and they've got a skimming
 
04:11:43.969 --> 04:11:43.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:46.610 --> 04:11:46.620 align:start position:0%
yeah I I would be in order to move some
 
04:11:46.620 --> 04:11:48.349 align:start position:0%
yeah I I would be in order to move some
numbers

04:11:48.349 --> 04:11:48.359 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
04:11:48.359 --> 04:11:50.210 align:start position:0%
numbers
okay

04:11:50.210 --> 04:11:50.220 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:11:52.790 --> 04:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
um well then I I would move for
 
04:11:57.170 --> 04:11:57.180 align:start position:0%
the court finding fees column I
 
04:11:57.180 --> 04:11:58.729 align:start position:0%
the court finding fees column I
um

04:11:58.729 --> 04:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:58.739 --> 04:12:01.790 align:start position:0%
um
13.8

04:12:01.790 --> 04:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:05.889 --> 04:12:05.899 align:start position:0%
or fiscal year 23
 
04:12:09.429 --> 04:12:09.439 align:start position:0%
13.9 for 24.
 
04:12:12.889 --> 04:12:12.899 align:start position:0%
14.1 for 25.
 
04:12:15.710 --> 04:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
is second uh representative all me I
 
04:12:18.530 --> 04:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
guess is right there okay uh any more
 
04:12:28.849 --> 04:12:28.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:31.910 --> 04:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
all right uh all those in favor of
 
04:12:35.990 --> 04:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:37.790 --> 04:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
excellent unanimous
 
04:12:40.010 --> 04:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
we do not need to revisit that
 
04:12:43.610 --> 04:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
check I'm wondering about something
 
04:12:46.729 --> 04:12:46.739 align:start position:0%
um that's large can you turn on your
 
04:12:48.110 --> 04:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
microphone because we can't hear you
 
04:12:51.769 --> 04:12:51.779 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry uh other
 
04:12:55.370 --> 04:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
we can't predict other at all
 
04:12:55.380 --> 04:12:56.870 align:start position:0%
we can't predict other at all
uh

04:12:56.870 --> 04:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:13:00.050 --> 04:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
it's up to das if we want to hold on to
 
04:13:01.790 --> 04:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
it to the end and ask them have you
 
04:13:03.670 --> 04:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
changed anything
 
04:13:06.590 --> 04:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
then that's one thing but other than
 
04:13:06.600 --> 04:13:08.990 align:start position:0%
then that's one thing but other than
that

04:13:08.990 --> 04:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:12.290 --> 04:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
uh just one thing before you go with
 
04:13:13.910 --> 04:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
other yeah you'll notice that the
 
04:13:15.889 --> 04:13:15.899 align:start position:0%
governor's got a number of 97 I put a
 
04:13:18.650 --> 04:13:18.660 align:start position:0%
number of 111.
 
04:13:20.389 --> 04:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
and so I reached out to the governor's
 
04:13:23.210 --> 04:13:23.220 align:start position:0%
director on that one in particular
 
04:13:25.729 --> 04:13:25.739 align:start position:0%
he believes his number and there was
 
04:13:29.929 --> 04:13:29.939 align:start position:0%
already some of the interest that the um
 
04:13:31.610 --> 04:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
the treasurer discussed with you was
 
04:13:33.050 --> 04:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
already kind of baked into the other
 
04:13:36.050 --> 04:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
number that he had I have it as a
 
04:13:38.510 --> 04:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
separate number so I need to confirm
 
04:13:42.110 --> 04:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
what's correct for at least 23 24 and 25
 
04:13:43.969 --> 04:13:43.979 align:start position:0%
you could go forward with that but I
 
04:13:49.070 --> 04:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:50.630 --> 04:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
just till I get an answer I don't want
 
04:13:52.550 --> 04:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
you to put 111 and then find it was
 
04:13:54.110 --> 04:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
wrong the other thing I'd like to point
 
04:13:55.849 --> 04:13:55.859 align:start position:0%
out with the other is at the bottom
 
04:13:57.349 --> 04:13:57.359 align:start position:0%
you'll see the amount of the interest
 
04:13:59.750 --> 04:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue that's being included
 
04:14:02.450 --> 04:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
in those numbers and you see that
 
04:14:04.729 --> 04:14:04.739 align:start position:0%
they tie right to the governors in 24
 
04:14:07.189 --> 04:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
and 25 so
 
04:14:09.530 --> 04:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
I just I just need to clarify 23 for you
 
04:14:09.540 --> 04:14:10.910 align:start position:0%
I just I just need to clarify 23 for you
good

04:14:10.910 --> 04:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:14:13.070 --> 04:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative Ellery yeah since it's
 
04:14:16.670 --> 04:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
apparently decided what to do with other
 
04:14:16.680 --> 04:14:18.550 align:start position:0%
apparently decided what to do with other
yeah

04:14:18.550 --> 04:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:14:22.250 --> 04:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
so that's a thought I would like to move
 
04:14:26.349 --> 04:14:26.359 align:start position:0%
the moves the estimates of 13.2 13.2
 
04:14:29.990 --> 04:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
13.2 that sounds repetitive because it
 
04:14:30.000 --> 04:14:31.510 align:start position:0%
13.2 that sounds repetitive because it
is

04:14:31.510 --> 04:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:14:34.370 --> 04:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
okay do we have a second
 
04:14:39.050 --> 04:14:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:41.510 --> 04:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
any questions comments representative
 
04:14:44.330 --> 04:14:44.340 align:start position:0%
Rochford okay you've been all those in
 
04:14:46.309 --> 04:14:46.319 align:start position:0%
favor accepting that motion raise your
 
04:14:48.769 --> 04:14:48.779 align:start position:0%
hand one two
 
04:14:48.779 --> 04:14:49.870 align:start position:0%
hand one two
yeah

04:14:49.870 --> 04:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:14:52.429 --> 04:14:52.439 align:start position:0%
it's illegal can't do that all right
 
04:14:55.969 --> 04:14:55.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:02.410 --> 04:15:02.420 align:start position:0%

Securities uh
 
04:15:14.269 --> 04:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
representative would you like to just
 
04:15:16.010 --> 04:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
discuss that a little bit I just don't
 
04:15:18.410 --> 04:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
want to make all the Motions but is
 
04:15:19.670 --> 04:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
there someone who'd like to make a
 
04:15:22.429 --> 04:15:22.439 align:start position:0%
motion to approve securities right right
 
04:15:36.170 --> 04:15:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:42.889 --> 04:15:42.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:47.990 --> 04:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:50.750 --> 04:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
okay uh any discussion questions
 
04:15:50.760 --> 04:15:52.610 align:start position:0%
okay uh any discussion questions
comments

04:15:52.610 --> 04:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
comments
 
04:15:55.370 --> 04:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
all those in favor raise your arm white
 
04:15:56.570 --> 04:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
people want to get out of here don't
 
04:15:58.729 --> 04:15:58.739 align:start position:0%
they okay looks like it's unanimous
 
04:16:04.370 --> 04:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:06.410 --> 04:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
well it is an accomplishment to think of
 
04:16:09.229 --> 04:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
the number we've got
 
04:16:11.210 --> 04:16:11.220 align:start position:0%
yeah it's fun to check I'm gonna check
 
04:16:11.220 --> 04:16:15.469 align:start position:0%
yeah it's fun to check I'm gonna check
mark

04:16:15.469 --> 04:16:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:17.689 --> 04:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
uh Chris are there other things that you
 
04:16:19.849 --> 04:16:19.859 align:start position:0%
might want us looking at that could be
 
04:16:22.910 --> 04:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
simple I think maybe the only other one
 
04:16:27.590 --> 04:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
might be Liquor on page three column d
 
04:16:30.530 --> 04:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
unless there's some need for additional
 
04:16:34.729 --> 04:16:34.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:37.250 --> 04:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
representative Ulrich
 
04:16:39.650 --> 04:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
as liquor indicated that the decline
 
04:16:42.290 --> 04:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
that took place during covet has changed
 
04:16:45.650 --> 04:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
or are they still running
 
04:16:49.870 --> 04:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
kind of lower than the anticipated
 
04:16:52.070 --> 04:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
they're not running
 
04:16:55.429 --> 04:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
um lower the issue you've seen the last
 
04:16:57.469 --> 04:16:57.479 align:start position:0%
three years is there's been an extra
 
04:17:00.229 --> 04:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
amount deducted from their revenue
 
04:17:02.510 --> 04:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
before it got to the general fund
 
04:17:06.229 --> 04:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
so the granted Advantage the the
 
04:17:08.269 --> 04:17:08.279 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion fund
 
04:17:10.490 --> 04:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
so during covid and the in two years
 
04:17:12.710 --> 04:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
after with the increased roles the
 
04:17:15.290 --> 04:17:15.300 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expenses have been more than
 
04:17:17.150 --> 04:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
originally budgeted
 
04:17:18.710 --> 04:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
it was put in statute that the
 
04:17:20.990 --> 04:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner could request a transfer
 
04:17:23.389 --> 04:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
from The Liquor Commission to fill that
 
04:17:23.399 --> 04:17:24.410 align:start position:0%
from The Liquor Commission to fill that
Gap

04:17:24.410 --> 04:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
Gap
 
04:17:28.969 --> 04:17:28.979 align:start position:0%
so in 21 20 20 and 21 it was about eight
 
04:17:32.090 --> 04:17:32.100 align:start position:0%
million dollars and then
 
04:17:35.689 --> 04:17:35.699 align:start position:0%
22 it was about 7 million they don't
 
04:17:38.990 --> 04:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
expect to do that again in 23 or going
 
04:17:42.349 --> 04:17:42.359 align:start position:0%
forward but it's so that's what
 
04:17:45.650 --> 04:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
so their revenue has come down but a
 
04:17:47.570 --> 04:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
little bit because of that but they were
 
04:17:47.580 --> 04:17:48.590 align:start position:0%
little bit because of that but they were
trending

04:17:48.590 --> 04:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
trending
 
04:17:48.600 --> 04:17:50.510 align:start position:0%
trending
upwards

04:17:50.510 --> 04:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
upwards
 
04:17:52.849 --> 04:17:52.859 align:start position:0%
right their forecast was up but there's
 
04:17:54.229 --> 04:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
that and there's another 10 to 11
 
04:17:56.450 --> 04:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
million that gets transferred so when
 
04:17:58.550 --> 04:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
you look at their presentation you'll
 
04:18:01.729 --> 04:18:01.739 align:start position:0%
see their their gross line is going up
 
04:18:03.349 --> 04:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
but then they subtract some and then the
 
04:18:04.969 --> 04:18:04.979 align:start position:0%
amount going to the general fund has
 
04:18:06.769 --> 04:18:06.779 align:start position:0%
been a little less than anticipated
 
04:18:09.050 --> 04:18:09.060 align:start position:0%
follow-up no no okay representative
 
04:18:09.060 --> 04:18:10.550 align:start position:0%
follow-up no no okay representative
Mommy

04:18:10.550 --> 04:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
Mommy
 
04:18:13.250 --> 04:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh yeah isn't it
 
04:18:16.010 --> 04:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
they don't expect to be doing that next
 
04:18:18.410 --> 04:18:18.420 align:start position:0%
year because we're going to have to come
 
04:18:22.309 --> 04:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
up with a plan to finance or get rid of
 
04:18:24.530 --> 04:18:24.540 align:start position:0%
expanded medicaid
 
04:18:28.189 --> 04:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
and it might not be that way no
 
04:18:31.070 --> 04:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
um so that they expect the Medicaid
 
04:18:34.550 --> 04:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
rolls will start to come down yeah and
 
04:18:37.070 --> 04:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
at then the cost associated with that
 
04:18:38.330 --> 04:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
will come down and they think they
 
04:18:40.429 --> 04:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
should be they be in the department of
 
04:18:42.950 --> 04:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
health and human Human Services should
 
04:18:45.530 --> 04:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
be able to manage within that Revenue
 
04:18:48.290 --> 04:18:48.300 align:start position:0%
stream that they have for uh the granted
 
04:18:50.090 --> 04:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
advantage and not need the extra bump
 
04:18:53.210 --> 04:18:53.220 align:start position:0%
from Liquor Commission okay so that's
 
04:18:55.370 --> 04:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
unrelated to that other one
 
04:18:58.250 --> 04:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
I do know there is a difference between
 
04:19:02.570 --> 04:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
the governors and the agencies uh do you
 
04:19:06.889 --> 04:19:06.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:08.570 --> 04:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
so we probably should
 
04:19:09.830 --> 04:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
um could the governor be doing current
 
04:19:11.809 --> 04:19:11.819 align:start position:0%
law which is that Medicaid expansion
 
04:19:13.610 --> 04:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
hasn't been approved yet
 
04:19:15.710 --> 04:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
for the next
 
04:19:21.910 --> 04:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:24.889 --> 04:19:24.899 align:start position:0%
so does does Medicaid expansion have to
 
04:19:28.729 --> 04:19:28.739 align:start position:0%
be reauthorized for this next budget
 
04:19:31.490 --> 04:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
it does well I think it's fiscal it
 
04:19:34.010 --> 04:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
needs to be done by fiscal 24. so I
 
04:19:35.929 --> 04:19:35.939 align:start position:0%
think the idea was that it might be
 
04:19:38.150 --> 04:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
worked on some this year
 
04:19:41.030 --> 04:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
I I don't know where that's at I I know
 
04:19:42.710 --> 04:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
there was some potential bills being
 
04:19:44.929 --> 04:19:44.939 align:start position:0%
introduced but I don't know what the
 
04:19:46.790 --> 04:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
the flavor of it is and I don't know
 
04:19:46.800 --> 04:19:47.809 align:start position:0%
the flavor of it is and I don't know
what's

04:19:47.809 --> 04:19:47.819 align:start position:0%
what's
 
04:19:49.550 --> 04:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
going to happen with some of the funding
 
04:19:52.729 --> 04:19:52.739 align:start position:0%
mechanisms that were in place
 
04:19:55.010 --> 04:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
I wonder folks is this something that we
 
04:19:56.929 --> 04:19:56.939 align:start position:0%
want to hear from the governor's budget
 
04:19:59.269 --> 04:19:59.279 align:start position:0%
office or or are you comfortable making
 
04:20:02.450 --> 04:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
a decision on I think we need to hear
 
04:20:02.460 --> 04:20:03.530 align:start position:0%
a decision on I think we need to hear
from

04:20:03.530 --> 04:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:20:06.469 --> 04:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:08.510 --> 04:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
I mean to me the question would be that
 
04:20:09.889 --> 04:20:09.899 align:start position:0%
simple is
 
04:20:12.290 --> 04:20:12.300 align:start position:0%
um did in fact they have not accounted
 
04:20:13.849 --> 04:20:13.859 align:start position:0%
for the Medicaid expansion here and
 
04:20:15.830 --> 04:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's what the difference is
 
04:20:18.710 --> 04:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
and again if they do do current law
 
04:20:20.330 --> 04:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
which is what these numbers are supposed
 
04:20:21.650 --> 04:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:20:23.870 --> 04:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
um you would take that out
 
04:20:26.809 --> 04:20:26.819 align:start position:0%
but he never has used current law and
 
04:20:28.610 --> 04:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
never presentations and I bet he has a
 
04:20:29.990 --> 04:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
couple of times but
 
04:20:33.410 --> 04:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
so representative fellows yeah so I I
 
04:20:35.510 --> 04:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
think they're also still building new
 
04:20:38.030 --> 04:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
liquor stores so that can might have
 
04:20:40.370 --> 04:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
some kind of impact on
 
04:20:43.929 --> 04:20:43.939 align:start position:0%
their revenues so
 
04:20:46.550 --> 04:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
they come back they can help us yeah to
 
04:20:48.469 --> 04:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
me it's saturated they build more liquor
 
04:20:50.330 --> 04:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
stores it increases convenience but
 
04:20:52.610 --> 04:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily increase sales but
 
04:20:54.769 --> 04:20:54.779 align:start position:0%
they they differ they they think they
 
04:20:57.110 --> 04:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
get more sales at every store
 
04:20:59.510 --> 04:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
all right sounds like we're not ready to
 
04:21:01.189 --> 04:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
make a decision on this one we need
 
04:21:03.590 --> 04:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
questions answered and maybe some time
 
04:21:06.170 --> 04:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
to look back on their presentation
 
04:21:08.389 --> 04:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
think about other concerns questions you
 
04:21:09.650 --> 04:21:09.660 align:start position:0%
might have
 
04:21:11.269 --> 04:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
unless someone
 
04:21:13.610 --> 04:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
feel strongly about something I'm going
 
04:21:14.870 --> 04:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
to go home and contribute to the liquor
 
04:21:14.880 --> 04:21:17.510 align:start position:0%
to go home and contribute to the liquor
tax

04:21:17.510 --> 04:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:20.510 --> 04:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
Madam chair representative orrs and then
 
04:21:23.510 --> 04:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative Almy uh also uh I thought
 
04:21:25.370 --> 04:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
we were about done on that but I thought
 
04:21:28.370 --> 04:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
can we look at insurance tax today or
 
04:21:30.530 --> 04:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
that one looks like a no-brainer unless
 
04:21:32.389 --> 04:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
I'm missing something
 
04:21:34.610 --> 04:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
all right uh I'm open to looking at
 
04:21:36.349 --> 04:21:36.359 align:start position:0%
insurance tax if the rest of the group
 
04:21:36.359 --> 04:21:37.370 align:start position:0%
insurance tax if the rest of the group
is

04:21:37.370 --> 04:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:21:37.380 --> 04:21:40.490 align:start position:0%
is
uh

04:21:40.490 --> 04:21:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:40.500 --> 04:21:42.550 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:21:42.550 --> 04:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:21:45.830 --> 04:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
well or or at least look at your
 
04:21:48.290 --> 04:21:48.300 align:start position:0%
paperwork and see if but we're gonna
 
04:21:50.809 --> 04:21:50.819 align:start position:0%
have to ask a question we'll ask the
 
04:21:53.809 --> 04:21:53.819 align:start position:0%
question about the does the governor's
 
04:21:55.969 --> 04:21:55.979 align:start position:0%
numbers take into account Medicaid
 
04:21:58.370 --> 04:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
expansion or not how does that work
 
04:21:59.990 --> 04:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
don't know if we need a presentation yet
 
04:22:02.090 --> 04:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
from liquor think about that as you get
 
04:22:04.550 --> 04:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
we get another 10 days before we see we
 
04:22:06.290 --> 04:22:06.300 align:start position:0%
have to schedule anything so represent
 
04:22:09.830 --> 04:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
all me thank you sir the insurance
 
04:22:12.950 --> 04:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
department has always but I guess
 
04:22:15.530 --> 04:22:15.540 align:start position:0%
because the woman who always did it
 
04:22:19.429 --> 04:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
finally did not come this year uh
 
04:22:22.010 --> 04:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
uh they've they've taken us through the
 
04:22:24.110 --> 04:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
heart and the soft markets for different
 
04:22:26.630 --> 04:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
parts of the insurance tax
 
04:22:30.950 --> 04:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
and I felt really odd getting just an
 
04:22:33.170 --> 04:22:33.180 align:start position:0%
overall number period
 
04:22:36.349 --> 04:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we could get out of them
 
04:22:39.110 --> 04:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
what their actuaries think is happening
 
04:22:41.150 --> 04:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
to the different markets for the
 
04:22:48.490 --> 04:22:48.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:51.110 --> 04:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative fellows um yeah for the
 
04:22:55.189 --> 04:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
the insurance I mean in the in FY 22
 
04:23:00.010 --> 04:23:00.020 align:start position:0%
they have 155 million and then the the
 
04:23:04.070 --> 04:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
plan for 2003 there those numbers are
 
04:23:05.990 --> 04:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
all a lot lower so I think we need an
 
04:23:08.030 --> 04:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
explanation of why they actually gave
 
04:23:10.969 --> 04:23:10.979 align:start position:0%
that to us well I don't remember
 
04:23:13.250 --> 04:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
well and this is where maybe just we
 
04:23:15.530 --> 04:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
need a little time and we have it enough
 
04:23:17.510 --> 04:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
we have a solid week to go back to our
 
04:23:19.849 --> 04:23:19.859 align:start position:0%
notes look back at the presentation see
 
04:23:22.070 --> 04:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
if we understand it if we don't we
 
04:23:24.050 --> 04:23:24.060 align:start position:0%
absolutely have them come back but
 
04:23:26.450 --> 04:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
that's when I actually remember
 
04:23:28.309 --> 04:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
it's up to you if we want them to come
 
04:23:30.170 --> 04:23:30.180 align:start position:0%
back we can certainly do that or if you
 
04:23:31.790 --> 04:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
want to just look at our notes and come
 
04:23:33.650 --> 04:23:33.660 align:start position:0%
back and discuss it some more
 
04:23:35.510 --> 04:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
or we can make a decision whatever
 
04:23:39.410 --> 04:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:41.990 --> 04:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think we had a motion
 
04:23:44.330 --> 04:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
yeah I was about to make a motion but
 
04:23:46.070 --> 04:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
with the intervening conversation I
 
04:23:47.689 --> 04:23:47.699 align:start position:0%
think maybe it's best hell till next
 
04:23:49.729 --> 04:23:49.739 align:start position:0%
time we meet
 
04:23:53.630 --> 04:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:58.670 --> 04:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
for 20 years but but the the part
 
04:24:01.309 --> 04:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
different parts of insurance the health
 
04:24:05.389 --> 04:24:05.399 align:start position:0%
the Property and Casualty the the uh
 
04:24:09.530 --> 04:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
life insurance and such on and where the
 
04:24:13.670 --> 04:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
actuaries think that market is going is
 
04:24:16.370 --> 04:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
is something that we did use to get and
 
04:24:18.110 --> 04:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that they were considering
 
04:24:20.330 --> 04:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
but I don't know because it's a totally
 
04:24:22.969 --> 04:24:22.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:25.370 --> 04:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
so is the group thinking that we would
 
04:24:27.349 --> 04:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
like someone to come back and
 
04:24:29.330 --> 04:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
present that and explain it or just
 
04:24:31.790 --> 04:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
email us the information you would like
 
04:24:34.010 --> 04:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
them to come either one but could you
 
04:24:35.809 --> 04:24:35.819 align:start position:0%
reach out to them and see something they
 
04:24:37.370 --> 04:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
could do and if they can come even if
 
04:24:38.750 --> 04:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
it's for 15 minutes that might be
 
04:24:40.969 --> 04:24:40.979 align:start position:0%
helpful I yeah and I would suggest that
 
04:24:42.170 --> 04:24:42.180 align:start position:0%
maybe you'd want them in the room
 
04:24:43.550 --> 04:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
because I I think it's a more
 
04:24:46.370 --> 04:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
complicated Revenue source
 
04:24:48.469 --> 04:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
um the way that the prepayments work the
 
04:24:50.990 --> 04:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
way that they have to reconcile the way
 
04:24:52.550 --> 04:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
that the rates are different for
 
04:24:55.189 --> 04:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
property versus Health
 
04:24:56.870 --> 04:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
um I think it would I would suspect
 
04:24:58.309 --> 04:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
there might be some questions that would
 
04:24:59.450 --> 04:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
be best just to have them here okay
 
04:25:01.370 --> 04:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
great then we will we'd love to have
 
04:25:06.590 --> 04:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:09.229 --> 04:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:11.990 --> 04:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
far the short shortest presentation I've
 
04:25:13.550 --> 04:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
never heard in front of them oh
 
04:25:16.010 --> 04:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
representative motion to adjourn
 
04:25:20.210 --> 04:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
just one before you do that just one
 
04:25:22.130 --> 04:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
quick thing for you guys no more
 
04:25:25.130 --> 04:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
projections no more estimating Just So
 
04:25:27.110 --> 04:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
based on your actions today you'll get
 
04:25:29.689 --> 04:25:29.699 align:start position:0%
this document back it'll be updated with
 
04:25:31.429 --> 04:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
um penciled in essentially with the
 
04:25:32.990 --> 04:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
agreement that you have on those certain
 
04:25:36.410 --> 04:25:36.420 align:start position:0%
revenues you'll then see the agency low
 
04:25:39.349 --> 04:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
and high for the dra for their revenue
 
04:25:42.229 --> 04:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
sources and in addition there'll be in a
 
04:25:44.630 --> 04:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
new sheet in the packet it's going to
 
04:25:47.030 --> 04:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
look like this and I'll pass it around I
 
04:25:50.149 --> 04:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
did it quickly during the lunch break so
 
04:25:52.070 --> 04:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
I think it's all right but I need to
 
04:25:53.450 --> 04:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
just want to double check it but just
 
04:25:55.189 --> 04:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
want to show you what happens with the
 
04:26:13.550 --> 04:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:32.630 --> 04:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:32.640 --> 04:26:51.769 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:26:51.769 --> 04:26:51.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:53.929 --> 04:26:53.939 align:start position:0%
so I'll I'll probably clean it up a
 
04:26:55.250 --> 04:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
little bit more but basically you can
 
04:26:57.710 --> 04:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
see what the business taxes
 
04:26:59.870 --> 04:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
um the Dre gave you their low and high
 
04:27:01.429 --> 04:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
for 23
 
04:27:04.130 --> 04:27:04.140 align:start position:0%
and then they reduce that by the impacts
 
04:27:05.870 --> 04:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
that of the tax law changes that haven't
 
04:27:08.809 --> 04:27:08.819 align:start position:0%
been considered to give you a new
 
04:27:10.309 --> 04:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
um kind of net revenue for the business
 
04:27:13.610 --> 04:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
tax again a range the high low
 
04:27:17.090 --> 04:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
that number is then carried up into 24.
 
04:27:18.649 --> 04:27:18.659 align:start position:0%
so you'll see that
 
04:27:18.659 --> 04:27:19.389 align:start position:0%
so you'll see that
um

04:27:19.389 --> 04:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:23.149 --> 04:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
1219.5 is the low for 24.
 
04:27:26.030 --> 04:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
and 1282.2 is the high at two percent
 
04:27:28.610 --> 04:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
because I'm taking the 125 7.1
 
04:27:31.010 --> 04:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
increasing that by 102 percent so that
 
04:27:33.410 --> 04:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
creates that range and from that you're
 
04:27:35.149 --> 04:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
going to take away the 25 million
 
04:27:37.130 --> 04:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
dollars and come up with what would be
 
04:27:39.530 --> 04:27:39.540 align:start position:0%
your net revenue
 
04:27:42.110 --> 04:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
that's different than when you go down
 
04:27:44.389 --> 04:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
to meals and rooms
 
04:27:47.330 --> 04:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
you have the 423
 
04:27:47.340 --> 04:27:48.670 align:start position:0%
you have the 423
9

04:27:48.670 --> 04:27:48.680 align:start position:0%
9
 
04:27:52.189 --> 04:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
455 5 as you're low and high
 
04:27:54.590 --> 04:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
and then it stays at zero percent and
 
04:27:58.130 --> 04:27:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:00.290 --> 04:28:00.300 align:start position:0%
you'll see that on row 11 there's that
 
04:28:02.510 --> 04:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
transfer that number is subtracted after
 
04:28:04.250 --> 04:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
you do your growth because that's a
 
04:28:04.260 --> 04:28:05.570 align:start position:0%
you do your growth because that's a
transferred

04:28:05.570 --> 04:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
transferred
 
04:28:08.330 --> 04:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
of the the gross revenue to come up with
 
04:28:10.429 --> 04:28:10.439 align:start position:0%
your new net revenue unlike the business
 
04:28:12.290 --> 04:28:12.300 align:start position:0%
tax where that's a change it's going to
 
04:28:15.710 --> 04:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
change the revenue going forward
 
04:28:17.689 --> 04:28:17.699 align:start position:0%
and that happens for
 
04:28:17.699 --> 04:28:18.469 align:start position:0%
and that happens for
um

04:28:18.469 --> 04:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:20.269 --> 04:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
the real estate transfer and the
 
04:28:21.830 --> 04:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends is the same as the
 
04:28:23.510 --> 04:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
business where you're decreasing the
 
04:28:24.889 --> 04:28:24.899 align:start position:0%
amount of Revenue so you're accounting
 
04:28:27.410 --> 04:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
for that compounding effect by taking
 
04:28:29.330 --> 04:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
the lower base after you've netted out
 
04:28:31.849 --> 04:28:31.859 align:start position:0%
the the tax law changes
 
04:28:34.189 --> 04:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
so this sheet will be
 
04:28:36.469 --> 04:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
included in the worksheet next time you
 
04:28:38.090 --> 04:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
get the worksheet sent to you so that
 
04:28:39.830 --> 04:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
you will at least have that information
 
04:28:42.590 --> 04:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
you can kind of look at that I'll send
 
04:28:44.450 --> 04:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
you the Excel so you can
 
04:28:44.460 --> 04:28:45.050 align:start position:0%
you the Excel so you can
um

04:28:45.050 --> 04:28:45.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:47.330 --> 04:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
tweak in that if you have ideas or
 
04:28:48.769 --> 04:28:48.779 align:start position:0%
thoughts you want to come up with so
 
04:28:52.910 --> 04:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
when we come back on the 27th and 28th
 
04:28:55.130 --> 04:28:55.140 align:start position:0%
that's I think this is when it's going
 
04:28:56.870 --> 04:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
to get a little bit more challenging
 
04:28:58.610 --> 04:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
than you saw today because it's going to
 
04:29:00.830 --> 04:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
be members are going to have their own
 
04:29:03.050 --> 04:29:03.060 align:start position:0%
ideas and what they think should be the
 
04:29:05.929 --> 04:29:05.939 align:start position:0%
best place to land and remember
 
04:29:08.689 --> 04:29:08.699 align:start position:0%
these are ranges that the dra provided
 
04:29:10.490 --> 04:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
it does not mean the committee has to
 
04:29:12.710 --> 04:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
stay in that range if there's reasons
 
04:29:14.389 --> 04:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
why the committee believes it should be
 
04:29:17.210 --> 04:29:17.220 align:start position:0%
higher or lower than a range that's
 
04:29:18.530 --> 04:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
perfectly acceptable there's nothing
 
04:29:20.809 --> 04:29:20.819 align:start position:0%
binding about these ranges that is to
 
04:29:24.830 --> 04:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:26.990 --> 04:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you so much we got some
 
04:29:30.050 --> 04:29:30.060 align:start position:0%
good work done today but um obviously we
 
04:29:31.849 --> 04:29:31.859 align:start position:0%
have a lot more to do and we're going to
 
04:29:34.550 --> 04:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
really try to get it done February 27th
 
04:29:37.969 --> 04:29:37.979 align:start position:0%
and 28th and then on March 1st hopefully
 
04:29:40.729 --> 04:29:40.739 align:start position:0%
be able to put it all together for
 
04:29:44.689 --> 04:29:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:50.990 --> 04:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:51.000 --> 04:29:52.309 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:29:52.309 --> 04:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:29:55.189 --> 04:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
and Chris surely you know but for the
 
04:29:55.199 --> 04:29:56.389 align:start position:0%
and Chris surely you know but for the
resolution

04:29:56.389 --> 04:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
04:30:00.050 --> 04:30:00.060 align:start position:0%
is it the number before transfers that
 
04:30:01.910 --> 04:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
goes into the resolution
 
04:30:04.610 --> 04:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
or after uh and I'm talking about
 
04:30:08.030 --> 04:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
transfers to you know in the meals and
 
04:30:12.469 --> 04:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
rentals to to it'd be the after number
 
04:30:15.229 --> 04:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
is the after the transfers right is our
 
04:30:19.130 --> 04:30:19.140 align:start position:0%
job to figure that transfer number or no
 
04:30:22.130 --> 04:30:22.140 align:start position:0%
no your job is to to come up with what
 
04:30:24.889 --> 04:30:24.899 align:start position:0%
you believe is the
 
04:30:28.070 --> 04:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
estimate that is the correct estimate so
 
04:30:30.229 --> 04:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
just say I just
 
04:30:35.149 --> 04:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
started packing up so I moved my sheet
 
04:30:37.250 --> 04:30:37.260 align:start position:0%
anyways just say that um with the meals
 
04:30:39.950 --> 04:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
and rooms you pick a midpoint between
 
04:30:42.229 --> 04:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
the the range yeah
 
04:30:44.389 --> 04:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
that we would adjust that at deduction
 
04:30:46.490 --> 04:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
to that midpoint to come up with a new
 
04:30:49.550 --> 04:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
what your net revenue would be
 
04:30:51.170 --> 04:30:51.180 align:start position:0%
so you're going to so the in the
 
04:30:52.550 --> 04:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
resolution that's what you would have is
 
04:30:53.870 --> 04:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
the net revenue because it's going to be
 
04:30:55.849 --> 04:30:55.859 align:start position:0%
removed anyways
 
04:30:57.290 --> 04:30:57.300 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be something that can
 
04:30:59.630 --> 04:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
be spent by the the finance committee on
 
04:31:01.429 --> 04:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
the on the operating budget that's right
 
04:31:04.490 --> 04:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
we do figure that the growth if you will
 
04:31:06.290 --> 04:31:06.300 align:start position:0%
the gross number
 
04:31:08.330 --> 04:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
um and then there's a mathematical
 
04:31:10.070 --> 04:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
calculation that will bring it down to
 
04:31:11.990 --> 04:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
the net number right I mean it's easy
 
04:31:13.670 --> 04:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
with red because it's a five million
 
04:31:15.950 --> 04:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
dollar deduction right it's a little bit
 
04:31:17.269 --> 04:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
more complicated with the meals and
 
04:31:19.790 --> 04:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
rooms because you got the transfer to
 
04:31:22.189 --> 04:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
the municipal Revenue fund as well as
 
04:31:24.889 --> 04:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
the school building Aid piece so those
 
04:31:26.710 --> 04:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
both got to be considered
 
04:31:30.110 --> 04:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
fortunately Lindsay had told me at the
 
04:31:31.610 --> 04:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
start of today they have a little cheat
 
04:31:33.469 --> 04:31:33.479 align:start position:0%
sheet that she'll send me to help me
 
04:31:35.410 --> 04:31:35.420 align:start position:0%
with that in terms of the calculation
 
04:31:37.790 --> 04:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
and and we really need to do that so
 
04:31:37.800 --> 04:31:38.809 align:start position:0%
and and we really need to do that so
that

04:31:38.809 --> 04:31:38.819 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:31:41.210 --> 04:31:41.220 align:start position:0%
um in addition to getting the revenue
 
04:31:41.220 --> 04:31:42.710 align:start position:0%
um in addition to getting the revenue
right

04:31:42.710 --> 04:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:31:44.630 --> 04:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
um I
 
04:31:46.849 --> 04:31:46.859 align:start position:0%
in the agency's recommended budget to
 
04:31:49.550 --> 04:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
the governor the treasurer had included
 
04:31:51.950 --> 04:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
the municipal Revenue piece as other
 
04:31:54.290 --> 04:31:54.300 align:start position:0%
Revenue so we'll need to make sure that
 
04:31:57.410 --> 04:31:57.420 align:start position:0%
appropriation is correct as well
 
04:31:59.450 --> 04:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
if it stays in the operating budget on
 
04:32:02.269 --> 04:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
another one the business Enterprise tax
 
04:32:03.950 --> 04:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
and the business profits tax you're
 
04:32:06.110 --> 04:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
going to do a calculation we're going to
 
04:32:09.050 --> 04:32:09.060 align:start position:0%
we're going to be estimating the gross
 
04:32:11.149 --> 04:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
and you're going to divide it out
 
04:32:14.809 --> 04:32:14.819 align:start position:0%
yes yeah so so you'll see one of the
 
04:32:17.269 --> 04:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
last worksheets I do for you will be the
 
04:32:19.010 --> 04:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
split between the education trust fund
 
04:32:20.990 --> 04:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
and the general fund so you'll see the
 
04:32:24.889 --> 04:32:24.899 align:start position:0%
BET BPT speeding split today I mentioned
 
04:32:27.290 --> 04:32:27.300 align:start position:0%
that the governor has and and you all
 
04:32:28.610 --> 04:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
were aware that the governor is
 
04:32:31.969 --> 04:32:31.979 align:start position:0%
recommending repealing the CST another
 
04:32:33.830 --> 04:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
thing the governor is recommending is
 
04:32:35.630 --> 04:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
how to do the education trust fund
 
04:32:36.889 --> 04:32:36.899 align:start position:0%
general fund split for the business
 
04:32:36.899 --> 04:32:38.870 align:start position:0%
general fund split for the business
taxes

04:32:38.870 --> 04:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
04:32:38.880 --> 04:32:39.649 align:start position:0%
taxes
um

04:32:39.649 --> 04:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:43.370 --> 04:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
it's basically taking 35 percent of the
 
04:32:45.889 --> 04:32:45.899 align:start position:0%
total collected and depositing that into
 
04:32:48.530 --> 04:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund versus the
 
04:32:51.950 --> 04:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
method that's used now which directs a
 
04:32:53.990 --> 04:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
portion of the rate collected into the
 
04:32:56.389 --> 04:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
education trust fund so for instance the
 
04:32:56.399 --> 04:32:57.130 align:start position:0%
education trust fund so for instance the
bet

04:32:57.130 --> 04:32:57.140 align:start position:0%
bet
 
04:33:02.149 --> 04:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
is set at 0.55 percent
 
04:33:04.310 --> 04:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
0.5 percent goes to the education trust
 
04:33:06.470 --> 04:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
fund point zero five percent goes to the
 
04:33:08.590 --> 04:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
general fund so it's a little bit more
 
04:33:10.970 --> 04:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
complication involved with doing the
 
04:33:14.150 --> 04:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
split the business profits at 7.5 six
 
04:33:16.910 --> 04:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
percent of that goes to the general fund
 
04:33:18.949 --> 04:33:18.959 align:start position:0%
of the rate collected and one and a half
 
04:33:21.830 --> 04:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
percent of the rate but is attributed
 
04:33:24.289 --> 04:33:24.299 align:start position:0%
goes to the education trust fund
 
04:33:26.150 --> 04:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
changing it to a flat percent after
 
04:33:27.590 --> 04:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
gross would make it easier for everybody
 
04:33:29.570 --> 04:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
involved but that's
 
04:33:32.810 --> 04:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
reflected in his splits I'll give you
 
04:33:35.150 --> 04:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
current what it would be under current
 
04:33:37.609 --> 04:33:37.619 align:start position:0%
law and then we would make if the
 
04:33:39.769 --> 04:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
committee excuse me if the house were to
 
04:33:41.449 --> 04:33:41.459 align:start position:0%
accept that recommendation there'd be a
 
04:33:41.459 --> 04:33:42.369 align:start position:0%
accept that recommendation there'd be a
negative

04:33:42.369 --> 04:33:42.379 align:start position:0%
negative
 
04:33:44.810 --> 04:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
adjustment or an adjustment to move
 
04:33:46.369 --> 04:33:46.379 align:start position:0%
money into the right buckets if it
 
04:33:47.810 --> 04:33:47.820 align:start position:0%
needed to
 
04:33:49.910 --> 04:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
represent only
 
04:33:54.650 --> 04:33:54.660 align:start position:0%
and just so that the new people know on
 
04:33:54.660 --> 04:33:56.510 align:start position:0%
and just so that the new people know on
when

04:33:56.510 --> 04:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:33:58.970 --> 04:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
the general fund
 
04:34:03.170 --> 04:34:03.180 align:start position:0%
on as well no when the education trust
 
04:34:05.990 --> 04:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
fund is in deficit which for quite a
 
04:34:09.709 --> 04:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
long time it was on the general fund is
 
04:34:13.189 --> 04:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
obligated to send money over to it
 
04:34:15.650 --> 04:34:15.660 align:start position:0%
but when the
 
04:34:20.590 --> 04:34:20.600 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund is in Surplus
 
04:34:25.070 --> 04:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
they can the budgeters can lapse the
 
04:34:27.769 --> 04:34:27.779 align:start position:0%
Surplus to the general fund to pay for
 
04:34:31.029 --> 04:34:31.039 align:start position:0%
things so there isn't a real
 
04:34:35.570 --> 04:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
split legal split between those two
 
04:34:38.750 --> 04:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
it's and we always wanted to combine
 
04:34:42.349 --> 04:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
them back again but on the Optics
 
04:34:44.510 --> 04:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
weren't very good for that some people
 
04:34:47.631 --> 04:34:47.641 align:start position:0%
did some of us did
 
04:34:47.641 --> 04:34:49.490 align:start position:0%
did some of us did
yeah well

04:34:49.490 --> 04:34:49.500 align:start position:0%
yeah well
 
04:34:52.131 --> 04:34:52.141 align:start position:0%
I I see people
 
04:34:54.529 --> 04:34:54.539 align:start position:0%
squirming in their seats because we did
 
04:34:57.529 --> 04:34:57.539 align:start position:0%
say 230. so we will end I will tell you
 
04:35:00.769 --> 04:35:00.779 align:start position:0%
in addition to the 27th 28th and March
 
04:35:04.070 --> 04:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
1st plan ahead to March 7th and March
 
04:35:04.080 --> 04:35:05.150 align:start position:0%
1st plan ahead to March 7th and March
8th

04:35:05.150 --> 04:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
8th
 
04:35:07.849 --> 04:35:07.859 align:start position:0%
March 7th we will hopefully hear the
 
04:35:10.429 --> 04:35:10.439 align:start position:0%
remaining bill or two that we have I
 
04:35:11.929 --> 04:35:11.939 align:start position:0%
think both of those would be second
 
04:35:14.570 --> 04:35:14.580 align:start position:0%
committee bills and we will try to do
 
04:35:17.390 --> 04:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
work sessions on three bills that I
 
04:35:19.189 --> 04:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
think we want to talk a lot about more
 
04:35:22.429 --> 04:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
which is one was House Bill 450 Mr
 
04:35:24.590 --> 04:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
Schamberg's bill which has to do with
 
04:35:27.529 --> 04:35:27.539 align:start position:0%
net operating loss another has to do
 
04:35:29.750 --> 04:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
with representative doucetz Bill he's
 
04:35:31.929 --> 04:35:31.939 align:start position:0%
gone which is the charitable gaming bill
 
04:35:36.051 --> 04:35:36.061 align:start position:0%
and the third would be House Bill 486
 
04:35:38.510 --> 04:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
reciprocal toll collection
 
04:35:40.730 --> 04:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
so we'll allocate some
 
04:35:43.310 --> 04:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
committee work session time to talk
 
04:35:45.109 --> 04:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
about those again and see what we might
 
04:35:46.869 --> 04:35:46.879 align:start position:0%
want to do
 
04:35:51.170 --> 04:35:51.180 align:start position:0%
and then on the eighth we'll try to exec
 
04:35:53.090 --> 04:35:53.100 align:start position:0%
as many bills as we can because then
 
04:35:55.010 --> 04:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
we're starting to get really close to
 
04:35:55.020 --> 04:35:56.390 align:start position:0%
we're starting to get really close to
deadlines

04:35:56.390 --> 04:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
deadlines
 
04:35:58.010 --> 04:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
but first and foremost we want to get
 
04:36:00.410 --> 04:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
through these Revenue estimates so take
 
04:36:02.209 --> 04:36:02.219 align:start position:0%
the time folks to read through your
 
04:36:04.849 --> 04:36:04.859 align:start position:0%
presentations talk to you know you know
 
04:36:06.170 --> 04:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
kind of educate yourself think about
 
04:36:07.970 --> 04:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
where you are on things so that on the
 
04:36:09.769 --> 04:36:09.779 align:start position:0%
27th you're prepared with your questions
 
04:36:11.510 --> 04:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
and comments and hopefully we can come
 
04:36:22.131 --> 04:36:22.141 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:22.141 --> 04:36:24.830 align:start position:0%
 
I

04:36:24.830 --> 04:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:36:26.830 --> 04:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
04:36:29.390 --> 04:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
right yeah I just wanted to get done as
 
04:36:31.369 --> 04:36:31.379 align:start position:0%
much as we could because just in case we
 
04:36:33.109 --> 04:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
have some bills that oh we need to amend
 
04:36:34.609 --> 04:36:34.619 align:start position:0%
it we need to think about it we need now
 
04:36:36.349 --> 04:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
I just want to give us a little wiggle
 
04:36:38.990 --> 04:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
room there I would expect that we would
 
04:36:41.449 --> 04:36:41.459 align:start position:0%
have session more
 
04:36:44.330 --> 04:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
21st 22nd 23rd of March because
 
04:36:47.029 --> 04:36:47.039 align:start position:0%
everyone's up again against that hard
 
04:36:50.810 --> 04:36:50.820 align:start position:0%
hard deadline of March 16th right so all
 
04:36:51.830 --> 04:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
the communities are going to be getting
 
04:36:54.170 --> 04:36:54.180 align:start position:0%
all of their work done by then so it'll
 
04:36:56.390 --> 04:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
be in the next week's calendar which is
 
04:36:59.209 --> 04:36:59.219 align:start position:0%
usually a solid two days
 
04:37:01.310 --> 04:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
so I'm thinking if we can stay to this
 
04:37:03.349 --> 04:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
schedule we'll be in really nice shape
 
04:37:05.090 --> 04:37:05.100 align:start position:0%
we'll have our revenues done we'll have
 
04:37:07.189 --> 04:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
our bill hearings done we'll exec as
 
04:37:08.510 --> 04:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
much as we can
 
04:37:11.449 --> 04:37:11.459 align:start position:0%
I think we'd be in really good shape
 
04:37:20.150 --> 04:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:23.510 --> 04:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
February revenues
 
04:37:26.390 --> 04:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
on after we'd sent the first Revenue
 
04:37:28.369 --> 04:37:28.379 align:start position:0%
estimates to
 
04:37:31.970 --> 04:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
to the finance committee and on if there
 
04:37:34.730 --> 04:37:34.740 align:start position:0%
seemed to be anything significant sent
 
04:37:37.609 --> 04:37:37.619 align:start position:0%
them on to the finance committee so they
 
04:37:39.890 --> 04:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
had a little bit more or less wiggle
 
04:37:39.900 --> 04:37:40.910 align:start position:0%
had a little bit more or less wiggle
room

04:37:40.910 --> 04:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
room
 
04:37:43.429 --> 04:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
yeah representative always mentioning
 
04:37:45.830 --> 04:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
that you know if we find out after we we
 
04:37:48.349 --> 04:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
finally get the February revenues which
 
04:37:51.529 --> 04:37:51.539 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be until mid-march uh we could
 
04:37:51.539 --> 04:37:52.609 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be until mid-march uh we could
maybe

04:37:52.609 --> 04:37:52.619 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
04:37:54.709 --> 04:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
talk to finance and update our
 
04:37:56.869 --> 04:37:56.879 align:start position:0%
resolution but you know again we have to
 
04:38:00.230 --> 04:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
we have to give them something and every
 
04:38:02.209 --> 04:38:02.219 align:start position:0%
month we're going to want more data and
 
04:38:04.189 --> 04:38:04.199 align:start position:0%
we will get it but we have to we have to
 
04:38:06.170 --> 04:38:06.180 align:start position:0%
give them something to start with so
 
04:38:08.631 --> 04:38:08.641 align:start position:0%
March 1st is our day
 
04:38:11.029 --> 04:38:11.039 align:start position:0%
