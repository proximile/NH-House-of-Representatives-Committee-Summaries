00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
all right it being 8 31 now we're gonna
 
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
um for the record this is my first time
 
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
seeing a subcommittee meeting let alone
 
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 align:start position:0%
attending one or being a chair of one so
 
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 align:start position:0%
bear with me as we go through this here
 
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.110 align:start position:0%
bear with me as we go through this here
um

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
I understand it's relatively informal
 
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
um obviously we want people speaking one
 
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
of the time but
 
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.490 align:start position:0%
of the time but
um

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
I guess the first one would be to have
 
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
the response for the Bill maybe
 
00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 align:start position:0%
discuss we've heard your testimony
 
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
already so if you want to if you have
 
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
anything new to add or you want to
 
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
emphasize some things and then maybe
 
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 align:start position:0%
take some questions and we could discuss
 
00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank thank you Mr chairman
 
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
um members of the subcommittee I
 
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to be here
 
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to work with you answer any
 
00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 align:start position:0%
questions uh engage in any
 
00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 align:start position:0%
um discussion that that we may want to
 
00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:00.770 align:start position:0%
um discussion that that we may want to
have

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to lead with my chin and
 
00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 align:start position:0%
say we don't want to let the perfect be
 
00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 align:start position:0%
the enemy of the good
 
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is it's my
 
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 align:start position:0%
opinion that we have a loophole in
 
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 align:start position:0%
existing RSA and two cases have been
 
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 align:start position:0%
brought forth unfortunately both from
 
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
from the town that I live in and a
 
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 align:start position:0%
constituent has asked me to to file
 
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
legislation to to close this loophole
 
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
and while I appreciate you know the need
 
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
to keep opportunities open for people
 
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
that are on the registered sex offender
 
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 align:start position:0%
list it's my opinion that they should
 
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
not be employing be managing or be the
 
00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 align:start position:0%
direct supervisor or left alone to work
 
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
one-on-one with minor children that puts
 
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
both parties both the registered sex
 
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 align:start position:0%
offender and the minor child in
 
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
potential Jeopardy and so it's in our
 
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
best interest to protect both of those
 
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
groups I I know there was a lot of
 
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.289 align:start position:0%
groups I I know there was a lot of
questions

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.910 align:start position:0%
questions
around

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
um you know primarily with miners part
 
00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 align:start position:0%
of the the bill as written and I I don't
 
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
think I was very clear on what the
 
00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 align:start position:0%
intent there was and so I'd like to
 
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 align:start position:0%
clarify uh what the intent is there so
 
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
maybe we can find some uh language that
 
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 align:start position:0%
we can all agree on uh to to clean that
 
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
up so when we see that language
 
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 align:start position:0%
what the what the sponsor of the bill
 
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
myself and what the constituent is
 
00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 align:start position:0%
asking for this this goes to things like
 
00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.770 align:start position:0%
asking for this this goes to things like
schools

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.430 align:start position:0%
schools
daycares

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
daycares
 
00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
after school
 
00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:37.670 align:start position:0%
after school
um

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.249 align:start position:0%
um
programs

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
that you might you might have right
 
00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 align:start position:0%
where where kids go after school Boys
 
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 align:start position:0%
and Girls Clubs thing things like that
 
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
it it's not meant or intended
 
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
to prohibit somebody working as a clerk
 
00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 align:start position:0%
at the corner store that's that's not
 
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 align:start position:0%
you know yeah technically are you
 
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
providing a service to minors yeah you
 
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
know you're selling them whatever
 
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
they're coming in to buy bread milk
 
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
candy whatever it is but you're not
 
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
you're not the customer is not an
 
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
employee right so it's it's the it's
 
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
this this employer employee relationship
 
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
link this possibility that the employer
 
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
the manager the supervisor or working
 
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
directly with children that are
 
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
registered sex offenders that's the link
 
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
we want to break that's the firewall
 
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
that we want to reinforce
 
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
so you know can can somebody work at a
 
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
local grocery store you know as a bagger
 
00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
or whatever yeah absolutely because it's
 
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a it's a customer right and
 
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
those discussions we were having it was
 
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
it was it was a customer coming in now
 
00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
you can say well an after-school program
 
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 align:start position:0%
the kid is the customer because the
 
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
parents are paying to send the kid and
 
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
and and that is right right but that the
 
00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
job there is actually supervising
 
00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
children right they show up after school
 
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
and if you're working there you're
 
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
supervising you're managing you're
 
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
around those children and that's the
 
00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 align:start position:0%
that's the link that we're trying to
 
00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
break that's the intent of the law I'm
 
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 align:start position:0%
certainly hoping
 
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
that we can come to some
 
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 align:start position:0%
mutual language that will reinforce that
 
00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259 align:start position:0%
firewall the challenge that I have is
 
00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 align:start position:0%
most of the proposed amendments that
 
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
have been brought forth
 
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 align:start position:0%
um by others
 
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 align:start position:0%
in my reading of those it simply adds
 
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 align:start position:0%
language but is ineffectual at building
 
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
the firewall that we're looking to build
 
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
that the language ends up being so loose
 
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 align:start position:0%
to make it easier for registered sex
 
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
offenders to find employment that it
 
00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:45.539 align:start position:0%
doesn't close the loophole and if we're
 
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
just going to change language but the
 
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
loophole remains open then then really
 
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
we're just we're wasting our time we're
 
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
spinning our wheels in the in the mud
 
00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
the idea is to put this firewall up to
 
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 align:start position:0%
close this loophole
 
00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions any anybody may
 
00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:05.689 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions any anybody may
have

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:05.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
I I just want to say that um this
 
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
particular particular crime is
 
00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:16.259 align:start position:0%
um just about the worst thing you can do
 
00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:19.139 align:start position:0%
to a person next to murder because the
 
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
the child uh who's the victim
 
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
is never really the same again that
 
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
person is effectively gone
 
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.029 align:start position:0%
person is effectively gone
um

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:32.340 align:start position:0%
but I I do thought I do I I did think
 
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
that in his node representative Lynn
 
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
made a good point
 
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
um in that one of the things that we
 
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
have to balance is the need to minimize
 
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
the risk to children with the fact that
 
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
um we can't create something over that's
 
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
so overbroad that it would totally
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
prohibit many types of employment for
 
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.189 align:start position:0%
prohibit many types of employment for
people

00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
who may be trying to to to rehabilitate
 
00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:04.139 align:start position:0%
so one thing
 
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
one thing I would I would suggest is to
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
and I know this may sound a little
 
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
strange in the context of of this
 
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
hearing but to take an approach
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
that you know kind of from the gun
 
00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:18.539 align:start position:0%
violence prevention handbook which
 
00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:20.039 align:start position:0%
essentially is
 
00:08:20.039 --> 00:08:20.689 align:start position:0%
essentially is
um

00:08:20.689 --> 00:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:23.879 align:start position:0%
we know that nothing that we can do in
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
statute will totally eliminate or
 
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.369 align:start position:0%
statute will totally eliminate or
prevent

00:08:28.369 --> 00:08:28.379 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
these things from happening but there
 
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:32.700 align:start position:0%
are things that we can do to minimize
 
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
the risk so an approach that we could
 
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
take is
 
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:39.180 align:start position:0%
are there some things that we can do to
 
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
the statute that will further reduce the
 
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:44.820 align:start position:0%
risk of this happening to Children
 
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
um and and my concern with with your
 
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:50.700 align:start position:0%
need to to almost totally close the
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
window is is I don't think that that we
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
can do that or it would be
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
constitutional necessarily for us to do
 
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
that but but looking at the statutes of
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
other states it does look like there are
 
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:05.220 align:start position:0%
some things that other states uh are
 
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.530 align:start position:0%
some things that other states uh are
doing

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:09:08.449 --> 00:09:08.459 align:start position:0%
um that perhaps we could adopt here in
 
00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:11.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire too so the the idea
 
00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:14.100 align:start position:0%
you know well it would be wonderful to
 
00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:15.899 align:start position:0%
close the window completely so that
 
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
these incidents never happen again
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
um as you say if if we if we don't throw
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
out the good and search is the perfect
 
00:09:27.889 --> 00:09:27.899 align:start position:0%
what we can do is close that window to a
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
point where it's it's harder for uh for
 
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:34.260 align:start position:0%
these types of offenses to happen than
 
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:37.260 align:start position:0%
Perhaps it is now and and that's that's
 
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
the approach I I'd kind of like to see
 
00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
us take
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative if I could
 
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
respond if that's okay and then I'll
 
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:46.860 align:start position:0%
take any question you have thank you
 
00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
representative I I appreciate um your
 
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:51.300 align:start position:0%
remarks and and I I don't uh on the face
 
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:52.860 align:start position:0%
of it I don't disagree with any of it
 
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
for sure I I think I think we have a lot
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
of common ground
 
00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
um the one thing I have to say is I
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
can't comment on what the representative
 
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
submitted to the committee or the
 
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is I wasn't put on copy on
 
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:04.740 align:start position:0%
any of that
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
um so I don't I don't have those
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
materials so the representative you
 
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
spoke to I I've I've never received
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
copies of those so I can't really speak
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
to what um what what those proposals are
 
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:15.959 align:start position:0%
other than things that I saw last
 
00:10:15.959 --> 00:10:25.550 align:start position:0%
other than things that I saw last
session

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
sorry if I didn't
 
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.509 align:start position:0%
sorry if I didn't
think I

00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
think I
 
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
but that's I mean it is that's exactly
 
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
as you can see that's it even has the
 
00:10:35.329 --> 00:10:35.339 align:start position:0%
date from from uh
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
from last time so that that's the that's
 
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
the same uh thing
 
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
in the last session
 
00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I I appreciate
 
00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:45.769 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I I appreciate
it

00:10:45.769 --> 00:10:45.779 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:48.180 align:start position:0%
if I may and this is where I was I had a
 
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
hang up with and uh
 
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:53.220 align:start position:0%
this is how I interpret this and I
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
understand your intent however down the
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
road when this becomes law
 
00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
that intent is going to be interpreted
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
by a judge and they may interpret it
 
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.310 align:start position:0%
by a judge and they may interpret it
differently

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
differently
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
the first part is employment in business
 
00:11:05.449 --> 00:11:05.459 align:start position:0%
providing Direct Services to minor or
 
00:11:07.069 --> 00:11:07.079 align:start position:0%
direct supervision the oversight of
 
00:11:07.079 --> 00:11:08.090 align:start position:0%
direct supervision the oversight of
minors

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
minors
 
00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:09.779 align:start position:0%
if you put the emphasis on employment
 
00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
and leave business out of it
 
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
it makes more sense as to what your
 
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
intent is but if I was to put the
 
00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
emphasis on business
 
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:18.660 align:start position:0%
that's where people
 
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
are thinking that any business that
 
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
provides a direct service to miners you
 
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't work at which would mean
 
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:25.740 align:start position:0%
McDonald's or a movie theater or
 
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
convenience store and I understand it's
 
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:28.860 align:start position:0%
not your intent
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
but if I put the emphasis on business
 
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
that's how I interpret that is that any
 
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
business so we will be limiting work
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
virtually anywhere
 
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
so I think that's the hang up yeah so um
 
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
if if striking if striking a word
 
00:11:44.279 --> 00:11:44.930 align:start position:0%
if if striking if striking a word
um

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:48.180 align:start position:0%
gets you to where you need to be namely
 
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
you know taking the reference of
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
business out and making an appointment
 
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
only so well let me just back up a
 
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:11:58.610 --> 00:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
I'm not good at thinking on my feet so
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
you bear with me
 
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
the burden should be in my opinion on
 
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
the employee if the burden should be on
 
00:12:10.009 --> 00:12:10.019 align:start position:0%
the registered sex offender they're the
 
00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
ones that you know have have committed a
 
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
crime Tried by a jury of their peers
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
found to be guilty and and are taking
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
the punishment that the society Doles
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
out for that
 
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
the the burden I I believe should be on
 
00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
that person they're the ones that need
 
00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
to take responsibility and full
 
00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.090 align:start position:0%
to take responsibility and full
responsibility

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
um for the consequences of their
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
previous actions and and I agree so
 
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:35.220 align:start position:0%
there was actually language other
 
00:12:38.569 --> 00:12:38.579 align:start position:0%
language in the original bill that was
 
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
um stripped out during a working session
 
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
that we had last year so we had an
 
00:12:44.329 --> 00:12:44.339 align:start position:0%
extensive working session
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
um last year I think representative
 
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
Manus um were you part of that last year
 
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
or no
 
00:12:53.449 --> 00:12:53.459 align:start position:0%
yeah so so you know we we we had we had
 
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
State Police we had attorney general we
 
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
had um
 
00:12:58.730 --> 00:12:58.740 align:start position:0%
um Department of Justice maybe that's
 
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
part of Attorney General
 
00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:02.459 align:start position:0%
um we had you know victims right
 
00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
Advocates ACLU and um registered sex
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
offender Advocates and and we all sort
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
of agreed on the language and that was
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
the languages put in front of you I'm
 
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
not a you know I'm not opposed to
 
00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.310 align:start position:0%
not a you know I'm not opposed to
further

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:16.740 align:start position:0%
um changing the the other thing that
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
that I'll bring up is during that work
 
00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
committee it was not I'm not the guy
 
00:13:24.769 --> 00:13:24.779 align:start position:0%
that stripped out the list of examples
 
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
it was actually the groups that came
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
before us that recommended stripping out
 
00:13:32.449 --> 00:13:32.459 align:start position:0%
that language
 
00:13:32.459 --> 00:13:33.650 align:start position:0%
that language
um

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:33.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
so that it doesn't become too narrow by
 
00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
way of examples so
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
um personally I think I think it's a
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
cleaner RSA without the list of examples
 
00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
um but I mean if that's if that's what
 
00:13:49.009 --> 00:13:49.019 align:start position:0%
it takes to get over the hurdle to leave
 
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
that language in you know I I would
 
00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
suppose that I'm I'm fine with that but
 
00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
that language is stripped out at the
 
00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
request of others that came to the
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
yeah I think a lot of what I was going
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
to say has already been kind of brought
 
00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
up in this situation I think you know in
 
00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
the beginning you know when we heard
 
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
this in the first place the it was the
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
language it was too broad and then how
 
00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
is this going to be interpreted and then
 
00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
also I think how is the owners who is
 
00:14:19.009 --> 00:14:19.019 align:start position:0%
the owner that's going to be on is it
 
00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
going to be on the employer and the
 
00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:22.860 align:start position:0%
employee or the employee and then how is
 
00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
that defined but so is this proposed
 
00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
amendment actually for is this what
 
00:14:30.769 --> 00:14:30.779 align:start position:0%
you're you're trying to use now or is
 
00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
this just for reference of what was
 
00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
submitted last year
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
00:14:38.569 --> 00:14:38.579 align:start position:0%
question I appreciate it this is this is
 
00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
not my Amendment so I I brought the bill
 
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0%
um forward again this year and what I
 
00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
brought forward this year is what had
 
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
been agreed to and approved out of
 
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:49.740 align:start position:0%
committee out of a work group and out of
 
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:53.820 align:start position:0%
the committee last year this was a floor
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
amendment that was brought forth
 
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
um to house session uh last year in when
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
we were meeting in in Manchester in the
 
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
function of Manchester so so the the
 
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:07.740 align:start position:0%
person that I think can speak
 
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
um best to to this proposed change would
 
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
be the representative behind me to my
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
right because it's it's his Amendment
 
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
sounds good
 
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
thank you and this and this floor
 
00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:22.139 align:start position:0%
amendment was voted down for what it's
 
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
worth um last year during session okay I
 
00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.810 align:start position:0%
worth um last year during session okay I
think

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
I think OJ was saying clarifying this
 
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
and saying that that provides services
 
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:33.660 align:start position:0%
exclusively or predominantly to minors
 
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
really clarifies the language a bit so I
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
I know it was voted down last year so
 
00:15:41.449 --> 00:15:41.459 align:start position:0%
well I like that so it's it's not parts
 
00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839 align:start position:0%
right when you're voting on the floor
 
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
you can't say well I like paragraph one
 
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
but I don't like paragraph three okay I
 
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:49.740 align:start position:0%
I don't disagree that line I like that
 
00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:51.180 align:start position:0%
language too
 
00:15:53.389 --> 00:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
um and it's you know the the list I
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
again I don't I don't care the the
 
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
advice was to get rid of the list to
 
00:15:58.910 --> 00:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
make it less confusing if we want to put
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
the list back in because that's what's
 
00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:02.339 align:start position:0%
in current RSA that's you know that
 
00:16:03.889 --> 00:16:03.899 align:start position:0%
that's fine too
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I I I think I think I I agree
 
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
with where your where your stance is at
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
on the topic of the list I think that
 
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
that I understand that the sponsor wants
 
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
to be flexible
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
um and kind of work with the concerns of
 
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.689 align:start position:0%
the committee
but

00:16:26.689 --> 00:16:26.699 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
um I think that initially like in the
 
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
initial hearing
 
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
um the sponsor
 
00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
testimony another testimony kind of
 
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:35.820 align:start position:0%
helped me understand that the list was
 
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:40.980 align:start position:0%
the problem and lists in legislation can
 
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
be problems
 
00:16:44.689 --> 00:16:44.699 align:start position:0%
um because when
 
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
when that day comes that someone's in
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
front of a judge the judge says well
 
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
what did the legislature intend and
 
00:16:51.889 --> 00:16:51.899 align:start position:0%
they'll take into consideration
 
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:53.220 align:start position:0%
everything that was discussed and
 
00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:55.079 align:start position:0%
committee depending on the available
 
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
notes which depends on the clerk and
 
00:16:58.970 --> 00:16:58.980 align:start position:0%
historically that's going to be like a
 
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
one one two sentence summary for every
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
five-minute speech you know every five
 
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
minute bit of testimony so that's a
 
00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.030 align:start position:0%
minute bit of testimony so that's a
challenge

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:10.140 align:start position:0%
um for a judge to determine and so
 
00:17:12.169 --> 00:17:12.179 align:start position:0%
they're going to lean to some extent I
 
00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:14.220 align:start position:0%
imagine and I'm not gonna
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
speak too heavily to what judges think
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
but I think that they would lean to some
 
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
extent on just simply the way that the
 
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
law is written
 
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
and I do think that the way that it's
 
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
written currently doesn't take into
 
00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
consideration employee employer employer
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
situations and supervisory and employee
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
situations and that's I am if I mean I
 
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm a little conf I don't know if
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
like we've kind of like lost the thread
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
in having a subcommittee
 
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
um and all of the different stakeholders
 
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
on the bill
 
00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
and all the feedback and the amendment
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
proposals but that seems like that's the
 
00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
issue that the sponsor brought up with
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
with the news articles that he gave us
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
the the person who was employing a
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
teenager in his landscaping business was
 
00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
pretty clearly not
 
00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
violating the laws that was written and
 
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
I don't know how we I guess the the bit
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
about provide services predominantly to
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
minors would be covered would cover the
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
carnival situation
 
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
um but you know I have a 16 year old she
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
worked at Market Basket since I mean you
 
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
know the uh the grocery store we won't
 
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
name that's a pillar of this community
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
um and is where you can save money
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
um but she worked there since she was 14
 
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
she applied the day that she turned 14
 
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
because that's the earliest she could
 
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
possibly work under the law and
 
00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:43.850 align:start position:0%
possibly work under the law and
um

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:45.900 align:start position:0%
she really enjoyed it but without a
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
doubt she spent a whole lot of time with
 
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
adults whose backgrounds we're not
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
familiar with and I do think that it's a
 
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
valid concern and Brad gave us this
 
00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
handout and it looks like crimes against
 
00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.690 align:start position:0%
handout and it looks like crimes against
minors

00:18:59.690 --> 00:18:59.700 align:start position:0%
minors
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
sex crimes against minors are included
 
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
in all three tiers so that I you know I
 
00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
think I had been wondering during the
 
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
hearing whether
 
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
the RSA should speak to the type of
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
crime but it seems that that's not
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
really necessary because you if you're
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
on the registry
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh that doesn't mean that you've
 
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
committed a crime against a minor but
 
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
you've committed a crime that was
 
00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
grouped in severity with a crime against
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
a minor of varying degrees but I was
 
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
going to propose since laptops and
 
00:19:36.049 --> 00:19:36.059 align:start position:0%
subcommittee are
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
I think okay
 
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
and Googling in subcommittee I think is
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
okay I would like to look at because
 
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
didn't the landscaper thing go to court
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
and that's why it made the news I would
 
00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
like to look at what the discussion was
 
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
in the courtroom and see if there's any
 
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.409 align:start position:0%
in the courtroom and see if there's any
um

00:19:54.409 --> 00:19:54.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
anything we can glean from that as far
 
00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
as the functionality of the current law
 
00:20:00.169 --> 00:20:00.179 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that would be helpful or
 
00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:01.740 align:start position:0%
if I'm pushing us
 
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
off the rails on my own but I just want
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
to give my input on that but I really
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
think that what the sponsor wants to do
 
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
makes sense I think it's achievable I
 
00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
think the list is
 
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
counterproductive but whether or not the
 
00:20:14.529 --> 00:20:14.539 align:start position:0%
list is counterproductive might be
 
00:20:18.049 --> 00:20:18.059 align:start position:0%
highlighted by anything that a judge may
 
00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:19.559 align:start position:0%
have written about the Landscaping guy
 
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
so I'm gonna google that now Mr chairman
 
00:20:24.049 --> 00:20:24.059 align:start position:0%
if I may yes thank you representative
 
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
one for being almost as verbose as I
 
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
tend to get because it gave me time to
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
read this amendment and refresh my
 
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
memory as to why I was against it
 
00:20:36.049 --> 00:20:36.059 align:start position:0%
and I'm still against this amendment as
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
written this is this does not this does
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
not close the loophole when you read
 
00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
paragraph one this is going exclusively
 
00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:51.299 align:start position:0%
to people working uh with children in
 
00:20:54.289 --> 00:20:54.299 align:start position:0%
such areas that I that I listed
 
00:20:54.299 --> 00:20:54.890 align:start position:0%
such areas that I that I listed
um

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:58.850 --> 00:20:58.860 align:start position:0%
schools after school that sort of stuff
 
00:21:00.529 --> 00:21:00.539 align:start position:0%
but it leaves
 
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
it leaves the possibility of a
 
00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:04.860 align:start position:0%
registered sex offender
 
00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:08.820 align:start position:0%
hiring a minor child it leaves open the
 
00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
possibility that a registered sex
 
00:21:14.029 --> 00:21:14.039 align:start position:0%
offender is the direct supervisor of a
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
minor child
 
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
it leaves wide open the possibility for
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
a registered sex offender to be in a
 
00:21:23.409 --> 00:21:23.419 align:start position:0%
position to work one-on-one with a child
 
00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:26.820 align:start position:0%
that those three things that's the
 
00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:29.700 align:start position:0%
loophole that's what the landscaper case
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
was all about that's what the
 
00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
carnival ride operator case was all
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
about is you have registered sex
 
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.430 align:start position:0%
about is you have registered sex
offenders

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
offenders
 
00:21:42.649 --> 00:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
that are in direct supervision direct
 
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
management or employing minor children
 
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
that's the loophole that's the part that
 
00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
we have to close this with all due
 
00:21:54.049 --> 00:21:54.059 align:start position:0%
respect to to the representative does
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
not close that loophole
 
00:21:58.490 --> 00:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
and that's why that's why I fought
 
00:22:00.169 --> 00:22:00.179 align:start position:0%
against this floor Amendment on the
 
00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
floor and I believe that's why this
 
00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:03.780 align:start position:0%
floor amendment was rejected by the body
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
now I don't you know I can't say why
 
00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
people voted certain ways but this this
 
00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
does not close that loophole and so
 
00:22:12.529 --> 00:22:12.539 align:start position:0%
while I don't disagree uh there probably
 
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be some wordsmithing around
 
00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.149 align:start position:0%
needs to be some wordsmithing around
direct

00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
direct
 
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
supervision language that's that's early
 
00:22:21.649 --> 00:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
in that's that's the part we want to
 
00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
that's the part we want to close I don't
 
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
think registered sex offenders should be
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
able to hire minors that puts those
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
registered sex offender in a position of
 
00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799 align:start position:0%
power over a minor who's already
 
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
a minor and doesn't have have the
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge that we have if if you're a
 
00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
direct manager a direct supervisor of a
 
00:22:39.649 --> 00:22:39.659 align:start position:0%
minor in your registered sex offender
 
00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
that puts you in a position of power
 
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:44.039 align:start position:0%
over a minor that that shouldn't be
 
00:22:45.529 --> 00:22:45.539 align:start position:0%
allowed if you're a registered sex
 
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
offender you shouldn't be in my opinion
 
00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:50.220 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't allow that registered sex
 
00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:52.740 align:start position:0%
offenders work one-on-one with children
 
00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
without at least one other person there
 
00:22:57.529 --> 00:22:57.539 align:start position:0%
to make sure the conversation the
 
00:22:59.570 --> 00:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
activities don't go sideways that's
 
00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
that's the loophole we're trying to
 
00:23:03.169 --> 00:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
close well perhaps at this point we can
 
00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
have representative Lynn speak to his
 
00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment and his uh opposition
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:15.529 --> 00:23:15.539 align:start position:0%
thanks very much
 
00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
so I guess
 
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
you know I think if if you were to ask
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
representative verbill and myself and I
 
00:23:24.409 --> 00:23:24.419 align:start position:0%
suspect all of you
 
00:23:24.419 --> 00:23:25.789 align:start position:0%
suspect all of you
what

00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:23:28.669 --> 00:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
what do we want you know if we if we
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
were to give us all
 
00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
an example of you know 10 or 20 sort of
 
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
situations and say where do you all come
 
00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
down I suspect we would all come down in
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
the same place we'd all say yep in this
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
case the person shouldn't be able to
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
have this employment or this case the
 
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
person should the problem I have with
 
00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
The Proposal that has that has been
 
00:23:51.049 --> 00:23:51.059 align:start position:0%
offered and that is now before the
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
committee is when when if you say
 
00:23:58.610 --> 00:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
that a sex offender can't have
 
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
and let's just let's take out the
 
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
business from it even if you say cannot
 
00:24:04.909 --> 00:24:04.919 align:start position:0%
have employment
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
that provides Direct Services to minors
 
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:10.919 align:start position:0%
now representative verbal said well you
 
00:24:12.649 --> 00:24:12.659 align:start position:0%
know we don't intend to prevent somebody
 
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
from working in the convenience store
 
00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:16.549 align:start position:0%
from working in the convenience store
but

00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
the the courts are not going to be
 
00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
they're gonna they're gonna be concerned
 
00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
with what the law says and if it says it
 
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
pretty clearly it's not you know you
 
00:24:30.289 --> 00:24:30.299 align:start position:0%
it's a very well established principle
 
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
if that if the law says something very
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
clearly you can't kind of go behind that
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
so the law says you can't provide Direct
 
00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
Services to minors
 
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:41.990 align:start position:0%
Services to minors
so

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
you get hired to be the the checkout
 
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:46.740 align:start position:0%
person at Market Basket
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
and through the checkout line Comes The
 
00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.510 align:start position:0%
and through the checkout line Comes The
Miner

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
Miner
 
00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
aren't you providing Direct Services to
 
00:24:54.049 --> 00:24:54.059 align:start position:0%
that Miner of course you are you're
 
00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:55.860 align:start position:0%
providing Direct Services to the minor
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
and so that means that the person the
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
you can't a registered sex offender
 
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
can't get a job at Market Basket working
 
00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
as a checkout person
 
00:25:09.649 --> 00:25:09.659 align:start position:0%
now maybe you want to do that you know
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
maybe you want to say that although
 
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
and by the same token couldn't get you
 
00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:16.740 align:start position:0%
know couldn't be the the person behind
 
00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
the counter at 7-Eleven or Cumberland
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
Farms or whatever because again a minor
 
00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:22.860 align:start position:0%
may be the one that comes in to buy or
 
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
you know a pack of gum and you're
 
00:25:27.649 --> 00:25:27.659 align:start position:0%
providing Direct Services if you're the
 
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
so I guess my only concern here is
 
00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
I'm no fan of sex offenders believe me
 
00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
but if
 
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
they are gonna most almost all of them
 
00:25:42.409 --> 00:25:42.419 align:start position:0%
are are not serving life sentences
 
00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:44.120 align:start position:0%
they're going to be released from
 
00:25:47.149 --> 00:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
incarceration at some point and then the
 
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
question really is
 
00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
do you want them to be able to get a job
 
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
in any place where it's sort of relative
 
00:25:57.409 --> 00:25:57.419 align:start position:0%
you know they're reasonably likely to be
 
00:25:59.210 --> 00:25:59.220 align:start position:0%
able to get a job I mean
 
00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
you know they're not they're they're not
 
00:26:03.169 --> 00:26:03.179 align:start position:0%
likely to be getting a job as an
 
00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:05.940 align:start position:0%
executive at BAE systems or something
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
like that you're talking about these
 
00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
kind of you know relatively for lack of
 
00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
a better term menial jobs that are most
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
likely the ones that they can get and if
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
you have a statute that prevents them
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
from even doing that you've essentially
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
a guaranteed they'll they're going to be
 
00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:24.059 align:start position:0%
on welfare and we're all going to pay
 
00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
for it and you know and and I don't
 
00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
think we want to do that so
 
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
I have I guess I think
 
00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.029 align:start position:0%
I have I guess I think
that

00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
the the way the statute is exists right
 
00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
now which contains this list of this
 
00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
this you know list of things that are
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
explicitly prohibited I I I agree with
 
00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
representative verbal that you don't
 
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
want that list to be the exclusive
 
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.630 align:start position:0%
want that list to be the exclusive
because

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
um I I completely agree with that
 
00:26:58.850 --> 00:26:58.860 align:start position:0%
um but I think that it does
 
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
it does
 
00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:04.460 align:start position:0%
serve the purpose of kind of capturing
 
00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
what generally the kinds of things that
 
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
are just flatly prohibited what we want
 
00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
to say look you can't do you can't work
 
00:27:15.169 --> 00:27:15.179 align:start position:0%
in these industries so to speak that are
 
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
you know that are sort of directed at
 
00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:18.409 align:start position:0%
you know that are sort of directed at
children

00:27:18.409 --> 00:27:18.419 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:27:24.769 --> 00:27:24.779 align:start position:0%
what what the example I mean what what I
 
00:27:27.289 --> 00:27:27.299 align:start position:0%
had proposed in my in the bill that was
 
00:27:29.149 --> 00:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
offered in the amendment that I offered
 
00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
last year was
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
um the the sort of catch-all at the end
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know more broadly worded but it
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
what's that says or any employment or
 
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:43.799 align:start position:0%
volunteer activity that provides
 
00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
services exclusively or predominantly to
 
00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
minors now I'm you know I'm the I'm the
 
00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
first to admit
 
00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
does is that you know absolutely crystal
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
clear so that we you will be able to
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
tell every single case whether it fits
 
00:28:03.169 --> 00:28:03.179 align:start position:0%
squarely within that or not no I'm not
 
00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:04.740 align:start position:0%
sure you would ever be able to have
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
language that would do that but it seems
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
to me what it does do is it says that
 
00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:14.460 align:start position:0%
if you know let me let me draw this
 
00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:15.649 align:start position:0%
if you know let me let me draw this
distinction

00:28:15.649 --> 00:28:15.659 align:start position:0%
distinction
 
00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
this would I would say this would not
 
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
prohibit a person from working as the
 
00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:23.700 align:start position:0%
you know the counter person uh the the
 
00:28:27.169 --> 00:28:27.179 align:start position:0%
checkout person that Market Basket or or
 
00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
the uh the uh
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
counter the behind the counter thing
 
00:28:36.649 --> 00:28:36.659 align:start position:0%
that's a 7-Eleven or Cumberland Farms or
 
00:28:39.409 --> 00:28:39.419 align:start position:0%
and also wouldn't prevent
 
00:28:42.289 --> 00:28:42.299 align:start position:0%
someone from for example getting a job
 
00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
at a restaurant as a waiter where you
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
know where the where
 
00:28:51.169 --> 00:28:51.179 align:start position:0%
the clientele of the restaurant is sort
 
00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
of the general public is it possible and
 
00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:56.940 align:start position:0%
you know that that that there will be a
 
00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
minor that comes into the restaurant
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes sure
 
00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
but I would say that and this would not
 
00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
capture that this would not capture the
 
00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:08.340 align:start position:0%
situation of a minor who is providing
 
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
services to uh who who Waits on the
 
00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
table where there's a minor there it
 
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that that that employment would
 
00:29:18.529 --> 00:29:18.539 align:start position:0%
be allowed under my proposal I would
 
00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
draw this distinction suppose instead of
 
00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
it being just a regular restaurant
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
suppose it's something like
 
00:29:27.529 --> 00:29:27.539 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to think of a good good
 
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
Chuck E cheese I think that was the one
 
00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:31.559 align:start position:0%
it's it's something that is it's a kids
 
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
restaurant where the the in where you
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
know most of the people that go there
 
00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:37.799 align:start position:0%
are kids
 
00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
um it's not sort of generally I would
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
say then that is uh um
 
00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
an activity that provides services
 
00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
exclusively or predominantly to minors
 
00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
and so you can't you can't work there
 
00:29:52.909 --> 00:29:52.919 align:start position:0%
um and I you know I don't
 
00:29:52.919 --> 00:29:53.570 align:start position:0%
um and I you know I don't
um

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:57.169 --> 00:29:57.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
you know is undermine is there a is
 
00:30:03.049 --> 00:30:03.059 align:start position:0%
there a a possibility you know for I
 
00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:04.980 align:start position:0%
mean for example representative verbal
 
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
pointed out and I I guess he's I think
 
00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
he's probably right I'd have to concede
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
this if you get a job at Market Basket
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
you're convicted sex offender you know
 
00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
are will there be minors that are also
 
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
working at Market Basket well yes that's
 
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
true and so you know
 
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
um uh he I think he might he would call
 
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
that a loophole
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
I guess I would tend to you know
 
00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
is it a loophole I I guess what I would
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
tend to say is if that's a loophole and
 
00:30:36.409 --> 00:30:36.419 align:start position:0%
you want to prohibit that then
 
00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:38.940 align:start position:0%
effectively you are you are you are
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
largely saying where does where you know
 
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%
that sex offenders can't work in the
 
00:30:45.529 --> 00:30:45.539 align:start position:0%
kind of jobs where they're likely to be
 
00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
able to get a job and I guess the other
 
00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:49.740 align:start position:0%
thing I would say is is it likely in
 
00:30:51.889 --> 00:30:51.899 align:start position:0%
that circumstance where you know you
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
have a co-work you have a correct
 
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:55.799 align:start position:0%
registered sex offender works as a is
 
00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
the checkout person at Market Basket and
 
00:30:59.870 --> 00:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
there are other miners that also work at
 
00:31:01.789 --> 00:31:01.799 align:start position:0%
Market Basket
 
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
is it likely in those circumstances that
 
00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
the minor is going to be left alone with
 
00:31:09.889 --> 00:31:09.899 align:start position:0%
the with the with the other person that
 
00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:13.140 align:start position:0%
works as a as a checkout person probably
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
not it would seemed to me would be a
 
00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
relatively unusual situation but I would
 
00:31:18.889 --> 00:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
concede it could happen
 
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
so what you have to I think what you
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
have to do in the end is balance what
 
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
how restrictive do you want to be do you
 
00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
want to give people registered sex
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
offenders any opportunity to be able to
 
00:31:30.049 --> 00:31:30.059 align:start position:0%
work in the economy that's really the
 
00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:32.220 align:start position:0%
decision you have to make
 
00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:34.980 align:start position:0%
if I could um so
 
00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at your proposed amendment
 
00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
now I'm I'm for the the list being in
 
00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
there uh I know in my experience a law
 
00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer the list is good
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
because it gives some guidance as to
 
00:31:48.409 --> 00:31:48.419 align:start position:0%
what types of things we're looking for
 
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
and there'll be no question that
 
00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
specifically that list
 
00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:53.820 align:start position:0%
there's no question about whether they
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:59.930 --> 00:31:59.940 align:start position:0%
adding the
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
part about
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
or any employment volunteer activity
 
00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:05.460 align:start position:0%
that provides services exclusively
 
00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
predominantly to minors
 
00:32:09.649 --> 00:32:09.659 align:start position:0%
covers I think everything else like you
 
00:32:09.659 --> 00:32:10.730 align:start position:0%
covers I think everything else like you
said

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:10.740 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:13.140 align:start position:0%
I think the concern from representative
 
00:32:15.049 --> 00:32:15.059 align:start position:0%
verville is
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
the supervision of minors so aside from
 
00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
it just being working in a place that
 
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
predominantly serves mine is that like
 
00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
Chuck E cheese or something if they're
 
00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
working at Market Basket and that person
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
is a direct supervisor of two or three
 
00:32:30.889 --> 00:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
miners or a landscaping company if there
 
00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
was some language in addition to
 
00:32:36.289 --> 00:32:36.299 align:start position:0%
Services exclusively predominantly to
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
minus or in employment with direct
 
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
supervision of minors or they are short
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
not sure now that's that's a good point
 
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
I think that's that's I mean maybe you
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
could add on to the end of it or any
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
employment or voluntary activity
 
00:32:53.149 --> 00:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
that provides uh Services exclusively or
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
predominantly to minors comma or that uh
 
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh or in which the the the the sex
 
00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
offender would be the direct supervisor
 
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sure because I I think I think we're
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
getting there I think we're getting
 
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
there really fast can I just say this um
 
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
so we can narrow this down in thinking
 
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
about time here
 
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:23.700 align:start position:0%
the section where you have a definition
 
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
under public private employer
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
organization as far as a background
 
00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.310 align:start position:0%
organization as far as a background
check

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
check
 
00:33:32.529 --> 00:33:32.539 align:start position:0%
I don't disagree that just citing
 
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:35.940 align:start position:0%
uh the section rather than redefining it
 
00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:37.130 align:start position:0%
uh the section rather than redefining it
again

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:37.140 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
so perhaps we can just leave that as it
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
is it already defines it once in the
 
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
above section so in section B yeah
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
you're defining it again so rather than
 
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
do that I see in representative Lynn's
 
00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:49.970 align:start position:0%
do that I see in representative Lynn's
proposal

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:49.980 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
it says uh
 
00:33:55.009 --> 00:33:55.019 align:start position:0%
oh yeah I specified a paragraph one
 
00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:56.700 align:start position:0%
right I just referred just to clean that
 
00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
up so we don't have two different
 
00:33:59.149 --> 00:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
definitions or two different things to
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
look at it we don't have to address that
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
part of your proposal because it just
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
specifies whatever we come to as an
 
00:34:07.789 --> 00:34:07.799 align:start position:0%
agreement on the
 
00:34:07.799 --> 00:34:09.050 align:start position:0%
agreement on the
uh

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
first part of it that we're discussing
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
now you don't you understand what I'm
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
saying yes yeah I think that makes some
 
00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:22.790 align:start position:0%
saying yes yeah I think that makes some
sense

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me interrupt
 
00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:27.899 align:start position:0%
um to be
 
00:34:30.349 --> 00:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
feels like it's got to be a no-go I know
 
00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:32.899 align:start position:0%
that it sounds great but practically
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
requiring every
 
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
organization of whatever kind in the
 
00:34:42.169 --> 00:34:42.179 align:start position:0%
state to start doing background checks
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
um it seems like an undue burden and it
 
00:34:45.599 --> 00:34:47.030 align:start position:0%
um it seems like an undue burden and it
doesn't

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:48.899 align:start position:0%
and it confuses the issue because I
 
00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
think the intent of the original Law is
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
to put the onus
 
00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:54.899 align:start position:0%
on the offender
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
to dictate their own employment and that
 
00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:01.020 align:start position:0%
when the offender fails to
 
00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
obtain employment that complies with the
 
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
expectations set upon them then they
 
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
suffer the consequences I think that
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
this committee really needs to have an
 
00:35:13.849 --> 00:35:13.859 align:start position:0%
amendment that eliminates to be sure I
 
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
don't think
 
00:35:16.609 --> 00:35:16.619 align:start position:0%
we can move forward with that
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
requirement just because of the
 
00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.030 align:start position:0%
requirement just because of the
widespread

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
widespread
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
effects that that would have on the
 
00:35:21.839 --> 00:35:23.089 align:start position:0%
effects that that would have on the
state

00:35:23.089 --> 00:35:23.099 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
um but as for the landscaper I've read
 
00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:28.220 align:start position:0%
the um well I'm going to say I browsed
 
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court decision which I
 
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
believe has representative Lynn's name
 
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
on it
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
and it looks like and that you know I
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
don't know how much of this has already
 
00:35:41.569 --> 00:35:41.579 align:start position:0%
been covered because I've been
 
00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
multitasking but the conviction that he
 
00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:48.839 align:start position:0%
got for employing a minor was overturned
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
by the Supreme Court and they said in
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
their decision
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
that more or less that the list was a
 
00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
problem was the problem and it they said
 
00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:03.890 align:start position:0%
problem was the problem and it they said
um

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
we are not persuaded by the state's
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
statutory interpretation so the you know
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor's interpretation of this
 
00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:13.140 align:start position:0%
law in part because it requires that we
 
00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:14.700 align:start position:0%
not give meaning to all the words of the
 
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
statute but that we instead Focus solely
 
00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
upon the phrase the care instruction or
 
00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:26.220 align:start position:0%
we acknowledge the state's point that
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
its reading of the statute arguably
 
00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
advances the goal of the statute to
 
00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:31.980 align:start position:0%
prevent child exploitation and abuse to
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.010 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
and then I don't know how to read
 
00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:41.700 align:start position:0%
decisions but it says it frustrates
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
rather than effectuates legislative
 
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
intent simplistically
 
00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:48.660 align:start position:0%
to assume that whatever furthers the
 
00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:50.940 align:start position:0%
state's primary objective must be the
 
00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:52.250 align:start position:0%
state's primary objective must be the
law

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:54.300 align:start position:0%
if the legislature disagrees with our
 
00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
statutory interpretation it is free to
 
00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
amend the RSA as it sees fit so
 
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
um maybe I think we're doing that now
 
00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
maybe representatively all right I have
 
00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
a point of order
 
00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:08.220 align:start position:0%
I'm curious I walked in before nine
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
o'clock I assume we're doing some kind
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
of meeting on House Bill 107.
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
no this I'm sorry
 
00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:18.780 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'm sorry if I just wanted
 
00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:21.900 align:start position:0%
to say what that um what I believe that
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court was trying to say and
 
00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn could tell me if I'm
 
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
wrong but it seems like the state was or
 
00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court was saying that just
 
00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:33.780 align:start position:0%
because we think that the legislature
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
intended or like that the goal of the
 
00:37:38.349 --> 00:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
legislature would be to prevent
 
00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
exploitation that results from people
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
meeting through a workplace or volunteer
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
situation that doesn't mean that the law
 
00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
actually says that and it so it does
 
00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
seem like the Supreme Court wanted to
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
eliminate the list and wanted the
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
legislature to work on
 
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
the wording and I would think they would
 
00:37:58.970 --> 00:37:58.980 align:start position:0%
want to keep the list and just expand on
 
00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:01.260 align:start position:0%
it yeah I don't think there was any I
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
think that what
 
00:38:04.609 --> 00:38:04.619 align:start position:0%
I think what the court was saying there
 
00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
was that the the
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances in that case were not
 
00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
we're not sort of clearly covered by the
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
statute and that you know it is as I
 
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
tried to mention before it it it really
 
00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
is a sort of principle of of judicial
 
00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
construction of statutes that it if the
 
00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:27.470 align:start position:0%
construction of statutes that it if the
statute

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover something
 
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
even though if if you know if it did
 
00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
cover it it would further the goal of
 
00:38:36.829 --> 00:38:36.839 align:start position:0%
the statute it's not the job of the
 
00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:39.320 align:start position:0%
Judiciary to say oh well that's great um
 
00:38:42.109 --> 00:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
uh you know we're going to interpret the
 
00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:44.460 align:start position:0%
statute as if it did because that would
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
further the goal the legislative the
 
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
court won't do that
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman if I may if I could just
 
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
hold on
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
you're from the sex offender registry is
 
00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:56.220 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
00:38:58.970 --> 00:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
do you have any any I just want to clear
 
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
this up because we have literally 20
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
minutes left here before and we'd have
 
00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:04.140 align:start position:0%
to do another work session which which
 
00:39:06.109 --> 00:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
is fine if we need to do that but do you
 
00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:07.980 align:start position:0%
have any comments on that section would
 
00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:11.180 align:start position:0%
that put an undue burden on first of all
 
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
your position and businesses where
 
00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
virtually every business would have to
 
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:27.170 align:start position:0%
 
s

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chairman if it would be possible
 
00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
if we'd have one or two minutes before
 
00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:34.380 align:start position:0%
we yield uh because I I made some cheat
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
notes I'm looking at representative
 
00:39:38.329 --> 00:39:38.339 align:start position:0%
Lynn's cheat notes and our cheat notes
 
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
are getting remarkably similar um so I
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
think we might be closer than we we
 
00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
think um at least on on on who's defined
 
00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:49.140 align:start position:0%
by the law and so I guess my if if we're
 
00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
going to use representative Lynn's
 
00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:55.740 align:start position:0%
Amendment as the framework which is fine
 
00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
then what I would ask is that we add
 
00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
language that a registered sex of
 
00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
language to the effect the registered
 
00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:05.220 align:start position:0%
sector sex offender cannot be the
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
employer so that boxes out the
 
00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
landscaper case right so if you're if
 
00:40:13.609 --> 00:40:13.619 align:start position:0%
you're a business owner you you cannot
 
00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
and you're a registered sex offender you
 
00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
cannot employ minors because that puts
 
00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:20.180 align:start position:0%
you in that power
 
00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
employer manager supervisor
 
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
or work one-on-one with a minor right
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
those are those are really the four
 
00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
things that I think we're trying to to
 
00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
block out and as I I look I look at his
 
00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
he's he's got direct supervision right
 
00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
so we're very very close I would say we
 
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
just want a bar registered sex offenders
 
00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:44.820 align:start position:0%
from being the employer being the
 
00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
manager being the supervisor or working
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
in a one-on-one setting so if it's three
 
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
people on a landscaping crew one's a
 
00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
minor one's a registered sex offender
 
00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
and one is not if the the one that's not
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
leaves and the registered sex offender
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
has to go with them that you can't leave
 
00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:03.500 align:start position:0%
the two alone I think if we added that
 
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
of a minor I think if we added that into
 
00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:07.730 align:start position:0%
of a minor I think if we added that into
this

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:07.740 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
um I think we would be I think we'd be
 
00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:12.180 align:start position:0%
in a happy place that we could
 
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
um all agree on with some other other
 
00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
tweaks so with that I'll yield thank you
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.349 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
foreign

00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:23.460 align:start position:0%
one additional thing and I was actually
 
00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:27.300 align:start position:0%
going to raise the issue of uh of uh of
 
00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:30.180 align:start position:0%
uh of businesses as well there's also
 
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
the possibility that an offender can
 
00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
actually own their own business that
 
00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:35.820 align:start position:0%
primarily serves children
 
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
um that's why I say which I'm not sure
 
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
the statute addresses or the amendment
 
00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:41.660 align:start position:0%
addresses at this point so for instance
 
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
they could buy an ice cream truck
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
um they could uh they could buy a Chuck
 
00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
E cheese franchise they they could so if
 
00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:55.020 align:start position:0%
we if we narrowly focus on on just
 
00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:56.569 align:start position:0%
we if we narrowly focus on on just
employment

00:41:56.569 --> 00:41:56.579 align:start position:0%
employment
 
00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
um I guess my question for
 
00:41:59.690 --> 00:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn is does that
 
00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
preclude a would it would would we be
 
00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:04.980 align:start position:0%
precluding people from buying an ice
 
00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:06.300 align:start position:0%
cream truck no you know in fact you know
 
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
what I I mean that's a very good I guess
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
I would direct you I I tried to capture
 
00:42:12.829 --> 00:42:12.839 align:start position:0%
that in so if you read
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
um six uh Roman numeral one six you know
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
the first what prohibition unemployment
 
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
of volunteer Services what it says is I
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
tried to capture that in there so a
 
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
person is guilty of a class a felony if
 
00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:27.300 align:start position:0%
having been convicted in this or any
 
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
other jurisdiction of the various
 
00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.010 align:start position:0%
other jurisdiction of the various
offenses

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:31.609 align:start position:0%
offenses
um

00:42:31.609 --> 00:42:31.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:34.140 align:start position:0%
it goes on to say he or she knowingly
 
00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
engages in employment or volunteer
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
service then the crucial language either
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
as the employer or provider of such
 
00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:45.300 align:start position:0%
services or as an employee or volunteer
 
00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
so I try to that's that language is
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
different than the than the current law
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
because it tried in other words it's
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
designed to capture just what you said
 
00:42:58.010 --> 00:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
so it's the you can't be the employer
 
00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:00.900 align:start position:0%
or the employee
 
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
um and that that's what that's designed
 
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
to capture
 
00:43:07.329 --> 00:43:07.339 align:start position:0%
a quick follow-up um
 
00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
I've been working on another bill that
 
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
would ban uh the use of prone restraint
 
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:13.740 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and under the currents
 
00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:15.560 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that we're having is
 
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
the current statute actually does ban
 
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:19.980 align:start position:0%
prone restraint but it doesn't ban it by
 
00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
name and it doesn't Define it so it's
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
unclear to actually to people who are
 
00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:27.069 align:start position:0%
unclear to actually to people who are
actually

00:43:27.069 --> 00:43:27.079 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
providing services to children that
 
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily something that
 
00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:34.140 align:start position:0%
they should be doing so my question is
 
00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:37.140 align:start position:0%
is do we need to be more explicit than
 
00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:41.460 align:start position:0%
that is it to avoid uh misinterpretation
 
00:43:43.609 --> 00:43:43.619 align:start position:0%
or is that something that you think the
 
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
legislature should be concerned with I
 
00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
don't know I guess I I think that you
 
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
know where it says that you can't do
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
these things
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
either as an employer or as an employee
 
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
or you know or a volunteer I think
 
00:43:59.690 --> 00:43:59.700 align:start position:0%
that's you know that should that is
 
00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:01.140 align:start position:0%
pretty clear
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
um so you know as representative was
 
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
saying I I think maybe we
 
00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
we are in agreement on this what if what
 
00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
if you added to the in my in my version
 
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
what if you added instead of ending the
 
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
sentence that says or any employment or
 
00:44:19.309 --> 00:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
volunteer service that or volunteer
 
00:44:21.069 --> 00:44:21.079 align:start position:0%
activity that provides services
 
00:44:23.569 --> 00:44:23.579 align:start position:0%
exclusively or predominantly to minors
 
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
what if you then put a comma
 
00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:28.740 align:start position:0%
so that that provides services
 
00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:30.900 align:start position:0%
exclusively or predominantly to minors
 
00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:31.910 align:start position:0%
exclusively or predominantly to minors
comma

00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
comma
 
00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:35.220 align:start position:0%
that involves the direct supervision of
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
minors comma or that involves one-on-one
 
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
work with minors
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
period I think that I think that kind of
 
00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:45.410 align:start position:0%
period I think that I think that kind of
covers

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
covers
 
00:44:48.349 --> 00:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
you know all of the things that we were
 
00:44:50.089 --> 00:44:50.099 align:start position:0%
you know that representative verville
 
00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
was was concerned about and that you
 
00:44:52.849 --> 00:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
know that that
 
00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
as sort of a loophole I think that sort
 
00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
of covers it not
 
00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.270 align:start position:0%
of covers it not
foreign

00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
I think I think I know
 
00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:04.740 align:start position:0%
if I think I know that representative
 
00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:06.780 align:start position:0%
Lynn and I would love to work together
 
00:45:11.089 --> 00:45:11.099 align:start position:0%
uh to come up with a new Amendment uh
 
00:45:13.609 --> 00:45:13.619 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh we could recess this work
 
00:45:13.619 --> 00:45:14.990 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh we could recess this work
committee

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:45:16.849 --> 00:45:16.859 align:start position:0%
um give us a week or two to hammer out
 
00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
some some details and bring something
 
00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
forth to the committee if there are
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee that have other
 
00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
concerns about other provisions of what
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn has brought forth
 
00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly willing to to address
 
00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
those two my my main concern has been
 
00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
would be addressed by this and and so I
 
00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
would yield to the committee members if
 
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
there's other parts of the bill that
 
00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
that are causing concern or pause you
 
00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
know we could certainly address that as
 
00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:44.940 align:start position:0%
well representative
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
so on the part about getting background
 
00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:49.140 align:start position:0%
checks those are getting tougher and
 
00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
tougher to get because everybody wants
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
them and that system is just overloading
 
00:45:58.910 --> 00:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
so they might be waiting weeks if not
 
00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
months to get a background check to hire
 
00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
somebody so right and that was discussed
 
00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:06.980 align:start position:0%
and I think we're gonna hear from uh
 
00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
representative all right uh on that part
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
of it this is specifically uh talking
 
00:46:14.569 --> 00:46:14.579 align:start position:0%
about the part defining
 
00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:16.740 align:start position:0%
the statute and the language and the
 
00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
list and whatnot and I think you guys
 
00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:19.740 align:start position:0%
are pretty close to coming up with
 
00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:21.420 align:start position:0%
something that you both agree on
 
00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
so that's probably the best course of
 
00:46:25.309 --> 00:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
action is to let them work on that we
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
can uh come back when there's an
 
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
amendment to it however the other part
 
00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:32.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:35.460 align:start position:0%
section B I would like to hear
 
00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:36.780 align:start position:0%
um some more information on that and
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
what the burden with that would be on
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
not only employers but on uh your
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
department as well
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
you had a question at some point
 
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
or testimony I'll have you in a second
 
00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:48.780 align:start position:0%
here I just wanted to make sure that you
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:58.250 --> 00:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
I guess the other issue here is 2b and I
 
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
had similar concerns with that
 
00:47:05.089 --> 00:47:05.099 align:start position:0%
if this is interpreted as McDonald's and
 
00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
Market Basket and any fast food
 
00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:08.940 align:start position:0%
restaurant or a restaurant at all or a
 
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
movie theater
 
00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:12.420 align:start position:0%
all now required to have background
 
00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:14.460 align:start position:0%
checks on everybody what kind of a
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
burden would that put on
 
00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
on you
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
so in in talking with um
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
I'm talking with criminal records
 
00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
yesterday would put a burden on uh
 
00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
you know there's a 25 fee assigned to
 
00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
those as what you know so the some of
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
the concern is
 
00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
who absorbs that 25 fee uh if you have
 
00:47:37.849 --> 00:47:37.859 align:start position:0%
multiple applicants applying for a job
 
00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
you know when you've got uh you know 10
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
people applying for two jobs
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
they all need those background uh checks
 
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
does that cost get absorbed by the
 
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
individual applying or by the company
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
so those they do take time as well so
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
that would be an issue and again we're
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
not in opposition or in favor of law but
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh if we're solely talking about
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks and I won't
 
00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
mention any of the other uh talking
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
points that I I kind of put together
 
00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:07.970 align:start position:0%
points that I I kind of put together
here

00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:07.980 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:08.569 align:start position:0%
here
um

00:48:08.569 --> 00:48:08.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
but I I do have to mention one thing
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
that I hear continue to hear over and
 
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
over is
 
00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:17.220 align:start position:0%
sex offender the verbiage sex offender
 
00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
versus an offender against children we
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
have a number of sex offenders in the
 
00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
state that have not committed any crimes
 
00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:25.500 align:start position:0%
against children there are crimes
 
00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:28.380 align:start position:0%
against adults so they don't fit into
 
00:48:31.609 --> 00:48:31.619 align:start position:0%
any of paragraph one essentially that
 
00:48:31.619 --> 00:48:32.630 align:start position:0%
any of paragraph one essentially that
says

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
felonious physical assault on a minor
 
00:48:38.569 --> 00:48:38.579 align:start position:0%
or any assault or child sexual abuse
 
00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
images they don't fit into those if
 
00:48:43.309 --> 00:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
we're specifically talking about a minor
 
00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:46.380 align:start position:0%
those also don't capture one of the
 
00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:46.970 align:start position:0%
those also don't capture one of the
um

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:46.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
laws that a tremendous amount of our
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
offenders fall under and that's uh
 
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
would be use of certain Computer
 
00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
Services prohibited which are the
 
00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
offenders that actually are online being
 
00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
caught by police departments that are
 
00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:05.300 align:start position:0%
they're trying to lure minors
 
00:49:07.849 --> 00:49:07.859 align:start position:0%
to meet them and and to have sex with
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
them so
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
that doesn't fit into any one of those
 
00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
three sections above
 
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
so if they're convicted of those things
 
00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
what happens so um
 
00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:22.740 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying this should be the
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
verbiage but
 
00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
you know perhaps any conviction
 
00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:28.140 align:start position:0%
requiring the uh
 
00:49:30.349 --> 00:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
offender to register and as if as an
 
00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
offender against children Maybe
 
00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.309 align:start position:0%
offender against children Maybe
broader

00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
broader
 
00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:36.660 align:start position:0%
in less
 
00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
ambiguitous to us
 
00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
law enforcement I think in some of these
 
00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:43.270 align:start position:0%
law enforcement I think in some of these
instances

00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
instances
 
00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:46.140 align:start position:0%
relative to what has been proposed we're
 
00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:48.660 align:start position:0%
going to have our hands tied and the way
 
00:49:50.329 --> 00:49:50.339 align:start position:0%
I see things is it is open to
 
00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:52.980 align:start position:0%
interpretation but depending how that's
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
perceived by the individual officer or
 
00:49:57.230 --> 00:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
the department or the person making that
 
00:49:58.910 --> 00:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
claim I think that's going to put a
 
00:50:01.609 --> 00:50:01.619 align:start position:0%
burden on those law enforcement agencies
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
to make that arrest or to bring those
 
00:50:07.790 --> 00:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
thank you I also have one of the
 
00:50:15.770 --> 00:50:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
so one of the big things and we're
 
00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
talking about uh paragraph B here on the
 
00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:22.309 align:start position:0%
talking about uh paragraph B here on the
bottom

00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
00:50:24.109 --> 00:50:24.119 align:start position:0%
how do employers and I think I brought
 
00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
this up last time how do employers
 
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:28.380 align:start position:0%
interpret the criminal background check
 
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
so if you are applying for a job at
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
McDonald's or let's just say I don't
 
00:50:35.329 --> 00:50:35.339 align:start position:0%
want to see I don't want to use a chain
 
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
restaurant but let's say a big chain
 
00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:37.849 align:start position:0%
restaurant but let's say a big chain
restaurant

00:50:37.849 --> 00:50:37.859 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
and you've got a conviction in Tennessee
 
00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:43.140 align:start position:0%
but now you're in a resident in New
 
00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:44.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you apply for a background
 
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
check here it's going to show you in New
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire New Hampshire background check
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily going to pull and
 
00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:52.380 align:start position:0%
it won't pull that Tennessee background
 
00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
so you might have a conviction in
 
00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
Tennessee that's not going to show up in
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
so are the
 
00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
restaurants now are they going to go by
 
00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:02.990 align:start position:0%
restaurants now are they going to go by
the

00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:04.849 --> 00:51:04.859 align:start position:0%
are they going to get on to the offender
 
00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
website and see you know this uh this
 
00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:09.660 align:start position:0%
subject is a sex offender perhaps he's
 
00:51:11.089 --> 00:51:11.099 align:start position:0%
going to do their the employer is going
 
00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:12.300 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
they're going to look at the list
 
00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
they're still not for the most part
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
going to be able to interpret that law
 
00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:20.940 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:51:23.569 --> 00:51:23.579 align:start position:0%
RSA or that law that that subject or
 
00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:25.980 align:start position:0%
that prospective employee was
 
00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:26.990 align:start position:0%
that prospective employee was
um

00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:29.089 --> 00:51:29.099 align:start position:0%
convicted of
 
00:51:30.589 --> 00:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
does that make sense to everybody it
 
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
does could could you explain how it's
 
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
done currently under current law
 
00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:37.460 align:start position:0%
for the people for the obviously these
 
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
positions that are on this list here
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
girl scout School daycare do they get a
 
00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
copy of the background check and
 
00:51:44.589 --> 00:51:44.599 align:start position:0%
interpret it
 
00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
so as far as if
 
00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
if somebody's applying to like a daycare
 
00:51:54.049 --> 00:51:54.059 align:start position:0%
yes I I don't know that they do at this
 
00:51:55.549 --> 00:51:55.559 align:start position:0%
point um
 
00:51:57.530 --> 00:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
quite honestly I don't know I don't know
 
00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
how many Employers in the state actually
 
00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
do criminal background checks I can't
 
00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:02.700 align:start position:0%
speak for that so this is basically the
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
current laws prohibiting the sex
 
00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
offender from applying for these jobs
 
00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
not making these places get background
 
00:52:11.329 --> 00:52:11.339 align:start position:0%
checks correct that's the way I that's
 
00:52:13.609 --> 00:52:13.619 align:start position:0%
the way I read it
 
00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
sorry I just want to ask a quick
 
00:52:17.569 --> 00:52:17.579 align:start position:0%
question I know I I work as a homeless
 
00:52:19.849 --> 00:52:19.859 align:start position:0%
advocate so I certainly need a criminal
 
00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
uh justice I mean a criminal background
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
check or whatever what they do is it's
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
called Corey c-o-ri and I was under the
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
impression that that would be Nationwide
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
you would have all of the information
 
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
not just in in well where I work is in
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts not just in Massachusetts
 
00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
but you know any criminal background
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
check is that not the case what is it
 
00:52:41.329 --> 00:52:41.339 align:start position:0%
called Cori c-o-r-i I'm not familiar
 
00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
with that that term
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
um I and that's the other thing too is
 
00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:47.460 align:start position:0%
in this paragraph B
 
00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:49.380 align:start position:0%
shall conduct a criminal background
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
check so and I think I brought this up
 
00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:53.220 align:start position:0%
last time that means a lot of different
 
00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:54.559 align:start position:0%
things to a lot of different people
 
00:52:58.490 --> 00:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
perhaps a criminal record
 
00:52:58.500 --> 00:52:59.930 align:start position:0%
perhaps a criminal record
check

00:52:59.930 --> 00:52:59.940 align:start position:0%
check
 
00:53:02.329 --> 00:53:02.339 align:start position:0%
from you know the state of New Hampshire
 
00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:04.980 align:start position:0%
or somebody that would that's going to
 
00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
be an actual criminal background check
 
00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:09.300 align:start position:0%
but again if you're convicted in
 
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
Tennessee and we do a criminal
 
00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
background check on you in New Hampshire
 
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
that's not going to flag if you live in
 
00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we're going to see your
 
00:53:17.809 --> 00:53:17.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
criminal record
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
isn't there two levels the state and the
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
federal yes so we should be doing the
 
00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:26.940 align:start position:0%
federal they again it doesn't say that
 
00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:28.380 align:start position:0%
but I know that that's why I'm asking
 
00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
yes put that in so to capture everything
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
you need the second level the federal
 
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
checklist I would say so and then I
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
think to take it a step further
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
um and again I want to be clear we're
 
00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
not in opposition we're just giving you
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
thinking points because we're on law
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement side are going to be the
 
00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
ones dealing with the aftermath of this
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:53:49.569 --> 00:53:49.579 align:start position:0%
um to take it a step further
 
00:53:53.809 --> 00:53:53.819 align:start position:0%
those offense who is going to interpret
 
00:53:57.290 --> 00:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
those offenses so for example you might
 
00:53:59.569 --> 00:53:59.579 align:start position:0%
have an assault and battery charge out
 
00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
of let's say Massachusetts you live in
 
00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they find that assault and
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
battery charge that might actually be
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
a sex crime but it's not listed that way
 
00:54:11.569 --> 00:54:11.579 align:start position:0%
it's it's assault and battery so the
 
00:54:13.609 --> 00:54:13.619 align:start position:0%
employer how is the employer now
 
00:54:15.049 --> 00:54:15.059 align:start position:0%
determining that they're not going to
 
00:54:17.089 --> 00:54:17.099 align:start position:0%
have access to that police report
 
00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
they're not going to have access to be
 
00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:22.980 align:start position:0%
able to say oh yeah look in 1997 you
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
know he struck his stepson for you know
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
while attempting to do this they don't
 
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
have access to that they're not going to
 
00:54:31.069 --> 00:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
be able to interpret that in my opinion
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
okay rep forever if you ever
 
00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
what's in front of you does not make any
 
00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:39.780 align:start position:0%
changes it's the best of my knowledge I
 
00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:43.140 align:start position:0%
I I haven't prepared reference amendment
 
00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
to my bill my bill doesn't change the
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
background checks from what's currently
 
00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire statute and apparently
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
is working quite well
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
so while I appreciate the remarks of the
 
00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
current speaker and I've indicated I
 
00:54:57.770 --> 00:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
would be more than happy to work with
 
00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
them for a bill for next term to maybe
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
address some of those concerns they have
 
00:55:04.849 --> 00:55:04.859 align:start position:0%
what's in front of you is not changed
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
the criminal background checks that are
 
00:55:08.930 --> 00:55:08.940 align:start position:0%
currently in place for these things okay
 
00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
as far as I know there's been no no
 
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
problems associated with that so I I
 
00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:15.900 align:start position:0%
really wouldn't want to get this bill
 
00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:18.660 align:start position:0%
bought down to that which is sort of a
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
different a different topic I think that
 
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
was a concern that's current language
 
00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
um I think is is it exactly because it's
 
00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:28.380 align:start position:0%
it's bold so there's some changes in
 
00:55:36.589 --> 00:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
I I think that the only change that I
 
00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
made in subsection to be
 
00:55:47.329 --> 00:55:47.339 align:start position:0%
was it was simply you know to to instead
 
00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
of lifting because I think the the
 
00:55:52.609 --> 00:55:52.619 align:start position:0%
current law about sort of whisping again
 
00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
the stuff that's in one
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
um I just said I just made a referencing
 
00:55:59.690 --> 00:55:59.700 align:start position:0%
one yeah but I know there are background
 
00:56:01.370 --> 00:56:01.380 align:start position:0%
checks done now I've done fingerprints
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
for School Employees so there are they
 
00:56:05.089 --> 00:56:05.099 align:start position:0%
do them and I don't know who interprets
 
00:56:06.650 --> 00:56:06.660 align:start position:0%
those but it's been done but nothing's
 
00:56:08.329 --> 00:56:08.339 align:start position:0%
changed as far as that part of it with
 
00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:10.380 align:start position:0%
current law right we're not changing
 
00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:15.130 align:start position:0%
current law right we're not changing
that

00:56:15.130 --> 00:56:15.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:21.900 align:start position:0%
okay we uh literally have maybe four
 
00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:24.180 align:start position:0%
minutes left here but thank you did you
 
00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:25.859 align:start position:0%
have some comments or something you want
 
00:56:30.829 --> 00:56:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
and and uh
 
00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:35.700 align:start position:0%
you can just let us know who you are and
 
00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:44.089 --> 00:56:44.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:46.740 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm Abby Simon I work for
 
00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections I am
 
00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:49.740 align:start position:0%
administrator of Behavioral Health and
 
00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:51.900 align:start position:0%
sex partner treatment program so I was
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify when looking over
 
00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
this making sure and second what you're
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
saying because there are a lot of I
 
00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
think just pull the mic you can pull the
 
00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:15.300 align:start position:0%
um what I was saying is I just want to
 
00:57:17.329 --> 00:57:17.339 align:start position:0%
Second making sure when we're looking at
 
00:57:17.339 --> 00:57:18.530 align:start position:0%
Second making sure when we're looking at
this

00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:20.700 align:start position:0%
um for people who have a sex offense not
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
everyone has a minor that has these sex
 
00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:27.180 align:start position:0%
offense so limiting people who do not
 
00:57:31.309 --> 00:57:31.319 align:start position:0%
have an offense against a minor
 
00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:33.540 align:start position:0%
does not help them find employment as
 
00:57:36.589 --> 00:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
well also we spoke in one of the
 
00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
hearings previously about making sure
 
00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:40.980 align:start position:0%
that their structure and routine for
 
00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
people so that they're not reoffending
 
00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:45.300 align:start position:0%
or coming back to the prison for other
 
00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
do you know if the current law includes
 
00:57:56.349 --> 00:57:56.359 align:start position:0%
or any sexual assault
 
00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:13.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
felonious offense involving child sexual
 
00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:20.950 align:start position:0%
felonious offense involving child sexual
abusive

00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
for a felonious physical assault of a
 
00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:25.309 align:start position:0%
for a felonious physical assault of a
minor

00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
minor
 
00:58:28.370 --> 00:58:28.380 align:start position:0%
or any sexual assault some sexual
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
thought doesn't have to be against the
 
00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
minor it could be any spectacular fault
 
00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:34.260 align:start position:0%
and I think uh you know I assume the
 
00:58:36.049 --> 00:58:36.059 align:start position:0%
legislation when they originally passed
 
00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
that when the theory was there you know
 
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
I think there's some evidence that
 
00:58:41.809 --> 00:58:41.819 align:start position:0%
sexual assault whether it's committed
 
00:58:44.089 --> 00:58:44.099 align:start position:0%
against a minor or an adult that puts a
 
00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
person at a high risk of community okay
 
00:58:47.329 --> 00:58:47.339 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's current law and that's
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
not even being proposed as a change in
 
00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:51.900 align:start position:0%
your Amendment so I think we should
 
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
stick to
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
the issues that we're discussing as far
 
00:58:57.890 --> 00:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
as what your proposed changes are in
 
00:59:00.589 --> 00:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
your Amendment you guys can work on that
 
00:59:02.089 --> 00:59:02.099 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions here at
 
00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:03.900 align:start position:0%
all for anybody
 
00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:05.690 align:start position:0%
all for anybody
okay

00:59:05.690 --> 00:59:05.700 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:07.260 align:start position:0%
I think at this point we could probably
 
00:59:08.930 --> 00:59:08.940 align:start position:0%
maybe recess
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
and you guys will work on a Amendment
 
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
together that probably works together
 
00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:16.740 align:start position:0%
and let us know and we will schedule
 
00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:17.809 align:start position:0%
and let us know and we will schedule
another

00:59:17.809 --> 00:59:17.819 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:20.099 align:start position:0%
work session and see if we can't
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
come to an agreement on that and handle
 
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
that out
 
00:59:32.829 --> 00:59:32.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
here if the committee decides that you
 
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
want to make some changes to the
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
background checkpoints
 
00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:45.839 align:start position:0%
I hope you don't when the roots are
 
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative if you do you know if you
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
let us know we'll
 
00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:53.220 align:start position:0%
put that in too I would rather deal with
 
00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:55.380 align:start position:0%
that as a separate building accent but
 
00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:58.630 align:start position:0%
that as a separate building accent but
yeah

00:59:58.630 --> 00:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:01.010 --> 01:00:01.020 align:start position:0%
again because that's currently in the
 
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
statute so it was known to issue to deal
 
01:00:06.289 --> 01:00:06.299 align:start position:0%
with it yeah thank you one more thing to
 
01:00:07.789 --> 01:00:07.799 align:start position:0%
the to the extent that you can share
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
your Amendment with us before the the
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
next work session would be great I think
 
01:00:15.289 --> 01:00:15.299 align:start position:0%
um my goal would be to make sure that we
 
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
get this through as a unanimous
 
01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:19.380 align:start position:0%
recommendation and that will take some
 
01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
okay and with that I'll close this
 
01:00:27.960 --> 01:04:30.589 align:start position:0%
okay and with that I'll close this
hearing

01:04:30.589 --> 01:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:32.289 --> 01:04:32.299 align:start position:0%
good morning

foreign

01:05:18.589 --> 01:05:18.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:18.599 --> 01:05:28.490 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:05:28.490 --> 01:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I didn't want to
 
01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you very much I'm
 
01:05:35.329 --> 01:05:35.339 align:start position:0%
president Timothy Horrigan from
 
01:05:37.069 --> 01:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
Stratford County District 10 which is
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
the towns of Durham and uh
 
01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
I see my former colleague Dr johannan
 
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
has put in a pink card and uh we served
 
01:05:48.170 --> 01:05:48.180 align:start position:0%
adjoining communities for I can't
 
01:05:50.089 --> 01:05:50.099 align:start position:0%
remember how long it was but like it's
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
good to see him again as always
 
01:05:54.289 --> 01:05:54.299 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:05:58.609 --> 01:05:58.619 align:start position:0%
this bill the HB 191 it's act relatively
 
01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
voluntarily surrendered firearms
 
01:06:04.970 --> 01:06:04.980 align:start position:0%
and um it's essentially
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
um undoing a bill that was passed a long
 
01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
time ago back in 1998 which is before
 
01:06:12.289 --> 01:06:12.299 align:start position:0%
before I was in the legislature
 
01:06:14.329 --> 01:06:14.339 align:start position:0%
and was signed into law by the governor
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
and that uh
 
01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
Governor by the way even though she's a
 
01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
Democrat I still think she made a
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
mistake and so I'm free to disagree with
 
01:06:23.569 --> 01:06:23.579 align:start position:0%
honor it's uh seen Shaheen who's now
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
Senator Sheen
 
01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:26.329 align:start position:0%
Senator Sheen
um

01:06:26.329 --> 01:06:26.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
and uh so to added RSA
 
01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:31.980 align:start position:0%
159.25 to the law book so that made it
 
01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
illegal for the State Police to run
 
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
voluntary uh
 
01:06:38.329 --> 01:06:38.339 align:start position:0%
gun buyback programs in fact it went a
 
01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
step forward by forbidding any state
 
01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
agency destroy any voluntarily
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
surrendered firearm and I don't know
 
01:06:46.609 --> 01:06:46.619 align:start position:0%
and I think that would I believe that
 
01:06:48.770 --> 01:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
would apply also to a County Sheriff's
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
departments and local police departments
 
01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
um since they are I think they
 
01:06:55.069 --> 01:06:55.079 align:start position:0%
would qualify as state agency so I don't
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
know if that's ever been tested or not
 
01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:00.660 align:start position:0%
if any tried to do it so the uh
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
um so since
 
01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
um so since the law was passed gun
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
owners may still in theory have the
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
right to destroy their property but they
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
cannot rely on the state police or any
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
other state government agency to do so
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
safely and um
 
01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
according to an April 9 1995 New
 
01:07:17.569 --> 01:07:17.579 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Sunday news article by
 
01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
reporter Taylor who later worked
 
01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
for the Hampshire speaker's office
 
01:07:23.329 --> 01:07:23.339 align:start position:0%
um State Police at that time had a
 
01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:25.140 align:start position:0%
simple and easy procedure for safely
 
01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
destroying a gun and I assume they still
 
01:07:29.690 --> 01:07:29.700 align:start position:0%
know how to do it and uh
 
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
I guess at the time what they suggested
 
01:07:33.410 --> 01:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
was well you can go to a local gun shop
 
01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:34.980 align:start position:0%
and do it but that's you know it's
 
01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
somebody has a gun they don't want it
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
maybe they're not uh you know serious
 
01:07:40.970 --> 01:07:40.980 align:start position:0%
gun owners maybe they're not used to
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
hanging around gun shops they may not
 
01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
even know where a trustworthy gun shop
 
01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
is or even maybe not feel comfortable if
 
01:07:49.010 --> 01:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
they've been the victims of some sort of
 
01:07:50.809 --> 01:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
trauma um
 
01:07:52.609 --> 01:07:52.619 align:start position:0%
ironically since this is an old bill
 
01:07:55.069 --> 01:07:55.079 align:start position:0%
it's easier to track down the bill files
 
01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
than it does for recent bills everyone
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
like if you ever want to know what
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
happened to a build
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
that happened last week it's really
 
01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
difficult to find the bill files but
 
01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
they've digitized all the bill files for
 
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
this one including a SB sb65
 
01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
1998 which is a bill this is overturning
 
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
and uh you know it was a very familiar
 
01:08:17.689 --> 01:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
name as the prime sponsor which was
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
Senator David wheeler now the executive
 
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
counselor wheeler and um
 
01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
also the former chair this longtime
 
01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:26.100 align:start position:0%
chair of this committee David Welch
 
01:08:27.769 --> 01:08:27.779 align:start position:0%
turned up in the debate and he had he
 
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
actually had kind of a strange story
 
01:08:31.849 --> 01:08:31.859 align:start position:0%
where he uh well what it says in the
 
01:08:33.229 --> 01:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
bill file he said he told the story
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
about a woman who accidentally shot at a
 
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
building his firearm was ceased and
 
01:08:39.289 --> 01:08:39.299 align:start position:0%
remained in custody for four years
 
01:08:39.299 --> 01:08:40.309 align:start position:0%
remained in custody for four years
um

01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
she voluntarily gave it up to police to
 
01:08:45.650 --> 01:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
buy herself keep herself Reverend Welch
 
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
bought the gun in his head at three
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
years that's a successful outcome and
 
01:08:50.090 --> 01:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
that was his that was our his argument
 
01:08:52.189 --> 01:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
against passing the bill that he it
 
01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
would have been really terrible if that
 
01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
wonderful beautiful gun had been
 
01:08:58.490 --> 01:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
destroyed instead of like finding a
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
loving home but representative Welch's
 
01:09:02.450 --> 01:09:02.460 align:start position:0%
and he was he was a good man I can
 
01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
imagine him I can just imagine how he
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
must have sounded when he's saying it
 
01:09:06.650 --> 01:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
was probably kind of funny but it's a
 
01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:08.759 align:start position:0%
strange why am I so strange thing and
 
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
also uh I mentioned that Dr Joe's here
 
01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:12.650 align:start position:0%
also uh I mentioned that Dr Joe's here
he's

01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
he's
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
apparently resident gun owners of New
 
01:09:16.010 --> 01:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they were an organization
 
01:09:17.809 --> 01:09:17.819 align:start position:0%
they had gone through several lobbyists
 
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
and spokespeople over the years but uh
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
they were instrumental in stopping the
 
01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:23.169 align:start position:0%
they were instrumental in stopping the
voluntary

01:09:23.169 --> 01:09:23.179 align:start position:0%
voluntary
 
01:09:27.289 --> 01:09:27.299 align:start position:0%
buyback program and um so that's uh
 
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
and actually it's another familiar name
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
associated videos was uh Ann leizak from
 
01:09:33.530 --> 01:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth who's uh
 
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
husband was professor at UNH and my
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
parents uh knew both uh and lizac and
 
01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
her husband Dr Richard lizac
 
01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
he was shot on Maplewood Avenue in
 
01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth near his home for really No
 
01:09:50.689 --> 01:09:50.699 align:start position:0%
Good Reason by a young person who had a
 
01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
had a firearm where they became they
 
01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
became um you know they became gun
 
01:09:57.410 --> 01:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
safety so she became a gun safety
 
01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
Advocate after that and she was uh led
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
the opposition to the bill which uh
 
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
was not successful but I still think um
 
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
I still think
 
01:10:09.650 --> 01:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
Banning uh Banning the destruction of uh
 
01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
voluntarily surrendered Firearms was a
 
01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:14.219 align:start position:0%
bad idea that's something that the state
 
01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:15.900 align:start position:0%
police and other state agencies should
 
01:10:18.169 --> 01:10:18.179 align:start position:0%
have an option and even uh
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
voluntary gun buyback programs I think
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
might be a good idea although there were
 
01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
and uh so that's uh
 
01:10:29.689 --> 01:10:29.699 align:start position:0%
the other going on probably pretty
 
01:10:32.209 --> 01:10:32.219 align:start position:0%
pretty near my five minutes anyway but
 
01:10:34.970 --> 01:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
um so what this bill actually is going
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
it's a first of all this HP RSA 15925
 
01:10:44.090 --> 01:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
which has not been amended since it was
 
01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
passed back in 1998. the first line was
 
01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
no state agency shall operate a Firearms
 
01:10:51.169 --> 01:10:51.179 align:start position:0%
quote voluntary surrender and Destroy
 
01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:53.460 align:start position:0%
program so that just crosses that out so
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
no state agencies
 
01:10:59.149 --> 01:10:59.159 align:start position:0%
can operate a firearm voluntarily
 
01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:00.900 align:start position:0%
surrender and Destroy programs and then
 
01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
also uh the rest of it is the same
 
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
except then we add a third option which
 
01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
was or destroyed by the state agency in
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
bold so that it adds that as an option
 
01:11:11.149 --> 01:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
I guess when I drafted I figured those
 
01:11:14.450 --> 01:11:14.460 align:start position:0%
were pretty much your three options
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
although I suppose there is the there is
 
01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
also the option of donating the guns um
 
01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
but uh you know perhaps we're you know
 
01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
perhaps like you know for use by like uh
 
01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
firearm safety programs or whatever but
 
01:11:33.050 --> 01:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
01:11:35.689 --> 01:11:35.699 align:start position:0%
anyway so then anyway so that's just now
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
they'll have the third option of
 
01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
destroying the firearm which now they're
 
01:11:40.729 --> 01:11:40.739 align:start position:0%
not required to do and I
 
01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
don't know they get a huge number of
 
01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
voluntarily surrender firearms and
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
testimony back in 1990 it was usually
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
about two or three a year but
 
01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
still they're keeping to it I assume I
 
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have I assume there's uh I
 
01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
assume that's probably continuing at a
 
01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
similar Pace or more because there's
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
more guns on the street now so there's
 
01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
probably like several dozen Firearms
 
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
just sitting in the warehouse that
 
01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
the they they don't want to sell they
 
01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
don't want to put in their own use and
 
01:12:09.709 --> 01:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
they may as well be able to destroy them
 
01:12:11.209 --> 01:12:11.219 align:start position:0%
especially if they're used you know some
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
particularly upsetting crime so
 
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
and um so finally just the last two
 
01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:18.780 align:start position:0%
lines in my uh written testimony is
 
01:12:20.689 --> 01:12:20.699 align:start position:0%
there are too many there were too many
 
01:12:23.149 --> 01:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
guns on the streets in 1998 in spite of
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
what uh some of the people who supported
 
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
that bill believed and there are even
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
more guns on Street than else I say
 
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
there's like still too many guns on the
 
01:12:32.810 --> 01:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
street and uh
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
so I think this bill would be a step to
 
01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
uh you know reducing the number of guns
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
on the street so I would urge you to uh
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
I know that's not necessarily A
 
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
universally popular position on the
 
01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
community on the committee but I think
 
01:12:47.090 --> 01:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
you know I I think we can get a majority
 
01:12:48.290 --> 01:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
of the committee in the full house
 
01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
behind this pretty simple idea so that's
 
01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
uh that's why I urge you to pass HP 191
 
01:12:57.070 --> 01:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Peru has a
 
01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:02.390 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Peru has a
question

01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
should add Municipal and County along
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
with the state that way you're making
 
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
sure you're grabbing everybody whether
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
it's a local police department or the
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
county sheriff
 
01:13:15.410 --> 01:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
that way they definitely in in that
 
01:13:17.450 --> 01:13:17.460 align:start position:0%
group that has to turn them into the
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
state for the auction oh yeah I would
 
01:13:22.010 --> 01:13:22.020 align:start position:0%
view that as a a uh I'd view that as a
 
01:13:23.930 --> 01:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
friendly Amendment amendment I see your
 
01:13:25.850 --> 01:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
schedule to Executive this afternoon but
 
01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
that's a simple simple Amendment so you
 
01:13:30.169 --> 01:13:30.179 align:start position:0%
could probably get that is an OLS or you
 
01:13:30.179 --> 01:13:31.370 align:start position:0%
could probably get that is an OLS or you
could

01:13:31.370 --> 01:13:31.380 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
put the bill off and execute it on some
 
01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
future dates since it's not to the best
 
01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:44.930 --> 01:13:44.940 align:start position:0%
representative Stone
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
taking my question are you aware that a
 
01:13:51.229 --> 01:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
lot of local agencies will utilize ffls
 
01:13:53.090 --> 01:13:53.100 align:start position:0%
to handle final disposition of firearms
 
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
was FFL would you explain a little bit
 
01:14:00.649 --> 01:14:00.659 align:start position:0%
more that would be a federally fire
 
01:14:03.709 --> 01:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
licensed dealer
 
01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
well sure I guess I'm aware of that and
 
01:14:08.930 --> 01:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
that was uh I read the whole bill file
 
01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
they often mentioned you can take it to
 
01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:13.140 align:start position:0%
a gun shop which I guess in FFL I mean
 
01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:14.460 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
01:14:16.490 --> 01:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
but then the state police also have the
 
01:14:18.290 --> 01:14:18.300 align:start position:0%
uh you know the state police have the
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
capability to also destroy guns they
 
01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
were doing in 1995 I'm pretty sure they
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
haven't forgotten how to do it um
 
01:14:26.330 --> 01:14:26.340 align:start position:0%
especially the state police's
 
01:14:27.890 --> 01:14:27.900 align:start position:0%
institution with a lot of institutional
 
01:14:29.630 --> 01:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
memory and also uh probably some of the
 
01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
officers who around back then are still
 
01:14:33.890 --> 01:14:33.900 align:start position:0%
serving now so I think I think if they
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
could do it uh 30 years ago as almost 30
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
years ago they can probably still do it
 
01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
now and I think that might be more might
 
01:14:42.649 --> 01:14:42.659 align:start position:0%
be more efficient in some cases and
 
01:14:44.930 --> 01:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
bringing in the uh the Firearms dealer
 
01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:48.430 align:start position:0%
bringing in the uh the Firearms dealer
thanks

01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:51.290 --> 01:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
01:14:55.130 --> 01:14:55.140 align:start position:0%
so to be clear it's just saying that you
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
know that this is possible it's just
 
01:14:58.910 --> 01:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
giving options for what to do with
 
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
voluntarily yeah so they can uh destroy
 
01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
these surrender Firearms themselves and
 
01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
they can also
 
01:15:07.850 --> 01:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
if they so choose have a voluntary you
 
01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
know surrender destroy or gun buyback
 
01:15:15.169 --> 01:15:15.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony this
 
01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:20.689 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony this
morning

01:15:20.689 --> 01:15:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:59.090 --> 01:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
I asked I tell this bill New Hampshire
 
01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
is in need of any funds as we see at
 
01:16:07.970 --> 01:16:07.980 align:start position:0%
White Farm Surplus sales as an FFL
 
01:16:10.189 --> 01:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
I have had people and families call both
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
local and State Police asking what to do
 
01:16:14.930 --> 01:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
with the state Firearms once somebody in
 
01:16:16.669 --> 01:16:16.679 align:start position:0%
the family has passed and they no longer
 
01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:19.140 align:start position:0%
want the firearms
 
01:16:20.990 --> 01:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
they have been told they can be turned
 
01:16:22.970 --> 01:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
into the state police who can dispose of
 
01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
them and it is not always told to them
 
01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
that they will be sold at auction or
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
used by the agency just that they will
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
take them
 
01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
I often end up with these firearms and
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
in some cases sell them for the families
 
01:16:41.090 --> 01:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
for money which is often needed by a
 
01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:42.110 align:start position:0%
for money which is often needed by a
family

01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
family
 
01:16:44.689 --> 01:16:44.699 align:start position:0%
who somebody might not have but have
 
01:16:48.649 --> 01:16:48.659 align:start position:0%
life insurance and costs are high and
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
the sale of those help that
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
as far as the surrender and Destroy
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
policy I object to that as it also can
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
be used as an end run to keep lawful
 
01:17:01.729 --> 01:17:01.739 align:start position:0%
Firearms to shrink and some of these
 
01:17:04.729 --> 01:17:04.739 align:start position:0%
Firearms may be high
 
01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
sought after collectible Firearms or
 
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
parts guns for older guns
 
01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
which if not kept by the agency should
 
01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
be sold to boost the general fund
 
01:17:19.729 --> 01:17:19.739 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire State Police
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
even sell their own replaced firearms
 
01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
and I have sold those
 
01:17:27.770 --> 01:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
as well myself
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
so if the state police are selling their
 
01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:30.830 align:start position:0%
so if the state police are selling their
own

01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
own
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
replaced firearms
 
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
I don't see an issue that they should
 
01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:38.390 align:start position:0%
I don't see an issue that they should
sell

01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:41.209 --> 01:17:41.219 align:start position:0%
anybody else's firearms
 
01:17:44.330 --> 01:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
and I think history if you look back
 
01:17:46.189 --> 01:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
over the years
 
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
that the disarming of the citizenry
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
can lead to bad governmental actions by
 
01:17:57.770 --> 01:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:02.209 --> 01:18:02.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:11.149 --> 01:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
good timer today
 
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
don't worry I'll be quick uh good
 
01:18:15.890 --> 01:18:15.900 align:start position:0%
morning uh Joe Hannon from Gunners of
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh we're in as you
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
probably already heard we are in
 
01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill and thank you
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
for the introduction before I appreciate
 
01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:24.770 align:start position:0%
for the introduction before I appreciate
that

01:18:24.770 --> 01:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:26.450 --> 01:18:26.460 align:start position:0%
um I do however disagree with the good
 
01:18:27.770 --> 01:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
gentleman from Durham uh Governor
 
01:18:29.209 --> 01:18:29.219 align:start position:0%
Shaheen made a good decision when she
 
01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
signed this into law
 
01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
um for first of all it's a very fiscally
 
01:18:35.450 --> 01:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
responsible thing to do to have a
 
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
something with value that the state
 
01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
could sell to buy firearms for other
 
01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
agencies to put back into the general
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
fund uh actually it all has to go to the
 
01:18:43.729 --> 01:18:43.739 align:start position:0%
general fund but that money can be used
 
01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
for any number of things in New
 
01:18:46.130 --> 01:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so if you care about anything
 
01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire whatever that is
 
01:18:49.149 --> 01:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
whatever is on your wish list of things
 
01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
that's just a few dollars less for every
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
firearm this destroyed and it's not like
 
01:18:55.370 --> 01:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
there's going to be more firearms on the
 
01:18:56.570 --> 01:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
street necessarily because if someone
 
01:18:58.130 --> 01:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
can't buy a used one at auction they're
 
01:19:00.890 --> 01:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
gonna probably buy one somewhere else
 
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
the gun dealers are going to keep making
 
01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
them if people want to buy one so I
 
01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
don't see that as a net uh effect what
 
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
you do see is a net you do see is a
 
01:19:11.810 --> 01:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
decrease in the maybe possibly more
 
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
affordable firearms for people who might
 
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
not be able to pay more money
 
01:19:17.870 --> 01:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
um anyone's free to buy a quote-unquote
 
01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
beautiful gun from any um you know from
 
01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
the state if they're allowed to possess
 
01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
firearms and if they so wish they can
 
01:19:25.610 --> 01:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
have it destroyed take it somewhere else
 
01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
and if that's their desire if that's the
 
01:19:30.649 --> 01:19:30.659 align:start position:0%
purpose of this they can do that
 
01:19:32.689 --> 01:19:32.699 align:start position:0%
um and and finally I'd like to say this
 
01:19:34.010 --> 01:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
makes about as much sense as book
 
01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
burning you know there's no reason to
 
01:19:38.330 --> 01:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
get rid of something that you might not
 
01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
agree with but someone else might be
 
01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:42.300 align:start position:0%
able to use or it has value and that's
 
01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
that's really all I said I'd be happy to
 
01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
01:19:55.010 --> 01:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:19:56.930 --> 01:19:56.940 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh representative
 
01:19:59.810 --> 01:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
Hannah my question is you know I mean if
 
01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
if I wanted to do that then why
 
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
shouldn't I have the option to do that
 
01:20:07.610 --> 01:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
no I mean if I if I wanted to
 
01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
voluntarily surrender it and have it
 
01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
destroyed then I don't know that's my
 
01:20:13.370 --> 01:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
choice I I know you may not like you
 
01:20:14.570 --> 01:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
know me
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
um just throwing something like that and
 
01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that that would be my
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
choice I'm just wondering why we would
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
restrict people people's options and
 
01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:29.450 --> 01:20:29.460 align:start position:0%
cut me off I have no emotional
 
01:20:31.490 --> 01:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
attachment to it so it doesn't it's not
 
01:20:33.050 --> 01:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
a matter of you know destroying this
 
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
beautiful gun as we heard it called it's
 
01:20:36.649 --> 01:20:36.659 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of like I said before a
 
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
value for the state if you want to have
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
it uh surrendered or destroyed you could
 
01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
do that any number of ways you don't
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
have to have the state to it and the
 
01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
state is losing the money and the and
 
01:20:47.450 --> 01:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
the value
 
01:20:51.290 --> 01:20:51.300 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're free to do that
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
um still no choice Dr Hannan yes if I if
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
I want to destroy one of my firearms how
 
01:20:58.729 --> 01:20:58.739 align:start position:0%
could I have that done uh actually
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
um offhand I believe I mean FFL can take
 
01:21:03.410 --> 01:21:03.420 align:start position:0%
it they can do whatever you want you can
 
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
say I want to you know cut in half
 
01:21:08.209 --> 01:21:08.219 align:start position:0%
whatever it takes uh I believe I'm not
 
01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
sure if the ATF does it you might have
 
01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
to contact them but you know it's not
 
01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
against a law to break your own property
 
01:21:16.669 --> 01:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
you know you could break your own as
 
01:21:18.050 --> 01:21:18.060 align:start position:0%
long as you don't make it an illegal
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
firearm when you break you have certain
 
01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
things could be a problem so if you have
 
01:21:23.090 --> 01:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
a rifle and you break the back cut the
 
01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
barrel and it's too short now you're a
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
felon uh for doing that even if it's a
 
01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
functional fi even if it's
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
non-functional if you break the trigger
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
and then cut the barrel short you've
 
01:21:33.290 --> 01:21:33.300 align:start position:0%
done it so there are correct ways to do
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
it anyone can do it if it's done
 
01:21:36.290 --> 01:21:36.300 align:start position:0%
correctly but you could do have a you
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
know a gunsmith anyone can do it for you
 
01:21:41.570 --> 01:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
and is to your knowledge is there a
 
01:21:43.250 --> 01:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
shortage of gunsmiths in New Hampshire
 
01:21:45.050 --> 01:21:45.060 align:start position:0%
uh not there isn't a shortage in this
 
01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:45.850 align:start position:0%
uh not there isn't a shortage in this
room

01:21:45.850 --> 01:21:45.860 align:start position:0%
room
 
01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:46.970 align:start position:0%
room
[Music]

01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:46.980 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
are you aware that there are are private
 
01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
companies that will uh destroy Firearms
 
01:21:59.209 --> 01:21:59.219 align:start position:0%
free of charge uh for law enforcement
 
01:21:59.219 --> 01:22:00.709 align:start position:0%
free of charge uh for law enforcement
agencies

01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:22:04.370 --> 01:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
great I didn't I I'm not surprised I
 
01:22:06.050 --> 01:22:06.060 align:start position:0%
don't know them personally
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
but do you think the use of those uh
 
01:22:11.149 --> 01:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
should be an option for our own State
 
01:22:11.159 --> 01:22:12.169 align:start position:0%
should be an option for our own State
Police

01:22:12.169 --> 01:22:12.179 align:start position:0%
Police
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
no and for all the reasons I just I said
 
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get to the the reason for
 
01:22:21.169 --> 01:22:21.179 align:start position:0%
that so if if they can be destroyed at
 
01:22:23.689 --> 01:22:23.699 align:start position:0%
at no cost and that's the wish of the
 
01:22:26.810 --> 01:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
property owner what what's the issue
 
01:22:28.490 --> 01:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
why involve the state the property owner
 
01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
can have it destroyed
 
01:22:32.330 --> 01:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
if they like uh I mean I don't
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
understand why the state has to get
 
01:22:39.530 --> 01:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah
 
01:22:43.370 --> 01:22:43.380 align:start position:0%
I I would say
 
01:22:46.149 --> 01:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
um this this state actually
 
01:22:48.770 --> 01:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
already seems to be involved in the
 
01:22:51.770 --> 01:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
disposal of firearms So currently they
 
01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
are accepting uh Firearms they're just
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
simply we've just simply precluded the
 
01:22:58.970 --> 01:22:58.980 align:start position:0%
option of destroying them
 
01:23:02.689 --> 01:23:02.699 align:start position:0%
so we already have the cost of accepting
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
those Firearms figuring out what to do
 
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
with them running auctions and sales and
 
01:23:10.850 --> 01:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
things things like that it seems like
 
01:23:13.550 --> 01:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
adding one more option for the property
 
01:23:16.669 --> 01:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
owner to just simply check a box and
 
01:23:19.850 --> 01:23:19.860 align:start position:0%
State Police pack these things off in a
 
01:23:22.490 --> 01:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
crate once a month and to this company
 
01:23:24.590 --> 01:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
that grinds them up or whatever they do
 
01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
with them it doesn't seem to be
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
and an undue burden given the fact that
 
01:23:32.410 --> 01:23:32.420 align:start position:0%
the state police already seemed to be
 
01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
spending money time and resources
 
01:23:40.669 --> 01:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
would you agree I would not agree thank
 
01:23:45.290 --> 01:23:45.300 align:start position:0%
you and and I would say if they they
 
01:23:46.490 --> 01:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
don't want to spend the money on an
 
01:23:48.649 --> 01:23:48.659 align:start position:0%
auction and all that other stuff they're
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
more than welcome to deliver them to me
 
01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
I'll give them my address if it's at no
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
cost and I'd be happy to take them off
 
01:23:56.810 --> 01:23:56.820 align:start position:0%
their hands and out of circulation
 
01:23:59.090 --> 01:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
I know sorry after the good
 
01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:01.250 align:start position:0%
I know sorry after the good
representative

01:24:01.250 --> 01:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:24:04.910 --> 01:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
01:24:06.010 --> 01:24:06.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:17.330 --> 01:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
good morning committee my name is Mary
 
01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
penny I'm the lieutenant Lieutenant with
 
01:24:20.570 --> 01:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire State Police I've been
 
01:24:22.490 --> 01:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
with him for about 19 years now a little
 
01:24:24.110 --> 01:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
bit over
 
01:24:27.050 --> 01:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
um just here for not to weigh on one
 
01:24:28.610 --> 01:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
side or another just what it would take
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
with us because it will be something we
 
01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
have to reintroduce into our
 
01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
organization in order to have this
 
01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
process go forward and how we would do
 
01:24:38.270 --> 01:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
it and make motions to the court because
 
01:24:40.130 --> 01:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
we don't just destroy anybody's Firearms
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
without the court giving us that kind of
 
01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
permission to do it so we would it is
 
01:24:45.890 --> 01:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
going to be a little bit more intense on
 
01:24:47.570 --> 01:24:47.580 align:start position:0%
our side in order to do more reports
 
01:24:51.050 --> 01:24:51.060 align:start position:0%
more motions in order to destroy them of
 
01:24:52.669 --> 01:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
course we have a concern that if anybody
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
walks in with a firearm wants it sold
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
from the FFL or private sale to a
 
01:24:57.950 --> 01:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
private sale you don't know who really
 
01:25:00.290 --> 01:25:00.300 align:start position:0%
is the actual owner of that firearm and
 
01:25:03.169 --> 01:25:03.179 align:start position:0%
was that firearm used in a crime at some
 
01:25:05.630 --> 01:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
point and now we're destroying it so
 
01:25:08.330 --> 01:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
just kind of things that we wanted to
 
01:25:10.729 --> 01:25:10.739 align:start position:0%
bring to your attention who that primary
 
01:25:12.169 --> 01:25:12.179 align:start position:0%
owner is
 
01:25:14.090 --> 01:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
um is it destroyed or gone to auction
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
right now most of them are destroyed
 
01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
that were used in a crime that we have
 
01:25:22.030 --> 01:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
safe keeping on it also with this
 
01:25:24.350 --> 01:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
statue that came forward unlike the
 
01:25:25.850 --> 01:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
others where we return or destroy
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
property it doesn't relieve the state of
 
01:25:29.630 --> 01:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
any liability if it is destroyed and
 
01:25:31.790 --> 01:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
someone comes forward later to say that
 
01:25:33.530 --> 01:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
was my property not theirs to give you
 
01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
because we we can run into that without
 
01:25:40.250 --> 01:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:42.890 --> 01:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
it's the the law that was signed that's
 
01:25:45.770 --> 01:25:45.780 align:start position:0%
currently the law have has your agency
 
01:25:48.290 --> 01:25:48.300 align:start position:0%
had a had a problem with like having so
 
01:25:49.490 --> 01:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
many Firearms you didn't know what to do
 
01:25:50.689 --> 01:25:50.699 align:start position:0%
with them and wishing you could destroy
 
01:25:50.699 --> 01:25:52.010 align:start position:0%
with them and wishing you could destroy
them

01:25:52.010 --> 01:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:25:53.330 --> 01:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
um we have not had a problem with so
 
01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:54.050 align:start position:0%
um we have not had a problem with so
many

01:25:54.050 --> 01:25:54.060 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:25:55.669 --> 01:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
um our division armor is in charge of
 
01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
destroying those Firearms so he is the
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
one that's or his designee of who he
 
01:26:03.649 --> 01:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
chooses to do that when he has that time
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
would the bill as written where it it
 
01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
simply says it goes on or it just seems
 
01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
to give the option to do that it does
 
01:26:17.450 --> 01:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement in this bill for
 
01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
them to do that
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
and even if a family wanted to have guns
 
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
destroyed I'm not sure what the
 
01:26:25.729 --> 01:26:25.739 align:start position:0%
mechanism would be to try and get the
 
01:26:27.709 --> 01:26:27.719 align:start position:0%
state to do that but the law does not
 
01:26:29.689 --> 01:26:29.699 align:start position:0%
just gives an option so would that
 
01:26:32.990 --> 01:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
affect your the way you did you uh as
 
01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
you described
 
01:26:36.649 --> 01:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
I'm not really understanding your
 
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
question the law itself does not direct
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
the state police to destroy voluntary
 
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
Firearms it only says that that is an
 
01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:46.910 align:start position:0%
Firearms it only says that that is an
option

01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
option
 
01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
even if they came from a voluntary sale
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
and I don't I don't know if there's
 
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
another law that applies to that but
 
01:26:54.890 --> 01:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
right now I don't see that it would
 
01:26:57.290 --> 01:26:57.300 align:start position:0%
it's my belief that
 
01:27:00.050 --> 01:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
would that cause you to additional work
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
if you just had that option to destroy
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
them it will provide some additional
 
01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
work because we have to write a report
 
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
on everything that comes in along with
 
01:27:09.890 --> 01:27:09.900 align:start position:0%
get that motion from the court in order
 
01:27:13.790 --> 01:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up I I don't I don't see in this
 
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
law that the court has to be involved in
 
01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
that you're saying every time that the
 
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
state police
 
01:27:23.689 --> 01:27:23.699 align:start position:0%
destroy a firearm they need a court
 
01:27:25.550 --> 01:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
order to do it for every single weapon
 
01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:35.209 --> 01:27:35.219 align:start position:0%
keep your testimony thank you could you
 
01:27:37.790 --> 01:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
um maybe you already did leave your
 
01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
information so that we have any more
 
01:27:40.970 --> 01:27:40.980 align:start position:0%
questions on this we could reach out to
 
01:27:44.570 --> 01:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:46.370 --> 01:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
anyone else here wishing to testify on
 
01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
this bill has not done so
 
01:27:50.270 --> 01:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none I hereby close public
 
01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:52.370 align:start position:0%
seeing none I hereby close public
hearing

01:27:52.370 --> 01:27:52.380 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
and the next one starts right now
 
01:46:18.410 --> 01:46:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:20.330 --> 01:46:20.340 align:start position:0%
this time I'm open to public hearing on
 
01:46:23.450 --> 01:46:23.460 align:start position:0%
House Bill 305 and and recognize
 
01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:25.080 align:start position:0%

01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:26.990 align:start position:0%
representative minion to introduce his
bill

01:46:26.990 --> 01:46:27.000 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair members of the
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
committee I'm here to introduce HB 305
 
01:46:35.209 --> 01:46:35.219 align:start position:0%
I represent Hillsboro One Pelham uh so
 
01:46:37.010 --> 01:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
last year I watched the testimonies of
 
01:46:39.410 --> 01:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
last sessions uh House Bill 1178 there
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
was a lot of talk about this this week I
 
01:46:43.490 --> 01:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
know you guys probably seeing me uh and
 
01:46:44.990 --> 01:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
the concerns of granite Staters about
 
01:46:46.609 --> 01:46:46.619 align:start position:0%
the language of the amendment of to the
 
01:46:50.930 --> 01:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
bill uh they responded to me with the
 
01:46:51.910 --> 01:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
current language
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
rsa159 E2 reads nothing in this chapter
 
01:46:57.470 --> 01:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
shall prevent a state county or local
 
01:46:59.570 --> 01:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
official from cooperating or rendering
 
01:47:02.270 --> 01:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
Aid or assistance to Federal officials
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
with any in any circumstance where there
 
01:47:06.590 --> 01:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
is reasonable suspicion to believe that
 
01:47:08.270 --> 01:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
a person who is a subject of an
 
01:47:10.490 --> 01:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
investigation for violation of federal
 
01:47:13.850 --> 01:47:13.860 align:start position:0%
Arms firearms laws covered by RSA 159 E2
 
01:47:17.570 --> 01:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
has also committed is committing or is
 
01:47:20.030 --> 01:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
about to commit a violation of New
 
01:47:22.850 --> 01:47:22.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law or a violation of a
 
01:47:24.770 --> 01:47:24.780 align:start position:0%
federal law regulation order or practice
 
01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:27.719 align:start position:0%
not covered by this section so
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
it says a violation of a New Hampshire
 
01:47:32.510 --> 01:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
law which is extremely broad but what is
 
01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
worse is a violation of federal law
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
regulation or order that nullifies the
 
01:47:40.669 --> 01:47:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:43.970 --> 01:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
if you've ever seen the at crime a day
 
01:47:46.729 --> 01:47:46.739 align:start position:0%
Twitter account you can see where this
 
01:47:49.729 --> 01:47:49.739 align:start position:0%
exception is very wide we create we
 
01:47:51.590 --> 01:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
commit however many felonies a day is
 
01:47:54.709 --> 01:47:54.719 align:start position:0%
the joke right so we're constantly in
 
01:47:57.050 --> 01:47:57.060 align:start position:0%
violation of some federal law if you dig
 
01:47:58.370 --> 01:47:58.380 align:start position:0%
deep enough
 
01:48:00.709 --> 01:48:00.719 align:start position:0%
so my language here simply scales back
 
01:48:01.970 --> 01:48:01.980 align:start position:0%
the exception to what I believe the
 
01:48:03.649 --> 01:48:03.659 align:start position:0%
original intent to be
 
01:48:05.629 --> 01:48:05.639 align:start position:0%
to prevent violent criminals from using
 
01:48:08.209 --> 01:48:08.219 align:start position:0%
the non-cooperation language of 1150 uh
 
01:48:10.910 --> 01:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
one sorry 159e as a shield for New
 
01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law enforcement with that I'll
 
01:48:14.930 --> 01:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
take any questions it's it's real it all
 
01:48:16.370 --> 01:48:16.380 align:start position:0%
does is strike one line and make it
 
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:29.750 --> 01:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:31.910 --> 01:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
what I'm what I'm trying to get at is
 
01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
what are you trying to accomplish here
 
01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:36.719 align:start position:0%
um what's and what what problems do you
 
01:48:38.930 --> 01:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
think that this bill will solve so the
 
01:48:41.090 --> 01:48:41.100 align:start position:0%
existing law right now has a massive
 
01:48:43.790 --> 01:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
loophole that it basically nullifies the
 
01:48:45.410 --> 01:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
entire purpose of the uh what we
 
01:48:49.010 --> 01:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
consider the gun sanctuary Bill uh so if
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
an individual is committing any crime
 
01:48:53.450 --> 01:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
Under the Sun whatsoever in New
 
01:48:55.729 --> 01:48:55.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or federal which is if you dig
 
01:48:57.169 --> 01:48:57.179 align:start position:0%
deep enough you're committing a crime
 
01:48:58.669 --> 01:48:58.679 align:start position:0%
right now by breathing the wrong amount
 
01:49:00.590 --> 01:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
of air or whatever it may be
 
01:49:03.530 --> 01:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
this scales that back to make it so it's
 
01:49:05.570 --> 01:49:05.580 align:start position:0%
very clear it has to be a class a felony
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
that the person is committing for our
 
01:49:09.229 --> 01:49:09.239 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to cooperate with the
 
01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
feds to enforce unconstitutional gun
 
01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:12.770 align:start position:0%
feds to enforce unconstitutional gun
laws

01:49:12.770 --> 01:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
laws
 
01:49:12.780 --> 01:49:15.169 align:start position:0%
laws
follow-up

01:49:15.169 --> 01:49:15.179 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:49:15.179 --> 01:49:16.669 align:start position:0%
follow-up
and

01:49:16.669 --> 01:49:16.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that this particular
 
01:49:23.090 --> 01:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
law uh applies uh to Firearms correct
 
01:49:25.609 --> 01:49:25.619 align:start position:0%
and second amendment issues
 
01:49:28.850 --> 01:49:28.860 align:start position:0%
so off the top of my head
 
01:49:30.790 --> 01:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
how many
 
01:49:33.470 --> 01:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
Firearms related violations in New
 
01:49:36.129 --> 01:49:36.139 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are class A felonies
 
01:49:38.330 --> 01:49:38.340 align:start position:0%
can you give me a couple of examples
 
01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
well it would be specific like like
 
01:49:42.830 --> 01:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
they're not necessarily Firearms related
 
01:49:44.149 --> 01:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
the way that the law is written right
 
01:49:47.090 --> 01:49:47.100 align:start position:0%
now is it it says that they can
 
01:49:49.370 --> 01:49:49.380 align:start position:0%
cooperate if any other violation is
 
01:49:51.050 --> 01:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
occurring the reason this amendment was
 
01:49:53.570 --> 01:49:53.580 align:start position:0%
originally added to the 1178 bill was
 
01:49:55.310 --> 01:49:55.320 align:start position:0%
because from my understanding is the
 
01:49:56.930 --> 01:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
attorney general wouldn't sign off on it
 
01:49:59.090 --> 01:49:59.100 align:start position:0%
because what the way the language was
 
01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
originally written is sounded like if an
 
01:50:01.970 --> 01:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
individual was committing a federal
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
firearms law violation our law
 
01:50:06.410 --> 01:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement were not allowed to
 
01:50:09.410 --> 01:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
cooperate with the feds because we had a
 
01:50:11.930 --> 01:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
the law the way the law was written it
 
01:50:13.609 --> 01:50:13.619 align:start position:0%
basically shielded the criminal so if
 
01:50:16.370 --> 01:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
they had like an uh a machine gun and
 
01:50:19.070 --> 01:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
we're committing human trafficking we
 
01:50:20.750 --> 01:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't help because they had the
 
01:50:22.669 --> 01:50:22.679 align:start position:0%
machine gun and we're not allowed to go
 
01:50:24.890 --> 01:50:24.900 align:start position:0%
after anybody who's violating or who
 
01:50:27.950 --> 01:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
isn't violating a New Hampshire gun law
 
01:50:30.370 --> 01:50:30.380 align:start position:0%
follow-up please
 
01:50:35.149 --> 01:50:35.159 align:start position:0%
would uh would your change preclude New
 
01:50:37.550 --> 01:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire then from assisting a Federal
 
01:50:40.729 --> 01:50:40.739 align:start position:0%
Officer with a kidnapping that crosses
 
01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
over uh state lines no I do not believe
 
01:50:46.729 --> 01:50:46.739 align:start position:0%
so I I'm almost certain that they so I'd
 
01:50:47.930 --> 01:50:47.940 align:start position:0%
have to go back and look at the RSA
 
01:50:49.370 --> 01:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
specifically defining all the class A
 
01:50:51.950 --> 01:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
felonies as defined by New Hampshire RSA
 
01:50:54.530 --> 01:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
and uh I believe trafficking and or
 
01:50:56.510 --> 01:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
kidnapping is on those
 
01:50:58.310 --> 01:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
but other federal crimes that are
 
01:51:01.250 --> 01:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
non-firearms related there would be a
 
01:51:03.530 --> 01:51:03.540 align:start position:0%
preclusion from also assisting with
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
those I stripped the feds because the
 
01:51:07.090 --> 01:51:07.100 align:start position:0%
feds uh tend to
 
01:51:11.229 --> 01:51:11.239 align:start position:0%
move around like definitions of of
 
01:51:14.209 --> 01:51:14.219 align:start position:0%
penalties and and uh
 
01:51:16.850 --> 01:51:16.860 align:start position:0%
crime severity thank you I didn't want
 
01:51:20.330 --> 01:51:20.340 align:start position:0%
to be subject to their whims
 
01:51:22.250 --> 01:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
could you give the committee an example
 
01:51:24.590 --> 01:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
of a case or not a real case even a
 
01:51:26.810 --> 01:51:26.820 align:start position:0%
hypothetical case where you think this
 
01:51:29.149 --> 01:51:29.159 align:start position:0%
law should apply give us a scenario for
 
01:51:31.070 --> 01:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
the folks so we can actually understand
 
01:51:33.410 --> 01:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
what this law should accomplish
 
01:51:35.209 --> 01:51:35.219 align:start position:0%
so the the existing law that's on the
 
01:51:37.850 --> 01:51:37.860 align:start position:0%
books um as a hypothetical let's say
 
01:51:40.450 --> 01:51:40.460 align:start position:0%
that I I had a suppressor like a
 
01:51:42.169 --> 01:51:42.179 align:start position:0%
self-manufactured a suppressor because
 
01:51:43.729 --> 01:51:43.739 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm trying to protect my own hearing
 
01:51:45.109 --> 01:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
and I didn't go through the process of
 
01:51:47.570 --> 01:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
getting a tax stamp right now if I had a
 
01:51:50.149 --> 01:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
suppressor but was also technically a
 
01:51:51.709 --> 01:51:51.719 align:start position:0%
growing up marijuana plant or something
 
01:51:53.149 --> 01:51:53.159 align:start position:0%
along those lines or not a marijuana
 
01:51:55.250 --> 01:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
plant but it had marijuana without you
 
01:51:56.750 --> 01:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
know so it's not a criminal violation
 
01:51:59.629 --> 01:51:59.639 align:start position:0%
here uh then
 
01:52:01.370 --> 01:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
the fact that I had marijuana and that's
 
01:52:03.410 --> 01:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
a violation of a federal crime or
 
01:52:06.169 --> 01:52:06.179 align:start position:0%
federal law our local law enforcement
 
01:52:08.689 --> 01:52:08.699 align:start position:0%
could help the ATF in enforcing that
 
01:52:10.729 --> 01:52:10.739 align:start position:0%
that suppress the tax stamp violation
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
that I did committed right now the law
 
01:52:14.810 --> 01:52:14.820 align:start position:0%
makes it now so just because I have
 
01:52:16.910 --> 01:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
marijuana that's not good enough excuse
 
01:52:18.709 --> 01:52:18.719 align:start position:0%
to bring in our state and local law
 
01:52:20.450 --> 01:52:20.460 align:start position:0%
enforcement to help the ATF enforce that
 
01:52:22.370 --> 01:52:22.380 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional law
 
01:52:23.930 --> 01:52:23.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:52:28.310 --> 01:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:29.990 --> 01:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for the
 
01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
question very long taking my question
 
01:52:35.330 --> 01:52:35.340 align:start position:0%
um I believe I've heard you say a couple
 
01:52:38.990 --> 01:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
of times that that this law prevents
 
01:52:41.229 --> 01:52:41.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:52:45.189 --> 01:52:45.199 align:start position:0%
police to assist the feds in an
 
01:52:48.590 --> 01:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional gun law and I'm curious
 
01:52:51.310 --> 01:52:51.320 align:start position:0%
if you can give me an example of exactly
 
01:52:55.209 --> 01:52:55.219 align:start position:0%
which gun laws that have not been
 
01:52:57.709 --> 01:52:57.719 align:start position:0%
deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme
 
01:52:59.570 --> 01:52:59.580 align:start position:0%
Court which ones that are currently
 
01:53:02.930 --> 01:53:02.940 align:start position:0%
enforced how how can you say that they
 
01:53:05.330 --> 01:53:05.340 align:start position:0%
are unconstitutional to the Federal
 
01:53:07.010 --> 01:53:07.020 align:start position:0%
Constitution right the bill doesn't
 
01:53:08.689 --> 01:53:08.699 align:start position:0%
specifically say I'm using my own
 
01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
opinion of these laws shall not infringe
 
01:53:12.290 --> 01:53:12.300 align:start position:0%
is quite straightforward and I think
 
01:53:13.790 --> 01:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
anything that infringes is
 
01:53:16.250 --> 01:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional by my definition
 
01:53:19.729 --> 01:53:19.739 align:start position:0%
okay so it's just your opinion yes those
 
01:53:21.890 --> 01:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
you're not saying that the federal laws
 
01:53:24.169 --> 01:53:24.179 align:start position:0%
that have not been overturned by the
 
01:53:26.270 --> 01:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
that's correct I apologize for the for
 
01:53:30.169 --> 01:53:30.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:35.629 --> 01:53:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:44.870 --> 01:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:47.930 --> 01:53:47.940 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much um Mr chair I can
 
01:53:49.550 --> 01:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
you be resident Timothy Horrigan I
 
01:53:51.770 --> 01:53:51.780 align:start position:0%
continue to represent uh Stratford
 
01:53:53.629 --> 01:53:53.639 align:start position:0%
County District 10 which is the towns of
 
01:53:53.639 --> 01:53:54.590 align:start position:0%
County District 10 which is the towns of
Durham

01:53:54.590 --> 01:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
Durham
 
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
um and I hope our colleague Revenant
 
01:54:00.530 --> 01:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
selig gets well soon she's watching on
 
01:54:02.090 --> 01:54:02.100 align:start position:0%
YouTube but at least she was watching
 
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
the previous hearing on YouTube so it
 
01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:05.810 align:start position:0%
the previous hearing on YouTube so it
um

01:54:05.810 --> 01:54:05.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
and I was glad the member refreshed my
 
01:54:10.609 --> 01:54:10.619 align:start position:0%
memory that it was HP 1178 because I was
 
01:54:12.770 --> 01:54:12.780 align:start position:0%
which I thought that's what it was what
 
01:54:14.270 --> 01:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
this is about now he's going nuts
 
01:54:17.209 --> 01:54:17.219 align:start position:0%
because these this RSA 159e which is
 
01:54:19.370 --> 01:54:19.380 align:start position:0%
what was established by uh
 
01:54:23.870 --> 01:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
HB 1178 is not listed in the uh Bill uh
 
01:54:26.570 --> 01:54:26.580 align:start position:0%
not yet listed in the build database so
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's just thought I'd
 
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned and I'm sure there's other
 
01:54:32.450 --> 01:54:32.460 align:start position:0%
rsas we have that problem with so I
 
01:54:35.209 --> 01:54:35.219 align:start position:0%
think the uh sponsor of this bill I
 
01:54:36.830 --> 01:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
think pointed out the whole premise
 
01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
behind HP 1178 was uh irrational like um
 
01:54:44.149 --> 01:54:44.159 align:start position:0%
you know there's you know just about any
 
01:54:46.129 --> 01:54:46.139 align:start position:0%
federal offense if the person owns a
 
01:54:47.810 --> 01:54:47.820 align:start position:0%
firearm can become
 
01:54:49.790 --> 01:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
can become at least in part of firearm
 
01:54:52.189 --> 01:54:52.199 align:start position:0%
offense and um I personally don't think
 
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
01:54:55.310 --> 01:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's anything wrong
 
01:54:56.930 --> 01:54:56.940 align:start position:0%
with that I don't really know why guns
 
01:54:58.729 --> 01:54:58.739 align:start position:0%
should be treated separately from any
 
01:55:01.370 --> 01:55:01.380 align:start position:0%
other dangerous thing and certainly um
 
01:55:05.090 --> 01:55:05.100 align:start position:0%
HB 11 78 has created a lot of uh
 
01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
irrational situations like for example
 
01:55:09.950 --> 01:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
uh here in my community we have a new
 
01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
we have a new middle school that has a
 
01:55:14.810 --> 01:55:14.820 align:start position:0%
lot of security precautions whether
 
01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:15.950 align:start position:0%
lot of security precautions whether
somebody

01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh somebody gets through the security
 
01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
cautions with a gun
 
01:55:21.649 --> 01:55:21.659 align:start position:0%
um they're
 
01:55:23.450 --> 01:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
school's not quite sure whether what
 
01:55:24.830 --> 01:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
they can do aside from putting the
 
01:55:26.689 --> 01:55:26.699 align:start position:0%
lockdown whereas uh
 
01:55:28.669 --> 01:55:28.679 align:start position:0%
see if the person came in with a suicide
 
01:55:30.830 --> 01:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
vest and a bomb you know I guess that's
 
01:55:32.450 --> 01:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
not covered by the Second Amendment if
 
01:55:34.250 --> 01:55:34.260 align:start position:0%
you're waving a chainsaw around that's
 
01:55:35.570 --> 01:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
obviously not covered by his second
 
01:55:38.330 --> 01:55:38.340 align:start position:0%
amendment or if you're a
 
01:55:40.310 --> 01:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
if you barge into the ladies room that's
 
01:55:41.689 --> 01:55:41.699 align:start position:0%
not covered by the Second Amendment
 
01:55:43.010 --> 01:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
unless of course you're wearing a gun
 
01:55:45.410 --> 01:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
while you do it there's lots of uh
 
01:55:47.870 --> 01:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
yes there's lots of situations so I'm
 
01:55:51.229 --> 01:55:51.239 align:start position:0%
not sure you know so like uh where they
 
01:55:52.129 --> 01:55:52.139 align:start position:0%
at least feel like they're they're
 
01:55:53.810 --> 01:55:53.820 align:start position:0%
hampered in the ability to deal with
 
01:55:55.250 --> 01:55:55.260 align:start position:0%
certain types of threats that they might
 
01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
reasonably expect to uh expect to have
 
01:55:59.629 --> 01:55:59.639 align:start position:0%
and certainly it makes it a lot harder
 
01:56:01.970 --> 01:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
to take preventive action um
 
01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
and there's a myriad of things uh Myriad
 
01:56:07.669 --> 01:56:07.679 align:start position:0%
things like that and also uh
 
01:56:09.890 --> 01:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
presidential executive orders
 
01:56:12.350 --> 01:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
um I mean I'm not a big fan of them but
 
01:56:14.810 --> 01:56:14.820 align:start position:0%
they are necessary sometime and uh the
 
01:56:16.189 --> 01:56:16.199 align:start position:0%
current president is not the only one
 
01:56:19.010 --> 01:56:19.020 align:start position:0%
who's issued executive orders uh
 
01:56:21.649 --> 01:56:21.659 align:start position:0%
governing uh the keeping or bearing of
 
01:56:24.050 --> 01:56:24.060 align:start position:0%
arms so the previous one did too he put
 
01:56:26.149 --> 01:56:26.159 align:start position:0%
on the executive order after a massacre
 
01:56:29.390 --> 01:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
in Las Vegas Banning bump stocks and uh
 
01:56:31.370 --> 01:56:31.380 align:start position:0%
the people who are so worried about the
 
01:56:32.810 --> 01:56:32.820 align:start position:0%
current president's executive orders
 
01:56:34.490 --> 01:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
were not worried about that presidency
 
01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
exact orders and I understand that's how
 
01:56:39.890 --> 01:56:39.900 align:start position:0%
it is when it's your your guy just like
 
01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
you know I voted for the current
 
01:56:43.669 --> 01:56:43.679 align:start position:0%
president so I'm inclined to cut a more
 
01:56:45.229 --> 01:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
slack than it was a president I hadn't
 
01:56:48.649 --> 01:56:48.659 align:start position:0%
voted for so that's fair enough so um
 
01:56:51.050 --> 01:56:51.060 align:start position:0%
I just sort of so I think uh you know I
 
01:56:53.570 --> 01:56:53.580 align:start position:0%
think they've I think I think uh it's
 
01:56:56.149 --> 01:56:56.159 align:start position:0%
monsters Phil has indeed
 
01:56:59.149 --> 01:56:59.159 align:start position:0%
uh seen an illogical uh
 
01:57:02.270 --> 01:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
in a logical element of the uh of the
 
01:57:03.590 --> 01:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
bill that we passed last year and I
 
01:57:05.450 --> 01:57:05.460 align:start position:0%
think the best solution uh those would
 
01:57:06.890 --> 01:57:06.900 align:start position:0%
be a Germain amendment to this bill
 
01:57:08.629 --> 01:57:08.639 align:start position:0%
there is another bill that just uh
 
01:57:11.810 --> 01:57:11.820 align:start position:0%
eliminates the whole eliminates the uh
 
01:57:14.570 --> 01:57:14.580 align:start position:0%
eliminates the whole whole the whole HP
 
01:57:18.649 --> 01:57:18.659 align:start position:0%
1178 RSA 159e so I think that's uh
 
01:57:20.689 --> 01:57:20.699 align:start position:0%
that's probably the better way to go
 
01:57:23.089 --> 01:57:23.099 align:start position:0%
rather than trying to fix in this bill
 
01:57:25.550 --> 01:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
one last thing we have
 
01:57:27.050 --> 01:57:27.060 align:start position:0%
we already have a big problem in the
 
01:57:28.970 --> 01:57:28.980 align:start position:0%
courts system and I serve on the
 
01:57:31.310 --> 01:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee so I'm made aware of
 
01:57:32.810 --> 01:57:32.820 align:start position:0%
this on occasion so we have a problem
 
01:57:34.930 --> 01:57:34.940 align:start position:0%
with overcharging uh
 
01:57:37.250 --> 01:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
overcharging defendants so this will
 
01:57:39.169 --> 01:57:39.179 align:start position:0%
encourage the police if they're
 
01:57:41.149 --> 01:57:41.159 align:start position:0%
investigating something and uh they
 
01:57:42.709 --> 01:57:42.719 align:start position:0%
think the person is a firearm and
 
01:57:44.689 --> 01:57:44.699 align:start position:0%
probably just about anybody might have a
 
01:57:46.370 --> 01:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
firearm they'll start charging people
 
01:57:48.589 --> 01:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
right off the bat with class A felonies
 
01:57:52.129 --> 01:57:52.139 align:start position:0%
even if they don't think that's what an
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate charge so we already have
 
01:57:55.490 --> 01:57:55.500 align:start position:0%
enough problem with overcharging people
 
01:57:56.930 --> 01:57:56.940 align:start position:0%
and this is just going to encourage our
 
01:57:58.850 --> 01:57:58.860 align:start position:0%
police forces to uh
 
01:58:00.770 --> 01:58:00.780 align:start position:0%
maybe even
 
01:58:03.290 --> 01:58:03.300 align:start position:0%
charge everyone who's doing something
 
01:58:03.300 --> 01:58:04.669 align:start position:0%
charge everyone who's doing something
suspicious

01:58:04.669 --> 01:58:04.679 align:start position:0%
suspicious
 
01:58:07.490 --> 01:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
that he might be going to trial with a
 
01:58:09.470 --> 01:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
class a felony just so they can continue
 
01:58:11.450 --> 01:58:11.460 align:start position:0%
to work with the federal officials and
 
01:58:14.450 --> 01:58:14.460 align:start position:0%
it's um certainly not uh
 
01:58:16.850 --> 01:58:16.860 align:start position:0%
and as I said to a certainly illogical
 
01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
to single out Firearms laws you know
 
01:58:19.970 --> 01:58:19.980 align:start position:0%
they're no different than like anything
 
01:58:21.890 --> 01:58:21.900 align:start position:0%
else that's dangerous in our society and
 
01:58:23.750 --> 01:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
they should be uh treated the same way
 
01:58:25.310 --> 01:58:25.320 align:start position:0%
rather than be given this sort of
 
01:58:28.430 --> 01:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
special status we give them so I
 
01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:29.750 align:start position:0%
special status we give them so I
um

01:58:29.750 --> 01:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:31.669 --> 01:58:31.679 align:start position:0%
so I think I think I probably urge you
 
01:58:33.410 --> 01:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
probably your best course of action is
 
01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
probably to retain this bill and then in
 
01:58:37.629 --> 01:58:37.639 align:start position:0%
case the HB 78 the
 
01:58:41.330 --> 01:58:41.340 align:start position:0%
hb15 which repeals this whole law
 
01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
passes and he can or fails you can use
 
01:58:45.890 --> 01:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
that to as a vehicle for further uh
 
01:58:47.750 --> 01:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
further action in that area but I don't
 
01:58:49.790 --> 01:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
see what's nothing good really can be
 
01:58:51.229 --> 01:58:51.239 align:start position:0%
accomplished just by this one change
 
01:58:53.149 --> 01:58:53.159 align:start position:0%
even though it's seems like a simple
 
01:58:55.490 --> 01:58:55.500 align:start position:0%
change so
 
01:58:57.290 --> 01:58:57.300 align:start position:0%
so thanks that's and that's what I had
 
01:58:58.850 --> 01:58:58.860 align:start position:0%
to say about it and I I guess I'd be
 
01:59:01.510 --> 01:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions although
 
01:59:04.669 --> 01:59:04.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thanks
 
01:59:06.770 --> 01:59:06.780 align:start position:0%
I apologize for any two partisan but I
 
01:59:08.390 --> 01:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
just felt I had to meet the point thanks
 
01:59:11.629 --> 01:59:11.639 align:start position:0%
all right thanks no worries
 
01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
um anyone else wishing to testifying
 
01:59:14.990 --> 01:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
this bill sure
 
01:59:18.530 --> 01:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:20.270 --> 01:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
there ain't no others hereby close to
 
01:59:22.910 --> 01:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HP 11 3 excuse me HP
 
01:59:22.920 --> 01:59:24.229 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HP 11 3 excuse me HP

305
 
01:59:27.970 --> 01:59:27.980 align:start position:0%
and the committee is now in recess until
 
02:00:06.109 --> 02:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:06.119 --> 02:00:34.330 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:00:39.729 --> 02:00:39.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:46.250 --> 02:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:46.260 --> 02:01:05.810 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:01:05.810 --> 02:01:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:05.820 --> 02:01:35.030 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:35.040 --> 02:02:17.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:02:17.470 --> 02:02:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:50.290 --> 02:02:50.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:53.809 --> 02:33:53.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:56.210 --> 02:33:56.220 align:start position:0%
morning at this point we are opening the
 
02:33:58.010 --> 02:33:58.020 align:start position:0%
executive sessions
 
02:33:59.990 --> 02:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
and we are starting with the executive
 
02:34:02.290 --> 02:34:02.300 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill
 
02:34:02.300 --> 02:34:04.070 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill
31

02:34:04.070 --> 02:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
31
 
02:34:07.070 --> 02:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
and I recognize representative Prue to
 
02:34:14.630 --> 02:34:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:17.150 --> 02:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
a second
 
02:34:20.570 --> 02:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:20.580 --> 02:34:22.130 align:start position:0%
 
oh

02:34:22.130 --> 02:34:22.140 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:34:23.630 --> 02:34:23.640 align:start position:0%
okay uh would you like to speak to your
 
02:34:27.950 --> 02:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:31.550 --> 02:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
I think these are mostly Antiques and
 
02:34:36.170 --> 02:34:36.180 align:start position:0%
what have you but um again they fall I
 
02:34:37.730 --> 02:34:37.740 align:start position:0%
believe under the Second Amendment to be
 
02:34:40.610 --> 02:34:40.620 align:start position:0%
able to protect myself if so needed I
 
02:34:43.130 --> 02:34:43.140 align:start position:0%
mean most people can carry a gun now
 
02:34:46.670 --> 02:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
without a permit so
 
02:34:48.950 --> 02:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
something to carry in your pocket I'm
 
02:34:50.450 --> 02:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
okay but
 
02:34:52.730 --> 02:34:52.740 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to you second
 
02:34:56.330 --> 02:34:56.340 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman um
 
02:34:56.340 --> 02:34:58.450 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman um
no

02:34:58.450 --> 02:34:58.460 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:35:01.429 --> 02:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
alrighty discussion
 
02:35:05.389 --> 02:35:05.399 align:start position:0%
I I'll just start by saying that um this
 
02:35:08.630 --> 02:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
is just an Antiquated statute
 
02:35:10.429 --> 02:35:10.439 align:start position:0%
there are far more lethal things
 
02:35:12.650 --> 02:35:12.660 align:start position:0%
available today than these
 
02:35:14.510 --> 02:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
as representative Bruce who have to put
 
02:35:14.520 --> 02:35:16.010 align:start position:0%
as representative Bruce who have to put
antiques

02:35:16.010 --> 02:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
antiques
 
02:35:17.870 --> 02:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
um so I I just don't see any need to
 
02:35:21.050 --> 02:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
keep them in statute is prohibited
 
02:35:24.410 --> 02:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:27.590 --> 02:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative gathway
 
02:35:30.650 --> 02:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
I have a real concern for this bill
 
02:35:34.010 --> 02:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
and um particularly for students
 
02:35:36.349 --> 02:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
High School
 
02:35:38.270 --> 02:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
Middle School
 
02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:39.710 align:start position:0%
Middle School
um

02:35:39.710 --> 02:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:42.290 --> 02:35:42.300 align:start position:0%
I think the law is in place for a reason
 
02:35:44.830 --> 02:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
and it's been there for a very long time
 
02:35:48.290 --> 02:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
and when you think about the um
 
02:35:50.570 --> 02:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
what they call this the the
 
02:35:52.730 --> 02:35:52.740 align:start position:0%
slung shots
 
02:35:54.830 --> 02:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
very dangerous weapon that's the one
 
02:35:58.010 --> 02:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
that has the balls on the end of it you
 
02:36:01.670 --> 02:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:05.389 --> 02:36:05.399 align:start position:0%
no that's what it is and um I just think
 
02:36:08.389 --> 02:36:08.399 align:start position:0%
that is it's a very uh
 
02:36:10.910 --> 02:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
can have quite a few unintended
 
02:36:12.770 --> 02:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
consequences if we would have passed
 
02:36:14.030 --> 02:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:36:17.510 --> 02:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
so I will not be voting to pass such a
 
02:36:20.090 --> 02:36:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:24.010 --> 02:36:24.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:26.750 --> 02:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
during the testimony we did hear these
 
02:36:29.330 --> 02:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
framed as uh Antiquated non-lethal
 
02:36:31.490 --> 02:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
defensive tools
 
02:36:34.250 --> 02:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
um when I actually looked up things like
 
02:36:38.150 --> 02:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
brass knuckle injuries in Google and
 
02:36:39.830 --> 02:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
looked up injuries from some of these
 
02:36:40.990 --> 02:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
other things
 
02:36:44.030 --> 02:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
what I found is uh these aren't just
 
02:36:46.550 --> 02:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
being kept on a shelf and treated like
 
02:36:50.330 --> 02:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
antiques there was a video that I saw of
 
02:36:54.230 --> 02:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
a woman who is sitting parked at a
 
02:36:56.990 --> 02:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
traffic light somebody using brass
 
02:36:59.830 --> 02:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
knuckles shattered the window of her car
 
02:37:02.450 --> 02:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
assaulted her punched her face pulled
 
02:37:05.570 --> 02:37:05.580 align:start position:0%
her out and the the difference which was
 
02:37:08.750 --> 02:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
shown in the video between what what her
 
02:37:11.929 --> 02:37:11.939 align:start position:0%
face looked like before that assault was
 
02:37:14.870 --> 02:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
committed on her and what she looked
 
02:37:16.330 --> 02:37:16.340 align:start position:0%
like afterwards
 
02:37:19.389 --> 02:37:19.399 align:start position:0%
was horrifying
 
02:37:24.230 --> 02:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
these are our weapons uh that can you
 
02:37:27.110 --> 02:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
imagine if people started taking them
 
02:37:28.990 --> 02:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
into bars
 
02:37:31.429 --> 02:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
started getting a little intoxicated
 
02:37:34.429 --> 02:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
imagine a situation where
 
02:37:38.030 --> 02:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
police had to go into a bar after some
 
02:37:42.410 --> 02:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
kind of disruption and uh you know and
 
02:37:45.230 --> 02:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
try to arrest uh you know people who
 
02:37:46.969 --> 02:37:46.979 align:start position:0%
were wearing these and who were using
 
02:37:46.979 --> 02:37:48.230 align:start position:0%
were wearing these and who were using
them

02:37:48.230 --> 02:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:37:48.240 --> 02:37:49.270 align:start position:0%
them
um

02:37:49.270 --> 02:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:52.969 --> 02:37:52.979 align:start position:0%
passing this creates a huge potential
 
02:37:56.210 --> 02:37:56.220 align:start position:0%
can of worms for New Hampshire it
 
02:37:58.550 --> 02:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
creates a can of worms for our law
 
02:38:00.969 --> 02:38:00.979 align:start position:0%
enforcement Personnel
 
02:38:03.530 --> 02:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
we have a statute that may not be used
 
02:38:06.770 --> 02:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
that much right now but the fact that
 
02:38:09.770 --> 02:38:09.780 align:start position:0%
it's there may be keeping people from
 
02:38:11.750 --> 02:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
doing some of this stuff and using some
 
02:38:13.790 --> 02:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
of these things against other people and
 
02:38:16.969 --> 02:38:16.979 align:start position:0%
to me that's a perfectly good reason to
 
02:38:19.610 --> 02:38:19.620 align:start position:0%
keep the statute on the books and so I
 
02:38:22.969 --> 02:38:22.979 align:start position:0%
will be voting against the motion of
 
02:38:24.710 --> 02:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
02:38:26.870 --> 02:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Manion
 
02:38:29.929 --> 02:38:29.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:29.939 --> 02:38:31.610 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:38:31.610 --> 02:38:31.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:33.889 --> 02:38:33.899 align:start position:0%
we have laws in place for the use of
 
02:38:35.809 --> 02:38:35.819 align:start position:0%
these weapons this is just a possession
 
02:38:37.730 --> 02:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
of these weapons so that wouldn't change
 
02:38:40.309 --> 02:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
uh if someone were to use these in a
 
02:38:42.410 --> 02:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
manner that violates another statute
 
02:38:45.170 --> 02:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
however if I was that woman in the car I
 
02:38:46.490 --> 02:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
would have loved the opportunity to have
 
02:38:48.349 --> 02:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
a pair of brass knuckles on myself to
 
02:38:51.110 --> 02:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
defend myself against that attack
 
02:38:53.150 --> 02:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:38:54.590 --> 02:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:38:56.510 --> 02:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
um actually that that made me remind me
 
02:38:59.150 --> 02:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
of a commercial I saw um Watson log on
 
02:39:00.950 --> 02:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
television where they were marketing
 
02:39:02.690 --> 02:39:02.700 align:start position:0%
apparently to women some kind of claw
 
02:39:05.270 --> 02:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
device that a woman could use to defend
 
02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:06.710 align:start position:0%
device that a woman could use to defend
herself

02:39:06.710 --> 02:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
herself
 
02:39:08.510 --> 02:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
um and I don't think that would fall
 
02:39:10.730 --> 02:39:10.740 align:start position:0%
into these descriptions but it had like
 
02:39:13.010 --> 02:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
made you look like that that guy with
 
02:39:14.510 --> 02:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
all the blades on his finger from the
 
02:39:16.010 --> 02:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
Marvel movies
 
02:39:18.770 --> 02:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
um so that there's there's that swords
 
02:39:22.190 --> 02:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
are illegal uh this this is just several
 
02:39:24.050 --> 02:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
things but um there's still a whole
 
02:39:27.230 --> 02:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
plethora of things that are legal so
 
02:39:29.330 --> 02:39:29.340 align:start position:0%
my support was based on the fact that it
 
02:39:32.150 --> 02:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
just narrowly these things but anyone
 
02:39:32.160 --> 02:39:33.050 align:start position:0%
just narrowly these things but anyone
else

02:39:33.050 --> 02:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
else
 
02:39:35.750 --> 02:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative janvard
 
02:39:38.510 --> 02:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I'm of the
 
02:39:40.610 --> 02:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
opinion that
 
02:39:42.170 --> 02:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
our Second Amendment in the United
 
02:39:44.450 --> 02:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
States Constitution guarantees us the
 
02:39:47.030 --> 02:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
right to bear arms these are clearly
 
02:39:50.270 --> 02:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
arms although Antiquated and to speak to
 
02:39:52.070 --> 02:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative Muse's
 
02:39:54.230 --> 02:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
um concern
 
02:39:57.770 --> 02:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
I just looked up RSA 631-1 first degree
 
02:39:57.780 --> 02:39:58.849 align:start position:0%
I just looked up RSA 631-1 first degree
assault

02:39:58.849 --> 02:39:58.859 align:start position:0%
assault
 
02:40:01.490 --> 02:40:01.500 align:start position:0%
person is guilty of a class a felony if
 
02:40:01.500 --> 02:40:03.830 align:start position:0%
person is guilty of a class a felony if
he

02:40:03.830 --> 02:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
he
 
02:40:05.870 --> 02:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
I'm going to the second one purposely or
 
02:40:07.610 --> 02:40:07.620 align:start position:0%
knowingly causes bodily injury to
 
02:40:10.130 --> 02:40:10.140 align:start position:0%
another by means of a deadly weapon so
 
02:40:12.230 --> 02:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
it's already illegal to use it in an
 
02:40:13.490 --> 02:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
unlawful way
 
02:40:16.969 --> 02:40:16.979 align:start position:0%
and and possessing it is not using it in
 
02:40:19.550 --> 02:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
an unlawful way it is a defensive weapon
 
02:40:22.250 --> 02:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
if it's used in as an offensive weapon
 
02:40:23.870 --> 02:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
it is then a crime
 
02:40:26.469 --> 02:40:26.479 align:start position:0%
so I support the OTP
 
02:40:28.670 --> 02:40:28.680 align:start position:0%

02:40:33.830 --> 02:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
committee's time my understanding is to
 
02:40:36.469 --> 02:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
the Twin Towers were brought down with
 
02:40:43.130 --> 02:40:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:43.140 --> 02:40:45.469 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:40:45.469 --> 02:40:45.479 align:start position:0%

I'm going to open the executive session
 
02:43:12.530 --> 02:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 158
 
02:43:15.650 --> 02:43:15.660 align:start position:0%

02:43:22.610 --> 02:43:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:25.309 --> 02:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
this is on 158 yep
 
02:43:28.910 --> 02:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
I would make a motion to itl this bill
 
02:43:35.030 --> 02:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:36.349 --> 02:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
02:43:38.210 --> 02:43:38.220 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I would
 
02:43:40.730 --> 02:43:40.740 align:start position:0%
this bill is presented with uh
 
02:43:43.190 --> 02:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
turn thousands of law-abiding citizens
 
02:43:44.809 --> 02:43:44.819 align:start position:0%

02:43:46.910 --> 02:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
majority of common hunting rounds can
 
02:43:48.710 --> 02:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
penetrate ballistic vests and slash
 
02:43:51.590 --> 02:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
armor in its National course
 
02:43:54.349 --> 02:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
therefore I feel this bill has really no
 
02:43:56.809 --> 02:43:56.819 align:start position:0%
value for Public Safety
 
02:43:59.389 --> 02:43:59.399 align:start position:0%
representative mannion
 
02:44:04.070 --> 02:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:06.590 --> 02:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
um discussion I'll I'll start off I just
 
02:44:09.410 --> 02:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
would say that the police haven't asked
 
02:44:11.990 --> 02:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
for this the definition
 
02:44:14.450 --> 02:44:14.460 align:start position:0%
um is is really
 
02:44:14.460 --> 02:44:15.050 align:start position:0%
um is is really
um

02:44:15.050 --> 02:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:18.590 --> 02:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
confusing and it would in fact make many
 
02:44:21.170 --> 02:44:21.180 align:start position:0%
rounds that have no relation whatsoever
 
02:44:23.690 --> 02:44:23.700 align:start position:0%
to the subject matter become felonious
 
02:44:26.270 --> 02:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
possession just because they're hunting
 
02:44:26.280 --> 02:44:27.170 align:start position:0%
possession just because they're hunting
rounds

02:44:27.170 --> 02:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
rounds
 
02:44:31.070 --> 02:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
um I I the the the bill if it were to be
 
02:44:32.929 --> 02:44:32.939 align:start position:0%
worthy of passing needs a lot of work
 
02:44:35.389 --> 02:44:35.399 align:start position:0%
and we're just not doing that right now
 
02:44:39.050 --> 02:44:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:42.590 --> 02:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
um who's oh representative Rhodes
 
02:44:44.990 --> 02:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I would just
 
02:44:48.170 --> 02:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
like to add that while the sponsor I I
 
02:44:49.610 --> 02:44:49.620 align:start position:0%
believe had
 
02:44:52.610 --> 02:44:52.620 align:start position:0%
you know good intentions as as he um was
 
02:44:55.070 --> 02:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
here with the testimony there was a lot
 
02:44:58.010 --> 02:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
of questions that were not able to be
 
02:45:01.070 --> 02:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
answered and one of the the one that is
 
02:45:03.889 --> 02:45:03.899 align:start position:0%
glaring in my face is
 
02:45:06.650 --> 02:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
If This Were to pass then what happens
 
02:45:08.990 --> 02:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
with the ammunition that people
 
02:45:11.870 --> 02:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
currently have and you know that was
 
02:45:13.429 --> 02:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
just well I guess it would be phased out
 
02:45:15.410 --> 02:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
over time but I think we all know
 
02:45:16.910 --> 02:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
exactly how that would would be
 
02:45:19.370 --> 02:45:19.380 align:start position:0%
implemented and again it was not able to
 
02:45:21.469 --> 02:45:21.479 align:start position:0%
be answered so I just think that I agree
 
02:45:25.190 --> 02:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
with the um Ito motion
 
02:45:28.670 --> 02:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
I would also add um and I didn't I
 
02:45:30.050 --> 02:45:30.060 align:start position:0%
should have
 
02:45:31.910 --> 02:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
um this is a true armor-piercing
 
02:45:34.670 --> 02:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
ammunition is already federally illegal
 
02:45:35.990 --> 02:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
um in possession of it as a federal
 
02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:37.670 align:start position:0%
um in possession of it as a federal
felony

02:45:37.670 --> 02:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
felony
 
02:45:39.530 --> 02:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
um and that's the stuff that really does
 
02:45:42.530 --> 02:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
actually designed and made for piercing
 
02:45:44.210 --> 02:45:44.220 align:start position:0%
body armor and it is used for military
 
02:45:44.220 --> 02:45:45.710 align:start position:0%
body armor and it is used for military
purposes

02:45:45.710 --> 02:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
02:45:48.050 --> 02:45:48.060 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:45:49.490 --> 02:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
um representative Murray
 
02:45:51.469 --> 02:45:51.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:45:53.030 --> 02:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to point out to the
 
02:45:54.830 --> 02:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
committee that the definition used in
 
02:45:56.450 --> 02:45:56.460 align:start position:0%
this bill was pulled from an existing
 
02:45:58.969 --> 02:45:58.979 align:start position:0%
RSA so while I agree with the itl motion
 
02:46:00.349 --> 02:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
I think that maybe we should examine
 
02:46:02.090 --> 02:46:02.100 align:start position:0%
that RSA in the future to provide more
 
02:46:02.100 --> 02:46:03.889 align:start position:0%
that RSA in the future to provide more
clarification

02:46:03.889 --> 02:46:03.899 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
02:46:06.469 --> 02:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
thank you good point

02:47:21.950 --> 02:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
and I recognize representative Muse for
 
02:47:25.790 --> 02:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:40.490 --> 02:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:42.590 --> 02:47:42.600 align:start position:0%
motion by representative Muse seconded
 
02:47:43.670 --> 02:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
by representative gaps right
 
02:47:44.870 --> 02:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative Muse would you like to
 
02:47:47.090 --> 02:47:47.100 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
02:47:50.450 --> 02:47:50.460 align:start position:0%
yes I I understand that there are folks
 
02:47:52.910 --> 02:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
who believe uh that this drug should be
 
02:47:54.530 --> 02:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
Exempted as part of harm reduction
 
02:47:54.540 --> 02:47:56.510 align:start position:0%
Exempted as part of harm reduction
strategy

02:47:56.510 --> 02:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
strategy
 
02:48:01.190 --> 02:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
um however I don't believe in uh that
 
02:48:04.790 --> 02:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
simply uh removing it uh as a controlled
 
02:48:07.010 --> 02:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
drug under the controlled Drug Act would
 
02:48:10.610 --> 02:48:10.620 align:start position:0%
actually accomplish uh harm reduction
 
02:48:12.889 --> 02:48:12.899 align:start position:0%
um I think what it would accomplish is a
 
02:48:15.349 --> 02:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
lot more people taking a drug that
 
02:48:19.070 --> 02:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
should probably be taken under some type
 
02:48:22.130 --> 02:48:22.140 align:start position:0%
of medical supervision if it's going to
 
02:48:25.429 --> 02:48:25.439 align:start position:0%
be taken at all in situations where they
 
02:48:28.070 --> 02:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
may not have help available to them one
 
02:48:29.090 --> 02:48:29.100 align:start position:0%
of the things that we heard during
 
02:48:32.389 --> 02:48:32.399 align:start position:0%
testimony is that while there are there
 
02:48:34.969 --> 02:48:34.979 align:start position:0%
are substantial number of people who
 
02:48:37.309 --> 02:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
seem to get a benefit and derive some
 
02:48:40.130 --> 02:48:40.140 align:start position:0%
type of psychological benefit from from
 
02:48:42.710 --> 02:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
taking this drug we also heard that
 
02:48:45.290 --> 02:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
there are other people who have who have
 
02:48:48.790 --> 02:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
bad trips and uh and where there can be
 
02:48:51.410 --> 02:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
significant consequences to taking a
 
02:48:52.870 --> 02:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
drug like this
 
02:48:52.880 --> 02:48:54.610 align:start position:0%
drug like this
without

02:48:54.610 --> 02:48:54.620 align:start position:0%
without
 
02:48:58.790 --> 02:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
sometime type of help being nearby if
 
02:49:03.010 --> 02:49:03.020 align:start position:0%
something goes wrong so I I
 
02:49:08.650 --> 02:49:08.660 align:start position:0%
am sympathetic to the idea of a
 
02:49:11.210 --> 02:49:11.220 align:start position:0%
decriminalizing uh
 
02:49:14.510 --> 02:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
some things in our controlled Drug Act
 
02:49:18.110 --> 02:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
but at this point in time the way this
 
02:49:21.170 --> 02:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
bill is written this would not be one of
 
02:49:21.180 --> 02:49:23.050 align:start position:0%
bill is written this would not be one of
them

02:49:23.050 --> 02:49:23.060 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:49:24.770 --> 02:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
representative gaththright would you
 
02:49:26.030 --> 02:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
like to speak to you a second
 
02:49:26.040 --> 02:49:27.530 align:start position:0%
like to speak to you a second
that

02:49:27.530 --> 02:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:49:30.110 --> 02:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Newell
 
02:49:33.110 --> 02:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
well I am very much in favor thank you
 
02:49:35.690 --> 02:49:35.700 align:start position:0%
Mr chair well I'm very much in favor of
 
02:49:37.610 --> 02:49:37.620 align:start position:0%
decriminalization and regulation I think
 
02:49:39.110 --> 02:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
that those two things go hand in hand
 
02:49:40.429 --> 02:49:40.439 align:start position:0%
and I think that there's a process for
 
02:49:42.710 --> 02:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
that and concur with what um
 
02:49:44.389 --> 02:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
02:49:45.950 --> 02:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
Right Said
 
02:49:49.070 --> 02:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative wheeler I think
 
02:49:52.309 --> 02:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
that adults should be able to make the
 
02:49:56.030 --> 02:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
decision to be stupid to be weird or to
 
02:49:58.670 --> 02:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
have a bad trip if they so choose and I
 
02:50:00.469 --> 02:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
think the state stepping in and saying
 
02:50:02.450 --> 02:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
that you're not allowed to take a drug
 
02:50:06.290 --> 02:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
which the only harms I could find online
 
02:50:09.849 --> 02:50:09.859 align:start position:0%
in research or we were told about were
 
02:50:12.349 --> 02:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
as representative Muse said a bad trip
 
02:50:15.410 --> 02:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
and I think that's not a significant
 
02:50:16.790 --> 02:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
enough harm it doesn't harm another
 
02:50:18.710 --> 02:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
person and if someone isn't harming
 
02:50:20.750 --> 02:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
another person with their choices then
 
02:50:22.790 --> 02:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
they should be allowed to make stupid
 
02:50:24.770 --> 02:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
decisions so I will be voting against
 
02:50:26.870 --> 02:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
the ideal motion
 
02:50:28.309 --> 02:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:50:30.469 --> 02:50:30.479 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
02:50:32.870 --> 02:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony that this was not
 
02:50:35.210 --> 02:50:35.220 align:start position:0%
addictive when I heard the state police
 
02:50:37.429 --> 02:50:37.439 align:start position:0%
had their opportunity to speak they had
 
02:50:39.610 --> 02:50:39.620 align:start position:0%
very little to say it was just a general
 
02:50:42.290 --> 02:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
uh dislike
 
02:50:44.630 --> 02:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh I think
 
02:50:44.640 --> 02:50:45.469 align:start position:0%
uh I think
um

02:50:45.469 --> 02:50:45.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:48.110 --> 02:50:48.120 align:start position:0%
next are we going to out if there's if
 
02:50:50.150 --> 02:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
there's no addictive properties are we
 
02:50:52.969 --> 02:50:52.979 align:start position:0%
next going to Outlaw pleasure so I'm
 
02:50:55.490 --> 02:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
going to be voting against the ITIL
 
02:50:57.590 --> 02:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
I believe pleasure has already been
 
02:51:00.050 --> 02:51:00.060 align:start position:0%
outlawed at the federal level
 
02:51:02.030 --> 02:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
02:51:05.630 --> 02:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:07.910 --> 02:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
I appreciate you trying to keep me my
 
02:51:10.969 --> 02:51:10.979 align:start position:0%
job and working because I'm the one who
 
02:51:14.330 --> 02:51:14.340 align:start position:0%
go get gets the bad trips but uh
 
02:51:18.290 --> 02:51:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:20.270 --> 02:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
02:51:21.469 --> 02:51:21.479 align:start position:0%
um so you know what else I'll ask the
 
02:51:23.090 --> 02:51:23.100 align:start position:0%
clerk to call oh who's going to miss can
 
02:51:24.349 --> 02:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
I just add one more thing for the record
 
02:51:28.130 --> 02:51:28.140 align:start position:0%
this drug was legal to buy online until
 
02:51:30.349 --> 02:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
2011 in my research I had a few
 
02:51:31.670 --> 02:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
questions and no one could answer that
 
02:51:34.550 --> 02:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
too well but in my research it was legal
 
02:51:36.650 --> 02:51:36.660 align:start position:0%
to buy online until 2011 and we hadn't
 
02:51:38.570 --> 02:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
had a problem uh until the federal
 
02:51:40.010 --> 02:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
government decided to step in and make
 
02:51:43.550 --> 02:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
it illegal for uh no well documented
 
02:51:46.190 --> 02:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
reason hence my comment about pleasure
 
02:51:47.630 --> 02:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
being unlawful
 
02:51:49.550 --> 02:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
um representative Muse
 
02:51:52.690 --> 02:51:52.700 align:start position:0%
one thing I would like to point out is
 
02:51:55.849 --> 02:51:55.859 align:start position:0%
the court has basically ruled according
 
02:51:58.070 --> 02:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
to the testimony that we heard that it
 
02:52:00.410 --> 02:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
is still legal and appropriate for
 
02:52:02.330 --> 02:52:02.340 align:start position:0%
people to use this drug for religious
 
02:52:05.450 --> 02:52:05.460 align:start position:0%
reasons uh and nothing about italing
 
02:52:10.490 --> 02:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:12.650 --> 02:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:52:14.389 --> 02:52:14.399 align:start position:0%

is the motion carries uh 14 to 6.
 
02:54:12.769 --> 02:54:12.779 align:start position:0%
for the record at this point
 
02:54:14.929 --> 02:54:14.939 align:start position:0%
um I closed the executive session on
 
02:54:16.910 --> 02:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 216.
 
02:54:18.889 --> 02:54:18.899 align:start position:0%
I opened the executive session on House
 
02:54:22.070 --> 02:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
Bill 315 and I recognize representative
 
02:54:32.809 --> 02:54:32.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:32.819 --> 02:54:34.370 align:start position:0%
 
this

02:54:34.370 --> 02:54:34.380 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:54:36.410 --> 02:54:36.420 align:start position:0%
is I would like to introduce an
 
02:54:36.420 --> 02:54:37.610 align:start position:0%
is I would like to introduce an
amendment

02:54:37.610 --> 02:54:37.620 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:54:40.010 --> 02:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
and now it's the amendment zero three
 
02:54:42.769 --> 02:54:42.779 align:start position:0%
seven zero H and I'll speak to the
 
02:54:44.809 --> 02:54:44.819 align:start position:0%
amendment the amendment does not do
 
02:54:46.190 --> 02:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
anything to the bill that was brought
 
02:54:48.710 --> 02:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
before us except for it adds an
 
02:54:48.720 --> 02:54:49.849 align:start position:0%
before us except for it adds an
additional

02:54:49.849 --> 02:54:49.859 align:start position:0%
additional
 
02:54:51.830 --> 02:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
um additional line
 
02:54:53.510 --> 02:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
and it says
 
02:54:55.969 --> 02:54:55.979 align:start position:0%
the provocation was not uh was not
 
02:54:58.130 --> 02:54:58.140 align:start position:0%
objectively reasonable if it resulted
 
02:55:00.230 --> 02:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
from the defendant's hostility to a
 
02:55:03.950 --> 02:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
decedent's religion race Creed sexual
 
02:55:06.710 --> 02:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
orientation as defined by RSA 21 colon
 
02:55:09.590 --> 02:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
49 national origin and this is the part
 
02:55:11.870 --> 02:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
I added political beliefs or affiliation
 
02:55:15.110 --> 02:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
or gender identity as defined under RSA
 
02:55:15.120 --> 02:55:16.610 align:start position:0%
or gender identity as defined under RSA
2154

02:55:16.610 --> 02:55:16.620 align:start position:0%
2154
 
02:55:19.190 --> 02:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
the reason I added that is because in
 
02:55:20.570 --> 02:55:20.580 align:start position:0%
the climate we're seeing today we're
 
02:55:20.580 --> 02:55:21.370 align:start position:0%
the climate we're seeing today we're
seeing

02:55:21.370 --> 02:55:21.380 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
02:55:24.530 --> 02:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
politicians non-politicians people
 
02:55:27.050 --> 02:55:27.060 align:start position:0%
getting getting shot getting killed
 
02:55:29.690 --> 02:55:29.700 align:start position:0%
because of their political beliefs and
 
02:55:31.190 --> 02:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
wherever we have a chance we have to
 
02:55:33.050 --> 02:55:33.060 align:start position:0%
reiterate our first amendment and our
 
02:55:35.150 --> 02:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
rights to believe the way we want
 
02:55:35.160 --> 02:55:36.469 align:start position:0%
rights to believe the way we want
and

02:55:36.469 --> 02:55:36.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:55:38.570 --> 02:55:38.580 align:start position:0%
I feel like this is a good spot to start
 
02:55:40.730 --> 02:55:40.740 align:start position:0%
and since the the sponsor was kind
 
02:55:42.710 --> 02:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
enough to bring this to my attention I
 
02:55:45.530 --> 02:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
believe that gender identity and the the
 
02:55:48.590 --> 02:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
whole gay defense thing is outrageous
 
02:55:53.150 --> 02:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:54.590 --> 02:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
um generally speaking I'm in favor of
 
02:55:56.690 --> 02:55:56.700 align:start position:0%
the Court being able to decide that but
 
02:55:58.429 --> 02:55:58.439 align:start position:0%
sometimes we have to as a legislature
 
02:56:00.830 --> 02:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
let the courts know the mind of the of
 
02:56:02.150 --> 02:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
the populace
 
02:56:04.790 --> 02:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
and that's where I stand in that
 
02:56:04.800 --> 02:56:05.349 align:start position:0%
and that's where I stand in that
um

02:56:05.349 --> 02:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:07.790 --> 02:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
I thought you seconded it can anyone
 
02:56:12.469 --> 02:56:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:15.769 --> 02:56:15.779 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:17.050 --> 02:56:17.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:56:20.090 --> 02:56:20.100 align:start position:0%
I'm through and
 
02:56:20.100 --> 02:56:25.790 align:start position:0%
I'm through and
um discussion

02:56:25.790 --> 02:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:31.090 --> 02:56:31.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:33.230 --> 02:56:33.240 align:start position:0%
one of the things I think that I'm
 
02:56:35.750 --> 02:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
wondering is whether the amendment
 
02:56:35.760 --> 02:56:36.670 align:start position:0%
wondering is whether the amendment
um

02:56:36.670 --> 02:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:39.290 --> 02:56:39.300 align:start position:0%
accomplishes the original attempt intent
 
02:56:42.290 --> 02:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
of the sponsor of actually prohibiting a
 
02:56:44.990 --> 02:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
gay Panic defense uh
 
02:56:48.650 --> 02:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
and another question would be are we
 
02:56:52.429 --> 02:56:52.439 align:start position:0%
opening the door to a uh
 
02:56:52.439 --> 02:56:54.830 align:start position:0%
opening the door to a uh
a a

02:56:54.830 --> 02:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
a a
 
02:56:57.349 --> 02:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
Democrat Panic offense a republican
 
02:56:59.450 --> 02:56:59.460 align:start position:0%
Panic defense say
 
02:57:03.230 --> 02:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
um uh racial Panic defenses I mean I'm
 
02:57:06.650 --> 02:57:06.660 align:start position:0%
trying to uh to kind of understand are
 
02:57:06.660 --> 02:57:07.790 align:start position:0%
trying to uh to kind of understand are
we

02:57:07.790 --> 02:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:57:10.190 --> 02:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
is the amendment actually germane to
 
02:57:12.710 --> 02:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
what was originally proposed or are we
 
02:57:14.450 --> 02:57:14.460 align:start position:0%
actually enacting something very very
 
02:57:14.460 --> 02:57:16.670 align:start position:0%
actually enacting something very very
different

02:57:16.670 --> 02:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:57:20.030 --> 02:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
well as I I left the um the sponsor's
 
02:57:22.610 --> 02:57:22.620 align:start position:0%
language intact except for additions so
 
02:57:25.610 --> 02:57:25.620 align:start position:0%
the sponsors intent is not affected as
 
02:57:27.349 --> 02:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
far as I'm concerned
 
02:57:29.750 --> 02:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
and it only expands upon it
 
02:57:31.670 --> 02:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
and if we look at what's already there
 
02:57:35.269 --> 02:57:35.279 align:start position:0%
we had race Creed sexual orientation
 
02:57:36.710 --> 02:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
um oh we added sexual interesting we had
 
02:57:39.710 --> 02:57:39.720 align:start position:0%
race Creed national origin all of the
 
02:57:41.450 --> 02:57:41.460 align:start position:0%
things that people
 
02:57:45.830 --> 02:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
so did we already have a a race uh Panic
 
02:57:48.530 --> 02:57:48.540 align:start position:0%
did we have a religious Panic
 
02:57:48.540 --> 02:57:49.190 align:start position:0%
did we have a religious Panic
um

02:57:49.190 --> 02:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:51.830 --> 02:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
I think that if we're going to extend
 
02:57:54.170 --> 02:57:54.180 align:start position:0%
this protection as a society we should
 
02:57:55.670 --> 02:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
look at what's happening in our current
 
02:57:55.680 --> 02:57:56.809 align:start position:0%
look at what's happening in our current
time

02:57:56.809 --> 02:57:56.819 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:57:59.330 --> 02:57:59.340 align:start position:0%
and right now we we see political
 
02:58:01.070 --> 02:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
violence on the rise
 
02:58:03.349 --> 02:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
so whether or not it's going to be a
 
02:58:05.809 --> 02:58:05.819 align:start position:0%
panic defense or any defense at all it
 
02:58:07.969 --> 02:58:07.979 align:start position:0%
should not be allowed as a defense to
 
02:58:09.349 --> 02:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
killing someone
 
02:58:11.929 --> 02:58:11.939 align:start position:0%
so um that's the reason for the addition
 
02:58:14.150 --> 02:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
I do not think it takes away from it
 
02:58:17.570 --> 02:58:17.580 align:start position:0%
simply adds to taking away the gay Panic
 
02:58:20.330 --> 02:58:20.340 align:start position:0%
defense and also adds to that religious
 
02:58:23.690 --> 02:58:23.700 align:start position:0%
excuse me political beliefs so that and
 
02:58:27.769 --> 02:58:27.779 align:start position:0%
follow-up sure absolutely yeah um so you
 
02:58:29.690 --> 02:58:29.700 align:start position:0%
you had said you you're you're you're
 
02:58:32.389 --> 02:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
basically saying that the amendment
 
02:58:35.269 --> 02:58:35.279 align:start position:0%
um uh doesn't replace any language it
 
02:58:37.309 --> 02:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
actually adds language but but there is
 
02:58:39.830 --> 02:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
language in the original Bill uh in
 
02:58:44.410 --> 02:58:44.420 align:start position:0%
section four uh uh
 
02:58:48.230 --> 02:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
for instance that does uh say that if
 
02:58:50.269 --> 02:58:50.279 align:start position:0%
the provocation was not objectively
 
02:58:52.250 --> 02:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
reasonable it says that basically the
 
02:58:54.290 --> 02:58:54.300 align:start position:0%
provocation is not objectionable
 
02:58:56.690 --> 02:58:56.700 align:start position:0%
objectively reasonable if it resulted
 
02:58:58.130 --> 02:58:58.140 align:start position:0%
from the discovery of knowledge about
 
02:59:01.130 --> 02:59:01.140 align:start position:0%
the potential disclosure of the victim's
 
02:59:02.809 --> 02:59:02.819 align:start position:0%
actual or perceived gender gender
 
02:59:05.170 --> 02:59:05.180 align:start position:0%
identity sex or sexual orientation
 
02:59:07.550 --> 02:59:07.560 align:start position:0%
including under circumstances under
 
02:59:09.429 --> 02:59:09.439 align:start position:0%
which the victim made an unwanted
 
02:59:12.530 --> 02:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
non-forcible romantic or sexual Advance
 
02:59:14.929 --> 02:59:14.939 align:start position:0%
towards the defendant or if the
 
02:59:16.849 --> 02:59:16.859 align:start position:0%
defendant and victim dated or had a
 
02:59:19.969 --> 02:59:19.979 align:start position:0%
romantic sexual relationship there's
 
02:59:22.070 --> 02:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
also some additional language that says
 
02:59:24.230 --> 02:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
in section four that says nothing in
 
02:59:26.030 --> 02:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
this paragraph shall preclude the jury
 
02:59:28.610 --> 02:59:28.620 align:start position:0%
from considering all relevant facts to
 
02:59:30.230 --> 02:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
determine whether the defendant was in
 
02:59:32.269 --> 02:59:32.279 align:start position:0%
fact provoked for the purposes of
 
02:59:34.389 --> 02:59:34.399 align:start position:0%
establishing subjective provocation
 
02:59:39.530 --> 02:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
there's also a a section B that that
 
02:59:41.269 --> 02:59:41.279 align:start position:0%
defines gender for the purpose of the
 
02:59:43.429 --> 02:59:43.439 align:start position:0%
paragraph So
 
02:59:46.010 --> 02:59:46.020 align:start position:0%
I I'm a little confused because the
 
02:59:48.230 --> 02:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
amendment actually seems to eliminate a
 
02:59:49.969 --> 02:59:49.979 align:start position:0%
lot of language that was in the original
 
02:59:52.550 --> 02:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
bill as opposed to just supplementing it
 
02:59:54.050 --> 02:59:54.060 align:start position:0%
and could you comment on that yeah I
 
02:59:55.010 --> 02:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
would actually
 
02:59:58.429 --> 02:59:58.439 align:start position:0%
um the the language the purpose of the
 
03:00:00.349 --> 03:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
bill was to defend it was to prohibit
 
03:00:01.550 --> 03:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
the gay
 
03:00:01.560 --> 03:00:02.450 align:start position:0%
the gay
um

03:00:02.450 --> 03:00:02.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:06.050 --> 03:00:06.060 align:start position:0%
the gay Panic defense and that's clearly
 
03:00:07.910 --> 03:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
still here the sex or gender without
 
03:00:09.830 --> 03:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
getting into as the original Bill did
 
03:00:11.690 --> 03:00:11.700 align:start position:0%
about dating
 
03:00:15.170 --> 03:00:15.180 align:start position:0%
um and into the nature of relationships
 
03:00:17.510 --> 03:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
in in my opinion it shouldn't matter
 
03:00:19.130 --> 03:00:19.140 align:start position:0%
what the relationship is if you kill
 
03:00:20.630 --> 03:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
someone and say you did it because they
 
03:00:22.250 --> 03:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
were gay
 
03:00:24.170 --> 03:00:24.180 align:start position:0%
um whether you were dating or you
 
03:00:26.630 --> 03:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
surprised them or what you did is in my
 
03:00:27.830 --> 03:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
mind you're relevant you killed someone
 
03:00:28.849 --> 03:00:28.859 align:start position:0%
you're trying to get away with it
 
03:00:31.070 --> 03:00:31.080 align:start position:0%
because you're saying to a guy so I did
 
03:00:32.990 --> 03:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
remove the part that described
 
03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:34.370 align:start position:0%
remove the part that described
relationships

03:00:34.370 --> 03:00:34.380 align:start position:0%
relationships
 
03:00:37.309 --> 03:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
as far as the gender identity it's
 
03:00:42.830 --> 03:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
already in Statute in RSA 21 colon 54.
 
03:00:45.170 --> 03:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
um so that a purpose having it in there
 
03:00:47.389 --> 03:00:47.399 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of the statute
 
03:00:49.730 --> 03:00:49.740 align:start position:0%
we can't have conflicting definitions we
 
03:00:51.410 --> 03:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
should have one definition in statute if
 
03:00:52.490 --> 03:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
we're going to define something in
 
03:00:54.769 --> 03:00:54.779 align:start position:0%
statute so having different chapters
 
03:00:56.330 --> 03:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
with different definitions of the same
 
03:00:59.150 --> 03:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
thing is not helpful so again I would go
 
03:01:02.290 --> 03:01:02.300 align:start position:0%
back to the intent of the sponsor was to
 
03:01:04.790 --> 03:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
alleviate or remove the gay Panic
 
03:01:06.950 --> 03:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
defense this does that and it just makes
 
03:01:09.590 --> 03:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
it a little broader without putting in
 
03:01:11.750 --> 03:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
language that is so specific to a
 
03:01:13.730 --> 03:01:13.740 align:start position:0%
certain scenario
 
03:01:13.740 --> 03:01:14.690 align:start position:0%
certain scenario
um

03:01:14.690 --> 03:01:14.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:18.230 --> 03:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
that it narrows it so much that it's not
 
03:01:20.389 --> 03:01:20.399 align:start position:0%
able to protect anyone else except for
 
03:01:22.849 --> 03:01:22.859 align:start position:0%
those specific people in those specific
 
03:01:24.830 --> 03:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
scenarios represent Manning you had a
 
03:01:24.840 --> 03:01:25.610 align:start position:0%
scenarios represent Manning you had a
comment

03:01:25.610 --> 03:01:25.620 align:start position:0%
comment
 
03:01:27.110 --> 03:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
or did you have your hand up no who had
 
03:01:29.210 --> 03:01:29.220 align:start position:0%
to hand up representative Reed thank you
 
03:01:30.349 --> 03:01:30.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
03:01:32.150 --> 03:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
um I felt the original bill was very
 
03:01:34.670 --> 03:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
narrow so when I heard the amendment I
 
03:01:36.889 --> 03:01:36.899 align:start position:0%
was much more comfortable with passage
 
03:01:39.769 --> 03:01:39.779 align:start position:0%
with the OTP I felt it was it was made
 
03:01:42.650 --> 03:01:42.660 align:start position:0%
better and more inclusive by adding all
 
03:01:44.990 --> 03:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
those other components so I like the
 
03:01:46.670 --> 03:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
amendment very much
 
03:01:50.090 --> 03:01:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:53.750 --> 03:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Mr chair
 
03:01:55.790 --> 03:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
um well I appreciate the intent of the
 
03:01:57.530 --> 03:01:57.540 align:start position:0%
amendment because I do agree that we
 
03:01:59.690 --> 03:01:59.700 align:start position:0%
need to make sure we protect all people
 
03:02:01.670 --> 03:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
from these kinds of
 
03:02:03.950 --> 03:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
um defenses in court
 
03:02:06.110 --> 03:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
um my concern is that there is legal
 
03:02:08.210 --> 03:02:08.220 align:start position:0%
precedent of the gay Panic defense being
 
03:02:10.849 --> 03:02:10.859 align:start position:0%
used specifically in these situations
 
03:02:12.889 --> 03:02:12.899 align:start position:0%
where their surprise dating
 
03:02:15.110 --> 03:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
relationships involved and because
 
03:02:17.090 --> 03:02:17.100 align:start position:0%
there's that legal precedent with those
 
03:02:20.030 --> 03:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
specific group of people and to my
 
03:02:21.710 --> 03:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
knowledge there's not that same legal
 
03:02:23.750 --> 03:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
precedent where people have been able to
 
03:02:26.990 --> 03:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
say oh I you know have a momentary burst
 
03:02:28.370 --> 03:02:28.380 align:start position:0%
of insanity because of someone's
 
03:02:30.590 --> 03:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
religion and that has ever been used to
 
03:02:32.630 --> 03:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
my knowledge in any case whether
 
03:02:35.269 --> 03:02:35.279 align:start position:0%
successfully or not it's two very
 
03:02:37.870 --> 03:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
different issues and I think it would be
 
03:02:40.429 --> 03:02:40.439 align:start position:0%
more applicable to the intent of the
 
03:02:43.370 --> 03:02:43.380 align:start position:0%
bill and also clearer to
 
03:02:45.830 --> 03:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
um those enforcing this law
 
03:02:48.349 --> 03:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
to be specific about what we're trying
 
03:02:50.330 --> 03:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
to prevent and then in the future we can
 
03:02:52.510 --> 03:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
do a different bill which addresses
 
03:02:55.429 --> 03:02:55.439 align:start position:0%
these other categories that we also want
 
03:02:57.469 --> 03:02:57.479 align:start position:0%
to protect but I think that this muddies
 
03:02:59.030 --> 03:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
and Waters down the original intent of
 
03:03:00.590 --> 03:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
the bill and could possibly still leave
 
03:03:02.809 --> 03:03:02.819 align:start position:0%
a loophole that would be abused in the
 
03:03:02.819 --> 03:03:04.370 align:start position:0%
a loophole that would be abused in the
future

03:03:04.370 --> 03:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
future
 
03:03:07.250 --> 03:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
thank you um I would respond to that
 
03:03:07.260 --> 03:03:08.090 align:start position:0%
thank you um I would respond to that
um

03:03:08.090 --> 03:03:08.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:09.830 --> 03:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
I recall I'm old enough to remember
 
03:03:11.990 --> 03:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
after 9 11. there were quite a few
 
03:03:13.370 --> 03:03:13.380 align:start position:0%
people that were taking action against
 
03:03:15.530 --> 03:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
people of the Islamic faith and they
 
03:03:17.450 --> 03:03:17.460 align:start position:0%
panicked because oh my God are they a
 
03:03:20.030 --> 03:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
terrorist and some people were indeed
 
03:03:22.670 --> 03:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
hurt by that
 
03:03:26.210 --> 03:03:26.220 align:start position:0%
further the the we have to in my opinion
 
03:03:28.429 --> 03:03:28.439 align:start position:0%
as a as a committee and as a legislature
 
03:03:31.070 --> 03:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
we don't pass laws to send political
 
03:03:34.250 --> 03:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
messages and if the intent was this we
 
03:03:35.750 --> 03:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
want to send a message and we're going
 
03:03:37.490 --> 03:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
to get so specific
 
03:03:39.950 --> 03:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
either the bill or the law is to protect
 
03:03:43.070 --> 03:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
people and we enumerated certain groups
 
03:03:45.170 --> 03:03:45.180 align:start position:0%
of people
 
03:03:47.870 --> 03:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
then it's to defend those people the the
 
03:03:49.849 --> 03:03:49.859 align:start position:0%
message or the intent
 
03:03:52.010 --> 03:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
isn't isn't the reason we make law we
 
03:03:53.750 --> 03:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
make law to protect people and I agree
 
03:03:54.950 --> 03:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
with you it has been used in other
 
03:03:57.290 --> 03:03:57.300 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions never in New Hampshire and
 
03:03:59.570 --> 03:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
it was not successful the gay Panic
 
03:04:01.730 --> 03:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
defense uh or hasn't been in in quite
 
03:04:03.830 --> 03:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
some time so the argument could be made
 
03:04:05.809 --> 03:04:05.819 align:start position:0%
it's really not needed however having
 
03:04:07.250 --> 03:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
said that
 
03:04:10.309 --> 03:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
to protect from it ever happening in New
 
03:04:13.070 --> 03:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire were saying let's pass this
 
03:04:15.830 --> 03:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
I say the same time why come back later
 
03:04:17.150 --> 03:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
when we have a chance right now to
 
03:04:18.710 --> 03:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
protect all of these people in these
 
03:04:20.990 --> 03:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
classes from anyone having any kind of
 
03:04:22.370 --> 03:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
excuse where they think they can get
 
03:04:23.870 --> 03:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
away with murder because of someone's
 
03:04:26.570 --> 03:04:26.580 align:start position:0%
religion someone's race
 
03:04:26.580 --> 03:04:27.230 align:start position:0%
religion someone's race
um

03:04:27.230 --> 03:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:28.550 --> 03:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
are all these things are so much
 
03:04:32.210 --> 03:04:32.220 align:start position:0%
political beliefs but again we are all
 
03:04:34.490 --> 03:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
free to
 
03:04:40.730 --> 03:04:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:43.429 --> 03:04:43.439 align:start position:0%
time representative Newman I just have a
 
03:04:44.809 --> 03:04:44.819 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned the bill that
 
03:04:47.030 --> 03:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
this that the definition conflicts with
 
03:04:49.309 --> 03:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
but I did not get the number of the bill
 
03:04:50.809 --> 03:04:50.819 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to
 
03:04:53.690 --> 03:04:53.700 align:start position:0%
see if they are comparable or if it two
 
03:04:55.370 --> 03:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
different two different definitions are
 
03:04:55.380 --> 03:04:59.710 align:start position:0%
different two different definitions are
appropriate

03:04:59.710 --> 03:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:03.469 --> 03:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:06.290 --> 03:05:06.300 align:start position:0%
I say okay thank you very much I I see
 
03:05:17.630 --> 03:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:17.640 --> 03:05:36.230 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:05:36.230 --> 03:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:36.240 --> 03:05:39.410 align:start position:0%
 
Bolden

03:05:39.410 --> 03:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:42.170 --> 03:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to throw in just food for
 
03:05:44.990 --> 03:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
a thought that I think historically it's
 
03:05:46.730 --> 03:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
it's easy to forget because we live in
 
03:05:48.590 --> 03:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
this world now of like
 
03:05:52.250 --> 03:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
we have rules where a nation of laws and
 
03:05:55.309 --> 03:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
and we grew up thinking we know what
 
03:05:57.530 --> 03:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
what is expected of us and that murder
 
03:06:00.590 --> 03:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
is always improper that physical
 
03:06:03.050 --> 03:06:03.060 align:start position:0%
violence is always improper but it
 
03:06:05.450 --> 03:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
wasn't that long ago that
 
03:06:08.630 --> 03:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
cultural perspectives were different and
 
03:06:10.490 --> 03:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
that those differences in cultural
 
03:06:10.500 --> 03:06:11.690 align:start position:0%
that those differences in cultural
perspectives

03:06:11.690 --> 03:06:11.700 align:start position:0%
perspectives
 
03:06:13.429 --> 03:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
were used
 
03:06:16.550 --> 03:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
to justify violence but not
 
03:06:19.070 --> 03:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
they weren't capitalized on to justify
 
03:06:20.690 --> 03:06:20.700 align:start position:0%
violence they genuinely Justified
 
03:06:24.710 --> 03:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
Violence in those cultures in Prior
 
03:06:27.349 --> 03:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
prior versions of this country
 
03:06:27.359 --> 03:06:28.550 align:start position:0%
prior versions of this country
um

03:06:28.550 --> 03:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:30.889 --> 03:06:30.899 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you've all heard about old laws
 
03:06:33.769 --> 03:06:33.779 align:start position:0%
about like maybe the thickness of the
 
03:06:35.330 --> 03:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
whip you can use on your wife for
 
03:06:35.340 --> 03:06:36.889 align:start position:0%
whip you can use on your wife for
example

03:06:36.889 --> 03:06:36.899 align:start position:0%
example
 
03:06:38.929 --> 03:06:38.939 align:start position:0%
um and we know that there's been shifts
 
03:06:41.570 --> 03:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
over time about physical punishment of
 
03:06:44.630 --> 03:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
children and I think most recently
 
03:06:48.769 --> 03:06:48.779 align:start position:0%
where that translates is uh there's I
 
03:06:50.269 --> 03:06:50.279 align:start position:0%
guess the most prolific serial killer I
 
03:06:52.010 --> 03:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
think his name is Sam little he
 
03:06:53.510 --> 03:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
specifically targeted sex workers
 
03:06:55.190 --> 03:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
because he knew that they wouldn't be
 
03:07:00.170 --> 03:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
valued and he argued when he was caught
 
03:07:02.389 --> 03:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
from time to time he would say well she
 
03:07:04.490 --> 03:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
was stealing money from me or she wanted
 
03:07:05.990 --> 03:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
to do something weird
 
03:07:08.330 --> 03:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
and then he was let go by authorities
 
03:07:10.190 --> 03:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
because they found that to be a
 
03:07:11.750 --> 03:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
Justified reason for whatever his
 
03:07:14.150 --> 03:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
violent Outburst was so there are people
 
03:07:17.510 --> 03:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
alive today who do take into
 
03:07:20.330 --> 03:07:20.340 align:start position:0%
consideration your reasoning for a
 
03:07:22.010 --> 03:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
violent act they don't think that it's
 
03:07:23.450 --> 03:07:23.460 align:start position:0%
black and white the way that some people
 
03:07:25.070 --> 03:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
may think it is today that you just
 
03:07:27.650 --> 03:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be violent and their own
 
03:07:30.050 --> 03:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
biases do go into their evaluation of
 
03:07:31.670 --> 03:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
your behavior
 
03:07:33.650 --> 03:07:33.660 align:start position:0%
um and I just
 
03:07:35.690 --> 03:07:35.700 align:start position:0%
wanted to throw that out there
 
03:07:38.630 --> 03:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:41.030 --> 03:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
the situations in which the bill at hand
 
03:07:44.690 --> 03:07:44.700 align:start position:0%
would be important are going to be very
 
03:07:47.090 --> 03:07:47.100 align:start position:0%
maybe even singular situation if ever
 
03:07:49.670 --> 03:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
hopefully right maybe never but it would
 
03:07:51.650 --> 03:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
be a very complicated situation in which
 
03:07:55.370 --> 03:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
someone lost their life and I hope that
 
03:07:57.650 --> 03:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
um we can
 
03:08:01.429 --> 03:08:01.439 align:start position:0%
make decisions with that in mind thanks
 
03:08:03.889 --> 03:08:03.899 align:start position:0%
thank you and that that reminds me of
 
03:08:05.809 --> 03:08:05.819 align:start position:0%
one other thing we just in this
 
03:08:07.910 --> 03:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
committee discussed the other day about
 
03:08:09.950 --> 03:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
needing to do a certain thing because
 
03:08:12.469 --> 03:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
there are continuously new residents
 
03:08:13.849 --> 03:08:13.859 align:start position:0%
coming to our country from different
 
03:08:16.010 --> 03:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
places who bring with them their their
 
03:08:19.010 --> 03:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
biases and culture ideas and until they
 
03:08:21.950 --> 03:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
can acclimate to our own things like
 
03:08:24.110 --> 03:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
this where it may be acceptable for one
 
03:08:26.870 --> 03:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
religion to to to use violence against
 
03:08:29.870 --> 03:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
another uh to clearly spell it out that
 
03:08:31.550 --> 03:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
is not an excuse in the United States to
 
03:08:33.769 --> 03:08:33.779 align:start position:0%
use violence or race or sexual
 
03:08:36.830 --> 03:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
orientation or or your gender identity
 
03:08:40.849 --> 03:08:40.859 align:start position:0%
or any of these things or or political
 
03:08:43.010 --> 03:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
um I just think if we're going to do it
 
03:08:44.570 --> 03:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
let's do it and make sure we that
 
03:08:46.610 --> 03:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
everyone possibly could be covered thank
 
03:08:46.620 --> 03:08:47.690 align:start position:0%
everyone possibly could be covered thank
you

03:08:47.690 --> 03:08:47.700 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:08:49.370 --> 03:08:49.380 align:start position:0%

03:08:52.429 --> 03:08:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:54.590 --> 03:08:54.600 align:start position:0%

motion passes 19-1 at this point I would
 
03:10:18.730 --> 03:10:18.740 align:start position:0%
like to make a motion of otpa
 
03:10:23.269 --> 03:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:24.830 --> 03:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
um I think that we've spent enough time
 
03:10:28.010 --> 03:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
discussing it because the the first the
 
03:10:29.389 --> 03:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
motion on the amendment covered the
 
03:10:32.450 --> 03:10:32.460 align:start position:0%
actual bill I think that um there's no
 
03:10:34.250 --> 03:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
excuse to kill anyone
 
03:10:34.260 --> 03:10:36.050 align:start position:0%
excuse to kill anyone
and

03:10:36.050 --> 03:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:10:38.690 --> 03:10:38.700 align:start position:0%
for anyone who might contemplate making
 
03:10:40.550 --> 03:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
one out of these reasons in the
 
03:10:42.349 --> 03:10:42.359 align:start position:0%
amendment that we just passed
 
03:10:44.030 --> 03:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
um they're not going to be able to and I
 
03:10:45.110 --> 03:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
think that's a step in the right
 
03:10:47.630 --> 03:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
direction and I applaud the sponsor for
 
03:10:49.969 --> 03:10:49.979 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill to us and certainly
 
03:10:52.429 --> 03:10:52.439 align:start position:0%
want to recognize the importance of the
 
03:10:54.410 --> 03:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:10:57.050 --> 03:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
of killing any anyone thinking of using
 
03:11:01.370 --> 03:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
the gay defense as an act of violence so
 
03:11:06.590 --> 03:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:08.510 --> 03:11:08.520 align:start position:0%

we had heard in the testimony reps Hall
about

03:12:48.530 --> 03:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:12:50.750 --> 03:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
for for a first time

um
 
03:13:00.349 --> 03:13:00.359 align:start position:0%
you know the the impacts of a person's
 
03:13:02.929 --> 03:13:02.939 align:start position:0%
job and or being able to gain employment
 
03:13:06.349 --> 03:13:06.359 align:start position:0%
afterwards and we are not changing
 
03:13:08.870 --> 03:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
anything about about possession or any
 
03:13:10.010 --> 03:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
of that part of the law this is
 
03:13:12.950 --> 03:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
basically just a
 
03:13:15.950 --> 03:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
just to I I guess it's almost uh given a
 
03:13:17.809 --> 03:13:17.819 align:start position:0%
person a chance for that for that first
 
03:13:20.450 --> 03:13:20.460 align:start position:0%
time offense to be able to bring things
 
03:13:22.250 --> 03:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
back together and give them a second
 
03:13:24.349 --> 03:13:24.359 align:start position:0%
second chance around
 
03:13:25.910 --> 03:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gather I would
 
03:13:29.690 --> 03:13:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:31.429 --> 03:13:31.439 align:start position:0%
um I'll start discussion I brought this
 
03:13:31.439 --> 03:13:32.750 align:start position:0%
um I'll start discussion I brought this
bill

03:13:32.750 --> 03:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:13:35.210 --> 03:13:35.220 align:start position:0%
because not because I think that we
 
03:13:36.170 --> 03:13:36.180 align:start position:0%
should be
 
03:13:36.180 --> 03:13:36.769 align:start position:0%
should be
um

03:13:36.769 --> 03:13:36.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:40.429 --> 03:13:40.439 align:start position:0%
weaker on on the use and Drugs in this
 
03:13:43.010 --> 03:13:43.020 align:start position:0%
in this state but because we need to
 
03:13:45.110 --> 03:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
stop making felons
 
03:13:45.120 --> 03:13:46.010 align:start position:0%
stop making felons
um

03:13:46.010 --> 03:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:48.469 --> 03:13:48.479 align:start position:0%
the effects of a felony on someone's
 
03:13:51.410 --> 03:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
life at a young age are almost
 
03:13:53.929 --> 03:13:53.939 align:start position:0%
incalculable it carries them and follows
 
03:13:55.849 --> 03:13:55.859 align:start position:0%
them the rest of their lives and it
 
03:13:57.230 --> 03:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
almost makes
 
03:14:00.290 --> 03:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
the hope of redemption and change out of
 
03:14:03.010 --> 03:14:03.020 align:start position:0%
Out Of Reach and it it just sends them
 
03:14:07.010 --> 03:14:07.020 align:start position:0%
automatically on a mental path where I
 
03:14:09.650 --> 03:14:09.660 align:start position:0%
can never get rid of this felony and the
 
03:14:11.630 --> 03:14:11.640 align:start position:0%
incentive to better themselves is just
 
03:14:14.690 --> 03:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
taken away and when I saw the disparity
 
03:14:18.530 --> 03:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
that with which this affects communities
 
03:14:21.410 --> 03:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
um of color in in this state and across
 
03:14:23.690 --> 03:14:23.700 align:start position:0%
the country I think that we need to stop
 
03:14:25.790 --> 03:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
making felons of our of our young folks
 
03:14:28.670 --> 03:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
and and when they make a mistake give
 
03:14:30.830 --> 03:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
them a chance to get help and back on
 
03:14:33.590 --> 03:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
track and
 
03:14:35.929 --> 03:14:35.939 align:start position:0%
they're just I just don't understand why
 
03:14:37.550 --> 03:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
we would want to continue making these
 
03:14:40.190 --> 03:14:40.200 align:start position:0%
people felons on such a level
 
03:14:43.730 --> 03:14:43.740 align:start position:0%
um so quickly so that's that anyone else
 
03:14:45.950 --> 03:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
03:14:47.750 --> 03:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
um I would just like to add um I'm
 
03:14:49.070 --> 03:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely in support of this Bill thank
 
03:14:50.389 --> 03:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
you for bringing it
 
03:14:51.889 --> 03:14:51.899 align:start position:0%
um and agree with all the things that
 
03:14:53.510 --> 03:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
you said also I think you know we really
 
03:14:55.730 --> 03:14:55.740 align:start position:0%
we need to make a shift in how we deal
 
03:14:58.130 --> 03:14:58.140 align:start position:0%
with people who have issues with
 
03:15:02.150 --> 03:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
substance use or you know um it it is a
 
03:15:03.349 --> 03:15:03.359 align:start position:0%
matter of
 
03:15:05.210 --> 03:15:05.220 align:start position:0%
um treating people as if they are a part
 
03:15:07.010 --> 03:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
of our community or other Rising them
 
03:15:08.870 --> 03:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
separating them and making them a felon
 
03:15:10.790 --> 03:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
is is essentially what you are saying
 
03:15:12.410 --> 03:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
putting somebody at a disadvantage
 
03:15:14.809 --> 03:15:14.819 align:start position:0%
putting them outside of our community
 
03:15:16.969 --> 03:15:16.979 align:start position:0%
and only harm can come from that so I
 
03:15:18.530 --> 03:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
just wanted to kind of just expand on
 
03:15:19.969 --> 03:15:19.979 align:start position:0%
what you said
 
03:15:21.410 --> 03:15:21.420 align:start position:0%

03:33:12.050 --> 03:33:12.060 align:start position:0%
amendment is to uh to HB 89 this is the
 
03:33:14.389 --> 03:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
bill that would actually annul uh the
 
03:33:16.849 --> 03:33:16.859 align:start position:0%

house in New Hampshire
 
03:33:23.630 --> 03:33:23.640 align:start position:0%
um uh the amendment actually addresses
 
03:33:26.090 --> 03:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
some concerns that uh House Council had
 
03:33:28.910 --> 03:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
about some of the the language that was
 
03:33:31.610 --> 03:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
used in the original Bill and so
 
03:33:34.250 --> 03:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
essentially the amendment dot CIS
 
03:33:38.090 --> 03:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
crosses the t's and helps us achieve our
 
03:33:40.070 --> 03:33:40.080 align:start position:0%

the last three sessions and as
 
03:36:01.670 --> 03:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative janvin said uh this is
 
03:36:02.870 --> 03:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
something that's important to the people
 
03:36:05.990 --> 03:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
of Hampton uh these issues are important
 
03:36:08.809 --> 03:36:08.819 align:start position:0%
to a lot of people uh whenever we can't
 
03:36:10.670 --> 03:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
go back in history and correct an
 
03:36:12.889 --> 03:36:12.899 align:start position:0%
injustice but what we can do is we can
 
03:36:16.370 --> 03:36:16.380 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that uh an injustice took
 
03:36:19.670 --> 03:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
place we can't correct the Injustice but
 
03:36:21.110 --> 03:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
what we can do is we can correct the
 
03:36:22.910 --> 03:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
record and that's really what we're
 
03:36:26.330 --> 03:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
attempting to do uh with this bill this
 
03:36:28.490 --> 03:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
was an important bill to other
 
03:36:30.290 --> 03:36:30.300 align:start position:0%
representatives in Hampton one was the
 
03:36:32.809 --> 03:36:32.819 align:start position:0%
former chair of this committee uh it was
 
03:36:35.750 --> 03:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
one of the uh the last bills that he
 
03:36:38.510 --> 03:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsored in the last session uh
 
03:36:42.590 --> 03:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
so uh hopefully we can uh we can we can
 
03:36:44.450 --> 03:36:44.460 align:start position:0%
get this thing through and I and I thank
 
03:36:46.610 --> 03:36:46.620 align:start position:0%
the chair uh for all of his efforts
 
03:36:49.729 --> 03:36:49.739 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes uh to make this happen
 
03:36:51.110 --> 03:36:51.120 align:start position:0%

I'm sorry representative gathway would
 
03:36:59.830 --> 03:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to you a second
 
03:37:04.370 --> 03:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
thank you I would um I would add that I
 
03:37:06.349 --> 03:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
was very careful with this and I went to
 
03:37:07.910 --> 03:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
House Council and we contemplated
 
03:37:09.769 --> 03:37:09.779 align:start position:0%
contact in the Supreme Court to make
 
03:37:11.690 --> 03:37:11.700 align:start position:0%
sure that we weren't violating any
 
03:37:14.269 --> 03:37:14.279 align:start position:0%
separation of powers issues
 
03:37:17.410 --> 03:37:17.420 align:start position:0%
um the the statutes in the Constitution
 
03:37:19.910 --> 03:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
reserves certain rights to the courts
 
03:37:22.670 --> 03:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
and to the executive branch with as far
 
03:37:24.229 --> 03:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
as Pardons and things of that nature
 
03:37:27.050 --> 03:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
what this is doing is this is saying as
 
03:37:29.870 --> 03:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
a body we do not agree with what was
 
03:37:32.210 --> 03:37:32.220 align:start position:0%
done and we feel that this should be
 
03:37:35.809 --> 03:37:35.819 align:start position:0%
corrected at least historically so that
 
03:37:37.370 --> 03:37:37.380 align:start position:0%
we can go on the record of saying that
 
03:37:39.550 --> 03:37:39.560 align:start position:0%
these were wrong these things were wrong
 
03:37:43.130 --> 03:37:43.140 align:start position:0%
it does not have a legal binding effect
 
03:37:46.389 --> 03:37:46.399 align:start position:0%
as if uh pardon were issued but
 
03:37:49.370 --> 03:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
the voice of the legislature is going to
 
03:37:53.090 --> 03:37:53.100 align:start position:0%
speak on it any further comments or
 
03:37:56.090 --> 03:37:56.100 align:start position:0%

03:40:13.250 --> 03:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
um additionally it you know fish the the
 
03:40:14.990 --> 03:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
job the fishing game have this this
 
03:40:16.190 --> 03:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
would quite literally be putting the
 
03:40:18.769 --> 03:40:18.779 align:start position:0%
handcuffs on them and considering that
 
03:40:20.030 --> 03:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
these are not emergencies whenever
 
03:40:22.490 --> 03:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
they're they're doing their job
 
03:40:24.469 --> 03:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
that would be it would take hours if not
 
03:40:27.349 --> 03:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
days in order to get the search warrant
 
03:40:30.110 --> 03:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
um the site of fish and game alone
 
03:40:31.729 --> 03:40:31.739 align:start position:0%
does actually
 
03:40:34.309 --> 03:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
um entice better behavior and all the
 
03:40:35.510 --> 03:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
way around I could go on and on because
 
03:40:37.190 --> 03:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
I have three pages of it but at the end
 
03:40:39.469 --> 03:40:39.479 align:start position:0%
of the day everybody that was here
 
03:40:42.290 --> 03:40:42.300 align:start position:0%
did did not want this to pass for the
 
03:40:43.910 --> 03:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
record except for the sponsor that's
 
03:40:46.610 --> 03:40:46.620 align:start position:0%
true story representative gathroy or no
 
03:40:47.990 --> 03:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
exception isn't true would you like to
 
03:40:49.610 --> 03:40:49.620 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
03:40:54.889 --> 03:40:54.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:57.769 --> 03:40:57.779 align:start position:0%
in the focus of their fishing game
 
03:40:57.779 --> 03:40:59.570 align:start position:0%
in the focus of their fishing game
duties

03:40:59.570 --> 03:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
duties
 
03:41:01.929 --> 03:41:01.939 align:start position:0%
um getting a warrant would be
 
03:41:04.150 --> 03:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
very cumbersome
 
03:41:07.610 --> 03:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
and they do their job very well when
 
03:41:10.250 --> 03:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
they switch into motor vehicle stops or
 
03:41:12.769 --> 03:41:12.779 align:start position:0%
anything else they understand that
 
03:41:17.090 --> 03:41:17.100 align:start position:0%
all those regular rules uh of search and
 
03:41:19.550 --> 03:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
seizure apply to them and they would get
 
03:41:23.570 --> 03:41:23.580 align:start position:0%
the warrants so I don't see any need to
 
03:41:25.910 --> 03:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
be changing anything that's been working
 
03:41:27.590 --> 03:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
very well
 
03:41:30.710 --> 03:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll open discussion by saying
 
03:41:32.990 --> 03:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
I I took the concerns of the Prime
 
03:41:34.790 --> 03:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
sponsor very seriously I looked at the
 
03:41:37.910 --> 03:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
statutes if it were the case that fish
 
03:41:41.630 --> 03:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
and game could go on the roads and start
 
03:41:44.330 --> 03:41:44.340 align:start position:0%
enforcing motor vehicle violations and
 
03:41:47.570 --> 03:41:47.580 align:start position:0%
search vehicles and persons that had
 
03:41:49.250 --> 03:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with their fish and game
 
03:41:52.490 --> 03:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
activities without warrant I would
 
03:41:55.729 --> 03:41:55.739 align:start position:0%
certainly be in favor of this but I
 
03:41:57.590 --> 03:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
spoke to the house Council I asked the
 
03:41:59.570 --> 03:41:59.580 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and the Fish
 
03:42:01.910 --> 03:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
and Game all of them seem to be of the
 
03:42:04.130 --> 03:42:04.140 align:start position:0%
same mind that that was not the case and
 
03:42:06.950 --> 03:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
could not provide a case an actual case
 
03:42:09.229 --> 03:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
where this happened if such a case
 
03:42:11.809 --> 03:42:11.819 align:start position:0%
exists in the future I would be happy to
 
03:42:14.870 --> 03:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
entertain this bill again but at the
 
03:42:17.469 --> 03:42:17.479 align:start position:0%
this point it does not seem necessary
 
03:42:19.969 --> 03:42:19.979 align:start position:0%
their their waiver
 
03:42:22.130 --> 03:42:22.140 align:start position:0%
from having to get a search warrant is
 
03:42:24.349 --> 03:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
indeed the definition of exes and
 
03:42:26.150 --> 03:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances because every time they
 
03:42:28.010 --> 03:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
are somewhere where they have to enforce
 
03:42:30.410 --> 03:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
this law it is exigent because well
 
03:42:31.729 --> 03:42:31.739 align:start position:0%
frankly no one's going to live in the
 
03:42:32.990 --> 03:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
woods and wait for them to get a search
 
03:42:35.150 --> 03:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
warrant or on the water
 
03:42:37.130 --> 03:42:37.140 align:start position:0%
um and I would open it up for any
 
03:42:38.929 --> 03:42:38.939 align:start position:0%
further comments or discussion anyone
 
03:42:38.939 --> 03:42:40.250 align:start position:0%
further comments or discussion anyone
else

03:42:40.250 --> 03:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
else
 
03:42:42.469 --> 03:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
representative Bolden
 
03:42:44.870 --> 03:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
I was impacted by the discussion during
 
03:42:44.880 --> 03:42:46.070 align:start position:0%
I was impacted by the discussion during
the

03:42:46.070 --> 03:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:42:48.410 --> 03:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
um public hearing about
 
03:42:50.990 --> 03:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
the concept that you waive certain
 
03:42:53.269 --> 03:42:53.279 align:start position:0%
rights when you apply for a license and
 
03:42:55.429 --> 03:42:55.439 align:start position:0%
I appreciated hearing about that
 
03:42:58.010 --> 03:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
and the aspect that it's communal
 
03:43:00.110 --> 03:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
property and
 
03:43:01.729 --> 03:43:01.739 align:start position:0%
um that that's the purpose of uh
 
03:43:05.090 --> 03:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
licensing and the regulation
 
03:43:07.010 --> 03:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
that's all thanks thank you that and
 
03:43:09.229 --> 03:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
that that makes perfect sense
 
03:43:10.849 --> 03:43:10.859 align:start position:0%
um anyone else

you take them for you take them at their
 
03:45:02.210 --> 03:45:02.220 align:start position:0%
word that what their intentions are and

achieve with with the bill
 
03:45:10.130 --> 03:45:10.140 align:start position:0%
and I have tried very hard to figure out
 
03:45:12.110 --> 03:45:12.120 align:start position:0%
exactly what the intention was with this
 
03:45:14.330 --> 03:45:14.340 align:start position:0%
particular Bill and I'm I'm not really
 
03:45:16.790 --> 03:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
sure to be honest with you I do know
 
03:45:20.030 --> 03:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
that the the people that work for the
 
03:45:21.710 --> 03:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Coalition
 
03:45:23.630 --> 03:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
um against domestic violence and sexual
 
03:45:23.640 --> 03:45:25.490 align:start position:0%
um against domestic violence and sexual
assault

03:45:25.490 --> 03:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
assault
 
03:45:27.710 --> 03:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
that becomes their lives and they lose
 
03:45:30.050 --> 03:45:30.060 align:start position:0%
sleep at night over some of the horror
 
03:45:31.910 --> 03:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
stories that they hear they have worked
 
03:45:33.710 --> 03:45:33.720 align:start position:0%
diligently to
 
03:45:36.469 --> 03:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
continue the the progress and to go
 
03:45:38.389 --> 03:45:38.399 align:start position:0%
backwards with changing some of the
 
03:45:40.969 --> 03:45:40.979 align:start position:0%
protections have been put into place is
 
03:45:42.550 --> 03:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
is awful
 
03:45:46.729 --> 03:45:46.739 align:start position:0%
and directly from a printout that we got
 
03:45:48.889 --> 03:45:48.899 align:start position:0%
it victims should never be responsible
 
03:45:50.330 --> 03:45:50.340 align:start position:0%
for the crimes committed against them
 
03:45:52.070 --> 03:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
nor is it the victim's job to impose the
 
03:45:53.269 --> 03:45:53.279 align:start position:0%
bill conditions or determine the
 
03:45:55.790 --> 03:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
resolutions that or the restitution I'm
 
03:45:58.969 --> 03:45:58.979 align:start position:0%
sorry that that that that says it all
 
03:46:03.349 --> 03:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
um additionally if you can start to
 
03:46:05.809 --> 03:46:05.819 align:start position:0%
pay off your victims so that they will
 
03:46:08.510 --> 03:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
drop their charges we're really going
 
03:46:10.849 --> 03:46:10.859 align:start position:0%
backwards now and
 
03:46:13.250 --> 03:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
you know was also stated that oh I I
 
03:46:15.110 --> 03:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
believe that these people they have tons
 
03:46:16.969 --> 03:46:16.979 align:start position:0%
of support and they have all these
 
03:46:19.070 --> 03:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
Advocates that's that's not true it is
 
03:46:22.610 --> 03:46:22.620 align:start position:0%
it is not easy for the victims of any of
 
03:46:25.309 --> 03:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
these crimes and a lot of times the
 
03:46:26.750 --> 03:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
person that is assigned to help them
 
03:46:28.849 --> 03:46:28.859 align:start position:0%
works for the court they work for the
 
03:46:31.790 --> 03:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
DA's office to kind of be the liaison in
 
03:46:34.550 --> 03:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
a stopping point between that victim and
 
03:46:35.870 --> 03:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
the actual
 
03:46:37.910 --> 03:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
um attorney the kind of you know help
 
03:46:39.170 --> 03:46:39.180 align:start position:0%
field some of those calls not
 
03:46:41.210 --> 03:46:41.220 align:start position:0%
necessarily to advocate for them
 
03:46:44.389 --> 03:46:44.399 align:start position:0%
and um it's also important to remember
 
03:46:47.389 --> 03:46:47.399 align:start position:0%
that the victim of these crimes
 
03:46:50.389 --> 03:46:50.399 align:start position:0%
they are the state's witness they don't
 
03:46:52.610 --> 03:46:52.620 align:start position:0%
they don't just have protections they
 
03:46:56.389 --> 03:46:56.399 align:start position:0%
they are there to assist but it is not
 
03:46:59.570 --> 03:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
their it's not necessarily against them
 
03:47:02.330 --> 03:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
um I I could go on and on but I don't
 
03:47:03.830 --> 03:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
think I need to
 
03:47:05.570 --> 03:47:05.580 align:start position:0%
got to
 
03:47:07.790 --> 03:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
Q representative representative Murphy
 
03:47:08.750 --> 03:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to you a second
 
03:47:12.110 --> 03:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
yes I would thank you Mr chair
 
03:47:16.490 --> 03:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
um I strongly support an itl of uh of
 
03:47:18.650 --> 03:47:18.660 align:start position:0%
this bill although
 
03:47:21.229 --> 03:47:21.239 align:start position:0%
um as it's presented it's it's you know
 
03:47:23.750 --> 03:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
amending the victim's Bill of Rights it
 
03:47:26.090 --> 03:47:26.100 align:start position:0%
quite honestly does the opposite
 
03:47:28.010 --> 03:47:28.020 align:start position:0%
um given that about half of all murder
 
03:47:30.950 --> 03:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
cases are domestic violence cases and 80
 
03:47:35.090 --> 03:47:35.100 align:start position:0%
of DV cases would be dismissed if HB 545
 
03:47:35.100 --> 03:47:36.710 align:start position:0%
of DV cases would be dismissed if HB 545
passes

03:47:36.710 --> 03:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
passes
 
03:47:38.929 --> 03:47:38.939 align:start position:0%
um it sets the stage for victim and
 
03:47:41.809 --> 03:47:41.819 align:start position:0%
witness intimidation
 
03:47:43.969 --> 03:47:43.979 align:start position:0%
um and given that the state has the duty
 
03:47:46.429 --> 03:47:46.439 align:start position:0%
to protect Society at large from the
 
03:47:49.550 --> 03:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
defendant's behavior I strongly support
 
03:47:52.030 --> 03:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
an itl
 
03:47:52.040 --> 03:47:53.929 align:start position:0%
an itl
discussion

03:47:53.929 --> 03:47:53.939 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
03:47:56.510 --> 03:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
03:47:59.570 --> 03:47:59.580 align:start position:0%
um I would just like to say having
 
03:48:01.670 --> 03:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
um worked with many people
 
03:48:03.769 --> 03:48:03.779 align:start position:0%
um who have been victims of domestic
 
03:48:06.830 --> 03:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
violence I think that unfortunately what
 
03:48:09.530 --> 03:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
this bill would do is that it would kind
 
03:48:11.450 --> 03:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
of exploit
 
03:48:13.490 --> 03:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
03:48:15.410 --> 03:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think of a better word
 
03:48:17.690 --> 03:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
than to tell you exploit the the state
 
03:48:20.690 --> 03:48:20.700 align:start position:0%
of mind that people are put in when
 
03:48:22.490 --> 03:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
they're victims of domestic violence and
 
03:48:25.010 --> 03:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
it would basically weaponize that
 
03:48:26.510 --> 03:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
against them or has the potential to
 
03:48:28.670 --> 03:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
weaponize that against
 
03:48:31.849 --> 03:48:31.859 align:start position:0%
um them so yeah I'm voting idea
 
03:48:34.729 --> 03:48:34.739 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
03:48:37.130 --> 03:48:37.140 align:start position:0%
seeing nonetheless to call the rule the
 
03:48:39.769 --> 03:48:39.779 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair I vote uh House Bill

03:49:58.849 --> 03:49:58.859 align:start position:0%
is there a second second second by

representative Manion
 
03:50:02.150 --> 03:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative Bree would you like to
 
03:50:04.550 --> 03:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion thank you yes
 
03:50:06.110 --> 03:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
um the controlled Drug Act was
 
03:50:09.830 --> 03:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
instituted in um in 1970 with amendments
 
03:50:11.870 --> 03:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
made throughout the years
 
03:50:14.150 --> 03:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
um it has served as a good guide for
 
03:50:16.370 --> 03:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
medical professionals
 
03:50:19.910 --> 03:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
um and law as well and I feel that at
 
03:50:21.469 --> 03:50:21.479 align:start position:0%
this time
 
03:50:24.229 --> 03:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
um to repeal that even for with a study
 
03:50:27.410 --> 03:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
committee is premature and with our drug
 
03:50:27.420 --> 03:50:28.070 align:start position:0%
committee is premature and with our drug
um

03:50:28.070 --> 03:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:31.610 --> 03:50:31.620 align:start position:0%
problem we're facing it I don't think
 
03:50:34.070 --> 03:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
there's any benefit to this maybe we can
 
03:50:37.429 --> 03:50:37.439 align:start position:0%
revisit in a few years when drug laws
 
03:50:39.469 --> 03:50:39.479 align:start position:0%
regarding marijuana change we can
 
03:50:41.630 --> 03:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
revisit it then but right now
 
03:50:45.170 --> 03:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
I moved to itl this bill
 
03:50:46.550 --> 03:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Manuel would
 
03:50:48.050 --> 03:50:48.060 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to you second no
 
03:50:48.060 --> 03:50:49.550 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to you second no
thanks

03:50:49.550 --> 03:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
03:50:52.969 --> 03:50:52.979 align:start position:0%
I would um I'll start the discussion
 
03:50:52.979 --> 03:50:53.690 align:start position:0%
I would um I'll start the discussion
um

03:50:53.690 --> 03:50:53.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:55.910 --> 03:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
I think that folks that support
 
03:50:59.389 --> 03:50:59.399 align:start position:0%
marijuana legalization need to be very
 
03:51:02.510 --> 03:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
careful of these bills right now the
 
03:51:04.729 --> 03:51:04.739 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
03:51:06.830 --> 03:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
it's kind of turned in a blind eye to
 
03:51:09.530 --> 03:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
some of the states that are selling and
 
03:51:11.710 --> 03:51:11.720 align:start position:0%
allowing marijuana for even medical use
 
03:51:14.269 --> 03:51:14.279 align:start position:0%
currently it is still illegal federally
 
03:51:16.910 --> 03:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
and at any point that could change in
 
03:51:18.530 --> 03:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
the federal government could decide to
 
03:51:20.690 --> 03:51:20.700 align:start position:0%
come in and shut everything down and
 
03:51:22.250 --> 03:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
arrest everyone involved in the
 
03:51:24.650 --> 03:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
production distribution selling medical
 
03:51:26.990 --> 03:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
marijuana cards or not
 
03:51:28.729 --> 03:51:28.739 align:start position:0%
until such time as the federal
 
03:51:31.450 --> 03:51:31.460 align:start position:0%
government changes these laws
 
03:51:34.130 --> 03:51:34.140 align:start position:0%
continuing to flout them by trying to
 
03:51:36.290 --> 03:51:36.300 align:start position:0%
legalize all kinds of different drugs at
 
03:51:38.330 --> 03:51:38.340 align:start position:0%
the same time is going to get the
 
03:51:40.370 --> 03:51:40.380 align:start position:0%
attention you don't want and it's going
 
03:51:43.130 --> 03:51:43.140 align:start position:0%
to bring the enforcement hammer down we
 
03:51:45.050 --> 03:51:45.060 align:start position:0%
need to move our federal delegates to
 
03:51:46.969 --> 03:51:46.979 align:start position:0%
change the laws at that level
 
03:51:48.769 --> 03:51:48.779 align:start position:0%
before we continue
 
03:51:51.170 --> 03:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
to pass legalization bills at the state
 
03:51:52.729 --> 03:51:52.739 align:start position:0%
level that are just going to bring
 
03:51:54.410 --> 03:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
negative attention to the populace of
 
03:51:56.269 --> 03:51:56.279 align:start position:0%
the state and some people who rely on
 
03:51:58.309 --> 03:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana for their medical
 
03:52:00.349 --> 03:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
conditions will suffer
 
03:52:03.349 --> 03:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Newell
 
03:52:05.570 --> 03:52:05.580 align:start position:0%
um just to say quickly agree
 
03:52:06.910 --> 03:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
um also
 
03:52:10.490 --> 03:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
I am completely for decriminalization
 
03:52:12.349 --> 03:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
and legalization
 
03:52:15.530 --> 03:52:15.540 align:start position:0%
um I do feel like it needs to be done in
 
03:52:18.110 --> 03:52:18.120 align:start position:0%
a specific way it needs to be done in a
 
03:52:20.990 --> 03:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
in a responsible way starting with what
 
03:52:22.790 --> 03:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
you said as well
 
03:52:24.469 --> 03:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
um and you know there needs to be Sports
 
03:52:27.229 --> 03:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
there needs to be regulation around it I
 
03:52:30.229 --> 03:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
just feel uh very strongly about
 
03:52:32.510 --> 03:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
um not being illegal but it being legal
 
03:52:33.769 --> 03:52:33.779 align:start position:0%
in the right way so that people are
 
03:52:37.250 --> 03:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
protected and using responsibly and the
 
03:52:40.910 --> 03:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:43.250 --> 03:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler with respect to
 
03:52:45.530 --> 03:52:45.540 align:start position:0%
representative Reed the chairman and
 
03:52:47.570 --> 03:52:47.580 align:start position:0%
representative Newell I do disagree with
 
03:52:50.510 --> 03:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
the itl motion seeing as though the
 
03:52:53.030 --> 03:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
controlled Drug Act was passed in 1971
 
03:52:58.490 --> 03:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
and to paraphrase what the assistant uh
 
03:53:00.650 --> 03:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
to the assistant to the president for
 
03:53:03.530 --> 03:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
domestic affairs said uh when asked
 
03:53:06.769 --> 03:53:06.779 align:start position:0%
about the controlled Drug Act it was we
 
03:53:08.809 --> 03:53:08.819 align:start position:0%
couldn't illegalize being against the
 
03:53:11.090 --> 03:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
war or being black so we had to
 
03:53:14.030 --> 03:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
illegalize being we had to illegalize
 
03:53:16.250 --> 03:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
cannabis for the hippies and heroin for
 
03:53:18.769 --> 03:53:18.779 align:start position:0%
the blacks and criminalize them as much
 
03:53:21.050 --> 03:53:21.060 align:start position:0%
as possible and seeing as though that
 
03:53:23.210 --> 03:53:23.220 align:start position:0%
was the intent for the controlled Drug
 
03:53:25.190 --> 03:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
Act when it was passed they didn't think
 
03:53:26.809 --> 03:53:26.819 align:start position:0%
too much into it there wasn't the
 
03:53:28.670 --> 03:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily regulations to make sure it
 
03:53:31.630 --> 03:53:31.640 align:start position:0%
was safe and a cogent policy they just
 
03:53:35.090 --> 03:53:35.100 align:start position:0%
implemented it to stop uh discussion on
 
03:53:38.630 --> 03:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
the war in Vietnam and uh organizing
 
03:53:40.010 --> 03:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
that was going on in the black
 
03:53:42.769 --> 03:53:42.779 align:start position:0%
communities I think repealing a law
 
03:53:45.410 --> 03:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
which was so egregiously passed would be
 
03:53:47.150 --> 03:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
beneficial for the New Hampshire state
 
03:53:49.490 --> 03:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
government and I think the harms that
 
03:53:52.250 --> 03:53:52.260 align:start position:0%
you illustrate would be worthwhile
 
03:53:54.290 --> 03:53:54.300 align:start position:0%
because sometimes there has to be some
 
03:53:56.570 --> 03:53:56.580 align:start position:0%
negative conversations to get to to
 
03:53:57.830 --> 03:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
where you want to go in terms of
 
03:53:59.809 --> 03:53:59.819 align:start position:0%
repealing doing something so egregious
 
03:54:02.570 --> 03:54:02.580 align:start position:0%
so I'll be voting against the itl motion
 
03:54:05.870 --> 03:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you and I respect your opinion and
 
03:54:07.610 --> 03:54:07.620 align:start position:0%
who knows which one of us is right but
 
03:54:10.190 --> 03:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
until we get the feds to fix it we're
 
03:54:12.349 --> 03:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
really just spinning our Wheels any
 
03:54:14.330 --> 03:54:14.340 align:start position:0%

they want to they seem to have a process
 
03:56:34.670 --> 03:56:34.680 align:start position:0%

03:56:36.710 --> 03:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
didn't seem to they didn't take a side
 
03:56:38.570 --> 03:56:38.580 align:start position:0%

costly

03:56:41.809 --> 03:56:41.819 align:start position:0%

talk about this uh I'm in agreement with
 
03:59:14.269 --> 03:59:14.279 align:start position:0%
this I just think that there was some
 
03:59:16.429 --> 03:59:16.439 align:start position:0%
confusion amongst the committee as to
 
03:59:18.830 --> 03:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
representative mania's testimony I would
 
03:59:20.570 --> 03:59:20.580 align:start position:0%
request that we have a subcommittee on
 
03:59:23.269 --> 03:59:23.279 align:start position:0%
this to get more information out of it
 
03:59:26.389 --> 03:59:26.399 align:start position:0%
very pretty I am
 
03:59:28.429 --> 03:59:28.439 align:start position:0%
you know I I'm inclined to agree I I
 
03:59:30.110 --> 03:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
don't think we really understood what
 
03:59:31.849 --> 03:59:31.859 align:start position:0%
the heck just happened
 
03:59:34.790 --> 03:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
um so I I would like to um I'd like to
 
03:59:37.309 --> 03:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna go ahead and take that advice
 
03:59:40.490 --> 03:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
and uh I'll withdraw my second if um
 
03:59:40.500 --> 03:59:42.410 align:start position:0%

to appoint a subcommittee and we are
 
04:00:01.729 --> 04:00:01.739 align:start position:0%

04:00:03.889 --> 04:00:03.899 align:start position:0%
