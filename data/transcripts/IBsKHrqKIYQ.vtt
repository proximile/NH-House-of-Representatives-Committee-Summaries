from their Loft in Cambridge and
 
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes they said something that made
 
00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
sense I remember one of the things that
 
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
they stressed and we all
 
00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 align:start position:0%
accepted freedom of
 
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 align:start position:0%

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 align:start position:0%
in the 1930s in Germany and continuing
 
00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
on since 1918 and what was once Russia
 
00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 align:start position:0%
there was no freedom of conscience if
 
00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 align:start position:0%
you had talent and ability you did what
 
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
what you were told no matter what your
 
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
personal belief system
 
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
was or
 
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
else later on folks in my town were
 
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
supporters of the Vietnam War but we did
 
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
understand there was a place for

objectors reluctantly we concluded that
 
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes the Goos made
 
00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
sense I'm part-time CEO of a medical

clinic my wife is a practicing
 
00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 align:start position:0%

and students alike if we start to move

and students alike if we start to move
against

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
conscience where will it end the present
 
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
environment where students and those
 
00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
already in practice a toll to ignore
 
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
their convictions in making ethical
 
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
decisions has led to
 
00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
increasing moral injury is the term
 
00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:35.390 align:start position:0%
increasing moral injury is the term
amongst

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
amongst
 
00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
professionals students in fear of
 
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 align:start position:0%
speaking up in their academic
 
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
institutions you can speak all the truth
 
00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 align:start position:0%
you want to power but good luck in your
 
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
career the reluctance of speaking truth
 
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
to power a hesitation to pursue certain
 
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
Specialties for fear of the pressure to
 
00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 align:start position:0%
violate one's conscience and the erosion
 
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
of thinking and acting ethically in
 
00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 align:start position:0%

number of medical students in Northern
 
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
New England and what I speak of I have
 
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
heard personally from numbers of those
 
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
students we know of people who have been
 
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.550 align:start position:0%
students we know of people who have been
forced

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 align:start position:0%
forced

example names dates facts places you can
 
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
look it up we know of Physicians who are
 
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
actively looking to leave New Hampshire
 
00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
for states where their conscience will
 
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
be honored on certain matters we know of
 
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
others who will not come
 
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 align:start position:0%
here and believe me since the medical
 
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
facility she is C oo of and I am
 
00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
chairman of the board of our recruiting
 
00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:02.599 align:start position:0%
and we are hearing from people who even
 
00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:05.639 align:start position:0%
though we will not force them to violate
 
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
conscience wonder that if they move to
 
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and seek another job
 
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
eventually they might have a
 
00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:16.039 align:start position:0%
problem this bill is intended to protect
 
00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
diversity of belief within the medical
 
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
profession and will benefit patients by
 
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
protecting the supply of ethical Health
 
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.790 align:start position:0%
protecting the supply of ethical Health
Care

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
Care
 
00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 align:start position:0%
Professionals this bill does not permit
 
00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
a refusal to serve a person on the basis
 
00:07:34.749 --> 00:07:34.759 align:start position:0%
of their race color sex or any other
 
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
protected characteristic it simply
 
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
protects them from being forced to
 
00:07:44.909 --> 00:07:44.919 align:start position:0%
perform specific procedures this bill is
 
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
specifically limited to conscience-based
 
00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:51.639 align:start position:0%
objections to very specific procedures
 
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:53.720 align:start position:0%
and does not allow for a general
 
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
discrimination against any
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
patient such medical persons cannot
 
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
refuse to care for an
 
00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:04.599 align:start position:0%
individual I ran this bill
 
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
by your chairman Bob Lynn and he said
 
00:08:12.309 --> 00:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
well there were a few things in it or
 
00:08:15.309 --> 00:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
few things not in it that caused him
 
00:08:15.319 --> 00:08:17.070 align:start position:0%
few things not in it that caused him
some

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:19.720 align:start position:0%
problems and I said what are
 
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
those there are two and that is the
 
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
amendment that I put in yesterday after
 
00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:27.039 align:start position:0%
I talked with
 
00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:32.599 align:start position:0%
him number one what if a person
 
00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
decides to take a job offer from an
 
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:41.560 align:start position:0%
organization that is mostly about
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
abortions and sterilizations and so on
 
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
and then gets into that facility and
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
decides to invoke an ethical objection
 
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
well first of all I really don't expect
 
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:55.240 align:start position:0%
that to happen but it might somebody
 
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
might do it to weaponize medicine to
 
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
deliberately take that job be hired
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
refuse to do it get fired and
 
00:09:10.069 --> 00:09:10.079 align:start position:0%
Sue the amendment does not protect a
 
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
person who acts that way plus and I was
 
00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:15.519 align:start position:0%
talking with one of your members uh
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
beforehand what if you're in a little
 
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
country facility way up where on the
 
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
weekend you're kind of it and somebody
 
00:09:27.069 --> 00:09:27.079 align:start position:0%
comes in and needs a
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
procedure in an emergency to save that
 
00:09:34.269 --> 00:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
person's life this bills carves that out
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
the amendment carves that out as well I
 
00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
appreciate chairman Lynn's
 
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
clarifications because I want this to be
 
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:47.720 align:start position:0%
fair straight across the board a primary
 
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
motivation for this bill is to ensure
 
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
that Health Care Professionals come to
 
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
and stay in New Hampshire to serve our
 
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
residents and are not forced to leave
 
00:09:59.389 --> 00:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
which will hurt the supply of care here
 
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
by protecting rights of conscience we
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
are protecting the quality of care
 
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
available abortion is not going away
 
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
here anytime soon so this bill will help
 
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
protect some of our best Health Care
 
00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:14.839 align:start position:0%
Professionals who would otherwise leave
 
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
to practice in States more hospitable if
 
00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:21.079 align:start position:0%
they came in the first place let me
 
00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:23.079 align:start position:0%
conclude by saying I am arguing this
 
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
from the left politically I'm arguing
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
this from the good government liberals
 
00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
of Cambridge Massachusetts who taught me
 
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
and people in my blue collar miltown
 
00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
something about
 
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:37.720 align:start position:0%
tolerance something about the right of
 
00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
conscience I'm arguing it from that
 
00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:43.160 align:start position:0%
direction it is not primarily about
 
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:45.240 align:start position:0%
abortion although obviously it's
 
00:10:48.269 --> 00:10:48.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned it is about conscience it is
 
00:10:48.279 --> 00:10:49.870 align:start position:0%
mentioned it is about conscience it is
about

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:10:52.509 --> 00:10:52.519 align:start position:0%
liberality so that's that's what I have
 
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:55.240 align:start position:0%
to offer Mr chairman thank you any
 
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
questions of this
 
00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
witness copies of um the amendment the
 
00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
amendment the amendment and of the
 
00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
testimony because um the sponsor
 
00:11:08.629 --> 00:11:08.639 align:start position:0%
referred to the testimony he did
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
indicate he was going to turn testimony
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
in I
 
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
I do you have a copy of the amendment as
 
00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
is if anyone else has a uh P card you
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:39.110 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
Horgan I'm wondering
 
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:45.160 align:start position:0%
um you you picked out a fairly narrow
 
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
range of medical procedures where you
 
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:49.240 align:start position:0%
can exercise your right of conscience so
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
why is it just those particular
 
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:54.200 align:start position:0%
procedures and not uh a wider range of
 
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
procedures because there probably are
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
other procedures that at least some
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
individuals may have ethical qualms
 
00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:02.519 align:start position:0%
about participating in thank you
 
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative for your question that's
 
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:05.720 align:start position:0%
a very good question I've been thinking
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
about that um these are the people with
 
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
whom my wife and I have been speaking
 
00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519 align:start position:0%
this is their particular issue there may
 
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
well be other issues too as you state
 
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
and let somebody else come with a bill
 
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
on that issue or those
 
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
issues this is the issue that uh we are
 
00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:31.399 align:start position:0%
responding to in part because of a
 
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
couple of experiences of people being
 
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
fired in this state so that's why we're
 
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
not saying it's the only one we're just
 
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
saying that's the one we have chosen to
 
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:43.720 align:start position:0%
work with at this
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
penel thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson for taking my
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
question we have all seen the headlines
 
00:12:57.189 --> 00:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
coming out of states such as Texas where
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
they have heartbeat laws and the claims
 
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
that Physicians are unable to
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
treat persons who have participated in
 
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
an abortion who come into a hospital
 
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
facility and um have been purported to
 
00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%
be denied treatment now I personally
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
find it unconscionable that a physician
 
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
would deny treatment to a woman who
 
00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:27.959 align:start position:0%
is the subject of a medical emergency
 
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:29.720 align:start position:0%
because she did something thing that the
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
physician didn't agree with I believe it
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
is the duty of the physician to care for
 
00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.350 align:start position:0%
is the duty of the physician to care for
somebody

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
regardless of how they got themselves
 
00:13:41.069 --> 00:13:41.079 align:start position:0%
into that pos position or whether it was
 
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
from somebody else is there anything in
 
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
this bill that would
 
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
prevent um a physician from treating
 
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
somebody or would it be unconscionable
 
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
for a physician to treat somebody in the
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire should they come
 
00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
in to the hospital
 
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
suffering from the result of an abortion
 
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
that has not gone the best
 
00:14:08.509 --> 00:14:08.519 align:start position:0%
way if I understand your question the
 
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
abortion has already taken
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
place yes this does not deal with that
 
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
this is conscience about being asked to
 
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
perform an abortion and the carve outs
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
or the Amendments is saying that is not
 
00:14:23.639 --> 00:14:25.030 align:start position:0%
or the Amendments is saying that is not
an

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
emergency if it's not an emergency and
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
you the doctor do not wish to perform
 
00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:35.079 align:start position:0%
one this protects you it also carves out
 
00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
if you're the only doctor in a little
 
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
facility and the person's coming in in
 
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
extremist you're going to go
 
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
ahead that's what this does thank you
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
very much you're welcome representative
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
MOS thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:52.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm reading your
 
00:14:57.629 --> 00:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
Amendment and it says um nor shall the
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
section apply to a healthcare provider
 
00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
who is the only health care provider
 
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
present in an emergency situation and I
 
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
want to ask you who determines whether
 
00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:10.839 align:start position:0%
it's an emergency situation is it the
 
00:15:13.389 --> 00:15:13.399 align:start position:0%
health care provider who would as a
 
00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
matter of conscience um choose not to
 
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
participate is it the
 
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
institution is it the treat who is it
 
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
and do we end up in a case where the
 
00:15:30.309 --> 00:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee of the health facility
 
00:15:33.629 --> 00:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
has to determine or
 
00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
litigate um whether it's an emergency
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
situation prior to care being provided
 
00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
to the person and I'm extremely
 
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
concerned about that well you who
 
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
determines normally if this is an
 
00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
emergency go to an ER and you will see
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
that there are people who jump ahead of
 
00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:55.160 align:start position:0%
30 other people sitting there in the
 
00:15:58.509 --> 00:15:58.519 align:start position:0%
room why because it has been determined
 
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
and it's whoever the triage or triage
 
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
person is it's obvious this person is in
 
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
extremist and the other ones are going
 
00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
to have to wait their turn this happens
 
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
all the time in Ys and that's what we
 
00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
would have here a person comes in not
 
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
saying I've decided I want to have an
 
00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
abortion this person is coming in where
 
00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
it is pretty obvious the life of the
 
00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:25.759 align:start position:0%
mother is being threatened there's
 
00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:27.959 align:start position:0%
various actions and noises and things
 
00:16:30.509 --> 00:16:30.519 align:start position:0%
that go on with being in extremist it
 
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
should be pretty obvious and it would
 
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
not necessarily be that doctor there are
 
00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:38.360 align:start position:0%
other people in the ER nurses and other
 
00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:40.279 align:start position:0%
people there and it would look pretty
 
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
obvious now I would imagine that if
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
the physician says oh no everything's
 
00:16:51.389 --> 00:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
well first of all I would not imagine
 
00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:53.839 align:start position:0%
that happening but let's say it did that
 
00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
person would be subject to sanctions for
 
00:16:58.269 --> 00:16:58.279 align:start position:0%
refusing emergency care to somebody
 
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:06.029 --> 00:17:06.039 align:start position:0%
emergency representative Perez thank you
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
having worked in emergency rooms in
 
00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
intensive care and 15 bed hospitals in
 
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
the mountain um are you aware that
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
emergencies are determined by a person's
 
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
vital signs not just what they say so
 
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
emergency can be
 
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
determined simply by the fact that there
 
00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:28.919 align:start position:0%
are certain things that occur they're
 
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
bleeding their blood pressure is
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
dropping their heart rate's going up um
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
their pain level is a
 
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
10 uh yes I would I'm the um unruly one
 
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
in the family I'm the liberal arts guy
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
much of my family are doctors nurses
 
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
nursing professors and so on and
 
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799 align:start position:0%
occasionally I listen to them and yeah
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
that's what they told me
 
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
too representative tur yeah thank you
 
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
and thanks for taking the question um I
 
00:17:59.950 --> 00:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
will say I have a a range of concerns on
 
00:18:02.149 --> 00:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
on this um and I shared the ones that
 
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
you raised for um uh that that chairman
 
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
Lynn raised um I'm going to add one that
 
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
I think uh as I read the bill there's
 
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
two things one is it seems that this is
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
worded to apply not just to Providers of
 
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
medical care but to basically any staff
 
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
that would be at the facilities in
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
question um and my my concern really is
 
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
not that part as much as when it's says
 
00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:31.640 align:start position:0%
that you can consciously conscientiously
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
object there's no process laid out here
 
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
for what that means it the way it I read
 
00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
this it is largely a mental decision
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
that you made and then you took action
 
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
based on that mental decision so as as
 
00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
the administrator of a of a medical
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
facility would it would it give you any
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
concern that your say scheduler might
 
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
have somebody calling asking for a
 
00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
procedure and that person would
 
00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
basically make a mental decision saying
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
I'm consciously objecting turn them away
 
00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:02.360 align:start position:0%
and you you might not even know this was
 
00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
happening there's no process that I can
 
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
see laid out for what
 
00:19:11.549 --> 00:19:11.559 align:start position:0%
objecting in involves in order that that
 
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:14.039 align:start position:0%
this be in the light of day does that
 
00:19:17.549 --> 00:19:17.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
does that wasn't the
 
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
question I think you're asking the chair
 
00:19:24.149 --> 00:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
for a
 
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:27.640 align:start position:0%
followup I I guess I need to M Mr chair
 
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
follow up reiterating what I originally
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
said does it give you any concern or do
 
00:19:36.669 --> 00:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
you see a problem with the idea that
 
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
that objecting in this bill is a process
 
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
that could take place solely in
 
00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:43.400 align:start position:0%
someone's mind and that they could take
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
action that nobody would even be aware
 
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
took I'm trying to run this as a
 
00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
parallel to conscientious objection to
 
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:56.039 align:start position:0%
the Vietnam War but I'm not having great
 
00:19:58.510 --> 00:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
success doing that but I'll work on that
 
00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.390 align:start position:0%
success doing that but I'll work on that
uh

00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I I don't P believe
 
00:20:08.029 --> 00:20:08.039 align:start position:0%
that a switchboard person would say oh
 
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't like what you're asking so
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to schedule it I think
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
anybody who did that would be fired on
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
any grounds I do hang out enough in our
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
business office to overhear what our
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
switchboard people say
 
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:29.240 align:start position:0%
and if it's uh what the patient wants
 
00:20:31.149 --> 00:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
and it's within our scope of service as
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
a family practice office they will
 
00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
simply put in the schedule I I've never
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
heard anybody say uh we don't do it
 
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:40.360 align:start position:0%
because I don't believe it we don't do
 
00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
major surgery because we're not surgeons
 
00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
so they would say I'm sorry I cannot
 
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
take out your gallbladder is not an
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
ethical question it's simply we're not
 
00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:51.640 align:start position:0%
qualified to do that so one can I have
 
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
one more followup please quickly so I I
 
00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
just wanted to draw your attention um to
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh page two lines uh you know 17 18 19
 
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
where it defines what participate or
 
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
participating in means um and it seems
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
to include things like referring for and
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
then later on in that in on line 18
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
admit for the purposes of providing so
 
00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.039 align:start position:0%
it seems to
 
00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
Encompass um any hospital or clinic
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
employee from line 14 so that that's
 
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
just to clarify why uh I think that
 
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
that's an issue all right let me respond
 
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799 align:start position:0%
to that by saying if a facility has that
 
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
as its policy it is quote pro-life
 
00:21:38.669 --> 00:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
facility I think that would fit if you
 
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
are saying that there might be a one
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
physician on the staff that has this
 
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
conscience uh and the switchboard person
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
intaking has that and makes the decision
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
on his or her own even though other
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
people in the facility would be willing
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
to do that yeah I think you've got a
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
point there I mean I think that could be
 
00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.430 align:start position:0%
point there I mean I think that could be
tweaked

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
tweaked
 
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you any other questions
 
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
representative McFarland thank you
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
chairman my first question I I was
 
00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
appreciative of Representative Horgan's
 
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
question because I was going to ask you
 
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:19.720 align:start position:0%
the same thing but I think seeing as
 
00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
you've answered that I I think the thing
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
that I'm struggling with with that
 
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
answer is that you are indicating you
 
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
have had experience is with people who
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
have been threatened with or or have
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
lost their jobs because of these kind of
 
00:22:37.269 --> 00:22:37.279 align:start position:0%
uh conscientious concerns and to my
 
00:22:39.549 --> 00:22:39.559 align:start position:0%
understanding not that I uh would object
 
00:22:41.549 --> 00:22:41.559 align:start position:0%
to having similar language in State
 
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:44.039 align:start position:0%
Statute there is language in the federal
 
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
statutes that's commonly referred to as
 
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
the Wen Amendment are you familiar with
 
00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:50.200 align:start position:0%
that vaguely I'd be happy to know more
 
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
about that if you could shoot that to me
 
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
at some point fair enough I mean my
 
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
question was essentially going to be if
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
you knew why that had not been able to
 
00:22:59.390 --> 00:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
protect these individuals but uh uh
 
00:23:00.669 --> 00:23:00.679 align:start position:0%
given that you you don't have that
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
context I I will leave that one may I
 
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up question followup um so
 
00:23:07.909 --> 00:23:07.919 align:start position:0%
with regard to your
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment would you be amenable to
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
changing the first sentence of that
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
amendment to read this section shall not
 
00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
apply to a health care provider employed
 
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
by a health care institution into a role
 
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
where such Healthcare institution
 
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
expects that individual provider to
 
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:29.240 align:start position:0%
provide abortion St Iz ation artificial
 
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:31.400 align:start position:0%
contraception as a major part of his
 
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
services and the reason for my question
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
is it troubles me that the way it's
 
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
written at the moment in that amendment
 
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
I don't know how to interpret or how the
 
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
courts would interpret a major part of
 
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh a large organization such as as you
 
00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:48.799 align:start position:0%
know our Hospital organization
 
00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:52.360 align:start position:0%
Services I think this was dashed off by
 
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
ol very quickly at the end of yesterday
 
00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
morning I having dashed it off quickly
 
00:23:59.430 --> 00:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
just before before that having talked to
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
Chairman Lyn I I think what this was
 
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
is a facility that makes this a major
 
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
part of what they do and then you decide
 
00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
to go to work there really you know
 
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
you're either disingenuous by half or
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
you really haven't thought it through um
 
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
I I want to use a different example
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
and it may be a stretch and it has
 
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with
 
00:24:30.909 --> 00:24:30.919 align:start position:0%
Healthcare the baseballer Sandy kofax
 
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
Jewish would not pitch on the Sabbath
 
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
for the Los Angeles Dodgers he was still
 
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
on the team and they worked around him
 
00:24:40.669 --> 00:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
in my hometown we had a couple of Jewish
 
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
firefighters who no matter when their
 
00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
schedule call for them to work they
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
would work on Christmas so the
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
Christians could have the day off and in
 
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
turn Christians would work on the day of
 
00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:54.039 align:start position:0%
atonement so a Jewish firefighter could
 
00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:56.039 align:start position:0%
have the day off these were
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
workarounds so in a facility where there
 
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
are numbers of
 
00:25:04.029 --> 00:25:04.039 align:start position:0%
people it could be people of Good Will
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
honoring conscience of teamw workers
 
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
could make allowances for that person
 
00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
who is saying I have ethical objections
 
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
because other people there could do
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
those things I think this is honest and
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
decent and in keeping with good
 
00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
Cambridge 1960 liberalism and if I may
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
chairman I mean I I I hope you are right
 
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
do you think it's likely that a hospital
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
organization uh in the state if this
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
were passed and with this amendment do
 
00:25:36.669 --> 00:25:36.679 align:start position:0%
you think it's likely that they would
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
try and claim that a major part of their
 
00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:43.799 align:start position:0%
services as the entity as a whole and
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not talking about a particular
 
00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:47.480 align:start position:0%
clinic or a particular facility I'm
 
00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:49.240 align:start position:0%
talking about the hospital organization
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
as a whole performs these Services as a
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
major part of their services I think
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
it's pretty obvious to prove one way or
 
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
the other what percentage what
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
procedures do you do here in your ER and
 
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
in your surgical Suites and so on what
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
percentage of that is an abortion I
 
00:26:06.909 --> 00:26:06.919 align:start position:0%
think it's pretty obvious to say either
 
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
this is a facility that majors in this
 
00:26:11.549 --> 00:26:11.559 align:start position:0%
or it
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
isn't representative pel Mr chair I have
 
00:26:17.149 --> 00:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
a procedural question um is it or is it
 
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:19.880 align:start position:0%
not appropriate for a member of our
 
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
committee to speak without being
 
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
recognized by the chair it is not
 
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate thank you thank you any
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
other questions of this Witness
 
00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.630 align:start position:0%
other questions of this Witness
representative

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
rbo thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question um to piggy back on
 
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative tur's question as I read
 
00:26:39.549 --> 00:26:39.559 align:start position:0%
this a re a receptionist or
 
00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
Administrative Assistant could decline
 
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
to schedule uh a potential patient would
 
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
not need to inform anyone at the
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
employer would not need to inform the
 
00:26:54.389 --> 00:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
person who's seeking the appointment um
 
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
would not need to refer them anywhere
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
else um is that
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
that's my first question to correct is
 
00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:03.799 align:start position:0%
that correct that is not the
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
intent and but is that the is that the
 
00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
way the bill is written is that if I
 
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
believe some people could infer that and
 
00:27:13.389 --> 00:27:13.399 align:start position:0%
good language will take away the
 
00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:15.559 align:start position:0%
possibility of multiple inferences from
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
a single sentence and it could well be
 
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
that a redo of this amendment would take
 
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
that into
 
00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
account okay may one follow up one
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you and and would you
 
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
agree that this is different from a
 
00:27:30.269 --> 00:27:30.279 align:start position:0%
conscientious objection for instance on
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
the Vietnam War where you were
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
mentioning where there was a process
 
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
where you would need to fill out a form
 
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
go before a board discuss um there was
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
an approval process uh and and how does
 
00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
that inform your thoughts on employer
 
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:46.120 align:start position:0%
rights here if they are a facility that
 
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
provides these services and they don't
 
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:52.360 align:start position:0%
have any ability to have Insight you
 
00:27:53.789 --> 00:27:53.799 align:start position:0%
know to be informed if somebody is
 
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
declining to provide scheduling for
 
00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
services I would expect in the interview
 
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
process when Dr Smith um applies for uh
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
a position that's being advertised this
 
00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:09.039 align:start position:0%
would come up I think it would be
 
00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
improper for Dr Smith to take the job
 
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:13.240 align:start position:0%
and then suddenly say oh by the way now
 
00:28:14.509 --> 00:28:14.519 align:start position:0%
that I'm here now that there's a
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
contract by the way I can't do this this
 
00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
this uh I would think that in the
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
interview process this would be made
 
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
clear and if the hospital wishes to go
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
ahead and hire that person there would
 
00:28:31.149 --> 00:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
be an understanding that this um uh
 
00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
invocation of conscience has been
 
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
accepted by the facility if they didn't
 
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
want to take that person onto the staff
 
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
they would simply say
 
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative tur thank
 
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and uh thanks again for
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
taking another question um I I don't
 
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
lose uh sight of a significant portion
 
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
of what's in this bill which is not
 
00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
related to abortion but is related to
 
00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:01.039 align:start position:0%
provision of contraception um and as I
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
read it it's basically all forms of
 
00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.950 align:start position:0%
read it it's basically all forms of
contraception

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
contraception
 
00:29:09.789 --> 00:29:09.799 align:start position:0%
um I see on page two line five that
 
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
things like pharmacies are considered
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
under the definition of a health care
 
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
institution you know so I think this
 
00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:19.559 align:start position:0%
gets at both the bill and the proposed
 
00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
amendment you know what's a significant
 
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
portion of your business you know I
 
00:29:27.789 --> 00:29:27.799 align:start position:0%
would say that most this is a question I
 
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
assume yes yes sorry I would I would say
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
that I would say that most of what a
 
00:29:36.269 --> 00:29:36.279 align:start position:0%
pharmacy does is not the provision of
 
00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
contraception but they are the major
 
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:41.240 align:start position:0%
providers of contraception so I
 
00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
guess similar to what we asked earlier
 
00:29:46.669 --> 00:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
would it be the person at the checkout
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
counter would it be the person any staff
 
00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
person within a pharmacy who could
 
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
invoke this provision and say we're not
 
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
going to offer um or assist or or even
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
check you out for a contraceptive
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
question and this is what I love to do
 
00:30:12.509 --> 00:30:12.519 align:start position:0%
in my committee is rewrite the bill in
 
00:30:15.149 --> 00:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
real time and so thank you for the
 
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
various inputs I hope this won't be
 
00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:19.720 align:start position:0%
exact for a while um I don't know if
 
00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
it's an early bill or not I should know
 
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
um but in any case uh I've heard some
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
good things here which do not go to the
 
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
heart of what I want but seem to uh add
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
on to what chairman Lynn raised as
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
concerns I don't expect this to uh go on
 
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
a consent calendar but I would like to
 
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
make it what I had hoped it would be and
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
remove as many uh let's back up and take
 
00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.430 align:start position:0%
remove as many uh let's back up and take
into

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
account numbers of good points that have
 
00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
been made today which to me
 
00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
not kill the bill but it makes it
 
00:31:05.629 --> 00:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
perhaps more widely palatable thank you
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
any other questions of this witness
 
00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank
 
00:31:23.629 --> 00:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
boerman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:31:28.269 --> 00:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
committee for hearing me today nice to
 
00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:31.559 align:start position:0%
be in front of you again um my name is
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
Paige boschman I represent NASA's Ward 4
 
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
as I have said to the committee before I
 
00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
am a women's Maternal Child health nurse
 
00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
I have served in high-risk prenatal care
 
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
I have done inhospital labor and
 
00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:47.919 align:start position:0%
delivery as a labor and delivery nurse I
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
have worked in a birth center and I've
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
worked with uh women and families
 
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
prenatally and postnatally as well as
 
00:31:56.629 --> 00:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
doing gynecological care and prenatal
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
office work I say all of that to give
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
you some examples of uh where my
 
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
experience lies now I I do want to bring
 
00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
up a few points I just have a I have a
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
lot of questions about this bill which
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
is what I would like to bring up today
 
00:32:15.629 --> 00:32:15.639 align:start position:0%
first of all I would like to say that we
 
00:32:18.669 --> 00:32:18.679 align:start position:0%
heard uh previously that nobody would do
 
00:32:20.909 --> 00:32:20.919 align:start position:0%
that uh my question about that is well
 
00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
then why do we need the bill it clearly
 
00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
happens because the whole point of this
 
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
bill came from providers who were fired
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
for doing just that so I would argue
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
that it does happen um I have a few
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
questions as I said um my biggest
 
00:32:42.029 --> 00:32:42.039 align:start position:0%
question here is exactly what repur said
 
00:32:44.029 --> 00:32:44.039 align:start position:0%
which is that we might talk about
 
00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
abortion but when we bring in the
 
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
subject of contraception I fear for the
 
00:32:51.029 --> 00:32:51.039 align:start position:0%
health and well-being of many of the
 
00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
women in our state first of all I would
 
00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
like to give a few examples so uh about
 
00:32:59.470 --> 00:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
12 years ago I would take calls from
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
women in the middle of having
 
00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
miscarriages they would pre be
 
00:33:06.629 --> 00:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
prescribed a medical uh pill that would
 
00:33:08.509 --> 00:33:08.519 align:start position:0%
help them to release the products of
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
conception as we call it I cannot tell
 
00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
you how many times even back then I
 
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
would call in the prescription to a
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
pharmacy and be questioned by the
 
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
pharmacist about why they that was being
 
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
prescribed so I do see this as a problem
 
00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:23.720 align:start position:0%
and I see it happening I'd like to have
 
00:33:26.909 --> 00:33:26.919 align:start position:0%
another uh example of contraception
 
00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
which is having the a uh layman's terms
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
having your tubes tied um I have been
 
00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
witnessed to a situation where a woman
 
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
came in for labor she then ended up
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
having a c-section she had already made
 
00:33:42.909 --> 00:33:42.919 align:start position:0%
the decision that at some point after
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
this baby she wanted her tubes tied now
 
00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
because she was having a c-section that
 
00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
was the perfect time she could had that
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
done and had one operation because she
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
was in a facility where they did not do
 
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
that which was her choice at that time I
 
00:33:59.310 --> 00:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
see that but because of that she had to
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
recover from her C-section be closed up
 
00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
recover from her C-section then go back
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
at another time with a new baby have the
 
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
risks of anesthesia infection and
 
00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
getting another procedure I don't think
 
00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:14.200 align:start position:0%
that that's something that people should
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
be subjected to without knowing that
 
00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:18.599 align:start position:0%
that could be something that happens I
 
00:34:22.109 --> 00:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
think about our small rural towns in New
 
00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where if that is the only
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
obstetrician on that night is that what
 
00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
might happen to that person are they
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
going to close somebody up and then have
 
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
them come back to have another surgery
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
I'd also like to question um when we
 
00:34:40.109 --> 00:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
talk about who Health Care Providers are
 
00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:43.399 align:start position:0%
there's actually a line that says any
 
00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
other person who furnishes artificial
 
00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
contraception does that mean the clerk
 
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
at the only Pharmacy or the only drug
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
store in town or the only Little Town
 
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
store uh who doesn't want to sell
 
00:34:59.710 --> 00:34:59.720 align:start position:0%
condoms are we impeding or increasing
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
the re the risk of STI and STDs I would
 
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
like to call attention also to the point
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
that there's nothing in here that says
 
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
that a person has to divulge this ahead
 
00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:12.839 align:start position:0%
of time and I think that's a real
 
00:35:16.109 --> 00:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
problem I would argue that contraception
 
00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
is one of the main services that
 
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
Obstetricians and gynecologists engage
 
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
in and therefore my opinion as I see it
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
would be that every obstetric off office
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
unless they unless they explicitly say
 
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
that's not what they do one of their
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
main roles is to provide contraception
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
not just for birth control but for a
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
number a number of other health care
 
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
conditions or other conditions that
 
00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
women may experience I think this is a
 
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
very dangerous bill I think there's a
 
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
lot uh that we're not looking at here I
 
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
do believe that although we think that
 
00:35:57.790 --> 00:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
legally if if it needs to be done for
 
00:35:59.870 --> 00:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
life-saving measures what we've seen in
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
other states you can look up Texas and
 
00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
all the women that have died there since
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
their abortion band when things are not
 
00:36:10.349 --> 00:36:10.359 align:start position:0%
explicitly clear providers are not clear
 
00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
and Confused um we know that in Texas a
 
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
woman had awful Vital Signs they knew
 
00:36:20.309 --> 00:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
that she was dying of sepsis they did
 
00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
not interfere until her vitals got to
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
such a low level that they could not
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
save her we know that this is not being
 
00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
interpreted correctly and it's a very
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
slippery slope I can go on but I'll
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
leave it there and I hope I do get some
 
00:36:33.839 --> 00:36:34.630 align:start position:0%
leave it there and I hope I do get some
good

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
questions question this witness
 
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.150 align:start position:0%
questions question this witness
representative

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:36:42.309 --> 00:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
Horgan um thank you very much there is a
 
00:36:44.589 --> 00:36:44.599 align:start position:0%
definition artificial conception in the
 
00:36:47.069 --> 00:36:47.079 align:start position:0%
in the bill which it doesn't really
 
00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:49.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't specifically mention condoms but
 
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
it I mean I think probably it's
 
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
intended to like restrict procedures
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
that are performed on women rather than
 
00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
men but um so
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
so so so do you so would you agree that
 
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh the condom might be covered under uh
 
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
under those uh the defin is artificial
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
contraception or contraception in the
 
00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
bill yeah a condom is artificial
 
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:14.200 align:start position:0%
contraception so I would imagine it
 
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
could be argued that is how I
 
00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.630 align:start position:0%
could be argued that is how I
interpreted

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
interpreted
 
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
it thank you representative Bergeron
 
00:37:22.589 --> 00:37:22.599 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and thank you in advance
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
for answering my question I wanted to
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
just ask you given the
 
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
exposure you've had to several different
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
environments what was your first
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
reaction when you read about the eight
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
and a half by
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
11 that has to be posted and the reason
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
I'm asking is I'm not sure you know do
 
00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:42.680 align:start position:0%
people like look at that and decide not
 
00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:44.680 align:start position:0%
to stay because they're in that
 
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
emergency department or whatnot do they
 
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
see that paper and then go and then but
 
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just kind of curious what your
 
00:37:56.589 --> 00:37:56.599 align:start position:0%
reaction was to that my reaction is if
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
the bill passed I do think it's
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
important for us to know our rights so
 
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
if that is something that passed I think
 
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
that anything that is in statute that we
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
have as a right should be posted but as
 
00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
I said before I I believe that that
 
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
could lead to people who did not divulge
 
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
it or who didn't know they get a job
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
they find out and then I do believe
 
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
especially in places where we are we are
 
00:38:28.589 --> 00:38:28.599 align:start position:0%
so under staffed in maternal healthc
 
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
care providers in this state and if we
 
00:38:34.829 --> 00:38:34.839 align:start position:0%
allow people to go into practices and
 
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
then divulge this we are putting some of
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
these small practices at a huge
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
disadvantage and a huge cost for them
 
00:38:45.069 --> 00:38:45.079 align:start position:0%
trying to shuffle things around this is
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
different than observing a day where you
 
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
can plan ahead and you know what day you
 
00:38:53.069 --> 00:38:53.079 align:start position:0%
can switch with the firefighters Etc
 
00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
this is in the moment care that comes up
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
you can't take the time to shuffle
 
00:38:59.870 --> 00:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
things around potentially in an
 
00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:01.270 align:start position:0%
things around potentially in an
emergency

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:39:04.349 --> 00:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
situation so I I do not think from that
 
00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
perspective that that would be something
 
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
beneficial representative McFarland
 
00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman bearing in mind
 
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
that the language of the bill speaks to
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
notices requiring to be posted and I
 
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
quote in a location in which healthc
 
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
care providers are likely to see such a
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
notice is it your professional
 
00:39:30.309 --> 00:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
experience that such notices to the
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
healthc care employees and providers
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
would be posted in the public waiting
 
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
room or in a room that they are are in
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
uh as providers in my experience we only
 
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
post things in my experience I've only
 
00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:48.839 align:start position:0%
seen notices posted in a waiting area if
 
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
it pertains to Patient rights my
 
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
experience is that this kind of thing is
 
00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:55.079 align:start position:0%
you know usually around a Time clock or
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the back wherever the
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
employee room is thank you that's where
 
00:40:01.069 --> 00:40:01.079 align:start position:0%
our rights are posted thank you thank
 
00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
you representative panel thank you for a
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
second I'd like to kind of turn this
 
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
around um I have heard of patients
 
00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
seeking treatment in particular for
 
00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
fertility concerns only to find out that
 
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
the very physician who is attempting to
 
00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:23.480 align:start position:0%
assist them with their fertility issues
 
00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:26.200 align:start position:0%
is also performing abortions and they
 
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
had were not informed formed of that and
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
so they found out that they were
 
00:40:32.109 --> 00:40:32.119 align:start position:0%
receiving care from a physician who was
 
00:40:34.829 --> 00:40:34.839 align:start position:0%
doing things that were against their
 
00:40:34.839 --> 00:40:35.710 align:start position:0%
doing things that were against their
good

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:35.720 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
conscience would it be um maybe not in
 
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
this bill but would you suggest that
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
maybe it should be posted in medical
 
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
facilities that abortions are performed
 
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
in this facility if that is something
 
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
that you don't want to be morally
 
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
participating in in any way I'm I'm all
 
00:40:57.309 --> 00:40:57.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question I'm always
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
in favor of informing patients and and
 
00:41:02.829 --> 00:41:02.839 align:start position:0%
having them know as much as possible and
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
I I'm not frankly
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to people who want to do this in
 
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
a facility where that's happening and
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
where it's well known I do think it
 
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
would be very difficult in a
 
00:41:16.829 --> 00:41:16.839 align:start position:0%
facility to H to be there and know that
 
00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
some people do this and some people
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
don't that's much harder to
 
00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.630 align:start position:0%
don't that's much harder to
identify

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
identify
 
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
um it's it's also I'm so sorry I lost my
 
00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:29.800 align:start position:0%
train of thought for just a second
 
00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:32.839 align:start position:0%
um it's also something that right now is
 
00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of a patient right if
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
I become pregnant and I want to know how
 
00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
much I don't know how many C-sections
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
this obstetrician does I ask them what
 
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
is your C-section rate what are your
 
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
Specialties right you can look that up
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
so I do believe that while I support
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
that I think that right now when we're
 
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
looking at other topics that is
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
something that is on the patient to
 
00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.510 align:start position:0%
something that is on the patient to
determine

00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
determine
 
00:42:00.589 --> 00:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
follow up is it possible and know we're
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
getting a little way away from the bill
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
but that a patient might not be
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
aware that there are procedures or
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
situations being performed in a hospital
 
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
until they are actually offered those
 
00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.349 align:start position:0%
until they are actually offered those
Services

00:42:20.349 --> 00:42:20.359 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
themselves you know I don't know that I
 
00:42:25.549 --> 00:42:25.559 align:start position:0%
can speak to that specifically I'm not
 
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
every patient um not not to be flippant
 
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
but um I I
 
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
do I think that most people know that
 
00:42:36.589 --> 00:42:36.599 align:start position:0%
most gynecologist and Obstetricians
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
engage in health care and and abortion
 
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
is a part of Health Care as is
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
contraception and I don't want to forget
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
that contraception is a big part of this
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
spill I think it's pretty well known if
 
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
if you want to get contraception you're
 
00:42:56.069 --> 00:42:56.079 align:start position:0%
going to an obstetrician so I I do think
 
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
that that is something that most people
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
should be aware of and that their
 
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
concerns are likely the exception and
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
they have every right to ask about that
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you you any of the questions
 
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative Perez thank you thanks
 
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I worked in three
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
Catholic Hospitals in my medical career
 
00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:15.160 align:start position:0%
I did intensive care ER recovery room
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
over 42 years each Catholic Hospital
 
00:43:22.829 --> 00:43:22.839 align:start position:0%
that I went to work at I had to sign a
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
their policy and their um I forget all
 
00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
different things
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
that say that what they do and do not do
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
in that and I had to sign that I agreed
 
00:43:33.839 --> 00:43:35.190 align:start position:0%
in that and I had to sign that I agreed
with

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
them are you telling me that that isn't
 
00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
the real world anymore actually yes I
 
00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
just recently left St Joe's Hospital in
 
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
nsha which is a Catholic Hospital and
 
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
that was my question during the
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
interview obviously you can understand
 
00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
where I'm coming from in healthcare and
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
I wanted to ensure that I wouldn't be in
 
00:43:57.309 --> 00:43:57.319 align:start position:0%
any kind of uh you know a violation of a
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
policy if I spoke about those things and
 
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
educated my patients as I should and
 
00:44:05.069 --> 00:44:05.079 align:start position:0%
they assured me that it was absolutely
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
not anything that was against what the
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
hospital stood for and I would I'm just
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
telling you my experience in the last
 
00:44:13.829 --> 00:44:13.839 align:start position:0%
year at at a hospital that is a Catholic
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
Hospital and again people going there
 
00:44:18.109 --> 00:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
know what they're going to because it's
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
a Catholic Hospital thank you
 
00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:21.150 align:start position:0%
a Catholic Hospital thank you
representative

00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:21.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
mayos thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:25.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I wanted to get
 
00:44:28.589 --> 00:44:28.599 align:start position:0%
back to um contra reception and I wanted
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
to ask is one of the uses of condoms to
 
00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
prevent the transmission of
 
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:39.640 align:start position:0%
HIV and if so by enabling a pharmacist
 
00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
to deny the provision of uh condoms are
 
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
you in fact increasing the risk to the
 
00:44:50.349 --> 00:44:50.359 align:start position:0%
patient of the transmission of HIV thank
 
00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you for that question and I
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
would like to clarify my um
 
00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:57.160 align:start position:0%
interpretation of this would mean
 
00:45:01.109 --> 00:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy and store clerk uh so I do or
 
00:45:02.549 --> 00:45:02.559 align:start position:0%
even you know I work in a sexual
 
00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
Wellness Clinic where we test for STI
 
00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:05.390 align:start position:0%
Wellness Clinic where we test for STI
and

00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
STDs and we give out condoms so what if
 
00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
somebody there doesn't want to give
 
00:45:13.549 --> 00:45:13.559 align:start position:0%
condoms right that that's not that is
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
not best practice of course and so the
 
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
answer to your question is absolutely it
 
00:45:21.069 --> 00:45:21.079 align:start position:0%
opens the door as we're in right now
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
could be interpreted to not sell condoms
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
and that will absolutely increase the
 
00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:27.880 align:start position:0%
risk of STI
 
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
HIV thank you any other questions of
 
00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:31.870 align:start position:0%
HIV thank you any other questions of
this

00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:31.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
witness representative rmo yeah I just
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to just again to return to the
 
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
language of the bill and would you agree
 
00:45:41.309 --> 00:45:41.319 align:start position:0%
that the way this is written
 
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
receptionist could turn away a patient
 
00:45:44.549 --> 00:45:44.559 align:start position:0%
for any other provider in the uh
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
facility knew the patient needed care
 
00:45:49.109 --> 00:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I couldn't can you speak up
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
sply and too far away um would you agree
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
the way this bill is written a
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
receptionist could turn away a patient
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
without anyone else at the facility
 
00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
knowing that that individual needed care
 
00:46:02.109 --> 00:46:02.119 align:start position:0%
I read this carefully and yes I do
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
interpret that I do believe that could
 
00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:06.680 align:start position:0%
be interpreted in that way okay there is
 
00:46:09.309 --> 00:46:09.319 align:start position:0%
there is nothing that says that um that
 
00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:11.960 align:start position:0%
requires that a person would inform
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
anybody else that they've taken that
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
action thank you thank you any other
 
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:42.109 --> 00:46:42.119 align:start position:0%

I've come to speak to you today to tell
 
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
you my story and urgently oppose hb23 to
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
this bill would result in people across
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
our state being denied access to
 
00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
Essential Medical Care and in some cases
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
dying as a
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
result my first period landed me in the
 
00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
hospital I woke up that morning in pain
 
00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:11.800 align:start position:0%
like I had never felt before and my legs
 
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
were just covered in blood I somehow
 
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
managed to drag myself to the bathroom
 
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
before the vomiting began and that's
 
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
where my parents found me and rushed me
 
00:47:22.589 --> 00:47:22.599 align:start position:0%
to the ER from there I received
 
00:47:25.069 --> 00:47:25.079 align:start position:0%
emergency care and a referral to an
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
OBGYN that first period was 10 days of
 
00:47:30.349 --> 00:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
heavy bleeding it was immediately clear
 
00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
that something was wrong the OBG ran
 
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:34.280 align:start position:0%
agreed and even said it seemed very
 
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
likely that I had endometriosis and
 
00:47:37.829 --> 00:47:37.839 align:start position:0%
should be put on birth control right
 
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
away to try to control the bleeding pain
 
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
and other symptoms over the next several
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
years I tried almost every birth control
 
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
on the market trying to find one that
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
helped the symptoms without too many
 
00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
side effects I also received surgery
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
both to diagnose the endometriosis since
 
00:47:56.349 --> 00:47:56.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it can be it can't be
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with tests and to have the
 
00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:01.839 align:start position:0%
standard oblation surgery even so after
 
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
this surgery it grew back with a
 
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
vengeance as it turned out I actually
 
00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
had stage four of all three types of
 
00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
endometriosis in 2018 it had grown back
 
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
to the point that it was on most of my
 
00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
internal organs and was actively
 
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
dissolving my appendix inside my body I
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
needed life-saving surgery which I
 
00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
thankfully received fast forward to 2024
 
00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
and the pain was returning again at this
 
00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
point my doctor and I decided a
 
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
hysterectomy would be the best course of
 
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:31.480 align:start position:0%
action I received that in August shortly
 
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
after my 30th birthday it has been
 
00:48:36.109 --> 00:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
lifechanging and has allowed me to focus
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
on other aspects of my health that have
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
fallen through the cracks if HB 232 had
 
00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
been law at any point in my journey I
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
could have been denied birth control
 
00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:47.839 align:start position:0%
surgery or even life-saving emergency
 
00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
care and I would have died doctors take
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
an oath to do no harm it's not a career
 
00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
where they can pick and choose who
 
00:48:57.789 --> 00:48:57.799 align:start position:0%
receives care my having endometriosis is
 
00:48:59.710 --> 00:48:59.720 align:start position:0%
beyond my control and needing birth
 
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
control and a hysterectomy in order to
 
00:49:04.109 --> 00:49:04.119 align:start position:0%
both stay alive and have any hope of a
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
good quality of life shouldn't be denied
 
00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:07.960 align:start position:0%
me because it goes against a potential
 
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
doctor's beliefs we've seen the real
 
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
world harm of bills like this in other
 
00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:14.079 align:start position:0%
states broad conscious closets have
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
resulted in denied emergency care for
 
00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:18.200 align:start position:0%
miscarriages refusals to fill birth
 
00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:20.200 align:start position:0%
control and even hospitals Turning Away
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
patients seeking gender affirming care
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
refusals already happen and this bill
 
00:49:26.109 --> 00:49:26.119 align:start position:0%
would only expand them with no
 
00:49:26.119 --> 00:49:27.710 align:start position:0%
would only expand them with no
accountability

00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
00:49:29.309 --> 00:49:29.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has long stood for
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
personal freedoms and access to Quality
 
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
healthare this bill does the opposite it
 
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
prioritizes individual beliefs over
 
00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:37.960 align:start position:0%
patient safety and allows discrimination
 
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
under the guise of conscious for this
 
00:49:41.789 --> 00:49:41.799 align:start position:0%
reason I urge you to stand with New
 
00:49:43.549 --> 00:49:43.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire women birthing people and all
 
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
patients who rely on timely essential
 
00:49:48.349 --> 00:49:48.359 align:start position:0%
Healthcare and vote no on HB 232 thank
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you any questions of this
 
00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:53.960 align:start position:0%
witness representative
 
00:49:56.349 --> 00:49:56.359 align:start position:0%
McFarland first let me just uh share my
 
00:49:58.910 --> 00:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
simp for your your circumstances as I'm
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
sure other members on the committee feel
 
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
um you allude to the language of the
 
00:50:07.549 --> 00:50:07.559 align:start position:0%
bill and I know that you have heard the
 
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
testimony from the prime sponsor that he
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
is not only amenable but he is uh
 
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
suggesting that there should be an
 
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
amendment that would uh exclude these
 
00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.510 align:start position:0%
amendment that would uh exclude these
emergency

00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh if such an amendment
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
were to be made to the bill do you feel
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:30.829 --> 00:50:30.839 align:start position:0%
it's again coming back to the who
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
decides what the emergency is and if
 
00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
they will choose to follow through if
 
00:50:39.309 --> 00:50:39.319 align:start position:0%
there is actual need for the emergent
 
00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
care um I Heard many people talking
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
about how this seems like it is a
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
decision that can just be made in a
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
person's head and that's the main part
 
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
that I find concerning I I'm not sure
 
00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment would fully cover
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
that any other questions
 
00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank
 
00:51:09.309 --> 00:51:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:12.839 align:start position:0%
Peters hi I'm a family doctor in
 
00:51:14.670 --> 00:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester um and I've done a lot of
 
00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:17.480 align:start position:0%
women's health in the past um throughout
 
00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
my career I've had the opportunity to
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
work in uh inpatient settings as a
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
hospitalist and academic settings and
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
outpatient settings and a Moonlight in
 
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
the jails and I've worked in ers so I
 
00:51:29.589 --> 00:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
have a a broad perspective about how
 
00:51:32.109 --> 00:51:32.119 align:start position:0%
healthc care teams work and about the
 
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
restrictions that Healthcare teams have
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
in rural areas and I know a lot of you
 
00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:38.200 align:start position:0%
are concerned about that too and I guess
 
00:51:40.349 --> 00:51:40.359 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the clarifying amendments
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
about emergency situations I think those
 
00:51:44.829 --> 00:51:44.839 align:start position:0%
are absolutely essential um but I think
 
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
that they would need some fine-tuning um
 
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
and and my biggest concern is that this
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't adequately take into
 
00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
consideration the restrictions of a
 
00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:56.200 align:start position:0%
healthcare team in a rural area right
 
00:51:58.789 --> 00:51:58.799 align:start position:0%
and I think that in general when we look
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
at our Health Care Systems the the more
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
restraints we put on those systems the
 
00:52:06.670 --> 00:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
narrower and narrower access to care
 
00:52:09.069 --> 00:52:09.079 align:start position:0%
becomes so I have worked in facilities
 
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
in other states a small rural Hospital
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
in California that had a conscious
 
00:52:15.549 --> 00:52:15.559 align:start position:0%
objection rule like this and staff
 
00:52:17.069 --> 00:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
members in the operating room were
 
00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
objecting to certain procedures and so
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
over time that hospital had to narrow
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
its ability to provide those procedures
 
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
even routine things like Tu liation this
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
is not a Catholic Hospital um and but
 
00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
over months and years they had to narrow
 
00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
and narrow and narrow the opportunities
 
00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
they had to provide those things saying
 
00:52:37.789 --> 00:52:37.799 align:start position:0%
we're only going to schedule these on
 
00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
Thursdays because we know we can staff
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
so and so who won't object and um and
 
00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
and then eventually hospitals just
 
00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
stopped Pro providing those procedures
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
and so that that's where I see this
 
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
leading and that's my concern is that um
 
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
you know Healthcare teams are highly
 
00:52:56.079 --> 00:52:56.990 align:start position:0%
you know Healthcare teams are highly
efficient

00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
efficient
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
and and we're trained everyone's trained
 
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
to do one very specific thing and
 
00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:01.839 align:start position:0%
they're not trained to do the other
 
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
things right so if some member of your
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
team objects and they step away it's not
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
like you know if your operating room
 
00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
nurse says I'm not going to participate
 
00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
in this procedure the anesthesiologist
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
can't go get the blood that the patient
 
00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:15.640 align:start position:0%
needs and give it to them like that
 
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
they're not trained to do that that's
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
not how the team runs and especially in
 
00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
rural areas where Staffing is already
 
00:53:25.109 --> 00:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
very very strained I think if we if we
 
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
allow I I guess it's it's putting the
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
individual's rights over the employer
 
00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
rights or over the systems rights you
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
know if we allow people to object then
 
00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
what I see happening in the future is
 
00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:37.880 align:start position:0%
that fewer and fewer facilities provide
 
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
essential life-saving procedures not
 
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:42.799 align:start position:0%
even in only emergency situations but in
 
00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:45.640 align:start position:0%
non-emergency situations too um so I
 
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
think that this unfortunately although
 
00:53:49.789 --> 00:53:49.799 align:start position:0%
the intentions are good of this bill I
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
think it will unfortunately have the
 
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
side effect of further limiting women's
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
access to healthcare um which should not
 
00:53:59.309 --> 00:53:59.319 align:start position:0%
be a goal for any of us thank you
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative pel thank you Mr chair
 
00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here and taking
 
00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:05.240 align:start position:0%
my question in the situation you
 
00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:08.839 align:start position:0%
described where um fewer and fewer
 
00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
procedures were being performed is it
 
00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
possible that the health care providers
 
00:54:18.789 --> 00:54:18.799 align:start position:0%
were attracted to positions in that
 
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
hospital because they could
 
00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.789 align:start position:0%
hospital because they could
conscientiously

00:54:24.789 --> 00:54:24.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:27.309 --> 00:54:27.319 align:start position:0%
object although theoretically I can see
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
how that would be possible the hospital
 
00:54:32.109 --> 00:54:32.119 align:start position:0%
was never adequately staffed so they
 
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
didn't have an overabundance of Staff
 
00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:35.720 align:start position:0%
they sort of had to work with the staff
 
00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:37.400 align:start position:0%
that they had and that's why the
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
procedures became fewer and fewer over
 
00:54:43.549 --> 00:54:43.559 align:start position:0%
time followup so it sounds more like a
 
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
staffing issue than a conscientious
 
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
objection issue to me yes but I don't
 
00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
think they're unrelated right because if
 
00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
you had if you had adequate staff then
 
00:54:54.829 --> 00:54:54.839 align:start position:0%
you could have you know people cover
 
00:54:55.950 --> 00:54:55.960 align:start position:0%
Monday through Friday for all the
 
00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
procedures you wanted who weren't going
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
to consciously object but none of our
 
00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:01.240 align:start position:0%
Healthcare systems work that way all of
 
00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:03.400 align:start position:0%
them are on skeleton staffs and using
 
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
loc's agencies to fill their staffs and
 
00:55:07.549 --> 00:55:07.559 align:start position:0%
we don't have that opportunity in the
 
00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire right now
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
especially not in our rural
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
areas representative
 
00:55:15.549 --> 00:55:15.559 align:start position:0%
buron thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:55:17.589 --> 00:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
for uh all your
 
00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
homework I was just curious if you see
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
this going down and say some of these
 
00:55:24.829 --> 00:55:24.839 align:start position:0%
emergencies that you've described do
 
00:55:26.789 --> 00:55:26.799 align:start position:0%
patients have to call around now before
 
00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
they leave they've got an emergency
 
00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
going at home or whatnot do they have to
 
00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
call ahead now to proceed to you know
 
00:55:34.829 --> 00:55:34.839 align:start position:0%
Healthcare facilities and say do you do
 
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
this do you do that do you s my
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
experience is that patients don't do
 
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
that but in some cases they probably
 
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
wish they
 
00:55:44.829 --> 00:55:44.839 align:start position:0%
had yeah I was just curious if you see
 
00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:46.839 align:start position:0%
that in the direction going down once
 
00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
you read this yeah no I'm
 
00:55:53.069 --> 00:55:53.079 align:start position:0%
good representative
 
00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:55.559 align:start position:0%
McFarland if we believe that there is an
 
00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
element in what you're relating to us of
 
00:56:02.029 --> 00:56:02.039 align:start position:0%
of a staffing issue do you consider as
 
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
representative pearon alluded to in his
 
00:56:09.029 --> 00:56:09.039 align:start position:0%
testimony that by not passing this bill
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
we continue to suffer from uh staffing
 
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
issues and uh issues of lack of
 
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
diversity because we end up uh pushing
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
people away who do feel strongly about
 
00:56:22.079 --> 00:56:24.990 align:start position:0%
people away who do feel strongly about
these

00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
issues I I can you can you ask that in a
 
00:56:30.029 --> 00:56:30.039 align:start position:0%
different way I'm not sure I followed
 
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
yes I I mean I think we understand that
 
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
there are some people who would be
 
00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:37.160 align:start position:0%
interested in being healthc care
 
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
providers in in these organizations who
 
00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:41.720 align:start position:0%
may either choose not to become healthc
 
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
care providers at all or having become
 
00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
them may choose not to work for those
 
00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
kinds of organizations for these reasons
 
00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
and so I'm asking if this bill doesn't
 
00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:53.720 align:start position:0%
pass is that not something that would in
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
fact promote some of the staffing issues
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about so I'm on the
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
board of the New Hampshire Academy of
 
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
family physicians and we have an
 
00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:02.440 align:start position:0%
advocacy committee that reviews all the
 
00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
bills that are coming up and so when we
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
talked about this on our committee so
 
00:57:10.349 --> 00:57:10.359 align:start position:0%
this is people with dozens and dozens of
 
00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:13.640 align:start position:0%
years of Family Medicine experience all
 
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
of us were a little bit baffled by this
 
00:57:17.870 --> 00:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
bill all of us thought why is this even
 
00:57:20.029 --> 00:57:20.039 align:start position:0%
coming up this isn't an issue if you if
 
00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
you object to something then you choose
 
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
a job where you don't do that and I
 
00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
guess my my perspective would be that
 
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
that that is how things should remain
 
00:57:31.029 --> 00:57:31.039 align:start position:0%
that if somebody is going to have an
 
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
objection in their conscience to a
 
00:57:35.069 --> 00:57:35.079 align:start position:0%
certain job that might be required of
 
00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
them then they they shouldn't take that
 
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
job right and that's and that's the way
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
it's always works so from a provider's
 
00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
standpoint you know from a physician's
 
00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
standpoint I just wouldn't take a job if
 
00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
I had to do something that my conscious
 
00:57:48.109 --> 00:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
objected to right I would choose a
 
00:57:50.829 --> 00:57:50.839 align:start position:0%
different job and if you you know if you
 
00:57:53.589 --> 00:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
are a you know a staff member who has an
 
00:57:56.349 --> 00:57:56.359 align:start position:0%
objection to for example using blood
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
products then don't work in the ER or
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
the O right work someplace where you
 
00:58:02.589 --> 00:58:02.599 align:start position:0%
don't have to give blood products so I
 
00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:05.240 align:start position:0%
don't think that that's a very practical
 
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
reality that that our staffing problems
 
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
are coming from a lack of protection for
 
00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:12.750 align:start position:0%
are coming from a lack of protection for
our

00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
consciences representative pill I just
 
00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:17.240 align:start position:0%
have a clarification issue are you
 
00:58:19.109 --> 00:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
representing yourself or the New
 
00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of family
 
00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
practitioners because that's what you
 
00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
put on your card is NH so I so I'm on
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
the I'm on the board for the new
 
00:58:28.109 --> 00:58:28.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire AFP and we discussed the
 
00:58:30.029 --> 00:58:30.039 align:start position:0%
specific bill at our advocacy meeting so
 
00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:31.880 align:start position:0%
I am speaking on their behalf thank you
 
00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
yeah just thanks thank you any other
 
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
trip thank you thank you Mr chair and
 
00:58:45.789 --> 00:58:45.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh it
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
seems to me that
 
00:58:48.079 --> 00:58:49.829 align:start position:0%
seems to me that
uh

00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:49.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:53.240 align:start position:0%
uh a group of people that should be
 
00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
involved in uh in this aren't uh because
 
00:59:00.789 --> 00:59:00.799 align:start position:0%
the uh the people that operate the
 
00:59:04.990 --> 00:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
ambulances if uh they're unaware that uh
 
00:59:08.029 --> 00:59:08.039 align:start position:0%
certain Health Care Facilities will not
 
00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh uh things is this is this going to be
 
00:59:19.230 --> 00:59:19.240 align:start position:0%
an issue here
 
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
too it certainly seems like it would
 
00:59:23.789 --> 00:59:23.799 align:start position:0%
become an issue yeah if anyone's allowed
 
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:31.309 --> 00:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
followup uh it's it's not that I was
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
concerned about the the uh ambulance
 
00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
operators themselves it's just that if
 
00:59:38.029 --> 00:59:38.039 align:start position:0%
if they're not informed that certain
 
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
Health Care Facilities will not be will
 
00:59:45.789 --> 00:59:45.799 align:start position:0%
not perform certain uh uh operations or
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
whatever you know if it's it seems like
 
00:59:50.349 --> 00:59:50.359 align:start position:0%
it's a a bad idea for an ambulance to
 
00:59:55.109 --> 00:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
show up and only then find out that the
 
00:59:58.029 --> 00:59:58.039 align:start position:0%
uh Healthcare fac facility doesn't you
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
know and then the say like in in uh
 
01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:04.280 align:start position:0%
Manchester you know there are options to
 
01:00:06.109 --> 01:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
go to other healthc care facilities but
 
01:00:10.109 --> 01:00:10.119 align:start position:0%
uh uh you know it's they say that they
 
01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:14.200 align:start position:0%
say that time is crucial you know so
 
01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.990 align:start position:0%
say that time is crucial you know so
thank

01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:20.440 align:start position:0%
you representative mayos thank you Mr
 
01:00:22.109 --> 01:00:22.119 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:00:24.069 --> 01:00:24.079 align:start position:0%
question I wanted to ask you doctor
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
about the amendment which says the
 
01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.910 align:start position:0%
about the amendment which says the
section

01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
um uh the section shall not apply to a
 
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
health care provider who is the only
 
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
health care provider present in an
 
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
emergency situation and you might have
 
01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
heard me ask my question earlier about
 
01:00:46.589 --> 01:00:46.599 align:start position:0%
who determines an emergency but I wanted
 
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
to ask you from your experience um in a
 
01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
rural setting where there's only one
 
01:00:53.309 --> 01:00:53.319 align:start position:0%
health care provider present in an
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
emergency situation and that healthc
 
01:00:59.950 --> 01:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
care provider is objecting based on
 
01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:02.680 align:start position:0%
conscience how in your experience would
 
01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
that work yeah I appreciate that there's
 
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
an emergency Clause because that was my
 
01:01:10.349 --> 01:01:10.359 align:start position:0%
first concern with this bill too was
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
thinking about you know the person who's
 
01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:13.480 align:start position:0%
bleeding in the middle of the night who
 
01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
needs their miscarriage taken care of
 
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
you know um and you can't always
 
01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
anticipate that and so it may not be
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
your provider who has agreed that
 
01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to take care of a patient
 
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
in any emergency it may be the scrub
 
01:01:27.390 --> 01:01:27.400 align:start position:0%
tech who just got called in for the
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
night shift unexpectedly and that wasn't
 
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't planning on that you know um so I
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
think that an amendment would need to be
 
01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
very fine-tuned and and well worded to
 
01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
be adequate and to adequately cover that
 
01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
but I think also as has been mentioned
 
01:01:44.789 --> 01:01:44.799 align:start position:0%
what we've seen in other states with
 
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
Clauses like this is is that
 
01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:49.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately people get a little bit
 
01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
touchy about it and a little scared when
 
01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
they don't fully understand the
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
legalities and so I think that people
 
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
begin to limit care because they're
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
concerned about their legal exposure um
 
01:02:02.029 --> 01:02:02.039 align:start position:0%
when bills like this are put into place
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
so that's I guess that's my concern is
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
that sort of down the road we see Ripple
 
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
effects um and those Ripple effects
 
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
would include having fewer and fewer
 
01:02:13.269 --> 01:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Providers willing to do
 
01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
procedures and having fewer and fewer
 
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
facilities that can maintain staff to do
 
01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:19.029 align:start position:0%
facilities that can maintain staff to do
those

01:02:19.029 --> 01:02:19.039 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:21.880 align:start position:0%
procedures thank
 
01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
you anyone any other
 
01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:27.160 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
01:02:29.309 --> 01:02:29.319 align:start position:0%
you so at this point I'm going to ask
 
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
the members if you have a question that
 
01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:32.799 align:start position:0%
you need to ask to understand the bill
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
and make an informed decision by all
 
01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:36.440 align:start position:0%
means ask it I'm going to have to limit
 
01:02:39.069 --> 01:02:39.079 align:start position:0%
follow-ups at this point and uh limit
 
01:02:41.069 --> 01:02:41.079 align:start position:0%
you to one opportunity to ask a question
 
01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:43.880 align:start position:0%
but if you have a question ask it please
 
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
um we're an hour into this meeting
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
already and I'm not even halfway through
 
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
the card so I
 
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
morning is this on now okay it is good
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
morning sorry about that for the record
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
Courtney Tanner I'm the senior director
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
of government relations at Dartmouth
 
01:03:16.029 --> 01:03:16.039 align:start position:0%
health and um we have uh of course we
 
01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
have a number of hospitals including
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center up in
 
01:03:20.789 --> 01:03:20.799 align:start position:0%
Lebanon but I think for the importance
 
01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
of this bill it's also to important to
 
01:03:25.069 --> 01:03:25.079 align:start position:0%
give you a little sense of our broader
 
01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
footprint we also have um three other
 
01:03:30.309 --> 01:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Community Hospitals Al
 
01:03:33.069 --> 01:03:33.079 align:start position:0%
pect in Lebanon New London Hospital in
 
01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:35.480 align:start position:0%
New London and chesher Medical Center in
 
01:03:38.109 --> 01:03:38.119 align:start position:0%
Kean we also have a number of outpatient
 
01:03:40.269 --> 01:03:40.279 align:start position:0%
clinics including heer Road in Lebanon
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
we have clinics in conquer Manchester
 
01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
and nashaa and the reason why I'm kind
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
of drawing out who we are and where we
 
01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
are um is because I have some concerns
 
01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
about the definitions of this bill and
 
01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
the and the uh breath and the broadness
 
01:03:58.430 --> 01:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
of this bill um we've talked you've
 
01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
heard a lot about abortion today but
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't just cover abortion it
 
01:04:05.789 --> 01:04:05.799 align:start position:0%
also covers access to contraception um
 
01:04:05.799 --> 01:04:06.789 align:start position:0%
also covers access to contraception um
prescription

01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
medications and and uh other um uh
 
01:04:13.789 --> 01:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
fertility services and so I just want to
 
01:04:17.309 --> 01:04:17.319 align:start position:0%
note that um while we are a a proud
 
01:04:19.269 --> 01:04:19.279 align:start position:0%
institution that does provide an array
 
01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:21.160 align:start position:0%
of reproductive Health Care access we
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
also are providing contraceptive and
 
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
other um prescription medications in our
 
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
outpatient clinics too and so I have
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
concerns about this implicating all of
 
01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
our uh clinics across the state I also
 
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
have grave concerns about page two lines
 
01:04:38.109 --> 01:04:38.119 align:start position:0%
11 the definition of healthc care
 
01:04:41.549 --> 01:04:41.559 align:start position:0%
provider that pretty much covers most of
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
if not all of our employees including
 
01:04:46.589 --> 01:04:46.599 align:start position:0%
some of our outpatient retail pharmacies
 
01:04:49.390 --> 01:04:49.400 align:start position:0%
um and any other PA professional so it's
 
01:04:50.549 --> 01:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
been talked a little bit about in this
 
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
committee that this could be a person
 
01:04:55.150 --> 01:04:55.160 align:start position:0%
who's just a person who's a scheduler
 
01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
refusing to schedule a patient because
 
01:04:59.190 --> 01:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
they have some concerns and what happens
 
01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
to that patient they just fall away
 
01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:03.400 align:start position:0%
there's no obligation to refer that um
 
01:05:06.029 --> 01:05:06.039 align:start position:0%
patient to a different scheduler or
 
01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
connect with um a a physician or a team
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
lead um so I have concerns about access
 
01:05:14.349 --> 01:05:14.359 align:start position:0%
issues as as I look at that definition
 
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
of a healthc care
 
01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:20.430 align:start position:0%
of a healthc care
provider

01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
um I also have concerns about uh the
 
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
Civil remedies protection there are um
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
while we always appreciate diversity of
 
01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
thought I have concerns about how this
 
01:05:35.549 --> 01:05:35.559 align:start position:0%
bill would interact with um ethical
 
01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
obligations and with uh our existing
 
01:05:40.829 --> 01:05:40.839 align:start position:0%
medical malpractice laws I suspect
 
01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
there's somebody behind me that may talk
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
a little bit about that so I'll lead
 
01:05:46.269 --> 01:05:46.279 align:start position:0%
that to to others but I do have concerns
 
01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
about how we as an institution would
 
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
reconcile different standards if this
 
01:05:52.829 --> 01:05:52.839 align:start position:0%
bill were were to be
 
01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
passed um I'm happy to take take
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
questions I also know uh chairman that
 
01:05:59.470 --> 01:05:59.480 align:start position:0%
you that you're running short on time
 
01:06:01.029 --> 01:06:01.039 align:start position:0%
but I am happy to take questions as I
 
01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
suspect there might be a few no I have
 
01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
no problem with people asking questions
 
01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
is just we want to limit the uh
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up system representative
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you Mr chair thank you U
 
01:06:11.309 --> 01:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
Miss Tanner for taking my question sure
 
01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
um my question is primarily around um
 
01:06:17.549 --> 01:06:17.559 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth health and and your network um
 
01:06:19.789 --> 01:06:19.799 align:start position:0%
can you provide the committee data on
 
01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
how many
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
sterilizations you engage in for miners
 
01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
under the age of 18
 
01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm not understanding the question
 
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
are you referring to a different a
 
01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.309 align:start position:0%
are you referring to a different a
specific

01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
procedure um gender transition surgeries
 
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's relevant to the
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
bill I'm happy to have a conversation
 
01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
with you offline but I'm I don't think
 
01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:42.200 align:start position:0%
that's relevant to just to follow up it
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
this bill specifically mentions
 
01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
sterilization treatment so that's why
 
01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
I'm asking I think it's completely
 
01:06:49.269 --> 01:06:49.279 align:start position:0%
relevant to the bill so Dartmouth health
 
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
does not perform surgeries for
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
individuals under minors one because
 
01:06:55.829 --> 01:06:55.839 align:start position:0%
there's a bill that passed last legisl
 
01:06:59.349 --> 01:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
session that prohibits um such care but
 
01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:01.799 align:start position:0%
uh in even prior to last legislative
 
01:07:03.549 --> 01:07:03.559 align:start position:0%
session Dartmouth health does not
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
perform um bottom surgeries for minors
 
01:07:07.349 --> 01:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
who are seeking gender affirming care
 
01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:10.119 align:start position:0%
surgeries thank you any other questions
 
01:07:13.309 --> 01:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
of this witness representative tur yeah
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
just just one um if this were in place
 
01:07:19.069 --> 01:07:19.079 align:start position:0%
would Dartmouth have concerns that the
 
01:07:20.829 --> 01:07:20.839 align:start position:0%
actions of some of their employees could
 
01:07:22.829 --> 01:07:22.839 align:start position:0%
leave your organization in violation of
 
01:07:25.549 --> 01:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
the mtala rules yes I I would have
 
01:07:27.549 --> 01:07:27.559 align:start position:0%
concerns about that I think as we talk
 
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
about our Workforce challenges it's come
 
01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:31.880 align:start position:0%
up a lot in this hearing um one I want
 
01:07:34.510 --> 01:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
to say as I was reviewing this this bill
 
01:07:37.109 --> 01:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
we in New Hampshire and across the
 
01:07:39.309 --> 01:07:39.319 align:start position:0%
country frankly are struggling for a
 
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
clinical Workforce certainly in Northern
 
01:07:44.109 --> 01:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
New England and
 
01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
um we there are not circumstances where
 
01:07:49.710 --> 01:07:49.720 align:start position:0%
we are placing Med students or or
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
residents in situations where they feel
 
01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable we want to have a complete
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
dialogue with with our Learners and with
 
01:07:59.309 --> 01:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
providers to make sure that they're in
 
01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
places that they feel comfortable and
 
01:08:02.430 --> 01:08:02.440 align:start position:0%
they're going to be able to serve the
 
01:08:05.309 --> 01:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
patients that they are signing up to
 
01:08:09.549 --> 01:08:09.559 align:start position:0%
serve additionally as we think about um
 
01:08:11.069 --> 01:08:11.079 align:start position:0%
some of our other Workforce challenges
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
in in our rural parts of the state I
 
01:08:16.110 --> 01:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
think we have to be really careful about
 
01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
striking a balance between um placing
 
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
civil remedies on institutions that may
 
01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:25.880 align:start position:0%
um expose our institutions to risks and
 
01:08:27.709 --> 01:08:27.719 align:start position:0%
allowing for an employer and employee
 
01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
relationship to be amicable so that
 
01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
employee employees feel comfortable
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
coming to their employers with concerns
 
01:08:36.030 --> 01:08:36.040 align:start position:0%
about performing certain procedures or
 
01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:37.640 align:start position:0%
questions about some of the work that's
 
01:08:40.189 --> 01:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
being done at that respective
 
01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
institution thank you representative
 
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
Pell thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so if there's a
 
01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
shortage of staff and you're concerned
 
01:08:51.709 --> 01:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
about um attracting more healthcare
 
01:08:55.470 --> 01:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
workers why wouldn't you be um
 
01:08:58.470 --> 01:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
interested in entertaining a provider
 
01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
who did have a conscientious objection
 
01:09:02.189 --> 01:09:02.199 align:start position:0%
because that would add to your staff it
 
01:09:04.990 --> 01:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
might give um an option for patients who
 
01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
would be more comfortable with somebody
 
01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
who didn't perform or prescribe certain
 
01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
treatments that they were not
 
01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
comfortable with themselves yeah I I
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
want to underscore we are uh we as an
 
01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:18.520 align:start position:0%
institution respect and and appreciate
 
01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
diversity of thought always and we want
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
to make sure that any provider that
 
01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
wants to come and work at Dartmouth
 
01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
Health feels comfortable in the service
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
that they want to be in and so I suspect
 
01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
that there are certain providers that
 
01:09:32.269 --> 01:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
might not want to be placed in OB cetric
 
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
but they might want to be placed in
 
01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
Orthopedics or uh a different type of
 
01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
service line and those conversations
 
01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
should happen outside of legislation and
 
01:09:42.749 --> 01:09:42.759 align:start position:0%
we would want that to happen with um the
 
01:09:44.789 --> 01:09:44.799 align:start position:0%
institution and the provider themselves
 
01:09:47.829 --> 01:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
without this looming uh threat of civil
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
remedies thank you representative
 
01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
mayos thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I
 
01:09:57.149 --> 01:09:57.159 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether you've seen the
 
01:09:59.910 --> 01:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
amendment but it says that the section
 
01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
shall not apply to a health care
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
provider who is the only care provider
 
01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
present in an emergency situation and I
 
01:10:11.149 --> 01:10:11.159 align:start position:0%
want to ask you as as Dartmouth health
 
01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
and Dartmouth Hitchcock how would you
 
01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
handle that situation if the only
 
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
provider is exercising their
 
01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
conscientious objection who would decide
 
01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
if it's an emergency situation and how
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
would that decision be made yeah so I I
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
don't have the amendment in front of me
 
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that there is an amendment
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
floating around so I've only heard about
 
01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
it in concept um I appreciate that there
 
01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
is an amendment that contemplates that
 
01:10:38.669 --> 01:10:38.679 align:start position:0%
because that's one of our concerns and
 
01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
our questions but I haven't seen the the
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
bill Tech so I would we do have concerns
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
about e access to emergency care if this
 
01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
bill were to be um passed and I I the
 
01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
bill is too broad I mean and we do need
 
01:10:56.110 --> 01:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
to oppose the bill as drafted um and I
 
01:10:57.870 --> 01:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that there's work that
 
01:10:59.950 --> 01:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
would bring this to a place where we
 
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:11:04.149 --> 01:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
comfortable thank you any other
 
01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
questions of this witness seeing none
 
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
thank you if anyone has written
 
01:11:10.669 --> 01:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
testimony even if it's just one sheet
 
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
that you want to turn in the clerk would
 
01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:14.430 align:start position:0%
that you want to turn in the clerk would
appreciate

01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:40.629 --> 01:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
thank you chair for taking the time to
 
01:11:43.229 --> 01:11:43.239 align:start position:0%
hear my testimony uh I've already passed
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
around a written copy of my remarks
 
01:11:47.229 --> 01:11:47.239 align:start position:0%
ahead of uh the hearing but I just
 
01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to note I'm passing around
 
01:11:51.669 --> 01:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
testimony on behalf of new futures for
 
01:11:55.629 --> 01:11:55.639 align:start position:0%
your review as well um for the record my
 
01:11:57.910 --> 01:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
name is Courtney Reid I serve as policy
 
01:12:00.430 --> 01:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
Advocate with the ACLU of New Hampshire
 
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm speaking in opposition to House
 
01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:03.750 align:start position:0%
and I'm speaking in opposition to House
Bill

01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
232 uh I just want to preface our
 
01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
concerns with this bill by noting that
 
01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
the ACLU throughout its history has
 
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
deeply valued religious liberty and has
 
01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
consistently fought to uphold these
 
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
freedoms and uh values First Amendment
 
01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
rights of expression and speech uh
 
01:12:25.629 --> 01:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
however there are concerns that Bill
 
01:12:29.629 --> 01:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
fails to balance uh these freedom of
 
01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
speech and uh belief exercises with
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
existing federal and state law and
 
01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.870 align:start position:0%
existing federal and state law and
discrimination

01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
protections uh in that it
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
would use the principle of religious
 
01:12:45.149 --> 01:12:45.159 align:start position:0%
freedom to discriminate or deny crucial
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
services to individuals in
 
01:12:50.709 --> 01:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
need and to dive into some of our
 
01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
concerns of the bill and how this would
 
01:12:54.910 --> 01:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
work in practice uh I want to Echo some
 
01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
of remarks that we've heard before uh
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
from previous speakers that the broad
 
01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
language of the bill and how it defines
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
health care provider or
 
01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
participate suggests uh that it could
 
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
have a reaching impact Beyond simply
 
01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
providing Medical Care again that this
 
01:13:13.950 --> 01:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
could affect scheduling Pharmacy pickups
 
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
referrals or insurance coverage uh and I
 
01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
want to note that uh although we haven't
 
01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
seen the amendment that's floating
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
around uh that this exemption
 
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.390 align:start position:0%
around uh that this exemption
for

01:13:27.390 --> 01:13:27.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
emergencies really just wouldn't work in
 
01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
practice especially considering this
 
01:13:34.030 --> 01:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
broad scope of Provider uh I think it
 
01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
should be uh a priority for the the
 
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
committee to concern how uh different
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
individuals that fall under the scope of
 
01:13:44.590 --> 01:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
this definition really fail to uh
 
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
exercise the same degree of medical
 
01:13:50.229 --> 01:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
judgment and discretion when it comes to
 
01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
uh determining Emergency
 
01:13:58.510 --> 01:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:01.400 align:start position:0%
with that uh you know the definition of
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
abortion as it as it is in the bill uh
 
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
does have a carve out for ectopic
 
01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
pregnancy but again uh there are many
 
01:14:10.510 --> 01:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
other instances around the country where
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
we've seen restrictions on access to
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
abortion uh where health is in the line
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
and where seconds count and so these
 
01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
alarming medical conditions uh like
 
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
hemorrhaging or sepsis uh really
 
01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:28.760 align:start position:0%
cannot uh work with the language of the
 
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
bill as it as it is in its current state
 
01:14:34.149 --> 01:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
and uh I just want to express that from
 
01:14:36.149 --> 01:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
our previous hearings for example on HB
 
01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
476 that Granite Staters really
 
01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
understand the realities of medical
 
01:14:42.669 --> 01:14:42.679 align:start position:0%
emergencies and they just do not uh look
 
01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
favorably on barriers to the sensitive
 
01:14:48.270 --> 01:14:48.280 align:start position:0%
care um with that there is also a
 
01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
failure to consider instances of rape
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
incest or other life-threatening or
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
traumatic situations but uh beyond that
 
01:14:58.790 --> 01:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
the license to discriminate would really
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
be felt more severely in rural areas of
 
01:15:04.110 --> 01:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
the state where patients have a limited
 
01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
choice in medical care uh and delays
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
brought on by travel or for waiting for
 
01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:14.920 align:start position:0%
a deterioration of one's uh condition uh
 
01:15:18.189 --> 01:15:18.199 align:start position:0%
would really result in irreparable harm
 
01:15:21.149 --> 01:15:21.159 align:start position:0%
and just to talk about existing state
 
01:15:22.629 --> 01:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
and federal
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
protections uh I think that this bill
 
01:15:27.229 --> 01:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
really raised concerns about violating
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
different uh laws for example um
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
allowing for restrictions on abortion
 
01:15:37.229 --> 01:15:37.239 align:start position:0%
narrower than our current state law the
 
01:15:39.709 --> 01:15:39.719 align:start position:0%
bar on civil or criminal actions from
 
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
public officials um it is unclear in the
 
01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
bill if this would go so far as to
 
01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
prevent the AG the New Hampshire AG from
 
01:15:52.270 --> 01:15:52.280 align:start position:0%
acting uh on a discrimination claim and
 
01:15:55.709 --> 01:15:55.719 align:start position:0%
I also wanted to cite uh Mt
 
01:15:59.070 --> 01:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
which is a federal law uh the emergency
 
01:16:01.229 --> 01:16:01.239 align:start position:0%
treatment uh and Labor Act which
 
01:16:03.629 --> 01:16:03.639 align:start position:0%
requires stabilization Transport
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
Services as well as title 9's healthc
 
01:16:08.590 --> 01:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
Care Service uh provision and the
 
01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care acts discrimination
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
protections just to name a few uh
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
Federal protections that I
 
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
think would be uh at risk of violation
 
01:16:20.189 --> 01:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
under this law uh I also want to express
 
01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire state law has
 
01:16:23.470 --> 01:16:23.480 align:start position:0%
discrimination protections that would be
 
01:16:26.430 --> 01:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
undermined um and earlier I talked about
 
01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
balancing discrimination protections
 
01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
with religious freedoms RSA 354a does a
 
01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
much better job at considering these
 
01:16:37.629 --> 01:16:37.639 align:start position:0%
balances for example if you uh look at
 
01:16:37.639 --> 01:16:38.270 align:start position:0%
balances for example if you uh look at
uh

01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:41.149 --> 01:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
35415 regarding housing there is a
 
01:16:42.990 --> 01:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
exemption for religious organizations
 
01:16:46.629 --> 01:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
there uh as well as RSA
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
49122 that gives individuals a a cause
 
01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
of action if their religious Liberties
 
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
have been
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
violated um broadening those protections
 
01:16:59.189 --> 01:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
we also have constitutional Protections
 
01:17:02.229 --> 01:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
in the 1 and 14th Amendment coupled with
 
01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh title sevens uh reasonable
 
01:17:07.229 --> 01:17:07.239 align:start position:0%
accommodations for employers we also
 
01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
have legislation like the religious
 
01:17:11.709 --> 01:17:11.719 align:start position:0%
freedom restoration act that requires
 
01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
strict scrutiny to be applied before uh
 
01:17:18.189 --> 01:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
any law is enacted that would burden
 
01:17:18.199 --> 01:17:19.229 align:start position:0%
any law is enacted that would burden
religious

01:17:19.229 --> 01:17:19.239 align:start position:0%
religious
 
01:17:21.390 --> 01:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
freedoms and so I'm citing a lot of
 
01:17:23.629 --> 01:17:23.639 align:start position:0%
things here but all of this is to say
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
that there are numerous state and
 
01:17:27.790 --> 01:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
federal protections that are well
 
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
thought out and have been hard earned to
 
01:17:32.709 --> 01:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
balance both of these Liberties and to
 
01:17:35.790 --> 01:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
protect patients and medical providers
 
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh it is in our view that HB 232
 
01:17:40.270 --> 01:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
undermines all of this work and
 
01:17:42.510 --> 01:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
essentially would give clinicians a
 
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
blank check to violate these safeguards
 
01:17:46.669 --> 01:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
uh at the cost of the health and
 
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
well-being of granite Staters even
 
01:17:51.310 --> 01:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
jeopardizing Federal funding streams um
 
01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
I have a few other notes in my testimony
 
01:17:55.709 --> 01:17:55.719 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take questions
 
01:17:57.790 --> 01:17:57.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so much are there any
 
01:17:59.350 --> 01:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
questions of this
 
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank
 
01:18:41.790 --> 01:18:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair honorable members of
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
the House Judiciary Committee thank you
 
01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:47.199 align:start position:0%
for hearing my testimony my name is
 
01:18:49.149 --> 01:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
Jason Hennessy I'm the president for New
 
01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire IDE to life I also have a PhD
 
01:18:53.950 --> 01:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
in computational sciences and statistics
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
and we're here to
 
01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
uh enthusiastically recommend that you
 
01:18:58.350 --> 01:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
pass the
 
01:19:01.790 --> 01:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
Bill many of you will remember the uh
 
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
the Chinese weager story where in
 
01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
western China many uh Muslim Chinese
 
01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
residents were put into re-education
 
01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:15.800 align:start position:0%
camps and forced to eat um pork as part
 
01:19:19.229 --> 01:19:19.239 align:start position:0%
of becoming more Mainline H Chinese now
 
01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:21.400 align:start position:0%
when we hear this this is this is
 
01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
grotesque because that's a huge
 
01:19:25.709 --> 01:19:25.719 align:start position:0%
violation of their conscience
 
01:19:27.629 --> 01:19:27.639 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to tell you that there are
 
01:19:30.149 --> 01:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
many uh pro-life Healthcare
 
01:19:33.229 --> 01:19:33.239 align:start position:0%
practitioners for whom having to do an
 
01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
abortion or be fired is also a huge
 
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
violation in fact uh throughout most of
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
History including in the hypocritic oath
 
01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
most many major religions have said that
 
01:19:47.310 --> 01:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:19:49.229 --> 01:19:49.239 align:start position:0%
wrong and
 
01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
so we want to we want to keep ethical
 
01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
Health Care here in New Hampshire we
 
01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
want to make sure our our practition are
 
01:19:56.229 --> 01:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
not having to violate their conscience
 
01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
in order just to keep their jobs article
 
01:20:00.990 --> 01:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
four of the New Hampshire Constitution
 
01:20:02.669 --> 01:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
declares that we have a right of
 
01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
conscience and it's in
 
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
inalienable Article 5 similarly
 
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
guarantees religious freedoms and HB 232
 
01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:12.229 align:start position:0%
guarantees religious freedoms and HB 232
upholds

01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
upholds
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
these uh I want to I want to cite a uh
 
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
research letter from the uh Journal of
 
01:20:20.910 --> 01:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
the American Med medical
 
01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
association the most recent that I could
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
find and which says that's 4 States
 
01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:27.550 align:start position:0%
find and which says that's 4 States
explicitly

01:20:27.550 --> 01:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
explicitly
 
01:20:30.189 --> 01:20:30.199 align:start position:0%
have uh protections for healthcare
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
practitioners and
 
01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
conscience and of those one of them
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
Mississippi basically protects anything
 
01:20:37.629 --> 01:20:37.639 align:start position:0%
that in your job that you have a
 
01:20:40.430 --> 01:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
conscience for so basically 47 States
 
01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
I've heard I've heard many
 
01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
concerns uh that have been have been
 
01:20:47.669 --> 01:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
spoken about here but I have not heard
 
01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
really examples because if we have 47
 
01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
states that have had these laws on the
 
01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
books for many years you would think
 
01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
there being plenty of examples to to
 
01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
quote from I mean these are states like
 
01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
California and New York Massachusetts
 
01:21:03.790 --> 01:21:03.800 align:start position:0%
all of many of these have rural areas um
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
and and they don't have the the things
 
01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
that people are asking for but we don't
 
01:21:10.189 --> 01:21:10.199 align:start position:0%
have any examples not that I heard of
 
01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
anyway now the question is do we need a
 
01:21:14.110 --> 01:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law uh we just heard that
 
01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:15.719 align:start position:0%
there's federal laws that protect
 
01:21:18.030 --> 01:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
conscience I want to draw your attention
 
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
to uh next door in Vermont who is one of
 
01:21:22.030 --> 01:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
the other three states that does not
 
01:21:25.629 --> 01:21:25.639 align:start position:0%
have a conscience law and and in there I
 
01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:21:29.629 --> 01:21:29.639 align:start position:0%
quote from the uh at the University of
 
01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
Vermont Medical Center a notice of
 
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
violation was issued by the federal HHS
 
01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
office office of civil rights and they
 
01:21:40.590 --> 01:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
reported that uh that UV MMC forced and
 
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
for forced the nurse complainant to
 
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
assist in an abortion against the
 
01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
nurse's religious or moral objection the
 
01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
nurse had expressed an objection for
 
01:21:50.430 --> 01:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
many years and was included in a list of
 
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
objectors but UV MMC knowingly assigned
 
01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
the nurse to an abortion procedure
 
01:21:56.910 --> 01:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
the nurse was not told the procedure was
 
01:21:58.470 --> 01:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
an abortion until the nurse walked into
 
01:22:00.510 --> 01:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
the room when the doctor knowing that
 
01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
the nurse
 
01:22:04.510 --> 01:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
objected told the nurse don't hate
 
01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
me the nurse again objected and other
 
01:22:09.870 --> 01:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
staff who were uh present who could have
 
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
taken the nurse's place but the nurse
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:17.070 --> 01:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
assist uh another another article
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
reports that the nurse left that
 
01:22:20.910 --> 01:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
position and has been traumatized ever
 
01:22:22.990 --> 01:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
since I want to draw your attention to
 
01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
this because you might think well
 
01:22:25.950 --> 01:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
federal law is going to cover it because
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
you know DHHS came in and the doj came
 
01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
in but it turns out that once the
 
01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
administration switched over in 2021 all
 
01:22:34.510 --> 01:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
of this went away all the all the
 
01:22:36.990 --> 01:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
charges were dropped that's why we need
 
01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire law we cannot depend on
 
01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
the federal government to uphold
 
01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
conscience rights and we have to do it
 
01:22:45.229 --> 01:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
here at the state level and this isn't
 
01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
just other states um if you go to the
 
01:22:51.149 --> 01:22:51.159 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock web page uh on their
 
01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
policies for OBGYN residents they
 
01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
require their residents to actually
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
refer for abortion even if it's against
 
01:22:58.560 --> 01:22:59.229 align:start position:0%
refer for abortion even if it's against
their

01:22:59.229 --> 01:22:59.239 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
conscience so this is not a theoretical
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
issue this is an issue that is happening
 
01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
here and
 
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
now and this is just what's on the web
 
01:23:09.709 --> 01:23:09.719 align:start position:0%
right there's there's probably all sorts
 
01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
of stories that are not are not there
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
and a reference to this is in my my
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
testimony that you're welcome to look up
 
01:23:18.189 --> 01:23:18.199 align:start position:0%
last week this committee also heard on
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
the hearing for HP 476 that we have uh
 
01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.270 align:start position:0%
the hearing for HP 476 that we have uh
severe

01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
severe
 
01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
shortages well keep in mind that the
 
01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
number of OBGYNs that actually do
 
01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
abortions is in the single digits
 
01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
according to according to one
 
01:23:34.110 --> 01:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
survey if that's the case that means
 
01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
that the vast majority do not perform
 
01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
abortions and so if we want to recruit
 
01:23:40.629 --> 01:23:40.639 align:start position:0%
from the from the vast majority of them
 
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
having conscience Protections in place
 
01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:47.110 align:start position:0%
having conscience Protections in place
is

01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:49.629 --> 01:23:49.639 align:start position:0%
required and I'll also share that I am
 
01:23:52.270 --> 01:23:52.280 align:start position:0%
aware of at least one Dartmouth medical
 
01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
school graduate who was familiar with
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
the policies at Dartmouth and refuse to
 
01:23:58.430 --> 01:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
stay here for residency because of those
 
01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:00.270 align:start position:0%
stay here for residency because of those
abortion

01:24:00.270 --> 01:24:00.280 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
policies but that's but other people who
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
are coming into the state from out of
 
01:24:05.870 --> 01:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
state may not be familiar with that they
 
01:24:08.709 --> 01:24:08.719 align:start position:0%
may not read all the
 
01:24:11.550 --> 01:24:11.560 align:start position:0%
details finally I want to address uh
 
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
some of the things I heard here and uh
 
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
and talk about what happen has happened
 
01:24:19.709 --> 01:24:19.719 align:start position:0%
in other states first that this might
 
01:24:21.870 --> 01:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
apply to receptionists first off the
 
01:24:24.110 --> 01:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
idea that we would not give nurses AIDS
 
01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:25.070 align:start position:0%
idea that we would not give nurses AIDS
or

01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
other staff who don't happen to have the
 
01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
the education qualifications of other
 
01:24:33.550 --> 01:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
staff conscience protection is um is
 
01:24:36.430 --> 01:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
insane in my mind people should be able
 
01:24:37.590 --> 01:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
to follow their
 
01:24:40.830 --> 01:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
conscience and by the way at least 34
 
01:24:43.149 --> 01:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
States including places like New York
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
don't limit the conscience protections
 
01:24:47.790 --> 01:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
to only certain staff they basically say
 
01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:49.750 align:start position:0%
to only certain staff they basically say
healthcare

01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
healthcare
 
01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:52.280 align:start position:0%
workers secondly you heard that somebody
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
might decide on the spot that they have
 
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
Healthcare object or they have a
 
01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:56.870 align:start position:0%
Healthcare object or they have a
conscience

01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
01:24:59.669 --> 01:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
objection well States like California
 
01:25:02.669 --> 01:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts only require a written
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
objection they don't say how early you
 
01:25:06.669 --> 01:25:06.679 align:start position:0%
have to put it in New York's law only
 
01:25:09.149 --> 01:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
requires prior written refusal with no
 
01:25:11.830 --> 01:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:14.070 --> 01:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
prior again if this was an issue you
 
01:25:16.030 --> 01:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
would think that there would be stories
 
01:25:18.510 --> 01:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
that we'd be hearing from other
 
01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
states um other so New York and
 
01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts for example have no new
 
01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
emergency exceptions although we do
 
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
support having an emergency
 
01:25:30.030 --> 01:25:30.040 align:start position:0%
exception and and we are very familiar
 
01:25:32.189 --> 01:25:32.199 align:start position:0%
with many pro-life healthcare workers
 
01:25:34.189 --> 01:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
and we are not aware of any who would
 
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
mother and that is the I guess the last
 
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
comment I'll make is in terms of rural
 
01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
care um amongst the 47 other states that
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
have conscience protection there are
 
01:25:51.109 --> 01:25:51.119 align:start position:0%
many rural States in there um California
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts New York all have large
 
01:25:53.830 --> 01:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
rural areas and we haven't heard
 
01:25:56.070 --> 01:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
anything about uh conscience rights
 
01:25:58.709 --> 01:25:58.719 align:start position:0%
interfering with the treatment of women
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
and with that I would be happy to take
 
01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
any questions any questions of this
 
01:26:05.310 --> 01:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
witness representative
 
01:26:07.870 --> 01:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
McFarland in both your verbal and your
 
01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
written testimony you talk about this uh
 
01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
interpretation that so much as making a
 
01:26:18.430 --> 01:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
referral would in fact
 
01:26:20.910 --> 01:26:20.920 align:start position:0%
be performing an abortion or a
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
sterilization or an artificial
 
01:26:26.550 --> 01:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
contraception I I imagine that um that
 
01:26:29.310 --> 01:26:29.320 align:start position:0%
is not something that some folks
 
01:26:31.030 --> 01:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
understand readily can you help us
 
01:26:33.229 --> 01:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
understand what the case law is that
 
01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
supports that
 
01:26:37.229 --> 01:26:37.239 align:start position:0%
conclusion that a that a referral would
 
01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
would be a conscientious objection that
 
01:26:41.109 --> 01:26:41.119 align:start position:0%
the performance of an appropriate
 
01:26:43.229 --> 01:26:43.239 align:start position:0%
referral is in and of itself the
 
01:26:48.390 --> 01:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:51.109 --> 01:26:51.119 align:start position:0%
act so my understanding is that there
 
01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
are a number of of phys s who very much
 
01:26:59.390 --> 01:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
object to abortion they believe it to be
 
01:27:02.910 --> 01:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
murder and the idea that you would help
 
01:27:07.109 --> 01:27:07.119 align:start position:0%
somebody obtain that would be in itself
 
01:27:09.310 --> 01:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
unconscionable may I have a
 
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
followup yes do you believe then that a
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
patient who goes to such a physician if
 
01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
they were given the right to object for
 
01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:19.270 align:start position:0%
they were given the right to object for
these

01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
reasons and is unable to be satisfied in
 
01:27:24.189 --> 01:27:24.199 align:start position:0%
in their purposes for going to that pH
 
01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
position should be charged for the
 
01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
services if I can if I can better
 
01:27:32.430 --> 01:27:32.440 align:start position:0%
understand your question representative
 
01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
you're you're
 
01:27:36.109 --> 01:27:36.119 align:start position:0%
saying can they charge for a service so
 
01:27:39.390 --> 01:27:39.400 align:start position:0%
suppose I go to a GP and I say I have
 
01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:41.199 align:start position:0%
several you know things I want to
 
01:27:43.350 --> 01:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
address and and these items are one of
 
01:27:46.270 --> 01:27:46.280 align:start position:0%
them and that physician then says I I am
 
01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:48.440 align:start position:0%
neither going to take care of you nor
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
make a referral are you saying that that
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
the hospital organization should still
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
charge for that service or should that
 
01:27:58.109 --> 01:27:58.119 align:start position:0%
service be null and void thank you for
 
01:27:59.550 --> 01:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
the question representative one of the
 
01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:01.119 align:start position:0%
things I know is that I do not
 
01:28:03.229 --> 01:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
understand medical billing so I don't
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
feel like I could answer that
 
01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
question thank
 
01:28:10.350 --> 01:28:10.360 align:start position:0%
you any other questions seeing none
 
01:28:14.109 --> 01:28:14.119 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Miss
 
01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:33.280 align:start position:0%

232 you've heard a lot I submitted I
 
01:28:54.109 --> 01:28:54.119 align:start position:0%
previously submitted written test
 
01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
testimony that I think outlined the over
 
01:28:57.910 --> 01:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
breadth that's been addressed by many
 
01:29:00.629 --> 01:29:00.639 align:start position:0%
other people at this hearing um it's
 
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
extremely over Broad in
 
01:29:06.030 --> 01:29:06.040 align:start position:0%
scope this bill has been brought at
 
01:29:07.870 --> 01:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
least twice before and I think it's been
 
01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
deemed inexpedient to legislate each
 
01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
time I hope that it reaches the same
 
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
fate during this
 
01:29:16.590 --> 01:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
session the New Hampshire Association
 
01:29:19.550 --> 01:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
for justice strongly feels that this is
 
01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
a solution in search of a problem it's
 
01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
not something that is necessary
 
01:29:26.990 --> 01:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
as representative
 
01:29:30.189 --> 01:29:30.199 align:start position:0%
McFarland recognized federal law already
 
01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
protects against discrimination for
 
01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:34.350 align:start position:0%
protects against discrimination for
employment

01:29:34.350 --> 01:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
employment
 
01:29:36.910 --> 01:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
disputes our biggest concern as an
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
organization is the broad immunity that
 
01:29:44.030 --> 01:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
it grants to Health Care Providers if
 
01:29:46.709 --> 01:29:46.719 align:start position:0%
someone is harmed because of a
 
01:29:51.390 --> 01:29:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:54.109 --> 01:29:54.119 align:start position:0%
conscience as this committee knows the
 
01:29:56.189 --> 01:29:56.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution guarantees
 
01:29:57.870 --> 01:29:57.880 align:start position:0%
every citizen of the state a right to a
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
remedy our Supreme Court has found that
 
01:30:03.950 --> 01:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
while not fundamental it is an important
 
01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
substantive right and there are very few
 
01:30:10.750 --> 01:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
immunities allowed in state law even the
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire has waved its
 
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
sovereign immunity which is perhaps the
 
01:30:17.070 --> 01:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
most important that we know when a state
 
01:30:20.270 --> 01:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
actor harms a
 
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
citizen if a healthc care provider
 
01:30:24.990 --> 01:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
exercises their right to
 
01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
conscience that shouldn't alleviate them
 
01:30:29.470 --> 01:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
from their responsibility for any harm
 
01:30:31.550 --> 01:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
that they cause to a
 
01:30:34.750 --> 01:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
patient we've heard about the emergency
 
01:30:36.790 --> 01:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
issues that may come up there are other
 
01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
times when people may require
 
01:30:42.510 --> 01:30:42.520 align:start position:0%
sterilization for breast cancer or for
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
other cancers when they need to have
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
their ovaries removed sterilization
 
01:30:52.189 --> 01:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
encompasses decisions for vasectomy for
 
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
men it encompasses as many things this
 
01:30:57.550 --> 01:30:57.560 align:start position:0%
isn't just an abortion bill when we're
 
01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
dealing with rights of
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
conscience in addition to the broad
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
immunity that this is given it's taking
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
away patients rights of action
 
01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
and it's a very slippery slope as well
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
if we think of how far this can go if
 
01:31:16.350 --> 01:31:16.360 align:start position:0%
this bill is passed the right of
 
01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
conscience can be extended to many other
 
01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
things it can be extended to allow
 
01:31:21.149 --> 01:31:21.159 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Providers to ignore do not
 
01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
resuscitation orders of
 
01:31:24.990 --> 01:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
patients if the rights of conscience
 
01:31:27.709 --> 01:31:27.719 align:start position:0%
bill is passed it could be extended in
 
01:31:30.510 --> 01:31:30.520 align:start position:0%
the future to allow providers to choose
 
01:31:32.189 --> 01:31:32.199 align:start position:0%
not to
 
01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
prescribe medications if they oppose
 
01:31:37.310 --> 01:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
them this is a slippery slope for the
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
future and it's something that I think
 
01:31:42.070 --> 01:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
requires a lot of consideration before
 
01:31:44.350 --> 01:31:44.360 align:start position:0%
it should ever come to
 
01:31:47.950 --> 01:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
fruition and finally the bill itself is
 
01:31:50.669 --> 01:31:50.679 align:start position:0%
internally inconsistent and while it
 
01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
protects the healthcare provider's right
 
01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
of conscience it completely ignores All
 
01:31:59.709 --> 01:31:59.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:03.109 --> 01:32:03.119 align:start position:0%
patients in section E3 the notice
 
01:32:04.750 --> 01:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
requirement I think representative
 
01:32:08.030 --> 01:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
McFarland recognized this the notice is
 
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
for healthc care providers it's not
 
01:32:11.550 --> 01:32:11.560 align:start position:0%
notice to the patients patients are
 
01:32:14.510 --> 01:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
never going to be notified if a provider
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
is exercising their right of conscience
 
01:32:18.430 --> 01:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
especially if it's someone a scheduling
 
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
clerk in an OBGYN office when someone
 
01:32:22.669 --> 01:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
calls to schedule an appointment to
 
01:32:24.550 --> 01:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
discuss contra
 
01:32:26.629 --> 01:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
exception the patient will never get
 
01:32:28.669 --> 01:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
notice of this it's nice that the
 
01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
provider will have notice that they
 
01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
can't be discriminated against but the
 
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
patient never going to have notice that
 
01:32:35.070 --> 01:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
providers are allowed to exercise their
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
right of
 
01:32:38.189 --> 01:32:38.199 align:start position:0%
conscience the other internal
 
01:32:41.310 --> 01:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
inconsistency is that this is giving
 
01:32:44.109 --> 01:32:44.119 align:start position:0%
providers their own cause of action to
 
01:32:46.990 --> 01:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
sue it provides them with civil remedies
 
01:32:50.030 --> 01:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
it allows them to Super for damages if
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
they're discriminated against for
 
01:32:53.550 --> 01:32:53.560 align:start position:0%
exercising the right of conscience but
 
01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
at the same time it's taking away the
 
01:32:57.430 --> 01:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
right of the patient to sue for damages
 
01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
or to have a civil remedy if the
 
01:33:02.629 --> 01:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
provider exercises their right of
 
01:33:05.070 --> 01:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
conscience you can't have it both ways
 
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
you can't give the provider a right that
 
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
you're taking away from the patient
 
01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
that's just not fair in practice it
 
01:33:14.669 --> 01:33:14.679 align:start position:0%
can't happen and I would hope that this
 
01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
committee would deem this inexpedient to
 
01:33:18.870 --> 01:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
legislate I'm happy to take any
 
01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:21.320 align:start position:0%
questions you may have any questions of
 
01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
this witness representative Oregan
 
01:33:27.870 --> 01:33:27.880 align:start position:0%
um this may be this may be a good
 
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
question for you because um you're
 
01:33:31.390 --> 01:33:31.400 align:start position:0%
obviously you wouldn't be here if you
 
01:33:34.910 --> 01:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
weren't a uh very if you weren't like a
 
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
lawyer is very well respected by your
 
01:33:39.390 --> 01:33:39.400 align:start position:0%
fellow trial fellow lawyers and also uh
 
01:33:40.669 --> 01:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
obviously studied the whole thing in
 
01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
great detail but one thing I've noticed
 
01:33:46.189 --> 01:33:46.199 align:start position:0%
it seems to me maybe I'm right or wrong
 
01:33:48.669 --> 01:33:48.679 align:start position:0%
and I don't know whether the dep of
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
healthc care provider excludes um
 
01:33:53.149 --> 01:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
so-called Pregnancy Crisis centers which
 
01:33:55.390 --> 01:33:55.400 align:start position:0%
I guess probably wouldn't ever be
 
01:33:57.189 --> 01:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
encouraging people to have abortions but
 
01:33:59.070 --> 01:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
you know they might be
 
01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
encouraging uh the young women who are
 
01:34:04.109 --> 01:34:04.119 align:start position:0%
there to uh take advantage of some of
 
01:34:05.709 --> 01:34:05.719 align:start position:0%
the other services which this bill
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
covers so is that uh so do you do you
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
feel that do you think the bill is
 
01:34:12.430 --> 01:34:12.440 align:start position:0%
written um does it does it in fact as I
 
01:34:15.149 --> 01:34:15.159 align:start position:0%
seem to read it exclude such pres such
 
01:34:17.229 --> 01:34:17.239 align:start position:0%
centers or are they included in that
 
01:34:17.239 --> 01:34:18.550 align:start position:0%
centers or are they included in that
definition

01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
definition
 
01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
or I don't think that I looked that
 
01:34:24.270 --> 01:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
closely at it and I'm sorry
 
01:34:26.669 --> 01:34:26.679 align:start position:0%
okay yeah that's just over a global okay
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
just thought i' just thought I'd ask in
 
01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
case you had a thought but thank don't
 
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:31.840 align:start position:0%

01:37:58.270 --> 01:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:37:59.950 --> 01:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
thank you committee for hearing this
 
01:38:02.669 --> 01:38:02.679 align:start position:0%
this bill for the record my name is
 
01:38:05.109 --> 01:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
representative Margaret dry I serve
 
01:38:08.270 --> 01:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
Sullivan district 7 which is Charlestown
 
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
Cornish I heard a really disturbing fact
 
01:38:21.709 --> 01:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
last summer at a conference that 40% of
 
01:38:23.950 --> 01:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
America's 9 to 11 year olds had been
 
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
exposed to hardcore
 
01:38:29.350 --> 01:38:29.360 align:start position:0%
pornography it bothered me so much that
 
01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
I jumped at the chance to sponsor a bill
 
01:38:34.830 --> 01:38:34.840 align:start position:0%
like one in Louisiana that required age
 
01:38:37.629 --> 01:38:37.639 align:start position:0%
verification before a user could access
 
01:38:41.870 --> 01:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
a porn site 19 states have passed that
 
01:38:44.790 --> 01:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
age verification law
 
01:38:48.350 --> 01:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
however in um one of them Free Speech
 
01:38:51.189 --> 01:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
Coalition versus Paxton is presently
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
before the United States Supreme Court
 
01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh to determine if it undermines free
 
01:38:58.830 --> 01:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
speech this Judiciary Committee actually
 
01:39:01.669 --> 01:39:01.679 align:start position:0%
last year had a similar bill on age
 
01:39:03.629 --> 01:39:03.639 align:start position:0%
verification uh and it was voted in
 
01:39:04.910 --> 01:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
expedient to
 
01:39:06.990 --> 01:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
legislate uh the paragraph in the house
 
01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
calendar that described it had three
 
01:39:10.950 --> 01:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
problems with that bill one it was easy
 
01:39:13.070 --> 01:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
to get around uh age verification
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
digitally because of uh V virtual
 
01:39:19.709 --> 01:39:19.719 align:start position:0%
private networks VPN um the similar Bill
 
01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
the Paxton bill was headed towards the
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court to see if it was VI in the
 
01:39:26.070 --> 01:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
First Amendment and the Attorney General
 
01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
was mentioned in the bill but nobody had
 
01:39:29.709 --> 01:39:29.719 align:start position:0%
consulted the Attorney
 
01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
General so an alternate Bill one that
 
01:39:35.310 --> 01:39:35.320 align:start position:0%
used a filter on electronic devices
 
01:39:38.109 --> 01:39:38.119 align:start position:0%
seemed like a better approach uh justice
 
01:39:41.589 --> 01:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
Kennedy and ashc uh in 2002 gave this
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
advice he said filters are less
 
01:39:46.510 --> 01:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
restrictive they impose selective
 
01:39:48.629 --> 01:39:48.639 align:start position:0%
restrictions on speech at the receiving
 
01:39:52.390 --> 01:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
end not Universal restrictions at the
 
01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:53.910 align:start position:0%
end not Universal restrictions at the
source

01:39:53.910 --> 01:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
source
 
01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
so this bill or one very much like the
 
01:39:57.669 --> 01:39:57.679 align:start position:0%
one you have before you today was passed
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
in Utah last year and took effect on
 
01:40:02.189 --> 01:40:02.199 align:start position:0%
January 1st
 
01:40:04.709 --> 01:40:04.719 align:start position:0%
2025 one of the first things I did when
 
01:40:06.990 --> 01:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
I got a copy of the bill that was passed
 
01:40:09.709 --> 01:40:09.719 align:start position:0%
in Utah was to send it on to our own
 
01:40:12.109 --> 01:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
attorney general for consultation the
 
01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
bill before you has been adjusted to
 
01:40:16.350 --> 01:40:16.360 align:start position:0%
refer to New Hampshire
 
01:40:19.270 --> 01:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
statutes and it has basically six
 
01:40:21.589 --> 01:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
sections very briefly I just want to
 
01:40:24.629 --> 01:40:24.639 align:start position:0%
point out the first section adds
 
01:40:28.510 --> 01:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
um amends the consumer expectation of
 
01:40:32.229 --> 01:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
privacy act that's what 507 DH colon 4
 
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
is to assume that the manufacturer of
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
the device will have a filter on the
 
01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
device then it moves on to a lot of
 
01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
definitions the one that's probably the
 
01:40:45.189 --> 01:40:45.199 align:start position:0%
most important on there is uh Roman
 
01:40:48.510 --> 01:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
numeral 8 which says obscene material
 
01:40:55.149 --> 01:40:55.159 align:start position:0%
that references R RSA 650 colon 1
 
01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
um the device filter is required in the
 
01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
next section uh there will be more
 
01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
today if there
 
01:41:11.950 --> 01:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
is this that requires a filter on the
 
01:41:14.229 --> 01:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
devices made by put there by the
 
01:41:16.510 --> 01:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturer the retailer has nothing to
 
01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
do with this it's just the
 
01:41:20.550 --> 01:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturer there's a private right of
 
01:41:24.270 --> 01:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
action for parents if the Mach if the
 
01:41:25.950 --> 01:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
device does not have a filter and they
 
01:41:29.629 --> 01:41:29.639 align:start position:0%
expected it or if uh someone has
 
01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
intentionally or unintentionally
 
01:41:34.270 --> 01:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
disabled the filter and their minor was
 
01:41:35.870 --> 01:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
exposed to
 
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
pornography um the next section is the
 
01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act this is where
 
01:41:44.109 --> 01:41:44.119 align:start position:0%
our attorney general would get in um
 
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
into the mix basically if the device
 
01:41:49.589 --> 01:41:49.599 align:start position:0%
says it has a filter it's required to
 
01:41:51.870 --> 01:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
have a filter and it does not that's an
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
area for the Attorney General to
 
01:41:56.830 --> 01:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
investigate finally there's criminal
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
liability for disabling the filter if
 
01:42:01.510 --> 01:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
you are not the parent or the guardian
 
01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
um and then um sets the the details for
 
01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
that it's a very simple bill it moves
 
01:42:11.669 --> 01:42:11.679 align:start position:0%
along pretty well and and it has been
 
01:42:14.149 --> 01:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
looked at with a number of eyes but I
 
01:42:15.510 --> 01:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
want to tell you why this bill is
 
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
important it's because families can
 
01:42:21.030 --> 01:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
control access on devices there are
 
01:42:22.990 --> 01:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
parents that can do this they can set it
 
01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:23.790 align:start position:0%
parents that can do this they can set it
up

01:42:23.790 --> 01:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:42:25.709 --> 01:42:25.719 align:start position:0%
most of the time they say it's extremely
 
01:42:28.830 --> 01:42:28.840 align:start position:0%
complicated but they can still set it up
 
01:42:30.830 --> 01:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
but they can't control what their
 
01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
children's friends parents do so why
 
01:42:39.189 --> 01:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
don't we set the safety as our default
 
01:42:41.669 --> 01:42:41.679 align:start position:0%
so to protect young eyes make them all
 
01:42:44.950 --> 01:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
safe and then adults can disable the
 
01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
filter as they see fit on their own
 
01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:49.990 align:start position:0%
filter as they see fit on their own
devices

01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
devices
 
01:42:52.910 --> 01:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
finally um this has met all the qualif
 
01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
the problems that you saw last year in
 
01:42:57.629 --> 01:42:57.639 align:start position:0%
an age verification bill I believe it's
 
01:43:01.149 --> 01:43:01.159 align:start position:0%
a better Bill and reports from Utah
 
01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
after their law has been in effect for
 
01:43:04.669 --> 01:43:04.679 align:start position:0%
more than a month is that there have
 
01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
been no problems with its implementation
 
01:43:08.990 --> 01:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm asking you to vote this bill
 
01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
ought to pass thank you and I'm open to
 
01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
any questions I have one question uh so
 
01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
this filter of something that's already
 
01:43:16.229 --> 01:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
in place it wouldn't be something
 
01:43:18.589 --> 01:43:18.599 align:start position:0%
manufacturers would have to have time to
 
01:43:20.350 --> 01:43:20.360 align:start position:0%
work the build it's already there thank
 
01:43:22.350 --> 01:43:22.360 align:start position:0%
you for the question yes I was amazed
 
01:43:24.270 --> 01:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
and pleased to know that they're already
 
01:43:25.550 --> 01:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
there it's really just a matter of
 
01:43:28.189 --> 01:43:28.199 align:start position:0%
extending it to the the right age thank
 
01:43:32.109 --> 01:43:32.119 align:start position:0%
you representative Oregon um this is
 
01:43:34.430 --> 01:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
have a question about one detail in the
 
01:43:38.149 --> 01:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
bill which is um in um your proposed
 
01:43:43.589 --> 01:43:43.599 align:start position:0%
uh 50 507 the definitions Roman numeral
 
01:43:47.109 --> 01:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
7 so it says minors include means under
 
01:43:49.229 --> 01:43:49.239 align:start position:0%
age of 18 okay that makes sense but then
 
01:43:51.270 --> 01:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
you throw in it's not emancipated
 
01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
married or member of the Armed Forces
 
01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
the United States I'm not exactly sure
 
01:43:58.189 --> 01:43:58.199 align:start position:0%
why if someone is uh enlisted in the
 
01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
Armed Force why it's any less dangerous
 
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
for them to be viewing this material and
 
01:44:05.510 --> 01:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
same applies probably for those other
 
01:44:09.070 --> 01:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
two categories so why is why is it why
 
01:44:10.950 --> 01:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
is it not dangerous for a teenager to
 
01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
see this Museum this material if they're
 
01:44:15.390 --> 01:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
you know if they're in the service or
 
01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
but it's okay if if they're if they're
 
01:44:19.390 --> 01:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
why is it okay for them if they're in
 
01:44:20.709 --> 01:44:20.719 align:start position:0%
the service but like if they're a
 
01:44:23.070 --> 01:44:23.080 align:start position:0%
civilian they can't see it and likewise
 
01:44:25.229 --> 01:44:25.239 align:start position:0%
representative um that is already in the
 
01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
law and there are a number of places in
 
01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire statute where that
 
01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
triumphant of over 18 or emancipated or
 
01:44:34.510 --> 01:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
member of the AR active duty member of
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
the Armed Forces counts as an
 
01:44:40.750 --> 01:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
adult any other questions representative
 
01:44:43.030 --> 01:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
tur yeah thank you and thanks for taking
 
01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
the question so you start off talking
 
01:44:46.669 --> 01:44:46.679 align:start position:0%
about the fact that the prior law that
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
was itl uh focused on age verification
 
01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
and that this law doesn't but but this
 
01:44:57.709 --> 01:44:57.719 align:start position:0%
law does invoke age as a key requirement
 
01:44:59.790 --> 01:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
and as far as I see the only provision
 
01:45:01.550 --> 01:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
for how that's enforced is it ask the
 
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
user to provide their age when they set
 
01:45:07.390 --> 01:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
up their account so is this basically
 
01:45:09.390 --> 01:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
not even addressing the question of age
 
01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
verification essentially saying it it
 
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
you know that corporations could be put
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
in violation of Consumer Protections
 
01:45:19.990 --> 01:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
without any way to sort of uh certify
 
01:45:22.109 --> 01:45:22.119 align:start position:0%
that the person that they are showing
 
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
material to would qualify okay thank you
 
01:45:27.189 --> 01:45:27.199 align:start position:0%
for the question let me ask that the age
 
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
verification process is what we're
 
01:45:32.470 --> 01:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
talking about not just age verification
 
01:45:35.189 --> 01:45:35.199 align:start position:0%
the process that had the other Bill had
 
01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
was you had to submit a driver's license
 
01:45:38.470 --> 01:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
or something you had to give your
 
01:45:40.709 --> 01:45:40.719 align:start position:0%
information and be checked to me whether
 
01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:42.719 align:start position:0%
you were 18 or older so even if you were
 
01:45:44.669 --> 01:45:44.679 align:start position:0%
an adult you are exposing all your
 
01:45:48.430 --> 01:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
information to this company uh this is
 
01:45:49.990 --> 01:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
done when you buy the device and
 
01:45:53.070 --> 01:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
register and activate it it's done and
 
01:45:55.950 --> 01:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
will then the M they will recognize that
 
01:45:59.109 --> 01:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
the person who whose device it is is
 
01:46:02.470 --> 01:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
under 18 there will be a password so
 
01:46:04.629 --> 01:46:04.639 align:start position:0%
that somebody over 18 the parents that
 
01:46:06.669 --> 01:46:06.679 align:start position:0%
get the password can change it so that
 
01:46:09.669 --> 01:46:09.679 align:start position:0%
it acts as a normal device for them it's
 
01:46:11.669 --> 01:46:11.679 align:start position:0%
just when it's registered the when the
 
01:46:13.990 --> 01:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
password is activated it would notice
 
01:46:17.470 --> 01:46:17.480 align:start position:0%
that you were not there did De retail
 
01:46:19.109 --> 01:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
people are not involved in it and there
 
01:46:21.390 --> 01:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
is if you notice there um if the
 
01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:23.149 align:start position:0%
is if you notice there um if the
manufacturer

01:46:23.149 --> 01:46:23.159 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
01:46:26.310 --> 01:46:26.320 align:start position:0%
um believes that they have tried to meet
 
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
the criteria then then they wouldn't be
 
01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
charged for that if they if they've done
 
01:46:32.709 --> 01:46:32.719 align:start position:0%
their best to make sure that the filter
 
01:46:36.070 --> 01:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
is in place sorry one quick followup
 
01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
could you could you point me to the
 
01:46:39.870 --> 01:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
sorry could you point me to the place
 
01:46:42.350 --> 01:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
where in the law where it says that that
 
01:46:43.870 --> 01:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
that there are these these protections
 
01:46:45.910 --> 01:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
and exemptions because I'm not totally
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
clear who would perform this this
 
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
verification function okay um if you
 
01:46:56.510 --> 01:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
look on um page three uh lines 23 to 26
 
01:46:59.310 --> 01:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
manufacturer that does not comply can be
 
01:47:01.510 --> 01:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
subject to action by the attorney
 
01:47:03.990 --> 01:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
general that the manufacturer reasonably
 
01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:06.639 align:start position:0%
believed based on its demonal efforts to
 
01:47:08.470 --> 01:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
comply with the law that the device did
 
01:47:12.030 --> 01:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
simply did comply with the provisions
 
01:47:13.589 --> 01:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
should be an absolute defense to any
 
01:47:15.070 --> 01:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
violation brought according to this
 
01:47:17.550 --> 01:47:17.560 align:start position:0%
section and the line Right Above It 21
 
01:47:21.470 --> 01:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
no cause of action shall exist against a
 
01:47:24.189 --> 01:47:24.199 align:start position:0%
retailer represent
 
01:47:26.270 --> 01:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
McFarland thank you and uh
 
01:47:27.790 --> 01:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
representative I apologize I missed the
 
01:47:29.310 --> 01:47:29.320 align:start position:0%
the starting part of your testimony I
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
thought we were doing 253 before yours
 
01:47:35.189 --> 01:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
but uh um I I read this bill carefully
 
01:47:38.270 --> 01:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
and uh to representative T's
 
01:47:41.589 --> 01:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
question uh I do see the section in
 
01:47:44.070 --> 01:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
there that you talk about uh that
 
01:47:46.270 --> 01:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
protects the manufacturers or purports
 
01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
to protect the manufacturers as long as
 
01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
they comply with the other part of your
 
01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
bill with r RSA 507 uh dasi colon 2
 
01:47:59.470 --> 01:47:59.480 align:start position:0%
however the way that that language is
 
01:48:03.990 --> 01:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
structured is language which um if I
 
01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
understand correctly and I would
 
01:48:07.750 --> 01:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate your your confirming or or
 
01:48:11.189 --> 01:48:11.199 align:start position:0%
clarifying for me uh would in fact
 
01:48:14.350 --> 01:48:14.360 align:start position:0%
compel uh a whole raft of Manufacturers
 
01:48:16.350 --> 01:48:16.360 align:start position:0%
be it car manufacturers laptop
 
01:48:18.310 --> 01:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and other manufacturers to
 
01:48:20.149 --> 01:48:20.159 align:start position:0%
take actions which are technically
 
01:48:23.470 --> 01:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
impossible and uh which you know when
 
01:48:25.589 --> 01:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
you talk about these filters would in
 
01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
fact not achieve the ends that you're
 
01:48:30.149 --> 01:48:30.159 align:start position:0%
asking for because they could readily be
 
01:48:34.109 --> 01:48:34.119 align:start position:0%
uh bypassed by a juvenile in any event
 
01:48:37.310 --> 01:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
is that correct um I'm thank you for the
 
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
question I'm trying to imagine what a
 
01:48:43.629 --> 01:48:43.639 align:start position:0%
car manufacturer would have to change so
 
01:48:45.669 --> 01:48:45.679 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of cars nowadays that
 
01:48:48.430 --> 01:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
have internet access built into them as
 
01:48:55.070 --> 01:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
um I think i' you've reached the part
 
01:48:59.669 --> 01:48:59.679 align:start position:0%
where I'm a little not as technically
 
01:49:01.589 --> 01:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
inclined as I would need to answer that
 
01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
question but I can find out the answer
 
01:49:04.950 --> 01:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
for you thank
 
01:49:06.910 --> 01:49:06.920 align:start position:0%
you are there any other questions
 
01:49:08.669 --> 01:49:08.679 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you very much perhaps I've
 
01:49:15.070 --> 01:49:15.080 align:start position:0%
missed a section can you show me where
 
01:49:18.350 --> 01:49:18.360 align:start position:0%
um it says in here that the parent has
 
01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:21.149 align:start position:0%
um it says in here that the parent has
some

01:49:21.149 --> 01:49:21.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:23.229 --> 01:49:23.239 align:start position:0%
responsibility uh if you go towards the
 
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:32.470 --> 01:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
bill um the it's about disabling the
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
device so so it will set up the parent
 
01:49:37.390 --> 01:49:37.400 align:start position:0%
has the
 
01:49:40.470 --> 01:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
password it will be uh assume that it is
 
01:49:44.709 --> 01:49:44.719 align:start position:0%
set to 18 and uh that uh anybody or
 
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
under 18 what and that's the beginning
 
01:49:51.070 --> 01:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
what line is that all right
 
01:49:54.030 --> 01:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
well are you looking for when they set
 
01:49:56.229 --> 01:49:56.239 align:start position:0%
it up how it's done or no I'm looking at
 
01:49:57.149 --> 01:49:57.159 align:start position:0%
what the
 
01:50:00.350 --> 01:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility I'm sorry I'm looking at
 
01:50:03.550 --> 01:50:03.560 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of a parent obviously
 
01:50:06.750 --> 01:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
I you know I'm showing my age um because
 
01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
I you know I raise children and
 
01:50:10.750 --> 01:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
grandchildren with devices that had on
 
01:50:13.310 --> 01:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
and off switches and I had the
 
01:50:16.430 --> 01:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility and so I'm just curious
 
01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639 align:start position:0%
about um where in this it says that the
 
01:50:24.390 --> 01:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
parent has a responsibility to ensure
 
01:50:29.550 --> 01:50:29.560 align:start position:0%
that the um minor is uh not exposed to
 
01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:31.070 align:start position:0%
that the um minor is uh not exposed to
material

01:50:31.070 --> 01:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
material
 
01:50:34.950 --> 01:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh that is prohibited under this
 
01:50:40.669 --> 01:50:40.679 align:start position:0%
proposal okay so take a look at um page
 
01:50:44.669 --> 01:50:44.679 align:start position:0%
two yep starting at um let's start with
 
01:50:47.629 --> 01:50:47.639 align:start position:0%
22 the filters uh line 32 the filter is
 
01:50:51.069 --> 01:50:51.079 align:start position:0%
required so it has to contain a filter
 
01:50:54.669 --> 01:50:54.679 align:start position:0%
32 line 32 33 okay I see contains a
 
01:50:57.669 --> 01:50:57.679 align:start position:0%
filter asks the user to provide the age
 
01:51:00.030 --> 01:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
automatically enables it gives the
 
01:51:02.709 --> 01:51:02.719 align:start position:0%
password it establishes the password
 
01:51:05.229 --> 01:51:05.239 align:start position:0%
that's given to the parents he notifies
 
01:51:07.189 --> 01:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
the user of the device when the filter
 
01:51:10.229 --> 01:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
blocks something from a website and um
 
01:51:13.109 --> 01:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
it will allow a non-minor user that's
 
01:51:15.310 --> 01:51:15.320 align:start position:0%
the parent who has the password the
 
01:51:18.069 --> 01:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
option to activate or deactivate or
 
01:51:21.189 --> 01:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
reactivate the filter right below that
 
01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
is the parent or legal guardian may
 
01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
bring a civil action against anybody who
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
intentionally disables this or um the
 
01:51:32.229 --> 01:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
manufacturer if the filter which they
 
01:51:35.470 --> 01:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
thought existed did not exist um that's
 
01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
their right of action on this at the
 
01:51:42.270 --> 01:51:42.280 align:start position:0%
very end um it does at the line 32 on
 
01:51:45.390 --> 01:51:45.400 align:start position:0%
page three it talks about disabling an
 
01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
electronic device for the purpose of
 
01:51:49.390 --> 01:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
allowing access to obscene material and
 
01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:52.709 align:start position:0%
allowing access to obscene material and
minor

01:51:52.709 --> 01:51:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:57.470 --> 01:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
is a crime and if the minor does in fact
 
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
access obscene material it's a class B
 
01:52:04.109 --> 01:52:04.119 align:start position:0%
felony if just if can I just clarify
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
would that be okay M yes so um if a
 
01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
parent then in this uh the last section
 
01:52:15.870 --> 01:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
that you uh noted um were to
 
01:52:21.069 --> 01:52:21.079 align:start position:0%
disable the electronic device then um
 
01:52:23.830 --> 01:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
who would bring the the charge of
 
01:52:26.470 --> 01:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
criminal liability against the
 
01:52:30.669 --> 01:52:30.679 align:start position:0%
parent probably somebody who knows about
 
01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
it thank you very
 
01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
much representative Perez thank you
 
01:52:39.470 --> 01:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking I'm G I look at this a
 
01:52:41.910 --> 01:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
little bit like like when I turn on the
 
01:52:44.109 --> 01:52:44.119 align:start position:0%
TV and it says recommended not
 
01:52:45.709 --> 01:52:45.719 align:start position:0%
recommended for under
 
01:52:50.629 --> 01:52:50.639 align:start position:0%
14 I have a choice of either
 
01:52:53.550 --> 01:52:53.560 align:start position:0%
allowing my Min or not minor child my
 
01:52:55.550 --> 01:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
minor child to watch it or
 
01:52:58.510 --> 01:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
not um are you saying that this would be
 
01:53:03.669 --> 01:53:03.679 align:start position:0%
the same idea that if I if a um a parent
 
01:53:05.790 --> 01:53:05.800 align:start position:0%
had a minor child bought the device
 
01:53:08.830 --> 01:53:08.840 align:start position:0%
registered the device as the child's
 
01:53:14.629 --> 01:53:14.639 align:start position:0%
device okay and if the parent chose to
 
01:53:17.350 --> 01:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
disable that could the parent be
 
01:53:19.790 --> 01:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
prosecuted for that well I just want to
 
01:53:23.189 --> 01:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
remind you all that it is a crime to
 
01:53:26.830 --> 01:53:26.840 align:start position:0%
show that um obscenity defined by our
 
01:53:29.109 --> 01:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
rsas to a minor okay thank you that's
 
01:53:32.669 --> 01:53:32.679 align:start position:0%
what I needed to clarify so um it's pre
 
01:53:37.629 --> 01:53:37.639 align:start position:0%
preventing the parent as well as another
 
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
individual from allowing this type of
 
01:53:44.430 --> 01:53:44.440 align:start position:0%
thing to happen yes thank you thank you
 
01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:45.750 align:start position:0%
thing to happen yes thank you thank you
representative

01:53:45.750 --> 01:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:53:48.550 --> 01:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
trip thank you Mr chair uh thank you for
 
01:53:51.229 --> 01:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:53:55.390 --> 01:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
uh I I notice on uh in the section that
 
01:53:59.310 --> 01:53:59.320 align:start position:0%
says filter required is that uh all
 
01:54:02.790 --> 01:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
devices uh shall contain when activated
 
01:54:05.589 --> 01:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
in the state shall contain a
 
01:54:10.149 --> 01:54:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:15.149 --> 01:54:15.159 align:start position:0%
so the uh the issue here is uh any
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
device it being either a uh a tablet or
 
01:54:21.229 --> 01:54:21.239 align:start position:0%
a smartphone will have to have the
 
01:54:23.589 --> 01:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
software installed
 
01:54:26.910 --> 01:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
uh already has the filter installed just
 
01:54:34.830 --> 01:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:38.589 --> 01:54:38.599 align:start position:0%
filter did that answer your
 
01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
question thank
 
01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from somebody
 
01:54:44.950 --> 01:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
who hasn't asked a question
 
01:54:48.270 --> 01:54:48.280 align:start position:0%
already we need to move along here so um
 
01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:49.069 align:start position:0%
already we need to move along here so um
thank

01:54:49.069 --> 01:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:54:51.030 --> 01:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
you have you asked a question already
 
01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative sh
 
01:54:56.669 --> 01:54:56.679 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you thank you thank you
 
01:54:58.589 --> 01:54:58.599 align:start position:0%
yes so at this point I have a lot of
 
01:55:01.510 --> 01:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
cards on this and we are really behind
 
01:55:03.069 --> 01:55:03.079 align:start position:0%
on hearings today so we're going to
 
01:55:07.069 --> 01:55:07.079 align:start position:0%
limit testimony to 3 minutes strictly so
 
01:55:09.270 --> 01:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
tailor your testimony to 3 minutes if
 
01:55:11.109 --> 01:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
you have written testimony that will be
 
01:55:14.310 --> 01:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
helpful to turn in and uh I'm going to
 
01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:24.189 --> 01:55:24.199 align:start position:0%
thank you committee members for taking
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
my testimony my name is Michael Aaron
 
01:55:29.790 --> 01:55:29.800 align:start position:0%
I'm representing uh Sullivan County
 
01:55:32.750 --> 01:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
District 8 which is nine towns I won't
 
01:55:34.430 --> 01:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
go into the
 
01:55:36.910 --> 01:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
list I am going to tell you a little
 
01:55:42.189 --> 01:55:42.199 align:start position:0%
story to to illustrate why this bill is
 
01:55:45.149 --> 01:55:45.159 align:start position:0%
necessary I know a young woman who was
 
01:55:49.470 --> 01:55:49.480 align:start position:0%
about 12 years old and she wanted to buy
 
01:55:55.069 --> 01:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
some athletic wear and decided to go to
 
01:55:59.350 --> 01:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
the Dicks Sporting Goods website to
 
01:56:00.589 --> 01:56:00.599 align:start position:0%
check out
 
01:56:04.350 --> 01:56:04.360 align:start position:0%
prices you can see where this is
 
01:56:07.510 --> 01:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
going she did not know the website name
 
01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
and typed in something else and was very
 
01:56:14.069 --> 01:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
surprised and traumatized when the
 
01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
website that she did pull up came up uh
 
01:56:22.430 --> 01:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
so I believe that if uh filters like the
 
01:56:25.790 --> 01:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
the filters being requested in this bill
 
01:56:28.669 --> 01:56:28.679 align:start position:0%
were in place on her device she would
 
01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
not have been traumatized by going to a
 
01:56:34.109 --> 01:56:34.119 align:start position:0%
pornographic website by
 
01:56:37.069 --> 01:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
mistake uh that's really my whole story
 
01:56:39.669 --> 01:56:39.679 align:start position:0%
and I'll be happy to answer
 
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
01:56:46.470 --> 01:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
McFarland thank you representative uh M
 
01:56:50.350 --> 01:56:50.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I I was struggling to
 
01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
understand the intent of the the prime
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor and as you are one of the
 
01:56:57.750 --> 01:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors sir perhaps you could help
 
01:56:59.629 --> 01:56:59.639 align:start position:0%
explain that intent a little further in
 
01:56:59.639 --> 01:57:00.430 align:start position:0%
explain that intent a little further in
the

01:57:00.430 --> 01:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:57:06.229 --> 01:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
context of knowing that parents and
 
01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:10.199 align:start position:0%
Guardians have the opportunity to choose
 
01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
to provide or withhold access uh by the
 
01:57:16.790 --> 01:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
child by the minor to a device to choose
 
01:57:19.109 --> 01:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
a device that has parental controls
 
01:57:21.030 --> 01:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
available and Implement those parental
 
01:57:24.629 --> 01:57:24.639 align:start position:0%
controls um to place restrictions on the
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
the network and internet access that
 
01:57:29.270 --> 01:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
they connect that device to and so forth
 
01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
can you explain to me therefore what the
 
01:57:33.950 --> 01:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill is that is
 
01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
additional to the the choice Avail
 
01:57:38.589 --> 01:57:38.599 align:start position:0%
already available uh to those parents
 
01:57:40.430 --> 01:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
and Guardians thank you for that
 
01:57:44.470 --> 01:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
question I believe that uh the filtering
 
01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
or the parental controls are already on
 
01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
those devices they're just not turned on
 
01:57:53.709 --> 01:57:53.719 align:start position:0%
by default and the purpose of this bill
 
01:57:56.030 --> 01:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that that is turned on
 
01:57:59.669 --> 01:57:59.679 align:start position:0%
by default rather than off uh some of
 
01:58:02.790 --> 01:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
these uh parental controls uh especially
 
01:58:05.229 --> 01:58:05.239 align:start position:0%
on some newer devices are really
 
01:58:07.390 --> 01:58:07.400 align:start position:0%
difficult to navigate through the
 
01:58:10.470 --> 01:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
settings and so if it's turned on by
 
01:58:14.069 --> 01:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
default uh it'll be there and does not
 
01:58:17.589 --> 01:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
rely on the parents uh expertise or non-
 
01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
expertise about using the device uh to
 
01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:26.510 --> 01:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative rbo thank you
 
01:58:27.790 --> 01:58:27.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:29.229 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
question

01:58:29.229 --> 01:58:29.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:32.639 align:start position:0%
um I as a parent with kids who have
 
01:58:34.189 --> 01:58:34.199 align:start position:0%
trying to listen to music on devices and
 
01:58:35.830 --> 01:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
working with these filters myself I can
 
01:58:37.470 --> 01:58:37.480 align:start position:0%
understand the challenges of of getting
 
01:58:39.270 --> 01:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
them right um and we certainly had
 
01:58:41.229 --> 01:58:41.239 align:start position:0%
instances where um like a Broadway
 
01:58:42.470 --> 01:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
musical we wanted to listen to as a
 
01:58:44.350 --> 01:58:44.360 align:start position:0%
family had some swear words in it and so
 
01:58:46.629 --> 01:58:46.639 align:start position:0%
the filter blocked it from me played
 
01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
until we you know made decisions about
 
01:58:52.629 --> 01:58:52.639 align:start position:0%
what to do with the filters um the
 
01:58:55.270 --> 01:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
if I'm understanding correctly the
 
01:58:58.069 --> 01:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
automatic filter being proposed here are
 
01:59:00.149 --> 01:59:00.159 align:start position:0%
the same filters that right now would be
 
01:59:02.669 --> 01:59:02.679 align:start position:0%
the same as what exists or would they
 
01:59:02.679 --> 01:59:05.030 align:start position:0%
the same as what exists or would they
somehow

01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
01:59:07.950 --> 01:59:07.960 align:start position:0%
um change the way the the kind of
 
01:59:09.390 --> 01:59:09.400 align:start position:0%
filters you're able to have or how you
 
01:59:11.589 --> 01:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
negotiate the filters as a parent I
 
01:59:13.229 --> 01:59:13.239 align:start position:0%
don't believe that they would be any
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
different than what is on the phone now
 
01:59:19.950 --> 01:59:19.960 align:start position:0%
device not on a on a particular platform
 
01:59:22.510 --> 01:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
right smartphone
 
01:59:26.069 --> 01:59:26.079 align:start position:0%
laptop uh tablet whatever uh there are
 
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
settings for parental controls uh to to
 
01:59:32.430 --> 01:59:32.440 align:start position:0%
let you know what kind of websites you
 
01:59:35.430 --> 01:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
can filter out and uh they're just not
 
01:59:38.669 --> 01:59:38.679 align:start position:0%
turned on okay so it doesn't fix the pro
 
01:59:40.990 --> 01:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
the challenges of the filters themselves
 
01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
it just automatically sets that on
 
01:59:46.310 --> 01:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
correct thank you any other
 
01:59:49.109 --> 01:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank

am a co-sponsor on the bill I am here to
 
02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
express my strong support for HB 293 FN
 
02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
aimed at preventing minors from
 
02:04:15.870 --> 02:04:15.880 align:start position:0%
accessing obscene content on electric
 
02:04:18.790 --> 02:04:18.800 align:start position:0%
electronic devices with internet access
 
02:04:20.910 --> 02:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
this issue is one of great concern not
 
02:04:22.910 --> 02:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
only for the saf and well-being of our
 
02:04:25.149 --> 02:04:25.159 align:start position:0%
children but also for the healthy
 
02:04:27.950 --> 02:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
development of their minds and Futures
 
02:04:29.589 --> 02:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
as we all know the internet is an
 
02:04:31.669 --> 02:04:31.679 align:start position:0%
invaluable tool that has transformed how
 
02:04:34.069 --> 02:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
we learn communicate and interact
 
02:04:36.470 --> 02:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
however with this access comes a
 
02:04:39.069 --> 02:04:39.079 align:start position:0%
significant risk the easy availability
 
02:04:41.870 --> 02:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
of harmful and obscene material Studies
 
02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
have shown that exposure to such content
 
02:04:46.750 --> 02:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
at a young age can have detrimental
 
02:04:49.350 --> 02:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
effects on minors including distorted
 
02:04:51.910 --> 02:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
views on relationship sexuality and
 
02:04:54.149 --> 02:04:54.159 align:start position:0%
self-image as well as increased
 
02:04:56.669 --> 02:04:56.679 align:start position:0%
vulnerability to exploitation it could
 
02:05:00.030 --> 02:05:00.040 align:start position:0%
also leave to very unsafe situations
 
02:05:02.549 --> 02:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
some may argue that s such restrictions
 
02:05:04.950 --> 02:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
could infringe upon personal freedom or
 
02:05:07.950 --> 02:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
hinder the open nature of the internet
 
02:05:09.709 --> 02:05:09.719 align:start position:0%
however there is a clear difference
 
02:05:11.589 --> 02:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
between promoting open access to
 
02:05:14.149 --> 02:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
information and allowing unrestricted
 
02:05:16.510 --> 02:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
access to content that is harmful to
 
02:05:19.910 --> 02:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
minors it could even lead children into
 
02:05:23.830 --> 02:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
being sex trafficked and other dangerous
 
02:05:26.069 --> 02:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
situations parents and Guardians should
 
02:05:28.270 --> 02:05:28.280 align:start position:0%
be empowered to make informed decisions
 
02:05:30.589 --> 02:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
about their children's online activities
 
02:05:32.669 --> 02:05:32.679 align:start position:0%
and this bill supports their ability to
 
02:05:35.270 --> 02:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
do so it is not about limiting access to
 
02:05:37.470 --> 02:05:37.480 align:start position:0%
knowledge or entertainment but about
 
02:05:39.109 --> 02:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
ensuring that children are protected
 
02:05:41.709 --> 02:05:41.719 align:start position:0%
from content that could and will cause
 
02:05:44.669 --> 02:05:44.679 align:start position:0%
irreversible harm in closing I urge this
 
02:05:47.030 --> 02:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
body to pass this bill to protect the
 
02:05:49.149 --> 02:05:49.159 align:start position:0%
well-being of our children and to ensure
 
02:05:51.390 --> 02:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
that the internet remains a safe place
 
02:05:53.790 --> 02:05:53.800 align:start position:0%
for for Learning and growth we have a
 
02:05:56.229 --> 02:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
collective responsibility to safeguard
 
02:05:58.470 --> 02:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
the mental health of future generations
 
02:06:00.189 --> 02:06:00.199 align:start position:0%
and this bill is a critical part of that
 
02:06:02.830 --> 02:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
effort I won't be taking questions today
 
02:06:04.109 --> 02:06:04.119 align:start position:0%
because there are people in this room
 
02:06:06.709 --> 02:06:06.719 align:start position:0%
who are far far more knowledgeable about
 
02:06:09.069 --> 02:06:09.079 align:start position:0%
this than I am but I am in full support

very straightforward and easy to

implement the filtering technology that

we're asking to default to on for miners
 
02:06:55.589 --> 02:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
already exists on the devices this would
 
02:06:58.069 --> 02:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
relieve a huge burden that's currently
 
02:07:00.629 --> 02:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
placed on the shoulders of parents to

protect children from obscene content

02:08:24.189 --> 02:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
first let's get on the same page about
 
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
what porn really is today when I talk to
 
02:08:29.310 --> 02:08:29.320 align:start position:0%
adults I get the strong sense that they
 
02:08:32.510 --> 02:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
picture a hot bombshell in lingerie or a
 
02:08:35.069 --> 02:08:35.079 align:start position:0%
half- naked model on the beach that's
 
02:08:36.990 --> 02:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
not what I stumbled upon back in the
 
02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
fourth grade I saw simulated incest
 
02:08:44.109 --> 02:08:44.119 align:start position:0%

catalog that's what we're dealing with
 
02:09:00.910 --> 02:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
we are also seeing um individual stories
 
02:09:03.189 --> 02:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
you've heard already but large scale
 
02:09:04.950 --> 02:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
negative outcomes when children are
 
02:09:07.470 --> 02:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
exposed to porn children who VI view
 
02:09:09.709 --> 02:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
pornography are three times more likely
 
02:09:12.790 --> 02:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
to be sexually exploited and porn
 
02:09:15.750 --> 02:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
exposure is fueling massive increases in
 
02:09:18.549 --> 02:09:18.559 align:start position:0%
child-on-child sexual abuse as you've
 
02:09:21.669 --> 02:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
already heard in a study at the UK where
 
02:09:23.149 --> 02:09:23.159 align:start position:0%
they're very well
 
02:09:25.629 --> 02:09:25.639 align:start position:0%
Advanced interviews apologize that's
 
02:09:27.270 --> 02:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
your that's your time limit if you can
 
02:09:29.430 --> 02:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
wrap up with a sentence yep we feel that
 
02:09:31.350 --> 02:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
there's a huge Risk by not having these
 
02:09:34.629 --> 02:09:34.639 align:start position:0%
filterings on today any child could walk
 
02:09:36.510 --> 02:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
into a bookstore and that bookstore
 
02:09:38.270 --> 02:09:38.280 align:start position:0%
would make sure that that child is not
 
02:09:40.470 --> 02:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
exposed to pornography or obscene
 
02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
material yet why do we allow that to
 
02:09:45.189 --> 02:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
happen online we urge you to pass this
 
02:09:47.910 --> 02:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you representative Alexander
 
02:09:49.109 --> 02:09:49.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:09:51.549 --> 02:09:51.559 align:start position:0%
my question I guess your last statement
 
02:09:53.830 --> 02:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
confused me because this bill is
 
02:09:55.189 --> 02:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
directed to the
 
02:09:57.870 --> 02:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturers not the retailers right
 
02:10:00.030 --> 02:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
but you just gave me a situation of the
 
02:10:02.189 --> 02:10:02.199 align:start position:0%
retailers blocking the access to this
 
02:10:04.830 --> 02:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
obscenity I understand that this is a
 
02:10:07.109 --> 02:10:07.119 align:start position:0%
this is an issue and we should you know
 
02:10:08.510 --> 02:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
government has an interest in protecting
 
02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:10.790 align:start position:0%
government has an interest in protecting
miners

02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
miners
 
02:10:13.310 --> 02:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
but should we go after the magazine
 
02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:14.589 align:start position:0%
but should we go after the magazine
manufacturers

02:10:14.589 --> 02:10:14.599 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
too we don't need to go it it's it's not
 
02:10:19.629 --> 02:10:19.639 align:start position:0%
it's the concept behind the
 
02:10:22.870 --> 02:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
issue right now the the burden is 100%
 
02:10:25.030 --> 02:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
on the shoulders of the parent to
 
02:10:27.189 --> 02:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
protect the children many of the parents
 
02:10:29.629 --> 02:10:29.639 align:start position:0%
in our state are in foster homes they do
 
02:10:31.629 --> 02:10:31.639 align:start position:0%
not have an parent and even you heard
 
02:10:34.629 --> 02:10:34.639 align:start position:0%
the testimony very involved parent that
 
02:10:37.669 --> 02:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
was unable to um set all the appropriate
 
02:10:39.470 --> 02:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
filters and even know that that's going
 
02:10:42.270 --> 02:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
on new parents aren't even aware of the
 
02:10:45.470 --> 02:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
risks and so we would like to see our
 
02:10:49.149 --> 02:10:49.159 align:start position:0%
state take responsibility to help block
 
02:10:50.950 --> 02:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
this putting it on the manufacturers
 
02:10:52.990 --> 02:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
levels very easy to implement and it's
 
02:10:56.510 --> 02:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
an easy way to get that done so you know
 
02:10:58.549 --> 02:10:58.559 align:start position:0%
why do we allow this you know however it
 
02:11:00.229 --> 02:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
gets done they can't walk into a
 
02:11:01.790 --> 02:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
bookstore and get it so why should they
 
02:11:03.189 --> 02:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
be able to get
 
02:11:05.950 --> 02:11:05.960 align:start position:0%
online representative pz thank you
 
02:11:08.149 --> 02:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question um what's
 
02:11:10.830 --> 02:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
to stop my child from going into the
 
02:11:13.629 --> 02:11:13.639 align:start position:0%
library and using the library computer
 
02:11:18.510 --> 02:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
or will we be able to make sure that
 
02:11:22.109 --> 02:11:22.119 align:start position:0%
schools are using this same type of of
 
02:11:25.870 --> 02:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
uh filter in the you know the schools
 
02:11:28.270 --> 02:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
because I know right now many schools
 
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
are saying and I know this as a fact
 
02:11:32.790 --> 02:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
well we can't do that we can't do we
 
02:11:34.709 --> 02:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
have the question oh yes will we be able
 
02:11:37.629 --> 02:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
to implement this in schools and librar
 
02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
so children aren't AB thank you for the
 
02:11:41.870 --> 02:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
question um we don't believe this bill
 
02:11:44.750 --> 02:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
is going to solve every exposure issue
 
02:11:46.669 --> 02:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
however we do believe it would yes in
 
02:11:48.589 --> 02:11:48.599 align:start position:0%
schools when they get devices now if
 
02:11:50.149 --> 02:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
they're activated in the state of New
 
02:11:52.030 --> 02:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire these filters would be turned
 
02:11:56.109 --> 02:11:56.119 align:start position:0%
on for ages 17 and under yeah
 
02:11:56.119 --> 02:11:57.310 align:start position:0%
on for ages 17 and under yeah
representative

02:11:57.310 --> 02:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:12:00.950 --> 02:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you um could you um on page
 
02:12:06.310 --> 02:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
two Romans 6 material means any Printed
 
02:12:09.430 --> 02:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
Matter visual representation goes on and
 
02:12:12.350 --> 02:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
on and on uh including but not limited
 
02:12:16.229 --> 02:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
to books magazines films pamplets
 
02:12:16.239 --> 02:12:18.149 align:start position:0%
to books magazines films pamplets
records

02:12:18.149 --> 02:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
records
 
02:12:23.229 --> 02:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:27.910 --> 02:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
we would have a filter on Printed Matter
 
02:12:30.549 --> 02:12:30.559 align:start position:0%
P we would not be able to have a filter
 
02:12:32.270 --> 02:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
on Printed Matter yeah so I'm not
 
02:12:34.709 --> 02:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
entirely sure how this particular bullet
 
02:12:36.790 --> 02:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
point relates to the rest of the bill
 
02:12:39.629 --> 02:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
but what we're asking for here is on the
 
02:12:41.830 --> 02:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
internet device whatever they are able
 
02:12:43.950 --> 02:12:43.960 align:start position:0%
to find on here so it could be a picture
 
02:12:46.229 --> 02:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
a picture of printed M material
 
02:12:48.830 --> 02:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
potentially um I don't know enough about
 
02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
this but I can find out for you could be
 
02:12:52.830 --> 02:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
but I think that's a definition already
 
02:12:54.990 --> 02:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
in statute of material that's why it's
 
02:12:57.270 --> 02:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
it's worded that way it already exists
 
02:13:00.549 --> 02:13:00.559 align:start position:0%
that that definition so representative
 
02:13:03.709 --> 02:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
McFarland thank you Mr
 
02:13:07.149 --> 02:13:07.159 align:start position:0%
chairman if I understand you correctly
 
02:13:10.069 --> 02:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
um you are looking to place this burden
 
02:13:11.910 --> 02:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
on the manufacturers as representative
 
02:13:15.189 --> 02:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
Alexander outlined could I understand
 
02:13:17.870 --> 02:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
then given that those manufacturers
 
02:13:19.470 --> 02:13:19.480 align:start position:0%
would in order for this to to be
 
02:13:22.350 --> 02:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
effective require to support these
 
02:13:24.990 --> 02:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
filters and these these Technologies for
 
02:13:27.310 --> 02:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
the duration of the effective use of the
 
02:13:30.709 --> 02:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
device by the miners uh or by anyone
 
02:13:32.790 --> 02:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
could could you help me understand how
 
02:13:35.390 --> 02:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
long you contemplate that a manufacturer
 
02:13:37.709 --> 02:13:37.719 align:start position:0%
selling a a tablet or a smartphone in
 
02:13:39.430 --> 02:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
this state would require to support that
 
02:13:41.549 --> 02:13:41.559 align:start position:0%
device and would it be true that after
 
02:13:43.310 --> 02:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
that point that that device would
 
02:13:45.189 --> 02:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
require to be bried by the manufacturer
 
02:13:46.950 --> 02:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
so that it couldn't be further
 
02:13:50.549 --> 02:13:50.559 align:start position:0%
used um these device these filters are
 
02:13:52.229 --> 02:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
already on there so for example if you
 
02:13:55.310 --> 02:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
have an iPhone already if your child is
 
02:13:57.390 --> 02:13:57.400 align:start position:0%
12 years old or younger and you activate
 
02:13:59.310 --> 02:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
your device for that child those filters
 
02:14:02.350 --> 02:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
are turned on so what we're asking is a
 
02:14:06.149 --> 02:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
very simple matter of extending the age
 
02:14:08.589 --> 02:14:08.599 align:start position:0%
that that happens and if there's devices
 
02:14:10.629 --> 02:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
where that filtering has not been turned
 
02:14:14.109 --> 02:14:14.119 align:start position:0%
on by default that it would be turned on
 
02:14:16.830 --> 02:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
um we do believe that these devices we
 
02:14:18.470 --> 02:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
all know we get the updates right that
 
02:14:20.189 --> 02:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
come nightly or whatever whenever they
 
02:14:22.149 --> 02:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
come that they would be there for the
 
02:14:24.549 --> 02:14:24.559 align:start position:0%
life of that and then once the device is
 
02:14:26.870 --> 02:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
deactivated the manufacturer is no
 
02:14:30.390 --> 02:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
longer required to support those filters
 
02:14:31.910 --> 02:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
um for the new
 
02:14:35.030 --> 02:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
person thank you representative trip
 
02:14:37.629 --> 02:14:37.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh fairly simple
 
02:14:40.310 --> 02:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
question so these filters are provided
 
02:14:43.069 --> 02:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
at no cost on the cell phones and the
 
02:14:43.079 --> 02:14:45.870 align:start position:0%
at no cost on the cell phones and the
tablets

02:14:45.870 --> 02:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
tablets
 
02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
correct any other questions
 
02:14:51.549 --> 02:14:51.559 align:start position:0%
representative T just to clarify are we
 
02:14:53.629 --> 02:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
talking about what's called the safe
 
02:14:56.510 --> 02:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
search uh switch on on a browser is that
 
02:14:57.910 --> 02:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
what the filter technology that we're
 
02:14:59.950 --> 02:14:59.960 align:start position:0%
talking about is it consistant right
 
02:15:01.270 --> 02:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
there we actually have a technical
 
02:15:02.589 --> 02:15:02.599 align:start position:0%
expert who's going to be talking more
 
02:15:03.830 --> 02:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
about it but we're we're actually
 
02:15:05.990 --> 02:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
talking much larger than that there are
 
02:15:08.069 --> 02:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
these things called spiders that
 
02:15:10.589 --> 02:15:10.599 align:start position:0%
evaluate web content so when you do a
 
02:15:13.270 --> 02:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
user does a search it will evaluate all
 
02:15:16.069 --> 02:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
the material and the words to determine
 
02:15:18.870 --> 02:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
using AI is there obscene material
 
02:15:20.510 --> 02:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
coming across and that's what would be
 
02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:21.510 align:start position:0%
coming across and that's what would be
blocked

02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
blocked
 
02:15:23.390 --> 02:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
the user would then get an indicator
 
02:15:26.310 --> 02:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
that this is blocked content so the
 
02:15:28.510 --> 02:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
parent doesn't have to take the burden
 
02:15:30.669 --> 02:15:30.679 align:start position:0%
of turning it off everywhere that's what
 
02:15:34.229 --> 02:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
we're going for here thank you any other
 
02:15:36.709 --> 02:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you all
 
02:15:38.069 --> 02:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
right thank you so much I appreciate
 
02:15:51.510 --> 02:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:53.990 --> 02:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
chair Manion and Judiciary members thank
 
02:15:56.030 --> 02:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
you for allowing me to give a quick
 
02:15:59.030 --> 02:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
testimony today uh I am again Rick
 
02:16:01.510 --> 02:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
fabrio senior director of advocacy and
 
02:16:02.950 --> 02:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
public affairs for the business and
 
02:16:06.030 --> 02:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
industry Association uh Bia understands
 
02:16:09.589 --> 02:16:09.599 align:start position:0%
the importance of uh restricting miners
 
02:16:11.470 --> 02:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
access to obscene material such as
 
02:16:15.510 --> 02:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
pornography it's not uh unlike uh proper
 
02:16:17.950 --> 02:16:17.960 align:start position:0%
protocols to assure miners can't buy
 
02:16:21.510 --> 02:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
alcohol and tobacco uh but 293 is flawed
 
02:16:23.470 --> 02:16:23.480 align:start position:0%
on multiple FR fronts with the most
 
02:16:26.189 --> 02:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
important being that it exposes device
 
02:16:28.229 --> 02:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and operating system
 
02:16:31.030 --> 02:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to unfair unreasonable and
 
02:16:33.870 --> 02:16:33.880 align:start position:0%
misguided civil liability the best way
 
02:16:36.349 --> 02:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
to keep miners uh from accessing obscene
 
02:16:39.429 --> 02:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
material pral and guardian involvement
 
02:16:41.669 --> 02:16:41.679 align:start position:0%
in the use of read readily available
 
02:16:43.910 --> 02:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
content blockers for devices and
 
02:16:46.629 --> 02:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
operating systems uh internet browsers I
 
02:16:49.990 --> 02:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
mean um but 293 creates unworkable
 
02:16:52.709 --> 02:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
requirements uh devices and operating
 
02:16:54.750 --> 02:16:54.760 align:start position:0%
systems are not manufactured to meet
 
02:16:57.309 --> 02:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
individual state laws and the desired
 
02:16:59.509 --> 02:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
level of filtering is not
 
02:17:02.190 --> 02:17:02.200 align:start position:0%
technologically feasible part of that is
 
02:17:03.589 --> 02:17:03.599 align:start position:0%
because of the inclusion as we've
 
02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
discussed books magazines and extensive
 
02:17:10.070 --> 02:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
list um and while the language the
 
02:17:11.870 --> 02:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
closest it gets to pornography saying
 
02:17:14.870 --> 02:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
pornography is the line that depicts or
 
02:17:17.190 --> 02:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
describe sexual conduct in a manner so
 
02:17:20.349 --> 02:17:20.359 align:start position:0%
explicit as to be patently false however
 
02:17:22.469 --> 02:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
it includes other definitions that are
 
02:17:25.349 --> 02:17:25.359 align:start position:0%
subjective such as ludin or lascivious
 
02:17:27.070 --> 02:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
thoughts when applying contemporary
 
02:17:29.750 --> 02:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
standards if there's a clearness in
 
02:17:31.709 --> 02:17:31.719 align:start position:0%
there I've yet to find it and I don't I
 
02:17:33.950 --> 02:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
just don't see that and that's important
 
02:17:35.830 --> 02:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
given the inclusion of civil liability
 
02:17:38.549 --> 02:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
up to $100,000 and punitive damages in a
 
02:17:40.830 --> 02:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
private right of action uh the goal
 
02:17:43.549 --> 02:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
should be provide proper safeguards not
 
02:17:46.830 --> 02:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
to Pro uh prompt a slew of civil actions
 
02:17:49.110 --> 02:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
that could be very costly to
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of both the operating
 
02:17:53.389 --> 02:17:53.399 align:start position:0%
systems and devices I'm happy to take
 
02:17:53.399 --> 02:17:54.389 align:start position:0%
systems and devices I'm happy to take
any

02:17:54.389 --> 02:17:54.399 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:17:56.549 --> 02:17:56.559 align:start position:0%

representative

02:17:58.150 --> 02:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:18:01.950 --> 02:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
McFarland thank you Mr chairman um Mr
 
02:18:05.669 --> 02:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
frbo am I right in understanding that if
 
02:18:08.549 --> 02:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
I have a tablet such as my car or a
 
02:18:10.349 --> 02:18:10.359 align:start position:0%
smartphone such as my
 
02:18:13.429 --> 02:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
laptop and I was see to seek to
 
02:18:15.589 --> 02:18:15.599 align:start position:0%
reinstall the operating system on that
 
02:18:18.110 --> 02:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
or to uh install an open source
 
02:18:20.549 --> 02:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
operating system on that that under this
 
02:18:22.790 --> 02:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
bill I would be a
 
02:18:26.349 --> 02:18:26.359 align:start position:0%
felon there are felony charges if you
 
02:18:29.790 --> 02:18:29.800 align:start position:0%
deactivate a this filter for and then a
 
02:18:31.950 --> 02:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
minor uses it another problem with this
 
02:18:35.469 --> 02:18:35.479 align:start position:0%
bill is that devices um are manufactured
 
02:18:39.030 --> 02:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
packaged wrapped and sent uh if they
 
02:18:41.389 --> 02:18:41.399 align:start position:0%
went to the default filter that it's on
 
02:18:44.910 --> 02:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
for you know miners um that still would
 
02:18:47.070 --> 02:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
require the purchaser of the device to
 
02:18:50.790 --> 02:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
take it home and start it up and then if
 
02:18:52.669 --> 02:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
choose to deactivate they would have to
 
02:18:54.830 --> 02:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
show some type of age verification but I
 
02:18:57.309 --> 02:18:57.319 align:start position:0%
don't see language in here that explains
 
02:19:01.110 --> 02:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
how age would be verified thank you any
 
02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:02.070 align:start position:0%
how age would be verified thank you any
other

02:19:02.070 --> 02:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:19:05.270 --> 02:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
questions representative mayos thank you
 
02:19:06.950 --> 02:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
02:19:13.070 --> 02:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
question um page two line five the
 
02:19:16.870 --> 02:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
bill um includes an obscenity or it it's
 
02:19:18.230 --> 02:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
actually under the definition of
 
02:19:20.750 --> 02:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
material it says undeveloped photograph
 
02:19:23.870 --> 02:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
graphs molds printing plate printing
 
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
plates and the like shall be deemed
 
02:19:28.349 --> 02:19:28.359 align:start position:0%
obene material not withstanding that
 
02:19:30.629 --> 02:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
processing or other acts may be required
 
02:19:33.150 --> 02:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
to make the obscenity patent or to
 
02:19:35.469 --> 02:19:35.479 align:start position:0%
disseminate it and I'm wondering if you
 
02:19:38.070 --> 02:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
have any concerns about that language in
 
02:19:40.469 --> 02:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
the bill oh I'm broadly concerned about
 
02:19:42.709 --> 02:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
that whole uh definition of obene
 
02:19:45.549 --> 02:19:45.559 align:start position:0%
materials because of the inclusion of
 
02:19:48.549 --> 02:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
all the different mediums but also what
 
02:19:51.790 --> 02:19:51.800 align:start position:0%
are contemporary standards and while
 
02:19:53.630 --> 02:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
there may be another law that offers
 
02:19:55.349 --> 02:19:55.359 align:start position:0%
something like that it still in my
 
02:19:57.910 --> 02:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
opinion would expose uh would create
 
02:20:01.630 --> 02:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
liability um and it's it feels a lot
 
02:20:03.870 --> 02:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
like for a bill where there's been a lot
 
02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
of testimony about
 
02:20:09.150 --> 02:20:09.160 align:start position:0%
pornography there's not language in here
 
02:20:11.750 --> 02:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
strictly focused on pornography and
 
02:20:15.910 --> 02:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
obscene material can be highly subed to
 
02:20:17.710 --> 02:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
individuals thank you are there any
 
02:20:17.720 --> 02:20:18.670 align:start position:0%
individuals thank you are there any
other

02:20:20.990 --> 02:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank

Eastman hello chairman chairman and
 
02:20:36.670 --> 02:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
02:20:38.870 --> 02:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
Trisha Eastman I am an educated middle
 
02:20:41.790 --> 02:20:41.800 align:start position:0%
class professional mom to three boys I
 
02:20:43.630 --> 02:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
here today to provide a personal
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
testimony on why I'm in support of this
 
02:20:51.150 --> 02:20:51.160 align:start position:0%
bill in 2020 my sons were given um
 
02:20:53.950 --> 02:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
Chromebooks for school my middle son at
 
02:20:58.429 --> 02:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
the age of nine innocently was searching
 
02:21:01.990 --> 02:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
for things online and came across
 
02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:03.190 align:start position:0%
for things online and came across
obscene

02:21:03.190 --> 02:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
obscene
 
02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
material I put on filters on our
 
02:21:09.630 --> 02:21:09.640 align:start position:0%
internet providers Wi-Fi as well as took
 
02:21:11.910 --> 02:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
their computers and tried to put blocks
 
02:21:14.630 --> 02:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
on whatever I could part of the problem
 
02:21:18.750 --> 02:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
was not having a technical background
 
02:21:22.950 --> 02:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
and not growing up in computers as our
 
02:21:26.110 --> 02:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
kids are um it caused things to be
 
02:21:28.030 --> 02:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
blocked that they needed for school so I
 
02:21:30.150 --> 02:21:30.160 align:start position:0%
often had to remove those so that they
 
02:21:33.070 --> 02:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
could access school and in fact allowing
 
02:21:37.830 --> 02:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
him to have access to obscene
 
02:21:41.030 --> 02:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
material jump forward to
 
02:21:45.309 --> 02:21:45.319 align:start position:0%
2024 my now 14-year-old son is addicted
 
02:21:45.319 --> 02:21:46.870 align:start position:0%
2024 my now 14-year-old son is addicted
to

02:21:46.870 --> 02:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:21:51.190 --> 02:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
pornography we are a very um
 
02:21:53.950 --> 02:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
unusual family where we limit screen
 
02:21:57.469 --> 02:21:57.479 align:start position:0%
time we do not allow our kids on
 
02:22:00.670 --> 02:22:00.680 align:start position:0%
anything with Wi-Fi or Internet access
 
02:22:02.950 --> 02:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
um willy-nilly like it's limited and
 
02:22:05.389 --> 02:22:05.399 align:start position:0%
monitored we went as far as to lock up
 
02:22:08.230 --> 02:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
Electronics he found ways to get on and
 
02:22:11.590 --> 02:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
to access this things came to a head
 
02:22:14.630 --> 02:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
when I learned from my 12-year-old son
 
02:22:18.830 --> 02:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
that the 14-year-old had gone on a um
 
02:22:21.590 --> 02:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
chat live stream pornography site and
 
02:22:21.600 --> 02:22:22.590 align:start position:0%
chat live stream pornography site and
was

02:22:22.590 --> 02:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:22:24.349 --> 02:22:24.359 align:start position:0%
chatting with
 
02:22:28.190 --> 02:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
people this terrified me I was scared
 
02:22:30.990 --> 02:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
that he would be trafficked or meet up
 
02:22:33.510 --> 02:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
with someone not even to mention the
 
02:22:35.590 --> 02:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
long-term effects of this addiction to
 
02:22:37.429 --> 02:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
pornography in his personal
 
02:22:39.670 --> 02:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
relationships as an
 
02:22:42.030 --> 02:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
adult because I felt like I could no
 
02:22:43.590 --> 02:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
longer provide the level of care that
 
02:22:45.910 --> 02:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
was needed for him I chose to send him
 
02:22:48.270 --> 02:22:48.280 align:start position:0%
to a residential treatment center where
 
02:22:53.630 --> 02:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
he spent 45 days came home for about 45
 
02:22:57.750 --> 02:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
days got on another device actually at
 
02:22:59.790 --> 02:22:59.800 align:start position:0%
school which is supposed to have go
 
02:23:02.469 --> 02:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
guardian and found ways around and got
 
02:23:05.510 --> 02:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
on some more chat
 
02:23:09.389 --> 02:23:09.399 align:start position:0%
websites I then sent him back he is now
 
02:23:11.910 --> 02:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
home after being there for 40 days he
 
02:23:13.870 --> 02:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
attends an intensive outpatient program
 
02:23:17.950 --> 02:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
3 days a week the school has um limited
 
02:23:21.830 --> 02:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
his computer access a um
 
02:23:23.469 --> 02:23:23.479 align:start position:0%
assistant in the classroom has to
 
02:23:25.070 --> 02:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
monitor what he's
 
02:23:28.830 --> 02:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
using and I did all I could as a parent
 
02:23:31.349 --> 02:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
and I believe that this bill will help
 
02:23:33.269 --> 02:23:33.279 align:start position:0%
with some of that
 
02:23:35.830 --> 02:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
burden and hopefully will limit I
 
02:23:37.349 --> 02:23:37.359 align:start position:0%
apologize that's your time limit if you
 
02:23:38.950 --> 02:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
want to give you a sentence to two to
 
02:23:41.550 --> 02:23:41.560 align:start position:0%
wrap up yeah um I think this bill should
 
02:23:43.309 --> 02:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
be passed in order to help protect our
 
02:23:45.550 --> 02:23:45.560 align:start position:0%
children not only from the short-term
 
02:23:47.670 --> 02:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
effects of viewing obscene and
 
02:23:49.710 --> 02:23:49.720 align:start position:0%
pornographic material but the long-term
 
02:23:52.230 --> 02:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
effects that we know from studies exist
 
02:23:54.590 --> 02:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
H I'm happy to take any questions
 
02:23:54.600 --> 02:23:56.309 align:start position:0%
H I'm happy to take any questions
representative

02:23:56.309 --> 02:23:56.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:23:59.590 --> 02:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
McFarland thank you Mr chairman I think
 
02:24:02.309 --> 02:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
all of us parents can understand the
 
02:24:06.990 --> 02:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
concerns around uh both the the your
 
02:24:08.710 --> 02:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
your children having access to these
 
02:24:12.190 --> 02:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
kinds of materials as well as the ready
 
02:24:14.790 --> 02:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
availability of Chromebooks and other
 
02:24:16.950 --> 02:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
devices that are managed by others that
 
02:24:18.630 --> 02:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
are thrust upon your children in in the
 
02:24:20.590 --> 02:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
school systems
 
02:24:22.670 --> 02:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
however I just want to understand it
 
02:24:25.710 --> 02:24:25.720 align:start position:0%
seems that the bulk of your testimony is
 
02:24:28.389 --> 02:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
as to the ineffectiveness of some of the
 
02:24:30.190 --> 02:24:30.200 align:start position:0%
existing filtering mechanisms which are
 
02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
being advocated for in this bill am I
 
02:24:36.510 --> 02:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding as a parent knowing how
 
02:24:38.510 --> 02:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
to turn on which ones and which ones to
 
02:24:41.870 --> 02:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
turn off or what to wh list and what to
 
02:24:45.630 --> 02:24:45.640 align:start position:0%
Blacklist on a computer is is an issue
 
02:24:47.670 --> 02:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
my understanding of this bill is that
 
02:24:50.429 --> 02:24:50.439 align:start position:0%
this filter is turned on and there is a
 
02:24:53.070 --> 02:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
constant searching of the internet and
 
02:24:55.469 --> 02:24:55.479 align:start position:0%
what the latest issues are because it
 
02:24:55.479 --> 02:24:56.630 align:start position:0%
what the latest issues are because it
does

02:24:56.630 --> 02:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
does
 
02:24:59.510 --> 02:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
change thank you for your question
 
02:25:01.510 --> 02:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative trip did you have a
 
02:25:05.990 --> 02:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
question yes I do uh do you feel that
 
02:25:09.510 --> 02:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
this uh bill should apply to uh the
 
02:25:12.230 --> 02:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
computers that are found in the schools
 
02:25:14.830 --> 02:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
yes and I believe it does because if I'm
 
02:25:16.230 --> 02:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
understanding the bill correctly it says
 
02:25:18.590 --> 02:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
anyone who disables this filter for a
 
02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
minor will be charged
 
02:25:23.670 --> 02:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question any other
 
02:25:27.790 --> 02:25:27.800 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
02:25:38.590 --> 02:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:41.030 --> 02:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
hedger and MERS committee turn on your
 
02:25:43.950 --> 02:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
mic I apologize uh thank you Mr chairman
 
02:25:45.309 --> 02:25:45.319 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee my name is
 
02:25:47.230 --> 02:25:47.240 align:start position:0%
Patrick hedger I am the director of
 
02:25:48.910 --> 02:25:48.920 align:start position:0%
policy at net choice we are a trade
 
02:25:50.790 --> 02:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
Association that represents and
 
02:25:52.590 --> 02:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
advocates for free expression and free
 
02:25:54.950 --> 02:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
enterprise online uh in line with that
 
02:25:57.950 --> 02:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
mission we respectfully oppose HB 293
 
02:25:59.790 --> 02:25:59.800 align:start position:0%
while certainly well- intended net
 
02:26:01.429 --> 02:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
Choice opposes this bill primarily for
 
02:26:04.429 --> 02:26:04.439 align:start position:0%
two reasons first it is unconstitutional
 
02:26:05.830 --> 02:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
but if it were somehow enacted and
 
02:26:08.910 --> 02:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
enforced the law is bad policy um it
 
02:26:11.190 --> 02:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
would force all users to show ID to
 
02:26:13.070 --> 02:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
access common websites such as Google
 
02:26:15.630 --> 02:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
search without meaningfully inhibiting
 
02:26:19.030 --> 02:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
access to obscene material HB 293 would
 
02:26:21.269 --> 02:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
immediately face cons challenges similar
 
02:26:22.230 --> 02:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
to those that struck down the
 
02:26:25.030 --> 02:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
communications decency act in 1996 the
 
02:26:26.590 --> 02:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court's unanimous decision in
 
02:26:26.600 --> 02:26:28.030 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court's unanimous decision in
Reno

02:26:28.030 --> 02:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
Reno
 
02:26:31.710 --> 02:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
vacu uh in the unlikely case that HB 293
 
02:26:33.910 --> 02:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
survives scrutiny in the courts the risk
 
02:26:36.510 --> 02:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
of unlimited private lawsuits at $50,000
 
02:26:38.910 --> 02:26:38.920 align:start position:0%
each would force device manufacturers to
 
02:26:41.349 --> 02:26:41.359 align:start position:0%
restrict access to internet browsers and
 
02:26:45.070 --> 02:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
search burdening users of all ages uh
 
02:26:46.790 --> 02:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
meaning everyone in this chamber would
 
02:26:48.269 --> 02:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
essentially have to prove they were over
 
02:26:50.590 --> 02:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
18 to use common internet browser and
 
02:26:53.550 --> 02:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
search engines and I will add that in
 
02:26:56.550 --> 02:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
the comparisons to the Utah law are not
 
02:26:58.910 --> 02:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
perfect here because Utah's law no
 
02:27:00.469 --> 02:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
longer contains the private right of
 
02:27:03.910 --> 02:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
action um that uh would create these
 
02:27:05.510 --> 02:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
potential lawsuits these unlimited
 
02:27:07.710 --> 02:27:07.720 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and despite the severe
 
02:27:09.389 --> 02:27:09.399 align:start position:0%
restrictions device manufacturers be
 
02:27:10.950 --> 02:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
compelled to put in place the limited
 
02:27:12.910 --> 02:27:12.920 align:start position:0%
scope of the fil required filter would
 
02:27:14.550 --> 02:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
not meaningfully inhibit the ability of
 
02:27:16.750 --> 02:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
adolescence to access obscene content
 
02:27:18.750 --> 02:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
filter only applies to internet browsers
 
02:27:20.230 --> 02:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
owned and controlled by the manual
 
02:27:22.190 --> 02:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
ufacturer this does nothing to stop
 
02:27:24.150 --> 02:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
obscene material through browsers apps
 
02:27:25.990 --> 02:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
and search engines on the device that
 
02:27:27.710 --> 02:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
are not affiliated with the device
 
02:27:30.389 --> 02:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
manufacturer so for example users of
 
02:27:33.269 --> 02:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
Safari on iPhone or Chrome on Android
 
02:27:35.110 --> 02:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
would be burdened with showing ID to
 
02:27:37.710 --> 02:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
access the web but adolescent ducko
 
02:27:40.230 --> 02:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
users for example would still be access
 
02:27:42.830 --> 02:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
able to access obscene material instead
 
02:27:44.830 --> 02:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
of this legislation New Hampshire should
 
02:27:46.630 --> 02:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
consider more targeted Solutions like
 
02:27:49.150 --> 02:27:49.160 align:start position:0%
digital literacy education in schools or
 
02:27:50.910 --> 02:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
better promotion of existing parental
 
02:27:53.309 --> 02:27:53.319 align:start position:0%
control resources these approaches would
 
02:27:55.429 --> 02:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
support families while preserving both
 
02:27:56.870 --> 02:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights and Market

combine our times together like four
 
02:28:54.389 --> 02:28:54.399 align:start position:0%

bill last minute so we right there is

mother of three sons in the last six
 
02:29:37.469 --> 02:29:37.479 align:start position:0%
years I have been focusing primarily on
 
02:29:40.190 --> 02:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
the intersection of sex trafficking and
 
02:29:43.950 --> 02:29:43.960 align:start position:0%
pornography AKA obscenity as well as how
 
02:29:46.910 --> 02:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
online um obscenity affects children as
 
02:29:50.510 --> 02:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
a result of this I have had um countless
 
02:29:53.469 --> 02:29:53.479 align:start position:0%
other New Hampshire parents grandparents
 
02:29:54.590 --> 02:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
as kind of like what everyone else is
 
02:29:56.349 --> 02:29:56.359 align:start position:0%
saying come to me with heartbreaking
 
02:30:00.230 --> 02:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
stories of how obscenity has um harmed
 
02:30:02.269 --> 02:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
their children
 
02:30:04.750 --> 02:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not going to get into as much
 
02:30:06.469 --> 02:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
of mine because Jason is the technical
 
02:30:08.630 --> 02:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
one so I'm going to let him go from here
 
02:30:11.750 --> 02:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
but one thing I have continually do hear
 
02:30:15.150 --> 02:30:15.160 align:start position:0%
from the parents um that I work with
 
02:30:16.910 --> 02:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
that come to me with stories about their
 
02:30:19.550 --> 02:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
children is they say this what is in
 
02:30:21.309 --> 02:30:21.319 align:start position:0%
place is not enough they they cannot
 
02:30:23.870 --> 02:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
keep up with the filters they don't know
 
02:30:25.870 --> 02:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
how to put things in place and even
 
02:30:27.429 --> 02:30:27.439 align:start position:0%
myself I should be an expert on this and
 
02:30:30.190 --> 02:30:30.200 align:start position:0%
I can barely figure them out so on that
 
02:30:32.630 --> 02:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
I hand it over to
 
02:30:35.269 --> 02:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
Jason uh thank you for having me here uh
 
02:30:37.349 --> 02:30:37.359 align:start position:0%
committee members uh I wanted to
 
02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
introduce myself I'm Jason serson I'm a
 
02:30:41.710 --> 02:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
resident of dun Barton I have six
 
02:30:44.269 --> 02:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
children I published papers and patents
 
02:30:46.110 --> 02:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
and cyber security I managed $100
 
02:30:47.870 --> 02:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
million in research programs for the
 
02:30:50.030 --> 02:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense at DARPA I've also
 
02:30:51.990 --> 02:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
founded an AI and a cyber security firm
 
02:30:53.389 --> 02:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire employing dozens
 
02:30:56.469 --> 02:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
of Engineers I also testified as an
 
02:30:57.950 --> 02:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
expert witness for the bill that passed
 
02:31:01.150 --> 02:31:01.160 align:start position:0%
in Utah uh back in 2021 and they passed
 
02:31:03.190 --> 02:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
a unanimous version in
 
02:31:05.710 --> 02:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
2024 I'm here to testify that this bill
 
02:31:07.230 --> 02:31:07.240 align:start position:0%
does not represent a technical or
 
02:31:09.230 --> 02:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
unreasonable hardship for the
 
02:31:10.790 --> 02:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
multi-billion I think now trillion
 
02:31:12.910 --> 02:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
dollar companies involved like Amazon
 
02:31:17.710 --> 02:31:17.720 align:start position:0%
Google and um uh Apple uh they already
 
02:31:20.150 --> 02:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
have these device filters uh so uh I
 
02:31:21.990 --> 02:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
believe representative McFarland made a
 
02:31:24.550 --> 02:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
point about cars this doesn't apply to
 
02:31:27.190 --> 02:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
cars it's specifically to mobile phones
 
02:31:30.030 --> 02:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
and tablets so we're not trying to ban
 
02:31:31.910 --> 02:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh pornography with the internet we're
 
02:31:34.230 --> 02:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
not trying to prevent all forms of
 
02:31:36.990 --> 02:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
lacious material from being access all
 
02:31:39.150 --> 02:31:39.160 align:start position:0%
this bill is doing is saying let's not
 
02:31:41.630 --> 02:31:41.640 align:start position:0%
have unrestricted access to the internet
 
02:31:44.950 --> 02:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
on by default for children most people
 
02:31:46.550 --> 02:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh you can talk to on the street or
 
02:31:48.349 --> 02:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
probably on the committee would agree
 
02:31:50.230 --> 02:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
you would not want unrestricted access
 
02:31:52.990 --> 02:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
to the internet on by default this is
 
02:31:54.510 --> 02:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
not saying parents are not responsible
 
02:31:57.349 --> 02:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
for parenting it is saying that the 7 to
 
02:31:59.710 --> 02:31:59.720 align:start position:0%
11 Step technical process currently
 
02:32:02.349 --> 02:32:02.359 align:start position:0%
required by parents who often don't have
 
02:32:04.070 --> 02:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh master's degrees in electric in
 
02:32:06.190 --> 02:32:06.200 align:start position:0%
electrical engineering like I do may
 
02:32:08.070 --> 02:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
have difficulty turning that on so
 
02:32:09.550 --> 02:32:09.560 align:start position:0%
instead of forcing them to figure out
 
02:32:11.389 --> 02:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
the 11 step process or even knowing such
 
02:32:13.870 --> 02:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
a process exists and how to navigate
 
02:32:16.469 --> 02:32:16.479 align:start position:0%
that that the device manufacturer who
 
02:32:18.230 --> 02:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
already knows the age of the user
 
02:32:20.030 --> 02:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
already has a filter on the device
 
02:32:22.070 --> 02:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
simply turns on that filter I didn't
 
02:32:23.190 --> 02:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
even know that they have it on by
 
02:32:25.790 --> 02:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
default for 12y olds uh the goal is to
 
02:32:28.950 --> 02:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
extend that up to still
 
02:32:31.030 --> 02:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
teenagers uh so a couple of other
 
02:32:33.030 --> 02:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
comments I wanted to make uh addressing
 
02:32:36.590 --> 02:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
earlier points um the crime uh that was
 
02:32:38.429 --> 02:32:38.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier is only if someone
 
02:32:41.510 --> 02:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
intentionally disables a filter to then
 
02:32:43.349 --> 02:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
specifically to enable a minor to view
 
02:32:44.990 --> 02:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
pornography not if it was just turned
 
02:32:47.469 --> 02:32:47.479 align:start position:0%
off and it was accidentally viewed uh
 
02:32:49.550 --> 02:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
the criminal component of the bill is if
 
02:32:51.190 --> 02:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
someone is intentionally doing that to
 
02:32:53.510 --> 02:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
bypass the filter and then a minor
 
02:32:56.110 --> 02:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
actually does view pornography from that
 
02:32:58.349 --> 02:32:58.359 align:start position:0%
device uh the other comment I want to
 
02:33:00.590 --> 02:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
make about the awkward definition of
 
02:33:02.469 --> 02:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
material and obscene material comes from
 
02:33:04.429 --> 02:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
historical case law definitions the
 
02:33:06.150 --> 02:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
important point of this bill is again
 
02:33:08.389 --> 02:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
we're not uh addressing what is
 
02:33:10.190 --> 02:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
pornography this has been litigated to
 
02:33:11.990 --> 02:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court the goal is to just
 
02:33:14.230 --> 02:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
turn on the default filters that already
 
02:33:16.030 --> 02:33:16.040 align:start position:0%
exists we're not getting into there's a
 
02:33:17.429 --> 02:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
whole definition what is pornography
 
02:33:19.870 --> 02:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
what is a filter it's only there to help
 
02:33:21.710 --> 02:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
explain why the filter is there what the
 
02:33:23.550 --> 02:33:23.560 align:start position:0%
filter is
 
02:33:27.230 --> 02:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
doing uh so final comment uh we we heard
 
02:33:29.790 --> 02:33:29.800 align:start position:0%
from the lobbying firm about why it's
 
02:33:31.950 --> 02:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional uh the Myriad of
 
02:33:34.309 --> 02:33:34.319 align:start position:0%
concerns of his testimony uh would
 
02:33:37.870 --> 02:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
require an entire uh document to address
 
02:33:39.910 --> 02:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh things like constitutionality are are
 
02:33:41.630 --> 02:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
crazy this is not saying you can't
 
02:33:43.429 --> 02:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
access the internet it's just saying for
 
02:33:45.830 --> 02:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
children the filter that already exists
 
02:33:47.950 --> 02:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
and is turned on and has no uh freedom
 
02:33:49.910 --> 02:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
of speech issues should be turned on
 
02:33:52.510 --> 02:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
instead of left off uh so there's
 
02:33:54.230 --> 02:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
there's not an issue there things like
 
02:33:56.790 --> 02:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
Duck Duck Go he mentioned uh would work
 
02:33:59.510 --> 02:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's actually not true either uh there
 
02:34:02.309 --> 02:34:02.319 align:start position:0%
are devices uh like Apple's filtering
 
02:34:05.030 --> 02:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
acquire applies not just your time so if
 
02:34:06.389 --> 02:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
you could just wrap up with a sentence
 
02:34:08.990 --> 02:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
or two yep but to all devices on there
 
02:34:11.230 --> 02:34:11.240 align:start position:0%
so yeah I just want to say if there are
 
02:34:13.269 --> 02:34:13.279 align:start position:0%
any questions uh happy to speak now but
 
02:34:15.389 --> 02:34:15.399 align:start position:0%
also afterward uh for the committee I
 
02:34:17.790 --> 02:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
live not far from here and happy to uh
 
02:34:20.070 --> 02:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
help however I can around the bill
 
02:34:22.990 --> 02:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
representative Perez thanks for taking
 
02:34:25.309 --> 02:34:25.319 align:start position:0%
um I know multiple people have gone to
 
02:34:27.230 --> 02:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
multiple different school districts and
 
02:34:31.030 --> 02:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
said hey my my 10-year-old 12y old
 
02:34:33.269 --> 02:34:33.279 align:start position:0%
15-year-old are able to access anything
 
02:34:35.389 --> 02:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
they want on the Chromebooks and they
 
02:34:37.269 --> 02:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
the repeated answer that they're getting
 
02:34:41.349 --> 02:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
back is well we can't we can't do
 
02:34:44.550 --> 02:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
anything in your expertise is that true
 
02:34:46.950 --> 02:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
can they really do something yeah so
 
02:34:48.710 --> 02:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
that's a great question so I actually
 
02:34:50.269 --> 02:34:50.279 align:start position:0%
work with the national on sexual
 
02:34:51.510 --> 02:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
exploitation who has mentioned here
 
02:34:53.910 --> 02:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
earlier uh as a board member uh because
 
02:34:55.510 --> 02:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
my wife and I care about this topic so
 
02:34:57.950 --> 02:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
deeply uh niosi has been lobbying and
 
02:34:59.469 --> 02:34:59.479 align:start position:0%
has a dirty dozen list where they've
 
02:35:02.550 --> 02:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
named Google among other companies as
 
02:35:04.469 --> 02:35:04.479 align:start position:0%
facilitating sexual exploitation because
 
02:35:06.710 --> 02:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
of their refusal historically to turn on
 
02:35:08.750 --> 02:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
filtering by default two Chromebooks
 
02:35:11.110 --> 02:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
sold to schools uh my understanding is
 
02:35:13.389 --> 02:35:13.399 align:start position:0%
that that changed and now Chromebooks by
 
02:35:16.349 --> 02:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
default are turning on filtering uh as
 
02:35:18.190 --> 02:35:18.200 align:start position:0%
was mentioned earlier safe search I
 
02:35:20.070 --> 02:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
believe representative Turner asked is
 
02:35:22.150 --> 02:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
this the same as safe search it's not
 
02:35:23.750 --> 02:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
the same as safe search at the device
 
02:35:25.790 --> 02:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
level you can use uh the operating
 
02:35:28.469 --> 02:35:28.479 align:start position:0%
system to filter content safe search is
 
02:35:31.510 --> 02:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
specific to Google or or or a search
 
02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
engine and it's saying filter at the
 
02:35:35.030 --> 02:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
search engine level this is saying at
 
02:35:37.870 --> 02:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
the device level Apple's device level
 
02:35:40.510 --> 02:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
also can mandate safe search on the
 
02:35:42.870 --> 02:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
browser so it does both uh if we do it
 
02:35:45.150 --> 02:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
at the device level here so yes they can
 
02:35:47.950 --> 02:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
be secured uh some schools turn off the
 
02:35:50.110 --> 02:35:50.120 align:start position:0%
filtering because they or they don't
 
02:35:52.110 --> 02:35:52.120 align:start position:0%
have it on by default historically uh
 
02:35:53.630 --> 02:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
but there is a movement in a good
 
02:35:54.950 --> 02:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
direction Google is starting to
 
02:35:56.870 --> 02:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
recognize these concerns and and my
 
02:35:57.870 --> 02:35:57.880 align:start position:0%
understanding is that they have started
 
02:36:00.790 --> 02:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
to sell Chromebooks with filtering on by
 
02:36:03.190 --> 02:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
default okay we haven't we don't have
 
02:36:04.990 --> 02:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
time for that okay I mentioned that
 
02:36:07.070 --> 02:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
earlier representative
 
02:36:09.510 --> 02:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
tur yeah yeah thanks and and thank you
 
02:36:11.670 --> 02:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
for um taking the question actually your
 
02:36:13.469 --> 02:36:13.479 align:start position:0%
your last statement was a great segue to
 
02:36:15.870 --> 02:36:15.880 align:start position:0%
my question which is we we heard earlier
 
02:36:18.190 --> 02:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
that this is not safe search uh that
 
02:36:20.110 --> 02:36:20.120 align:start position:0%
this is something more something that
 
02:36:23.790 --> 02:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
involves AI um can you say a few words
 
02:36:26.950 --> 02:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
about what we would be asking parents to
 
02:36:30.830 --> 02:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
share with an AI um engine um in order
 
02:36:32.710 --> 02:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
to utilize these functions regarding
 
02:36:35.230 --> 02:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
their children's search and where would
 
02:36:37.070 --> 02:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
that processing take
 
02:36:39.790 --> 02:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
place great question uh this doesn't
 
02:36:41.190 --> 02:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
have to do with parents sharing any
 
02:36:43.830 --> 02:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
extra information or any AI or any data
 
02:36:46.349 --> 02:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
mining it's purely when the device is
 
02:36:47.950 --> 02:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
activated it asks for the age of the
 
02:36:47.960 --> 02:36:49.630 align:start position:0%
activated it asks for the age of the
user

02:36:49.630 --> 02:36:49.640 align:start position:0%
user
 
02:36:51.309 --> 02:36:51.319 align:start position:0%
ready that information is they'll last
 
02:36:53.230 --> 02:36:53.240 align:start position:0%
for birthday things like that it's just
 
02:36:55.670 --> 02:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
saying if the age is a minor then turn
 
02:36:57.110 --> 02:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
on the filtering that's already on the
 
02:36:58.870 --> 02:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
device just turn that on so there's not
 
02:37:00.510 --> 02:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
a data mining component there's not AI
 
02:37:02.830 --> 02:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
doing things you're correct there is AI
 
02:37:05.070 --> 02:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
on some of the devices for identifying
 
02:37:07.030 --> 02:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
what is pornographic or not but that's
 
02:37:08.670 --> 02:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
separate the device manufacturer already
 
02:37:10.590 --> 02:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
has that they use that to analyze
 
02:37:12.269 --> 02:37:12.279 align:start position:0%
content and make decisions about whether
 
02:37:15.190 --> 02:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
to filter or not uh this bill is purely
 
02:37:16.990 --> 02:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
saying do you turn on the existing
 
02:37:19.750 --> 02:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
filter technology that's already there
 
02:37:21.550 --> 02:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
so it's an onoff switch and saying do
 
02:37:24.309 --> 02:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
you turn on the filter that's there by
 
02:37:26.790 --> 02:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
default representative
 
02:37:29.510 --> 02:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
McFarlin thank you Mr chairman and and
 
02:37:34.030 --> 02:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony Mr cyers uh
 
02:37:36.750 --> 02:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
I my question for you and I just want to
 
02:37:39.070 --> 02:37:39.080 align:start position:0%
clarify some comments you made you you
 
02:37:41.269 --> 02:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
you indicated that uh you've read this
 
02:37:45.230 --> 02:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
bill carefully um and where it describes
 
02:37:48.349 --> 02:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
tablet as a mobile device equipped with
 
02:37:49.910 --> 02:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
a mobile operating system system a
 
02:37:52.309 --> 02:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
touchscreen display a rechargeable
 
02:37:53.750 --> 02:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
battery and the ability to support
 
02:37:55.990 --> 02:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
access to a cellular network and where
 
02:37:58.590 --> 02:37:58.600 align:start position:0%
it defines smartphone to mean an
 
02:38:00.550 --> 02:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
electronic device that combines a cell
 
02:38:03.349 --> 02:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
phone with a handheld computer typically
 
02:38:04.710 --> 02:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
offering internet access through a
 
02:38:06.870 --> 02:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
browser or search engine data storage
 
02:38:09.030 --> 02:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
text and email capabilities would you
 
02:38:12.590 --> 02:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
agree that this bill would in fact not
 
02:38:15.590 --> 02:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
cover Chromebooks in schools as one
 
02:38:20.030 --> 02:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
example and would in fact cover uh
 
02:38:23.030 --> 02:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
vehicles that meet the criteria in the
 
02:38:24.550 --> 02:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
02:38:27.110 --> 02:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
tablet it's a great question uh I would
 
02:38:28.910 --> 02:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
agree it was not apply to Chromebooks as
 
02:38:30.710 --> 02:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
Chromebooks would qualify as a laptop
 
02:38:32.349 --> 02:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
computer and this does not apply to
 
02:38:36.070 --> 02:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
laptop computers uh I don't think in my
 
02:38:38.550 --> 02:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
technical uh interpretation that a
 
02:38:40.230 --> 02:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
mobile device with a mobile operating
 
02:38:43.309 --> 02:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
system would be uh confused with a car
 
02:38:44.910 --> 02:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
um but I do understand that argument
 
02:38:46.230 --> 02:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
because some people do actually take
 
02:38:48.389 --> 02:38:48.399 align:start position:0%
tablets and like inject them into the C
 
02:38:51.030 --> 02:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
dashboard of an autom motive so I could
 
02:38:52.590 --> 02:38:52.600 align:start position:0%
see how one would interpret it that way
 
02:38:54.670 --> 02:38:54.680 align:start position:0%
and if it was me I might recommend
 
02:38:56.790 --> 02:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
modifying some of the language there to
 
02:38:59.030 --> 02:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
remove that ambiguity but I I do think
 
02:39:01.150 --> 02:39:01.160 align:start position:0%
most interpretations of this if someone
 
02:39:02.950 --> 02:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
says tablet they don't think you're Ford
 
02:39:05.070 --> 02:39:05.080 align:start position:0%
Explorer um but I do understand why
 
02:39:06.750 --> 02:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
someone might have that concern thank
 
02:39:09.990 --> 02:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
you representative mayos thank you Mr
 
02:39:12.110 --> 02:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you Mr serson for taking
 
02:39:14.349 --> 02:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
my question I'm wondering if you would
 
02:39:17.630 --> 02:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
agree that the manufacturing implicates
 
02:39:20.990 --> 02:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce and if that's true
 
02:39:23.550 --> 02:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
whether this would be better H um
 
02:39:25.910 --> 02:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
handled at the federal level rather than
 
02:39:28.429 --> 02:39:28.439 align:start position:0%
at the state level thank you yeah thank
 
02:39:29.710 --> 02:39:29.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question it's a great
 
02:39:31.950 --> 02:39:31.960 align:start position:0%
question uh there are many things that
 
02:39:33.950 --> 02:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
are done uh at the interstate level I
 
02:39:35.429 --> 02:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
think most of the products we import
 
02:39:37.230 --> 02:39:37.240 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire come from out of
 
02:39:40.790 --> 02:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
state um that does not mean uh we
 
02:39:43.670 --> 02:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
neglect our uh responsibility to
 
02:39:46.349 --> 02:39:46.359 align:start position:0%
legislate uh safety devices I think
 
02:39:48.309 --> 02:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
California has made a living in in
 
02:39:50.030 --> 02:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
telling the world's many ufacturers how
 
02:39:52.469 --> 02:39:52.479 align:start position:0%
they need to manufacture things uh in
 
02:39:53.990 --> 02:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
this case we already have the state of
 
02:39:57.110 --> 02:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
Utah doing this and I think n's strategy
 
02:39:59.830 --> 02:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
for this legislation is to have it pass
 
02:40:01.389 --> 02:40:01.399 align:start position:0%
at the state level show that there's a
 
02:40:03.870 --> 02:40:03.880 align:start position:0%
movement and support across uh the
 
02:40:06.349 --> 02:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
Republic and and demonstrate that uh
 
02:40:07.950 --> 02:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
while moving towards eventual Federal
 
02:40:09.790 --> 02:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
legislation uh because I think this is a
 
02:40:11.950 --> 02:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
common sense bill that most people again
 
02:40:12.910 --> 02:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
if you talk to people on the street
 
02:40:14.230 --> 02:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
they're shocked that this is not already
 
02:40:17.309 --> 02:40:17.319 align:start position:0%
a thing or why that's an issue you any
 
02:40:19.750 --> 02:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
other questions of this Witness
 
02:40:22.070 --> 02:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank
 
02:40:42.429 --> 02:40:42.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:44.269 --> 02:40:44.279 align:start position:0%
Bono thank you chair and committee
 
02:40:46.469 --> 02:40:46.479 align:start position:0%
members for the opportunity to testify
 
02:40:48.150 --> 02:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
my name is ju Lono I'm speaking on
 
02:40:49.630 --> 02:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
behalf of the taxpayers protection
 
02:40:52.950 --> 02:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
Alliance or TPA a nonprofit nonpartisan
 
02:40:54.910 --> 02:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayer advocacy consumer watch
 
02:40:57.790 --> 02:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
organization respectfully TPA opposes
 
02:41:01.190 --> 02:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
this bill devis filter bills or like HB
 
02:41:03.710 --> 02:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
293 is well intentioned for sure but
 
02:41:05.910 --> 02:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
they have glaring constitutional issues
 
02:41:07.790 --> 02:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
preventing miners from accessing obscene
 
02:41:10.389 --> 02:41:10.399 align:start position:0%
content is a Lal goal but as been has
 
02:41:12.389 --> 02:41:12.399 align:start position:0%
been said before it's precisely the
 
02:41:14.150 --> 02:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
creation of this obscene content
 
02:41:16.030 --> 02:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
category which ultimately become the
 
02:41:18.510 --> 02:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
Bill's shortfall by creating a category
 
02:41:20.389 --> 02:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
of content that is considered obscene
 
02:41:21.830 --> 02:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
which platforms are now going to be
 
02:41:23.870 --> 02:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
required to block off for minors the
 
02:41:25.550 --> 02:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
government will then become the
 
02:41:27.030 --> 02:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
arbitrate of what speech is considered
 
02:41:29.469 --> 02:41:29.479 align:start position:0%
obscene or not designating a government
 
02:41:30.910 --> 02:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
with the task of determining what type
 
02:41:33.349 --> 02:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
of speech and by quoting the bill lack
 
02:41:35.790 --> 02:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
serious literary artistic political or
 
02:41:38.710 --> 02:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
scientific value as theine of the bill
 
02:41:40.670 --> 02:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
will present a clear cut of front of the
 
02:41:42.950 --> 02:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
the First Amendment these constitutional
 
02:41:44.510 --> 02:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
issues will inevitably get the state of
 
02:41:46.910 --> 02:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire involving costly lawsuits
 
02:41:48.429 --> 02:41:48.439 align:start position:0%
to defend the constitutionality of the
 
02:41:50.309 --> 02:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
bill with taxpayers are going to
 
02:41:52.590 --> 02:41:52.600 align:start position:0%
ultimately F foot in the bill existing
 
02:41:54.710 --> 02:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
precedents such as renew renew versus
 
02:41:56.870 --> 02:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
ACLU or Brown versus the entertainment
 
02:41:59.110 --> 02:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
Merchants associating and the plethora
 
02:42:00.910 --> 02:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
of state level rulings indicate that
 
02:42:02.830 --> 02:42:02.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are going to be paying for a
 
02:42:05.990 --> 02:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
losing case children Educators and
 
02:42:07.630 --> 02:42:07.640 align:start position:0%
parents already have a vast array of
 
02:42:09.950 --> 02:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
parental control tools at the disposal
 
02:42:12.590 --> 02:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
that prevent children from accessing
 
02:42:14.910 --> 02:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
inappropriate content these controls can
 
02:42:16.510 --> 02:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
not only be found in the devices
 
02:42:18.469 --> 02:42:18.479 align:start position:0%
themselves but also on the online
 
02:42:21.230 --> 02:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
platforms or with their internet service
 
02:42:23.550 --> 02:42:23.560 align:start position:0%
providers legisl legislative efforts
 
02:42:25.269 --> 02:42:25.279 align:start position:0%
should be focusing on helping parents
 
02:42:27.469 --> 02:42:27.479 align:start position:0%
and Guardians be aware of these tools
 
02:42:29.030 --> 02:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
and see how they can effectively use
 
02:42:32.150 --> 02:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
them as a taxpayer advocacy organization
 
02:42:33.750 --> 02:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
in the name of taxpayers and fiscal
 
02:42:36.150 --> 02:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility in New Hampshire TP TPA
 
02:42:37.870 --> 02:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
encourages to reject this Bill thank you
 
02:42:40.670 --> 02:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
so much thank you any questions of this
 
02:42:42.910 --> 02:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
witness representative
 
02:42:45.510 --> 02:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
McFarland thank you Mr chairman and uh
 
02:42:47.230 --> 02:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your
 
02:42:49.990 --> 02:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
testimony as I have heard all the
 
02:42:52.030 --> 02:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
testimony in in support or opposition to
 
02:42:53.590 --> 02:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
this bill one of the things that I think
 
02:42:57.269 --> 02:42:57.279 align:start position:0%
we haven't spoken to is as to the
 
02:43:00.469 --> 02:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity for children to be able to
 
02:43:02.590 --> 02:43:02.600 align:start position:0%
compute and hack on their devices in
 
02:43:04.510 --> 02:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
ways that are highly educational and
 
02:43:06.550 --> 02:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
that may have contributed to the
 
02:43:08.190 --> 02:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
qualifications of of some of our
 
02:43:11.630 --> 02:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
previous Witnesses in your understanding
 
02:43:15.750 --> 02:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
does this bill uh end up creating a
 
02:43:17.070 --> 02:43:17.080 align:start position:0%
circumstance where we are
 
02:43:20.349 --> 02:43:20.359 align:start position:0%
disenfranchising our children
 
02:43:22.070 --> 02:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's a very good question I
 
02:43:24.269 --> 02:43:24.279 align:start position:0%
think as you mentioned the problematic
 
02:43:26.190 --> 02:43:26.200 align:start position:0%
part of the bill in that case if is a
 
02:43:28.429 --> 02:43:28.439 align:start position:0%
children Tinkers with the device as you
 
02:43:30.269 --> 02:43:30.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned is hacker and trying to open
 
02:43:33.349 --> 02:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
up the the OS and deactivates this
 
02:43:35.110 --> 02:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
filter I get I think it opens
 
02:43:36.190 --> 02:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity for this kid to be
 
02:43:38.790 --> 02:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
considered a Fallon under definition uh
 
02:43:43.309 --> 02:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
of the Bill thank you any other
 
02:43:46.150 --> 02:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank
 
02:43:48.510 --> 02:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
you I don't have any more pink cards is
 
02:43:49.990 --> 02:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
anyone else that wish is to speak on
 
02:43:52.990 --> 02:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
this bill it hasn't filled out a pain
 
02:43:56.389 --> 02:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
card seeing none I'm going to close the
 
02:43:58.070 --> 02:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
02:44:00.830 --> 02:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
293 and just mention that it's afternoon
 
02:44:03.110 --> 02:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
if somebody wants to go ahead and take a
 
02:44:05.870 --> 02:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
break corkin is been waiting patiently

I'm GNA have his bill next I just want
 
02:44:08.269 --> 02:44:08.279 align:start position:0%
to make sure that if you want to take a
 
02:44:10.110 --> 02:44:10.120 align:start position:0%
break we're going to run through here
 
02:44:11.030 --> 02:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
but if you need to go get something to
 
02:44:12.870 --> 02:44:12.880 align:start position:0%

02:44:17.990 --> 02:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
own okay should I'm not going to open
 
02:44:20.710 --> 02:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
the hearing on house Bill 253 and
 
02:44:22.550 --> 02:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
represent uh and and recognize
 
02:44:34.309 --> 02:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:37.070 --> 02:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you so uh after some of the
 
02:44:38.910 --> 02:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
monster bills you had this morning uh
 
02:44:40.230 --> 02:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
hopefully this will be five minutes of
 
02:44:42.230 --> 02:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
testimony by me and no one else and you
 
02:44:47.110 --> 02:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:49.790 --> 02:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
lunch so all of the lawyers on the
 
02:44:52.309 --> 02:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
committee uh probably know exactly what
 
02:44:54.910 --> 02:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
iala is uh but for those of us who are
 
02:44:56.670 --> 02:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
not lawyers I'll take just 30 seconds to
 
02:45:00.230 --> 02:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
explain it whenever one of us uses an
 
02:45:02.630 --> 02:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
attorney for various things whether a
 
02:45:04.670 --> 02:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
inheritance is being dealt with or
 
02:45:06.469 --> 02:45:06.479 align:start position:0%
there's uh some funds from the
 
02:45:09.950 --> 02:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
transaction selling real estate or um
 
02:45:11.870 --> 02:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
the results of a lawsuit have come in
 
02:45:13.590 --> 02:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
and are being held by the attorney until
 
02:45:15.550 --> 02:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
they're dispersed you know 30 days or 90
 
02:45:18.230 --> 02:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
days later that money is put in a
 
02:45:19.670 --> 02:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
savings account that is under the
 
02:45:21.910 --> 02:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
control of the uh attorney for the
 
02:45:25.309 --> 02:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
benefit of the uh recipient and uh the
 
02:45:27.309 --> 02:45:27.319 align:start position:0%
attorney is not going to spin up you
 
02:45:29.910 --> 02:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
know 150 different savings accounts for
 
02:45:31.830 --> 02:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
each of his 150 clients during the year
 
02:45:34.070 --> 02:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
he will just have one savings account um
 
02:45:36.469 --> 02:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
pile all the money in and disperse it as
 
02:45:38.750 --> 02:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh the dispersals are required um and
 
02:45:39.990 --> 02:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's quite
 
02:45:42.150 --> 02:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable uh and the attorney himself
 
02:45:44.230 --> 02:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
is keeping track of how much needs to be
 
02:45:46.750 --> 02:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
dispersed to each entity so um you know
 
02:45:48.990 --> 02:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
if I have $1,000 for my benefit that
 
02:45:51.550 --> 02:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
lands in an attorney's uh trust account
 
02:45:52.990 --> 02:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
uh and it comes out 30 days later it
 
02:45:54.630 --> 02:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
might have earned you know $6 in
 
02:45:56.590 --> 02:45:56.600 align:start position:0%
interest or whatever the math is and
 
02:45:58.830 --> 02:45:58.840 align:start position:0%
simultaneously other amounts are landing
 
02:46:00.590 --> 02:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
in there and also generating interest
 
02:46:02.870 --> 02:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
from the bank um at the end of the year
 
02:46:05.110 --> 02:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
it would be wildly impractical for an
 
02:46:07.750 --> 02:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
attorney to go through and say uh Travis
 
02:46:11.349 --> 02:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
corkran had $600 for 91 days at
 
02:46:15.910 --> 02:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
1.2% we need to mail him a check for a16
 
02:46:19.550 --> 02:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
and so forth and so on so the um
 
02:46:21.030 --> 02:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
way that this is resolved and and yet
 
02:46:22.389 --> 02:46:22.399 align:start position:0%
that money also shouldn't flow to the
 
02:46:24.550 --> 02:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
attorney he hasn't earned that interest
 
02:46:26.230 --> 02:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh the way that this is resolved is
 
02:46:28.469 --> 02:46:28.479 align:start position:0%
currently by New Hampshire bar rules
 
02:46:30.830 --> 02:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
using a program called IA which uh
 
02:46:33.590 --> 02:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
stands for uh interest bearing accounts
 
02:46:36.269 --> 02:46:36.279 align:start position:0%
or you know interest on trusty accounts
 
02:46:39.469 --> 02:46:39.479 align:start position:0%
um this is all fairly reasonable um but
 
02:46:41.870 --> 02:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
the question is exactly who disperses
 
02:46:43.870 --> 02:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
these funds and what criteria do they
 
02:46:46.349 --> 02:46:46.359 align:start position:0%
use and if we've been following the news
 
02:46:48.990 --> 02:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
recently with the revelations about the
 
02:46:52.190 --> 02:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
us uh government's budget and the US Aid
 
02:46:54.349 --> 02:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
uh money which has effectively uh been
 
02:46:57.110 --> 02:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
this vast dark slush fund that has been
 
02:47:00.030 --> 02:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
dispersed to all sorts of entities and
 
02:47:01.550 --> 02:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
uh dispersed not in a sort of an
 
02:47:03.110 --> 02:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
even-handed way where we're you know
 
02:47:05.190 --> 02:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
just paying for you know first aid in
 
02:47:06.990 --> 02:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
this place and you know libraries over
 
02:47:09.110 --> 02:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
there but a lot of it has been very very
 
02:47:11.790 --> 02:47:11.800 align:start position:0%
very targeted um and you know this is
 
02:47:12.910 --> 02:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
the federal level and I'm making an
 
02:47:14.670 --> 02:47:14.680 align:start position:0%
analogy so just you know 10 more seconds
 
02:47:16.830 --> 02:47:16.840 align:start position:0%
I'll get back to New Hampshire but it
 
02:47:19.550 --> 02:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
has been targeted by those who are aware
 
02:47:22.269 --> 02:47:22.279 align:start position:0%
of how these uh non-governmental
 
02:47:25.030 --> 02:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
organization mechanisms work and it is
 
02:47:29.670 --> 02:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
directed to uh Allied uh Nos and uh used
 
02:47:32.150 --> 02:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
for very very political purposes often
 
02:47:36.190 --> 02:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
so the iala fund in New Hampshire is uh
 
02:47:38.389 --> 02:47:38.399 align:start position:0%
effectively a tax on New Hampshire
 
02:47:41.389 --> 02:47:41.399 align:start position:0%
citizens those who use attorneys um for
 
02:47:44.190 --> 02:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
sort of any purpose and uh this money is
 
02:47:46.910 --> 02:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
being dispersed uh the this tax dollars
 
02:47:49.030 --> 02:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
in a sense uh metaphorically so is being
 
02:47:51.309 --> 02:47:51.319 align:start position:0%
dispersed not by representatives of the
 
02:47:54.110 --> 02:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
citizens but by members of the bar
 
02:47:57.309 --> 02:47:57.319 align:start position:0%
association and uh I found several
 
02:47:58.309 --> 02:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
different numbers talking about the
 
02:48:01.110 --> 02:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
total amount um some numbers say half a
 
02:48:02.950 --> 02:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
million some say about a million a year
 
02:48:05.349 --> 02:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
some say two million a year um but
 
02:48:07.150 --> 02:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
reviewing the grants that have been
 
02:48:09.910 --> 02:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
given um some of these grants are fairly
 
02:48:11.790 --> 02:48:11.800 align:start position:0%
neutral and sound like good ideas you
 
02:48:14.070 --> 02:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
know organization to help the indent or
 
02:48:16.910 --> 02:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
whatever um some of them uh on the other
 
02:48:18.790 --> 02:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
hand are very much on one side of the
 
02:48:20.429 --> 02:48:20.439 align:start position:0%
political aisle uh going to
 
02:48:22.230 --> 02:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
organizations that are involved in
 
02:48:24.790 --> 02:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
lobbying or helping uh very particular
 
02:48:28.349 --> 02:48:28.359 align:start position:0%
groups and um I pulled up just a few
 
02:48:29.950 --> 02:48:29.960 align:start position:0%
examples and I don't want to go through
 
02:48:32.590 --> 02:48:32.600 align:start position:0%
the entire spreadsheet um but grants are
 
02:48:33.950 --> 02:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
going to New Hampshire Catholic
 
02:48:36.510 --> 02:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
Charities uh which uses them for among
 
02:48:38.790 --> 02:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
other purposes to help settle refugees
 
02:48:41.590 --> 02:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire um that goes to the
 
02:48:43.349 --> 02:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
Manchester chapter of the
 
02:48:45.750 --> 02:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
NAACP and while that organization may do
 
02:48:47.590 --> 02:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
some good uh things it has also done
 
02:48:50.110 --> 02:48:50.120 align:start position:0%
other things uh such as endorsing or
 
02:48:51.990 --> 02:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
pushing for laws that infringe on the
 
02:48:53.910 --> 02:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
first amendment by criminalizing the
 
02:48:57.070 --> 02:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
display of the Confederate flag and to
 
02:49:00.030 --> 02:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
um pushing for uh laws against quote
 
02:49:02.750 --> 02:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
unquote disinformation and for pushing
 
02:49:05.230 --> 02:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
uh for laws that would criminalize
 
02:49:08.469 --> 02:49:08.479 align:start position:0%
Behavior by private firms um as uh
 
02:49:10.429 --> 02:49:10.439 align:start position:0%
racist or discriminatory not based on
 
02:49:12.429 --> 02:49:12.439 align:start position:0%
any evidence of that by just by
 
02:49:15.830 --> 02:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
disperate impact um let's see there's
 
02:49:17.710 --> 02:49:17.720 align:start position:0%
also the disabilities Right Center has
 
02:49:19.349 --> 02:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
been a uh
 
02:49:21.110 --> 02:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh receiver of these funds and one of
 
02:49:22.950 --> 02:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
the things that they do is launch
 
02:49:26.190 --> 02:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
lawsuits against private firms uh if in
 
02:49:28.710 --> 02:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
the view of the disability rights Center
 
02:49:30.950 --> 02:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
they have you know the handicapped door
 
02:49:32.750 --> 02:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
was blocked for you know 15 minutes or
 
02:49:35.630 --> 02:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
the sort of thing so um you know I need
 
02:49:37.910 --> 02:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
not say that every single recipient of
 
02:49:40.349 --> 02:49:40.359 align:start position:0%
these funds uh is necessarily doing bad
 
02:49:42.910 --> 02:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
or doing bad all of the time but we do
 
02:49:44.590 --> 02:49:44.600 align:start position:0%
have this situation where there are sort
 
02:49:47.190 --> 02:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
of dark funds that are being taken from
 
02:49:49.309 --> 02:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
citizens as a whole and directed very
 
02:49:52.229 --> 02:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
much in one side of the political aisle
 
02:49:54.790 --> 02:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh this bill um gets back to the
 
02:49:57.950 --> 02:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
original idea behind IA funds which is
 
02:49:59.950 --> 02:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
there is in fact a huge transaction cost
 
02:50:02.429 --> 02:50:02.439 align:start position:0%
to tracking every single penny um and
 
02:50:04.229 --> 02:50:04.239 align:start position:0%
that would not be realistic to mail out
 
02:50:07.550 --> 02:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
thousands of checks for 60 cents each um
 
02:50:09.670 --> 02:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
and it specifies
 
02:50:14.349 --> 02:50:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:17.429 --> 02:50:17.439 align:start position:0%
second the uh funds instead flow to New
 
02:50:19.190 --> 02:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's public defenders
 
02:50:22.150 --> 02:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
and this is I think a uh idea that
 
02:50:24.269 --> 02:50:24.279 align:start position:0%
should be palatable to people on both
 
02:50:27.229 --> 02:50:27.239 align:start position:0%
sides of the aisle um you know the
 
02:50:28.790 --> 02:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
libertarian could see you know what is
 
02:50:30.550 --> 02:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
it that public defenders do they help
 
02:50:32.469 --> 02:50:32.479 align:start position:0%
individual citizens who are often very
 
02:50:34.349 --> 02:50:34.359 align:start position:0%
much mismatched in a David and Goliath
 
02:50:36.429 --> 02:50:36.439 align:start position:0%
situation against prosecutors with
 
02:50:38.510 --> 02:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
effectively unlimited budgets and on the
 
02:50:40.150 --> 02:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
left side of the aisle you could see you
 
02:50:42.469 --> 02:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
know effectively the same um that you
 
02:50:43.870 --> 02:50:43.880 align:start position:0%
know the these are not handouts to
 
02:50:45.910 --> 02:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
billionaires or you know gun
 
02:50:48.710 --> 02:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
manufacturers manufacturers or anything
 
02:50:51.309 --> 02:50:51.319 align:start position:0%
um but again supporting a very uh
 
02:50:54.910 --> 02:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
pro-social um good uh
 
02:50:56.870 --> 02:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
program I'm happy to answer any
 
02:51:01.349 --> 02:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
questions representative uh
 
02:51:04.269 --> 02:51:04.279 align:start position:0%
Horgan I guess you actually just to
 
02:51:06.110 --> 02:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
jumped out of me looking at build lines
 
02:51:09.070 --> 02:51:09.080 align:start position:0%
14 like trying to prevent um prevent
 
02:51:10.990 --> 02:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
them from contributing any funds to any
 
02:51:13.910 --> 02:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization and you explained
 
02:51:15.750 --> 02:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
why that is and you cited three examples
 
02:51:16.830 --> 02:51:16.840 align:start position:0%
which you
 
02:51:19.309 --> 02:51:19.319 align:start position:0%
think are bad although I'm not sure if
 
02:51:20.710 --> 02:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
everybody in the room would agree
 
02:51:23.229 --> 02:51:23.239 align:start position:0%
especially Disability Rights Association
 
02:51:24.590 --> 02:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if you actually
 
02:51:26.590 --> 02:51:26.600 align:start position:0%
characterized what they do but I think
 
02:51:28.309 --> 02:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
they're an excellent organization I'm
 
02:51:30.070 --> 02:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
member of at least one that's been cited
 
02:51:33.710 --> 02:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
by your co-sponsor as an NGO
 
02:51:37.389 --> 02:51:37.399 align:start position:0%
um I'm just ask would would it be would
 
02:51:40.389 --> 02:51:40.399 align:start position:0%
it be uh would you be would it be would
 
02:51:41.990 --> 02:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
you consider a friendly Amendment if we
 
02:51:45.229 --> 02:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
simply said they had to disclose uh what
 
02:51:47.190 --> 02:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
other organizations are donating to have
 
02:51:49.870 --> 02:51:49.880 align:start position:0%
a blanket prohibition on it um because I
 
02:51:52.269 --> 02:51:52.279 align:start position:0%
think and what would they do if the
 
02:51:56.190 --> 02:51:56.200 align:start position:0%
vendor office just um continued donating
 
02:51:57.870 --> 02:51:57.880 align:start position:0%
to organizations which at least maybe
 
02:52:00.110 --> 02:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
you find objectionable um what if they
 
02:52:01.950 --> 02:52:01.960 align:start position:0%
simply what would be the consequences if
 
02:52:04.429 --> 02:52:04.439 align:start position:0%
they simply refuse to take the funds and
 
02:52:06.269 --> 02:52:06.279 align:start position:0%
um decide to seek their funds elsewhere
 
02:52:07.670 --> 02:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
rather than have this restriction on
 
02:52:11.910 --> 02:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
their activities so um I believe that uh
 
02:52:14.070 --> 02:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
if they refuse to take the funds uh
 
02:52:17.269 --> 02:52:17.279 align:start position:0%
those would be swept to the general fund
 
02:52:17.279 --> 02:52:22.030 align:start position:0%
those would be swept to the general fund
um

02:52:22.030 --> 02:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:23.870 --> 02:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
I I certainly remember that uh back and
 
02:52:28.429 --> 02:52:28.439 align:start position:0%
forth uh talking to the uh OS um and my
 
02:52:30.469 --> 02:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
eyes are a little blurry right now uh
 
02:52:33.630 --> 02:52:33.640 align:start position:0%
and so my uh answer is that no I would
 
02:52:35.910 --> 02:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
not um you know obviously it's not my
 
02:52:38.150 --> 02:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
decision um but I would not recommend an
 
02:52:40.229 --> 02:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
amendment of that form because that
 
02:52:42.950 --> 02:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
allows for basically uh the exact
 
02:52:45.870 --> 02:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
current situation to take place where uh
 
02:52:47.429 --> 02:52:47.439 align:start position:0%
you know people in a small community who
 
02:52:49.349 --> 02:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
work together say hey you know it was
 
02:52:51.349 --> 02:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
very much Our intention to fund this one
 
02:52:53.229 --> 02:52:53.239 align:start position:0%
activist group but now we can't do it
 
02:52:55.030 --> 02:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
directly it goes to you guys would you
 
02:52:56.670 --> 02:52:56.680 align:start position:0%
mind making sure that it still flows to
 
02:52:59.229 --> 02:52:59.239 align:start position:0%
them um I think that it is reasonable
 
02:53:01.910 --> 02:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
for the uh House of Representatives to
 
02:53:04.070 --> 02:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
identify the public defender office as a
 
02:53:06.349 --> 02:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
worthy cause and to specify that the
 
02:53:07.830 --> 02:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
funds should go there and should stay
 
02:53:10.550 --> 02:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
there for the benefit of their
 
02:53:13.349 --> 02:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
clients followup I guess you're saying
 
02:53:15.710 --> 02:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
the defender office you wouldn't give
 
02:53:18.790 --> 02:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
them the uh you would deny them the the
 
02:53:20.550 --> 02:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
right to support other organizations
 
02:53:24.710 --> 02:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
which they feel uh are they feel like
 
02:53:26.790 --> 02:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
help them achieve their their partner
 
02:53:28.150 --> 02:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
for other organizations which help them
 
02:53:29.550 --> 02:53:29.560 align:start position:0%
achieve their mission so you would like
 
02:53:31.670 --> 02:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
deny them the right just because some
 
02:53:33.870 --> 02:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
third party may not necessarily agree
 
02:53:37.269 --> 02:53:37.279 align:start position:0%
with who they who they choose it would
 
02:53:38.510 --> 02:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
not deny them that right they have
 
02:53:39.950 --> 02:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely every right to do that but if
 
02:53:41.429 --> 02:53:41.439 align:start position:0%
they choose to do that they would be
 
02:53:43.590 --> 02:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
choosing between two Alternatives and
 
02:53:44.950 --> 02:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
one of them would be this additional
 
02:53:46.950 --> 02:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
source of funding for their core
 
02:53:48.830 --> 02:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
Mission any other question questions
 
02:53:50.309 --> 02:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you Mr
 
02:53:51.510 --> 02:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative um how
 
02:53:53.510 --> 02:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
much money are we talking about um I've
 
02:53:55.630 --> 02:53:55.640 align:start position:0%
seen various conflicting numbers I
 
02:53:58.309 --> 02:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
believe it's about $2 million a
 
02:54:00.870 --> 02:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
year any other questions representative
 
02:54:03.030 --> 02:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
McFarland thank you Mr chairman uh
 
02:54:05.910 --> 02:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative Corran if we were to
 
02:54:07.469 --> 02:54:07.479 align:start position:0%
contemplate an amendment as was being
 
02:54:11.750 --> 02:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
discussed a few moments ago and provide
 
02:54:13.269 --> 02:54:13.279 align:start position:0%
uh the these lawyers with the
 
02:54:14.990 --> 02:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to seek to direct the
 
02:54:17.590 --> 02:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
funds elsewhere would that in your
 
02:54:19.830 --> 02:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
opinion increase the costs of
 
02:54:22.550 --> 02:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
administration and audit of this statute
 
02:54:24.550 --> 02:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
um I I think that's quite likely we
 
02:54:27.070 --> 02:54:27.080 align:start position:0%
would have to um you know review where
 
02:54:29.070 --> 02:54:29.080 align:start position:0%
it was going and see if these you know
 
02:54:31.790 --> 02:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
were activist NOS or something else uh
 
02:54:34.630 --> 02:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
and and again I I think that the purpose
 
02:54:37.309 --> 02:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
of an amendment um you know I I
 
02:54:38.790 --> 02:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say purpose it's always sort
 
02:54:40.550 --> 02:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
of a rhetorical fallacy to attribute
 
02:54:43.269 --> 02:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
that um but I think that that sort of
 
02:54:44.830 --> 02:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
you know patches one hole in the boat
 
02:54:46.389 --> 02:54:46.399 align:start position:0%
and then just immediately opens up
 
02:54:48.630 --> 02:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
another one saying you can't uh send
 
02:54:50.990 --> 02:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
funds to you know NOS except you can
 
02:54:52.389 --> 02:54:52.399 align:start position:0%
route it through this office and then
 
02:54:54.389 --> 02:54:54.399 align:start position:0%
they can send funds to NOS so I do not
 
02:54:57.190 --> 02:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
see it as being a a great approach thank
 
02:55:01.070 --> 02:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
you representative okay representative
 
02:55:05.429 --> 02:55:05.439 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you very much um do you
 
02:55:10.190 --> 02:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
recognize any difference between funding
 
02:55:16.150 --> 02:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
um uh entities which provide uh criminal
 
02:55:20.389 --> 02:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
representation versus civil case
 
02:55:22.750 --> 02:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
representation um it's my understanding
 
02:55:25.389 --> 02:55:25.399 align:start position:0%
that the public defender office only
 
02:55:27.750 --> 02:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
provides criminal defense uh I I could
 
02:55:29.710 --> 02:55:29.720 align:start position:0%
be incorrect on that and if I am I'll
 
02:55:32.510 --> 02:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
I'll uh acknowledge that correction
 
02:55:36.349 --> 02:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
could I follow up
 
02:55:41.349 --> 02:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
yes yes thank you um actually that is my
 
02:55:44.830 --> 02:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
understanding um also and it and it is
 
02:55:46.830 --> 02:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
also my understanding that the public
 
02:55:49.990 --> 02:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
defender can go to the fiscal committee
 
02:55:52.510 --> 02:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
and in fact does go to the fiscal
 
02:55:55.630 --> 02:55:55.640 align:start position:0%
committee regularly when there is Need
 
02:56:00.950 --> 02:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
for additional funding for um criminal
 
02:56:05.590 --> 02:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
defense um do you then think that civil
 
02:56:11.030 --> 02:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
defense is not as um important in our
 
02:56:14.110 --> 02:56:14.120 align:start position:0%
justice system as criminal defense um I
 
02:56:16.110 --> 02:56:16.120 align:start position:0%
I think that it is definitely important
 
02:56:17.830 --> 02:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
I I guess if you're explicitly asking me
 
02:56:19.990 --> 02:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
to rank order is it less important I
 
02:56:22.309 --> 02:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
would say it is less important um you
 
02:56:24.110 --> 02:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
know I have uh LED sort of an
 
02:56:26.429 --> 02:56:26.439 align:start position:0%
interesting life and I've been on uh
 
02:56:29.269 --> 02:56:29.279 align:start position:0%
both sides of multiple lawsuits and um
 
02:56:31.030 --> 02:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
being involved in a civil lawsuit is
 
02:56:33.990 --> 02:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
exciting uh being a defendant against
 
02:56:35.510 --> 02:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
the government when they're attempting
 
02:56:37.750 --> 02:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
to press criminal charges is much more
 
02:56:39.870 --> 02:56:39.880 align:start position:0%
exciting um so I think that the public
 
02:56:42.269 --> 02:56:42.279 align:start position:0%
defenders office does great work uh
 
02:56:43.790 --> 02:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
helping people who cannot afford their
 
02:56:46.870 --> 02:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
own defense and and this again gets to
 
02:56:48.710 --> 02:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh sort of the David and Goliath problem
 
02:56:50.550 --> 02:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
where you could have somebody you know
 
02:56:52.469 --> 02:56:52.479 align:start position:0%
not graduating the top half of his of
 
02:56:54.950 --> 02:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
his high school class not having family
 
02:56:58.150 --> 02:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
resources and you know through a mistake
 
02:57:01.269 --> 02:57:01.279 align:start position:0%
or you know even an intentional error um
 
02:57:03.429 --> 02:57:03.439 align:start position:0%
you know is you know was in the wrong
 
02:57:05.389 --> 02:57:05.399 align:start position:0%
car with the wrong friend and suddenly
 
02:57:07.070 --> 02:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
there's you know accessory to this and
 
02:57:08.510 --> 02:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
felony weight of that and this other
 
02:57:10.630 --> 02:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
thing uh and there are people who end up
 
02:57:12.950 --> 02:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
facing sort of you know huge uh
 
02:57:15.389 --> 02:57:15.399 align:start position:0%
precarious situations and so the public
 
02:57:18.349 --> 02:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
defender gives these people um you know
 
02:57:20.750 --> 02:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
some help in that situation so if I
 
02:57:23.150 --> 02:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
could you know uh rank order you know
 
02:57:25.790 --> 02:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
should the public defender office or any
 
02:57:27.750 --> 02:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
group either help someone who's looking
 
02:57:29.870 --> 02:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
at 20 years to life or help someone
 
02:57:31.950 --> 02:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
who's looking at a $50,000 civil
 
02:57:33.990 --> 02:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
judgment uh I would certainly think that
 
02:57:37.110 --> 02:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
the former is a much higher priority U
 
02:57:38.710 --> 02:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
thank you although I'd like to follow up
 
02:57:41.429 --> 02:57:41.439 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid that the um the sponsors
 
02:57:43.469 --> 02:57:43.479 align:start position:0%
answers might be so long that we ought
 
02:57:47.349 --> 02:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
to try to I I can try to be briefer okay
 
02:57:49.830 --> 02:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
that's all right okay thank you
 
02:57:52.349 --> 02:57:52.359 align:start position:0%
representative mayos thank you Mr chair
 
02:57:54.830 --> 02:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I
 
02:57:59.990 --> 02:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask um the bill says that the
 
02:58:02.349 --> 02:58:02.359 align:start position:0%
public defenders office would lose their
 
02:58:05.150 --> 02:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
funding from myala if they contributed
 
02:58:08.550 --> 02:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
any funds to any nonprofit organization
 
02:58:11.190 --> 02:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
so do you contemplate that for example
 
02:58:14.030 --> 02:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
if the public defenders were a sponsor
 
02:58:17.469 --> 02:58:17.479 align:start position:0%
at the bar association midyear or end
 
02:58:19.590 --> 02:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
year meeting and they made a
 
02:58:22.229 --> 02:58:22.239 align:start position:0%
contribution and were a sponsor or that
 
02:58:25.550 --> 02:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
if they paid a nonprofit organization to
 
02:58:28.150 --> 02:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
train new upand cominging public
 
02:58:30.590 --> 02:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
defender attorneys that then they would
 
02:58:33.750 --> 02:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
lose their iila funding that is a very
 
02:58:35.550 --> 02:58:35.560 align:start position:0%
well crafted sort of adversarial
 
02:58:37.150 --> 02:58:37.160 align:start position:0%
question that gets to the worst possible
 
02:58:39.910 --> 02:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
aspect of this and I'd say Yes um uh it
 
02:58:42.910 --> 02:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely would and um you know on on
 
02:58:44.630 --> 02:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
the one hand you could say well you know
 
02:58:46.110 --> 02:58:46.120 align:start position:0%
there there should be you know carats
 
02:58:48.550 --> 02:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
for this and that and uh I abs
 
02:58:50.590 --> 02:58:50.600 align:start position:0%
understand the utility of those sorts of
 
02:58:52.229 --> 02:58:52.239 align:start position:0%
things and how that is in keeping with
 
02:58:53.950 --> 02:58:53.960 align:start position:0%
the core mission of the public defender
 
02:58:57.670 --> 02:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
office um but the problem is that uh you
 
02:58:59.190 --> 02:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
could either have a very simple rule
 
02:59:01.429 --> 02:59:01.439 align:start position:0%
saying no pass through donations to
 
02:59:04.309 --> 02:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
other NOS or you could uh you know
 
02:59:06.510 --> 02:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
getting this very complicated subjective
 
02:59:09.190 --> 02:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
standard where you know uh not you know
 
02:59:10.670 --> 02:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
directly contributing to the core
 
02:59:12.790 --> 02:59:12.800 align:start position:0%
Mission and then we have a conversation
 
02:59:15.110 --> 02:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
about you know is the public defender
 
02:59:17.389 --> 02:59:17.399 align:start position:0%
office passing money to some activist
 
02:59:19.150 --> 02:59:19.160 align:start position:0%
group that is seeking to influence
 
02:59:21.790 --> 02:59:21.800 align:start position:0%
legislation which some people approve of
 
02:59:24.349 --> 02:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
and other citizens disapprove of um you
 
02:59:26.070 --> 02:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
know relevant and again getting back to
 
02:59:28.469 --> 02:59:28.479 align:start position:0%
the federal example with us Aid once you
 
02:59:30.790 --> 02:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
open the door to could it plausibly be
 
02:59:32.750 --> 02:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
construed as in the interest of you know
 
02:59:35.870 --> 02:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
etc etc etc then pretty soon you uh you
 
02:59:38.070 --> 02:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
know have have no barriers whatso
 
02:59:40.190 --> 02:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
whatsoever to funding insane things
 
02:59:42.469 --> 02:59:42.479 align:start position:0%
which is the problem that I'm trying to
 
02:59:45.030 --> 02:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
address any other questions of this
 
02:59:47.389 --> 02:59:47.399 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you thank you
 
02:59:52.590 --> 02:59:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:54.670 --> 02:59:54.680 align:start position:0%
Michael from the public defendant office
 
02:59:56.349 --> 02:59:56.359 align:start position:0%
and I can't really read the last time I
 
03:00:05.469 --> 03:00:05.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:08.910 --> 03:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
you turn the mic yeah yep there you go
 
03:00:10.469 --> 03:00:10.479 align:start position:0%
my name is Michael a capino and I
 
03:00:12.269 --> 03:00:12.279 align:start position:0%
currently have the privilege of serving
 
03:00:13.550 --> 03:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
as the chairman of the board of
 
03:00:15.990 --> 03:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
directors of New Hampshire public
 
03:00:18.309 --> 03:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
defender um New Hampshire public
 
03:00:20.429 --> 03:00:20.439 align:start position:0%
defender does not take a position on
 
03:00:22.309 --> 03:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
this bill but I am here to provide
 
03:00:26.150 --> 03:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
information to you all about um the
 
03:00:28.830 --> 03:00:28.840 align:start position:0%
program uh first of all we were not
 
03:00:33.429 --> 03:00:33.439 align:start position:0%
consulted about this bill uh nobody um
 
03:00:35.750 --> 03:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
got in touch with the public defender to
 
03:00:38.190 --> 03:00:38.200 align:start position:0%
uh determine uh exactly what we do or
 
03:00:42.070 --> 03:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
How We Do It um secondly I want to make
 
03:00:44.190 --> 03:00:44.200 align:start position:0%
it clear that the New Hampshire public
 
03:00:47.510 --> 03:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
defender does not make contributions to
 
03:00:47.520 --> 03:00:48.630 align:start position:0%
defender does not make contributions to
political

03:00:48.630 --> 03:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
political
 
03:00:50.870 --> 03:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
campaigns and we do not make
 
03:00:54.030 --> 03:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
contributions to other uh nonprofit
 
03:00:56.070 --> 03:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
organizations or
 
03:01:00.870 --> 03:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
oros there are times where we may need
 
03:01:03.790 --> 03:01:03.800 align:start position:0%
services from other NOS for instance if
 
03:01:06.269 --> 03:01:06.279 align:start position:0%
we need a particular language
 
03:01:09.790 --> 03:01:09.800 align:start position:0%
interpreter um we may hire that person
 
03:01:12.510 --> 03:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
from a service such as a Lutheran
 
03:01:14.550 --> 03:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
Services organization or something like
 
03:01:16.670 --> 03:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
that but we consider that to be payment
 
03:01:20.030 --> 03:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
for services and not a contribution to
 
03:01:21.389 --> 03:01:21.399 align:start position:0%
such an
 
03:01:21.399 --> 03:01:22.950 align:start position:0%
such an
organization

03:01:22.950 --> 03:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
organization
 
03:01:25.870 --> 03:01:25.880 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to get that out on the
 
03:01:27.590 --> 03:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
table first of all because this bill
 
03:01:30.550 --> 03:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
seems to suggest uh that we would need
 
03:01:33.710 --> 03:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
some kind of oversight um with respect
 
03:01:38.070 --> 03:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
to I guess NOS is the word uh that is
 
03:01:40.469 --> 03:01:40.479 align:start position:0%
concerning um I also want to explain to
 
03:01:42.389 --> 03:01:42.399 align:start position:0%
you a little bit about what New
 
03:01:44.030 --> 03:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public defender is we are not
 
03:01:46.550 --> 03:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
a state agency we are a private
 
03:01:49.790 --> 03:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
Corporation uh by Statute we provide we
 
03:01:52.309 --> 03:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
are the agency that has chosen to
 
03:01:55.110 --> 03:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
provide uh Indigent criminal defense
 
03:01:57.469 --> 03:01:57.479 align:start position:0%
services to the state of New Hampshire
 
03:01:59.630 --> 03:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
we do that through an arrangement with
 
03:02:04.229 --> 03:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
the judicial Council uh our budget um is
 
03:02:07.950 --> 03:02:07.960 align:start position:0%
uh our contract I should say um comes
 
03:02:11.030 --> 03:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
from the budget of the judicial Council
 
03:02:14.830 --> 03:02:14.840 align:start position:0%
um for the last bium it was $28 million
 
03:02:16.830 --> 03:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
per year we
 
03:02:20.830 --> 03:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
have3 30 plus or minus lawyers working
 
03:02:22.830 --> 03:02:22.840 align:start position:0%
for us right now and 10 offices
 
03:02:25.670 --> 03:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
throughout uh the state of New Hampshire
 
03:02:29.150 --> 03:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:32.590 --> 03:02:32.600 align:start position:0%
um the way that it works is we contract
 
03:02:34.229 --> 03:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
with the judicial Council the judicial
 
03:02:36.590 --> 03:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
Council seeks a budget from uh the
 
03:02:38.710 --> 03:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
governor and then ultimately from the
 
03:02:42.389 --> 03:02:42.399 align:start position:0%
house we have in fact received um money
 
03:02:44.830 --> 03:02:44.840 align:start position:0%
um when the budget uh when the contract
 
03:02:46.710 --> 03:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
didn't cover it as representative Smith
 
03:02:50.830 --> 03:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
has has indicated we have gone to um to
 
03:02:53.710 --> 03:02:53.720 align:start position:0%
house uh to the financial uh committee
 
03:02:56.830 --> 03:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
on occasion when uh we needed
 
03:02:59.830 --> 03:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
um to uh Shore up the budget for one
 
03:03:04.870 --> 03:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
reason or another um but our our uh
 
03:03:07.190 --> 03:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
money comes through a contract with the
 
03:03:10.590 --> 03:03:10.600 align:start position:0%
state um so I just wanted to point that
 
03:03:12.269 --> 03:03:12.279 align:start position:0%
out and the other thing is we don't do
 
03:03:15.150 --> 03:03:15.160 align:start position:0%
any civil representation we represent
 
03:03:18.429 --> 03:03:18.439 align:start position:0%
individuals in the state courts before
 
03:03:22.309 --> 03:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire parole board um and uh
 
03:03:24.710 --> 03:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
occasionally we will provide advice and
 
03:03:27.190 --> 03:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
counsel when one of our clients is
 
03:03:29.750 --> 03:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
called before some board where their
 
03:03:32.030 --> 03:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
Fifth Amendment right to remain silent
 
03:03:36.670 --> 03:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
may be in may be uh involved um but uh
 
03:03:39.550 --> 03:03:39.560 align:start position:0%
the judicial Council also provides uh
 
03:03:42.229 --> 03:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
the budget line for Casa for New
 
03:03:44.910 --> 03:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistance and for
 
03:03:47.910 --> 03:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
assigned councils and for uh contract
 
03:03:49.990 --> 03:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
Council so we we are part of a much
 
03:03:53.269 --> 03:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
bigger um
 
03:03:56.790 --> 03:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
appropriation um so I'm happy to answer
 
03:03:59.110 --> 03:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
any any questions that anybody has I do
 
03:04:03.150 --> 03:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate the prior speakers um latory
 
03:04:05.389 --> 03:04:05.399 align:start position:0%
remarks about our program I do believe
 
03:04:07.670 --> 03:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
that we uh have an excellent public
 
03:04:09.269 --> 03:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
defender program here in the state of
 
03:04:11.389 --> 03:04:11.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I believe that our lawyers
 
03:04:14.550 --> 03:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
every day are out there uh uh pursuing
 
03:04:17.269 --> 03:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
our major cause which is to provide the
 
03:04:19.110 --> 03:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
best sixth amendment protection to the
 
03:04:21.510 --> 03:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire that is
 
03:04:24.510 --> 03:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
available any questions representative
 
03:04:27.389 --> 03:04:27.399 align:start position:0%
McFarland thank you Mr chairman uh is it
 
03:04:30.550 --> 03:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
your position that the public defenders
 
03:04:32.950 --> 03:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
office is fully funded or do you believe
 
03:04:34.150 --> 03:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
that you could benefit from these
 
03:04:36.309 --> 03:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
additional funds depends what you mean
 
03:04:40.910 --> 03:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
by fully funded um we we I I don't think
 
03:04:42.710 --> 03:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
it's any secret and by the way our
 
03:04:46.349 --> 03:04:46.359 align:start position:0%
budget as being part of the um judicial
 
03:04:46.359 --> 03:04:47.870 align:start position:0%
budget as being part of the um judicial
Council

03:04:47.870 --> 03:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
Council
 
03:04:50.349 --> 03:04:50.359 align:start position:0%
uh there is a reference in this bill to
 
03:04:53.070 --> 03:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
um we have to publish our our budget to
 
03:04:55.670 --> 03:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
to get the money um it's part it's
 
03:04:57.870 --> 03:04:57.880 align:start position:0%
already public it's part of what uh the
 
03:05:00.950 --> 03:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
judicial Council puts out each year um
 
03:05:04.469 --> 03:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
so but um are we fully funded no and I
 
03:05:06.590 --> 03:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
don't think that we have enough lawyers
 
03:05:09.389 --> 03:05:09.399 align:start position:0%
right now um I think in fact if you read
 
03:05:11.110 --> 03:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire bar news there's a
 
03:05:14.750 --> 03:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
recent um there's a recent uh article in
 
03:05:18.910 --> 03:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
that uh publication uh laying out how um
 
03:05:22.229 --> 03:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
our current staff is uh overburdened we
 
03:05:25.269 --> 03:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
have very high case loads right now um
 
03:05:28.830 --> 03:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
we uh sought a a bunch more money than
 
03:05:32.990 --> 03:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
is in the current um judicial Council uh
 
03:05:36.510 --> 03:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation um or I should say request
 
03:05:39.469 --> 03:05:39.479 align:start position:0%
at this point for the upcoming bium um
 
03:05:43.790 --> 03:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
so um but we are laboring to fix that
 
03:05:47.150 --> 03:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
problem uh we uh have an attrition
 
03:05:49.750 --> 03:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
problem with lawyers uh that leave and
 
03:05:51.190 --> 03:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
and it's very difficult to hire new
 
03:05:54.469 --> 03:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
lawyers these days um so I would I would
 
03:05:57.910 --> 03:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
say we're fully funded for what we have
 
03:06:00.870 --> 03:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire needs a larger public
 
03:06:02.990 --> 03:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
defender program with public defenders
 
03:06:05.150 --> 03:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
who have lower case
 
03:06:07.389 --> 03:06:07.399 align:start position:0%
loads Representative
 
03:06:10.389 --> 03:06:10.399 align:start position:0%
mayos no any other
 
03:06:14.269 --> 03:06:14.279 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
03:06:39.630 --> 03:06:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:41.229 --> 03:06:41.239 align:start position:0%

here on behalf for the N Hampshire bar
 
03:06:52.190 --> 03:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
assoc the N Hampshire bar Foundation um
 
03:06:54.110 --> 03:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
chairman Scott Harris of the bar
 
03:06:56.349 --> 03:06:56.359 align:start position:0%
Foundation his testimony just to
 
03:06:58.389 --> 03:06:58.399 align:start position:0%
highlight a couple of things in his uh
 
03:07:00.910 --> 03:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
letter to you uh the first paragraph
 
03:07:03.550 --> 03:07:03.560 align:start position:0%
highlights the how the I olter fund has
 
03:07:04.790 --> 03:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
come about through the New Hampshire
 
03:07:06.710 --> 03:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court their
 
03:07:08.830 --> 03:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
rules um the New Hampshire bar
 
03:07:12.150 --> 03:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
Foundation is a nonprofit public charity
 
03:07:14.349 --> 03:07:14.359 align:start position:0%
it's made up of 19
 
03:07:16.590 --> 03:07:16.600 align:start position:0%
volunteers but I'd like to bring to your
 
03:07:18.950 --> 03:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
attention the last p paragraph that
 
03:07:20.950 --> 03:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
you'll see that during the last fiscal
 
03:07:22.950 --> 03:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
year the Iota grants provided legal
 
03:07:24.349 --> 03:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
assistance for
 
03:07:28.150 --> 03:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
14,28 to individuals in our
 
03:07:31.349 --> 03:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
state it improves the life the the um
 
03:07:33.269 --> 03:07:33.279 align:start position:0%
access to Justice administration of
 
03:07:36.110 --> 03:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
justice but it also
 
03:07:39.870 --> 03:07:39.880 align:start position:0%
works directly with legal aid
 
03:07:42.070 --> 03:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
organizations that provide uh
 
03:07:44.429 --> 03:07:44.439 align:start position:0%
representation such as in the family
 
03:07:47.910 --> 03:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
court so it's an important aspect in the
 
03:07:50.710 --> 03:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh judicial system and on behalf of the
 
03:07:52.630 --> 03:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire bar Foundation we
 
03:07:54.150 --> 03:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask that you vote
 
03:07:56.790 --> 03:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate on this bill
 
03:07:58.510 --> 03:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions and I
 
03:08:01.229 --> 03:08:01.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time are there any
 
03:08:03.910 --> 03:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:08:07.229 --> 03:08:07.239 align:start position:0%
Horan so my um it looks like so
 
03:08:09.990 --> 03:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
basically what what you and Attorney
 
03:08:11.790 --> 03:08:11.800 align:start position:0%
Harris are saying who whose letter
 
03:08:14.110 --> 03:08:14.120 align:start position:0%
you're passing around is basically this
 
03:08:15.950 --> 03:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
this bill is unnecessary because a
 
03:08:18.110 --> 03:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
similar program has already been
 
03:08:21.070 --> 03:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
um been created by the bar foundation
 
03:08:23.110 --> 03:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
and mean I suppose you have the and so
 
03:08:25.269 --> 03:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
there's really no need to uh replace
 
03:08:27.429 --> 03:08:27.439 align:start position:0%
that with this government run program
 
03:08:32.190 --> 03:08:32.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:35.030 --> 03:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
bill I I I think the concern is to have
 
03:08:37.070 --> 03:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
a disruption in what is already in
 
03:08:38.990 --> 03:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
practice that that answer your question
 
03:08:40.870 --> 03:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
sir so the buyer Foundation has already
 
03:08:42.910 --> 03:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
set something like this up and and I
 
03:08:45.070 --> 03:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
guess it is voluntary if a lawyer wants
 
03:08:47.269 --> 03:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
to send out a check for dollar six to
 
03:08:49.349 --> 03:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
their client here she's free to do so
 
03:08:50.990 --> 03:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
but they this is obviously more
 
03:08:56.910 --> 03:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:59.349 --> 03:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
Smith representative Alexander thank you
 
03:09:00.550 --> 03:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for answering my
 
03:09:02.590 --> 03:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
question of course um
 
03:09:05.990 --> 03:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
I kind of what I what I saw was like in
 
03:09:07.550 --> 03:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
third paragraph at the last sentence
 
03:09:09.510 --> 03:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
it's unclear if this incentive would be
 
03:09:11.110 --> 03:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
available if Iola funds were diverted to
 
03:09:11.120 --> 03:09:12.630 align:start position:0%
available if Iola funds were diverted to
other

03:09:12.630 --> 03:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:09:15.150 --> 03:09:15.160 align:start position:0%
purposes is there like not a better
 
03:09:18.790 --> 03:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
purpose than Shoring up the you know
 
03:09:20.790 --> 03:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
underfunded public defenders office I
 
03:09:23.990 --> 03:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
guess I'm wondering like you like you
 
03:09:25.710 --> 03:09:25.720 align:start position:0%
believe that Banks
 
03:09:28.790 --> 03:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
would reduce the interest rates that
 
03:09:31.790 --> 03:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
they're offering for for these
 
03:09:34.950 --> 03:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
um these funds if the funds were
 
03:09:36.950 --> 03:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
diverted to the public defenders office
 
03:09:39.150 --> 03:09:39.160 align:start position:0%
you know that's a very good question and
 
03:09:41.349 --> 03:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
I and let me get back to you on that
 
03:09:43.469 --> 03:09:43.479 align:start position:0%
that is a very good question on that
 
03:09:45.389 --> 03:09:45.399 align:start position:0%
there question just just to follow up I
 
03:09:47.910 --> 03:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
mean I don't I don't see the nefarious
 
03:09:49.190 --> 03:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
public defenders office as being
 
03:09:50.389 --> 03:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
something where the banks would be like
 
03:09:52.910 --> 03:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
oh okay like we can't offer these
 
03:09:55.150 --> 03:09:55.160 align:start position:0%
payments anymore right thank you for the
 
03:09:57.429 --> 03:09:57.439 align:start position:0%
question any other questions
 
03:10:02.309 --> 03:10:02.319 align:start position:0%
representative Smith um do you see um IA
 
03:10:09.389 --> 03:10:09.399 align:start position:0%
funds um as a uh as a tax which is what
 
03:10:12.910 --> 03:10:12.920 align:start position:0%

ma would could would there be any
 
03:10:26.870 --> 03:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
possible reason to see this as a
 
03:10:30.030 --> 03:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
tax it frankly representative thank you
 
03:10:32.349 --> 03:10:32.359 align:start position:0%

funding that goes to the agencies that
 
03:10:51.710 --> 03:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
are funded and then Pro provide legal
 
03:10:55.150 --> 03:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
representation to Indigent clients that
 
03:10:57.349 --> 03:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
actually helps the court system does it
 
03:11:00.389 --> 03:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
not by assisting people who would
 
03:11:05.030 --> 03:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise be prosay in within the um
 
03:11:07.950 --> 03:11:07.960 align:start position:0%

with me was that say lians and family
 
03:11:23.110 --> 03:11:23.120 align:start position:0%

03:12:17.670 --> 03:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:20.750 --> 03:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair and members of the committee
 
03:12:24.790 --> 03:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
for the record um my name is Gail Kenny
 
03:12:27.429 --> 03:12:27.439 align:start position:0%
I am a clergy person with the United
 
03:12:30.750 --> 03:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
Church of Christ and I am a resident of
 
03:12:34.870 --> 03:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
Kanan New Hampshire but in another life
 
03:12:37.790 --> 03:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
um I worked for the New Hampshire Bar
 
03:12:40.830 --> 03:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
Association and I was present when the
 
03:12:45.510 --> 03:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
Ia program in New Hampshire was created
 
03:12:48.349 --> 03:12:48.359 align:start position:0%
and um my job at the time with the bar
 
03:12:52.510 --> 03:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
association was to to oversee and ensure
 
03:12:55.910 --> 03:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
the implementation of the Iola program
 
03:12:59.229 --> 03:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
and to oversee how the money was was
 
03:13:04.309 --> 03:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
spent and where it went so I am
 
03:13:07.349 --> 03:13:07.359 align:start position:0%
intimately familiar with the Iola
 
03:13:09.790 --> 03:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
program its purpose and its
 
03:13:12.190 --> 03:13:12.200 align:start position:0%
implementation and its use even though I
 
03:13:13.950 --> 03:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
have been away from it for a number of
 
03:13:17.670 --> 03:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
years at this point um this
 
03:13:20.670 --> 03:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
I think it's I would implore this
 
03:13:25.990 --> 03:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
committee before um voting on this bill
 
03:13:29.870 --> 03:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
to have a clear understanding of what
 
03:13:32.269 --> 03:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
the program is and what the bill is
 
03:13:35.150 --> 03:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
trying to do and what the implications
 
03:13:39.269 --> 03:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
of this bill is and I will say that my
 
03:13:42.550 --> 03:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
listening to the sponsor was the sponsor
 
03:13:45.630 --> 03:13:45.640 align:start position:0%
did not have a clear understanding of
 
03:13:48.870 --> 03:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
the program and purposes and from whence
 
03:13:52.510 --> 03:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
it came um uh let's just start off I
 
03:13:54.510 --> 03:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
will I want to address a representative
 
03:13:54.520 --> 03:13:55.710 align:start position:0%
will I want to address a representative
Smith's

03:13:55.710 --> 03:13:55.720 align:start position:0%
Smith's
 
03:13:58.429 --> 03:13:58.439 align:start position:0%
question the money that is created
 
03:14:02.590 --> 03:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
through the Iola program absent the
 
03:14:08.269 --> 03:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court rule in 1982 to create it
 
03:14:11.030 --> 03:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
um the money would not
 
03:14:15.070 --> 03:14:15.080 align:start position:0%
exist what um when lawyers in private
 
03:14:18.349 --> 03:14:18.359 align:start position:0%
practice hold funds for that are very
 
03:14:20.870 --> 03:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
minimal in amount or for a short period
 
03:14:23.469 --> 03:14:23.479 align:start position:0%
of time for example real estate closing
 
03:14:24.870 --> 03:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
where they might get a certain amount of
 
03:14:27.190 --> 03:14:27.200 align:start position:0%
money one day they turn it over the next
 
03:14:30.870 --> 03:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
day it stays in the bank only overnight
 
03:14:33.150 --> 03:14:33.160 align:start position:0%
um over the decades it had been
 
03:14:36.870 --> 03:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
recognized that small amounts of money
 
03:14:39.550 --> 03:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
held by attorneys or money held for a
 
03:14:42.910 --> 03:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
short period of time would not generate
 
03:14:45.910 --> 03:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
enough interest in order to make it U
 
03:14:48.309 --> 03:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
financially feasible and beneficial to
 
03:14:52.830 --> 03:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
the client for that money to be um put
 
03:14:54.670 --> 03:14:54.680 align:start position:0%
into a separate account for the benefit
 
03:14:56.429 --> 03:14:56.439 align:start position:0%
of the client so the client could earn
 
03:14:59.429 --> 03:14:59.439 align:start position:0%
interest for example they could earn $5
 
03:15:02.830 --> 03:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
of interest and yet for the cost to um
 
03:15:05.389 --> 03:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
that would be built to the client for
 
03:15:07.910 --> 03:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
creating the account monitoring the
 
03:15:10.389 --> 03:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
account closing the account and then
 
03:15:12.190 --> 03:15:12.200 align:start position:0%
turning the money back over to the
 
03:15:15.790 --> 03:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
client far far far would exceed the
 
03:15:18.790 --> 03:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
amount of interest that was created so
 
03:15:22.309 --> 03:15:22.319 align:start position:0%
over the years lawyers put that money in
 
03:15:25.150 --> 03:15:25.160 align:start position:0%
noninterest bearing accounts that's
 
03:15:26.910 --> 03:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
where that shortterm a small amount of
 
03:15:31.469 --> 03:15:31.479 align:start position:0%
money always existed no money was
 
03:15:34.469 --> 03:15:34.479 align:start position:0%
created but the I ala rule from the
 
03:15:37.389 --> 03:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court said it's okay for
 
03:15:40.110 --> 03:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
attorneys to pull those small amounts or
 
03:15:42.950 --> 03:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
short-term amounts into a single
 
03:15:46.150 --> 03:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
interest bearing account as long as the
 
03:15:48.229 --> 03:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
interest goes
 
03:15:51.429 --> 03:15:51.439 align:start position:0%
solely for civil legal services for the
 
03:15:54.150 --> 03:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
Civil legal services for the poor or
 
03:15:56.269 --> 03:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
other public information about the law
 
03:15:59.110 --> 03:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
and the legal system so it is creating
 
03:16:02.389 --> 03:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
money that would not exist it is not a
 
03:16:04.750 --> 03:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
tax on
 
03:16:07.790 --> 03:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
anybody it is not money that that the
 
03:16:09.950 --> 03:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
government had to begin with the
 
03:16:12.510 --> 03:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
government had a say over it's money
 
03:16:14.389 --> 03:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
that otherwise would not exist without
 
03:16:17.670 --> 03:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
that Supreme Court rule so
 
03:16:20.189 --> 03:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
this built and to me creates two
 
03:16:22.429 --> 03:16:22.439 align:start position:0%
significant concerns the first one is
 
03:16:26.150 --> 03:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional the Iola program oh first
 
03:16:28.670 --> 03:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court has
 
03:16:31.750 --> 03:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
Regulatory and supervisory authority
 
03:16:33.910 --> 03:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
over the legal profession in New
 
03:16:37.030 --> 03:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and as part of exercising its
 
03:16:40.349 --> 03:16:40.359 align:start position:0%
Regulatory and supervisory Authority it
 
03:16:43.349 --> 03:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
set up rule um through rule 50 of the
 
03:16:46.349 --> 03:16:46.359 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and uh the rule 50 I
 
03:16:48.349 --> 03:16:48.359 align:start position:0%
attached to my testimony so that
 
03:16:51.269 --> 03:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
everybody can see it
 
03:16:54.870 --> 03:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
created uh the Iola program the second
 
03:16:56.670 --> 03:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
state in the nation to create it the
 
03:16:58.510 --> 03:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
first was Florida then the Florida
 
03:17:01.510 --> 03:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court chief justice um visited
 
03:17:03.550 --> 03:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to explain the program to
 
03:17:06.110 --> 03:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the Supreme Court
 
03:17:10.030 --> 03:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
after much um a thorough research of
 
03:17:13.070 --> 03:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
what the implications were um created
 
03:17:16.910 --> 03:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
the rule in 1982 um to um create the
 
03:17:22.030 --> 03:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
program so the bill 253 says in essence
 
03:17:26.630 --> 03:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
is saying that um it is going to just
 
03:17:29.550 --> 03:17:29.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely ignore the Supreme Court rule
 
03:17:32.389 --> 03:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
and the Supreme Court um regulatory
 
03:17:35.790 --> 03:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
authority over the bar and and to say
 
03:17:39.030 --> 03:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
that the Supreme Court no longer has any
 
03:17:40.870 --> 03:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
authority to direct where this money
 
03:17:44.429 --> 03:17:44.439 align:start position:0%
should go the jurisdictional question is
 
03:17:46.309 --> 03:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
what is in the legislative purview what
 
03:17:48.229 --> 03:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
is in the executive purview what is in
 
03:17:50.990 --> 03:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
the Court's purview three co-equal
 
03:17:54.469 --> 03:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
branches of government this bill usurps
 
03:17:57.229 --> 03:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
and ignores and sets a precedent that
 
03:17:59.950 --> 03:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
the legislature seizes for itself
 
03:18:02.070 --> 03:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
regulatory authority over the Supreme
 
03:18:04.349 --> 03:18:04.359 align:start position:0%
Court you really need to think long and
 
03:18:06.469 --> 03:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
hard about whether or not this is
 
03:18:08.110 --> 03:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
something that the legislature should be
 
03:18:11.309 --> 03:18:11.319 align:start position:0%
weighing into and doing um the second
 
03:18:13.630 --> 03:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
thing is
 
03:18:18.070 --> 03:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
moral paying for criminal
 
03:18:20.510 --> 03:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
legal services for the poor for Indigent
 
03:18:23.229 --> 03:18:23.239 align:start position:0%
defense the public defender program is a
 
03:18:25.790 --> 03:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirement through the
 
03:18:28.670 --> 03:18:28.680 align:start position:0%
sixth and the 14th amend amendment is
 
03:18:31.830 --> 03:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
constitutionally required for the state
 
03:18:35.710 --> 03:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
to pay for Indigent criminal defense as
 
03:18:38.229 --> 03:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
provided um by the public defender
 
03:18:40.870 --> 03:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
program and then some other um attorneys
 
03:18:43.670 --> 03:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
it is a state responsibility the state
 
03:18:46.469 --> 03:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
has zero responsibility to provide civil
 
03:18:50.590 --> 03:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
Le services for the poor and yet access
 
03:18:53.550 --> 03:18:53.560 align:start position:0%
to Justice will not happen in the state
 
03:18:56.309 --> 03:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire unless people in Civil
 
03:19:00.429 --> 03:19:00.439 align:start position:0%
Court have access to attorneys to to
 
03:19:00.439 --> 03:19:01.469 align:start position:0%
Court have access to attorneys to to
legal

03:19:01.469 --> 03:19:01.479 align:start position:0%
legal
 
03:19:03.670 --> 03:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
representation that's what the iila
 
03:19:08.229 --> 03:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
program does uh provides that and so if
 
03:19:10.790 --> 03:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass and you take away
 
03:19:13.830 --> 03:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
all that money $1 to2 million a year
 
03:19:16.790 --> 03:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
providing civil legal services to the
 
03:19:19.030 --> 03:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
poorest people in the state of New
 
03:19:22.150 --> 03:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um morally what are you going
 
03:19:24.030 --> 03:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
to replace that with you're just taking
 
03:19:26.830 --> 03:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
it away completely so now the the poor
 
03:19:29.110 --> 03:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that are trying to you
 
03:19:32.229 --> 03:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
know um tenants with um with evictions
 
03:19:34.309 --> 03:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
or people in abuse cases that
 
03:19:36.990 --> 03:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
desperately need legal services are no
 
03:19:38.950 --> 03:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
longer going to have that funding
 
03:19:41.389 --> 03:19:41.399 align:start position:0%
because this bill has taken it away
 
03:19:43.910 --> 03:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
there's a moral responsibility of of
 
03:19:45.630 --> 03:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
this committee and the legislature
 
03:19:48.389 --> 03:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
determine what happens to all those
 
03:19:51.510 --> 03:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
people if this bill were to pass
 
03:19:55.469 --> 03:19:55.479 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional moral I implore you to
 
03:19:58.510 --> 03:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
find this inexpedient to legislate that
 
03:20:01.229 --> 03:20:01.239 align:start position:0%
it's not understood by the sponsors and
 
03:20:03.870 --> 03:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
it is just it would be a travesty to to
 
03:20:07.590 --> 03:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
weigh into this representative Alexander
 
03:20:09.309 --> 03:20:09.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you I'm right
 
03:20:11.590 --> 03:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
here thank you for taking my question
 
03:20:13.150 --> 03:20:13.160 align:start position:0%
and um your testimony was really
 
03:20:14.550 --> 03:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
valuable to understand this a little
 
03:20:16.790 --> 03:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
better um I understand your
 
03:20:18.510 --> 03:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional question but the moral
 
03:20:20.790 --> 03:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
one I'm kind of hung up about because
 
03:20:24.510 --> 03:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you agree that criminal cases
 
03:20:27.990 --> 03:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
and the government's um like the
 
03:20:30.590 --> 03:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
legislator's responsibility to fund
 
03:20:32.429 --> 03:20:32.439 align:start position:0%
under the under the Constitution would
 
03:20:37.269 --> 03:20:37.279 align:start position:0%
be more of a of a moral obligation than
 
03:20:40.429 --> 03:20:40.439 align:start position:0%
funding civil cases I guess I guess I'm
 
03:20:42.030 --> 03:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm confused with the the
 
03:20:43.469 --> 03:20:43.479 align:start position:0%
stretch I think you're stretching it a
 
03:20:48.790 --> 03:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:50.469 --> 03:20:50.479 align:start position:0%
I don't think you pit one against the
 
03:20:52.510 --> 03:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
other first of all I I would you
 
03:20:55.510 --> 03:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
prioritize them right I'm just asking no
 
03:20:59.150 --> 03:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
access to justice is access to Justice
 
03:21:00.830 --> 03:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
whether you're in criminal court or
 
03:21:04.229 --> 03:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
whether you're in Civil Court morally
 
03:21:07.229 --> 03:21:07.239 align:start position:0%
the entire population when they come up
 
03:21:09.630 --> 03:21:09.640 align:start position:0%
against things which are legal in
 
03:21:11.990 --> 03:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
concept and for which representation
 
03:21:14.349 --> 03:21:14.359 align:start position:0%
would make a difference in their lives
 
03:21:17.750 --> 03:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
there is no difference the difference
 
03:21:20.670 --> 03:21:20.680 align:start position:0%
between um Justice for criminal
 
03:21:23.189 --> 03:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
defendants and justice for people in
 
03:21:26.189 --> 03:21:26.199 align:start position:0%
civil court access to justice is access
 
03:21:29.189 --> 03:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
to Justice period the difference is and
 
03:21:31.670 --> 03:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
the only difference is it is a
 
03:21:31.680 --> 03:21:33.870 align:start position:0%
the only difference is it is a
constitutional

03:21:33.870 --> 03:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
03:21:39.750 --> 03:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
requirement for um people to have um
 
03:21:42.309 --> 03:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
access to defense in Criminal Court
 
03:21:44.510 --> 03:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
there's no constitutional requirement in
 
03:21:47.469 --> 03:21:47.479 align:start position:0%
regards to civil court
 
03:21:49.630 --> 03:21:49.640 align:start position:0%
representative McFarland thank you Mr
 
03:21:51.630 --> 03:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you to the Reverend
 
03:21:54.229 --> 03:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
Kenny for your persuasive testimony and
 
03:21:55.429 --> 03:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
it's it's a pleasure to see one of my
 
03:21:58.590 --> 03:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
constituents here I I just want to ask
 
03:22:00.189 --> 03:22:00.199 align:start position:0%
you know I I think that representative
 
03:22:02.630 --> 03:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
Alexander raises some valid
 
03:22:05.830 --> 03:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
concerns um around what the the sort of
 
03:22:07.870 --> 03:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
the moral uh what the greater moral
 
03:22:09.750 --> 03:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
issue is what the moral equivalence is
 
03:22:12.110 --> 03:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
uh of where these funds are directed but
 
03:22:13.110 --> 03:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
even if
 
03:22:16.269 --> 03:22:16.279 align:start position:0%
you say okay we we we should be fully
 
03:22:18.870 --> 03:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
fun funding the public defender office
 
03:22:20.429 --> 03:22:20.439 align:start position:0%
uh from the state budget and we should
 
03:22:23.309 --> 03:22:23.319 align:start position:0%
be focusing here on civil Legal Services
 
03:22:26.150 --> 03:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
if you're sympathetic to the sponsors
 
03:22:29.309 --> 03:22:29.319 align:start position:0%
concerns that some of these civil legal
 
03:22:32.830 --> 03:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
organizations uh have a partisan nature
 
03:22:37.790 --> 03:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
to them can you represent or recommend
 
03:22:40.030 --> 03:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
uh your point of view around what civil
 
03:22:43.229 --> 03:22:43.239 align:start position:0%
Legal Services organizations exist that
 
03:22:51.670 --> 03:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:51.680 --> 03:22:53.590 align:start position:0%
 
I'm

03:22:53.590 --> 03:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
03:22:56.590 --> 03:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
not totally fully I I I think I
 
03:22:58.630 --> 03:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying I'm not
 
03:23:00.710 --> 03:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
fully ask more
 
03:23:03.910 --> 03:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
simply if if we were to say instead of
 
03:23:05.670 --> 03:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
saying we're going to redirect These
 
03:23:07.269 --> 03:23:07.279 align:start position:0%
funds to the public defender if we were
 
03:23:08.510 --> 03:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
to say we're going to redirect them to
 
03:23:10.189 --> 03:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
an organization that's focused on civil
 
03:23:12.309 --> 03:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
Legal Services what should that
 
03:23:12.319 --> 03:23:14.990 align:start position:0%
Legal Services what should that
organization

03:23:14.990 --> 03:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:17.870 --> 03:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
be there are multiple organizations in
 
03:23:19.990 --> 03:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that provide um civil
 
03:23:23.990 --> 03:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
legal services to to the poor um and I
 
03:23:26.510 --> 03:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
don't have the current list of of who is
 
03:23:30.110 --> 03:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
getting um Ulta money
 
03:23:35.469 --> 03:23:35.479 align:start position:0%
um however I will tell you that in 1982
 
03:23:39.389 --> 03:23:39.399 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court very very very
 
03:23:41.950 --> 03:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
carefully studied what the implications
 
03:23:44.349 --> 03:23:44.359 align:start position:0%
would be and where this money would go
 
03:23:45.910 --> 03:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
and since that time through the New
 
03:23:47.630 --> 03:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire bar Association which is
 
03:23:49.670 --> 03:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
directed by the Supreme Court to oversee
 
03:23:52.910 --> 03:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
the Iola program they too look very
 
03:23:55.269 --> 03:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
carefully at where the money is going
 
03:23:58.110 --> 03:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
what is being used for it is not being
 
03:24:00.189 --> 03:24:00.199 align:start position:0%
used for political purposes it is not
 
03:24:02.790 --> 03:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
being used for lobbying purposes it is
 
03:24:05.229 --> 03:24:05.239 align:start position:0%
used for the purpose of helping
 
03:24:08.110 --> 03:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
individuals have their day in court in
 
03:24:10.950 --> 03:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
civil cases with the representation they
 
03:24:13.950 --> 03:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
need in order to achieve Justice it is
 
03:24:16.510 --> 03:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
so carefully controlled and overse
 
03:24:20.750 --> 03:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
seeing that that um
 
03:24:25.429 --> 03:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
it's well I'm sorry not go on but
 
03:24:28.630 --> 03:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
it's concerns what you're hinting at
 
03:24:31.150 --> 03:24:31.160 align:start position:0%
have been addressed and they are
 
03:24:33.750 --> 03:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
concerns shared by the Supreme Court and
 
03:24:35.710 --> 03:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
if the Supreme Court quite frankly in
 
03:24:38.950 --> 03:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
its regulatory wisdom had any hint or
 
03:24:42.229 --> 03:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
any feeling that there were issues they
 
03:24:44.189 --> 03:24:44.199 align:start position:0%
would take a look at their Rule and
 
03:24:47.150 --> 03:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
their regulation and their oversight
 
03:24:50.510 --> 03:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
authority over this program and Over the
 
03:24:53.710 --> 03:24:53.720 align:start position:0%
Bar and would make any changes necessary
 
03:24:55.790 --> 03:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any other
 
03:24:59.389 --> 03:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank
 
03:25:09.590 --> 03:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:11.550 --> 03:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
krian good afternoon members of the
 
03:25:12.950 --> 03:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Aaron krian general
 
03:25:18.510 --> 03:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:21.189 --> 03:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
um wanted to uh come up and discuss this
 
03:25:23.830 --> 03:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
with you if you had any questions about
 
03:25:26.070 --> 03:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
um the role of the courts with Iola it
 
03:25:28.269 --> 03:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
is currently Supreme Court rule 50 that
 
03:25:30.670 --> 03:25:30.680 align:start position:0%
lays out how IA funds are collected and
 
03:25:31.950 --> 03:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
it turns them over to the bar to
 
03:25:34.550 --> 03:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
disperse I think as you hear up to about
 
03:25:36.670 --> 03:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
$2 million which goes I believe
 
03:25:39.030 --> 03:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
predominantly to civil legal aid
 
03:25:41.150 --> 03:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
organizations um when folks come to the
 
03:25:42.910 --> 03:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
courts and it's not a criminal matter
 
03:25:43.790 --> 03:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
they're not seeking criminal
 
03:25:46.070 --> 03:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
representation it is very common that
 
03:25:49.070 --> 03:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
they ask us how do I get a lawyer I or I
 
03:25:51.910 --> 03:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
can't afford one what do I do um we are
 
03:25:53.590 --> 03:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
often referring them letting them know
 
03:25:56.830 --> 03:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
that these civil a organizations exist
 
03:25:58.990 --> 03:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
um it is something that I hear very
 
03:26:00.790 --> 03:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
frequently from legislators that they
 
03:26:02.389 --> 03:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
have concern about how large the
 
03:26:03.830 --> 03:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
self-represented population in New
 
03:26:06.510 --> 03:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is um and I think you also see
 
03:26:09.189 --> 03:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
a kind of legislative drift over time to
 
03:26:12.269 --> 03:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
increase the number of subjects that
 
03:26:13.750 --> 03:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
there is mandatory statutory
 
03:26:15.510 --> 03:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
representation for not constitutional
 
03:26:17.710 --> 03:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
like criminal but mandatory statutory
 
03:26:20.030 --> 03:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
that was just increased again um for
 
03:26:22.469 --> 03:26:22.479 align:start position:0%
children in residential proceedings last
 
03:26:24.030 --> 03:26:24.040 align:start position:0%
year by the by the legislature to
 
03:26:25.750 --> 03:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
increase mandatory representation by
 
03:26:28.110 --> 03:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
attorneys so I I hear your concern about
 
03:26:29.349 --> 03:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
people being represented I hear your
 
03:26:30.550 --> 03:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
concern about funding the public
 
03:26:32.030 --> 03:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
defender program and making sure that
 
03:26:34.309 --> 03:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
people have lawyers in other contexts
 
03:26:36.150 --> 03:26:36.160 align:start position:0%
because I think you do hear from your
 
03:26:37.870 --> 03:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
constituents that they are very scared
 
03:26:39.910 --> 03:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
to go to court sometimes um even in
 
03:26:42.630 --> 03:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
situations where they don't have a a
 
03:26:44.429 --> 03:26:44.439 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to a lawyer or
 
03:26:45.950 --> 03:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
where they don't have a statutory right
 
03:26:48.870 --> 03:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
to a lawyer um so I hear the the the
 
03:26:51.870 --> 03:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
concerns on on both sides for this issue
 
03:26:53.990 --> 03:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
um one thing I might suggest is that um
 
03:26:57.189 --> 03:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
you know folks may not know that it is
 
03:27:00.150 --> 03:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
actually uh a democratic process to be
 
03:27:01.670 --> 03:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
involved with the Supreme Court's rules
 
03:27:04.910 --> 03:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
under the very next rule uh rule 51 any
 
03:27:06.590 --> 03:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
person in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:27:08.510 --> 03:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
member of the public a lawyer can
 
03:27:10.990 --> 03:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
propose a change to as a Supreme Court
 
03:27:13.229 --> 03:27:13.239 align:start position:0%
rule or any Court rule um I think this
 
03:27:14.870 --> 03:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
is completely underutilized and I think
 
03:27:16.550 --> 03:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
we'd love to hear from folks more more
 
03:27:18.990 --> 03:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
about whether they would want to change
 
03:27:20.229 --> 03:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
these rules or whether they feel that
 
03:27:22.550 --> 03:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
they're working but um one thing I might
 
03:27:24.189 --> 03:27:24.199 align:start position:0%
just put to your consideration and this
 
03:27:26.349 --> 03:27:26.359 align:start position:0%
just one thing to think is it could be
 
03:27:28.510 --> 03:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
confusing to have a a legislative
 
03:27:29.750 --> 03:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
provision that says one thing and a
 
03:27:32.070 --> 03:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court rule it says another um it
 
03:27:33.790 --> 03:27:33.800 align:start position:0%
it might be something better to work
 
03:27:35.110 --> 03:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
together on and invite anyone who's
 
03:27:37.550 --> 03:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
interested to come and perhaps pitch a
 
03:27:39.429 --> 03:27:39.439 align:start position:0%
change to that rule through the rule 51
 
03:27:40.910 --> 03:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
process which really is just sending an
 
03:27:42.189 --> 03:27:42.199 align:start position:0%
email and if you have any trouble with
 
03:27:43.830 --> 03:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
it feel free to reach out to me and I'm
 
03:27:45.469 --> 03:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
happy to help so that we can kind of
 
03:27:47.790 --> 03:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
bring all the different thoughts on IA
 
03:27:49.229 --> 03:27:49.239 align:start position:0%
into one process um you know
 
03:27:51.070 --> 03:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn when he's not in
 
03:27:53.950 --> 03:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
Vietnam or somewhere uh sits on that
 
03:27:55.910 --> 03:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
committee I think other legislators do
 
03:27:57.750 --> 03:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
as well so it's something that we we
 
03:27:59.349 --> 03:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
welcome legislative interaction with as
 
03:28:01.710 --> 03:28:01.720 align:start position:0%
well representative Alexander thank you
 
03:28:04.750 --> 03:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss kran for being here is it
 
03:28:07.309 --> 03:28:07.319 align:start position:0%
I I I guess I maybe I'm a new legislator
 
03:28:09.950 --> 03:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
and I what's the process for getting an
 
03:28:12.429 --> 03:28:12.439 align:start position:0%
opinion from the court relative to if
 
03:28:14.670 --> 03:28:14.680 align:start position:0%
fulta fund should be used
 
03:28:18.710 --> 03:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
for criminal Legal Services as well
 
03:28:20.030 --> 03:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
great question I think typically I
 
03:28:21.870 --> 03:28:21.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't try to give you a policy
 
03:28:24.349 --> 03:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
opinion um you know we we do try to be
 
03:28:26.030 --> 03:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
restrained in in in making a suggestion
 
03:28:27.950 --> 03:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
to on policy should you have new
 
03:28:30.590 --> 03:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
statutory civil representation rights
 
03:28:32.189 --> 03:28:32.199 align:start position:0%
should you you know fund one
 
03:28:33.870 --> 03:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
organization or another I I wouldn't
 
03:28:35.510 --> 03:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
want to give advice on that because I
 
03:28:36.750 --> 03:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
know that's a role that the legislature
 
03:28:40.030 --> 03:28:40.040 align:start position:0%
is very predominant in um so that's
 
03:28:42.030 --> 03:28:42.040 align:start position:0%
that's a tough one for me to answer if
 
03:28:43.630 --> 03:28:43.640 align:start position:0%
you're asking about legal questions
 
03:28:45.429 --> 03:28:45.439 align:start position:0%
there is a process in our constitution
 
03:28:47.750 --> 03:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
for the legislature to send a legal
 
03:28:49.110 --> 03:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
question over to the justices of the
 
03:28:51.550 --> 03:28:51.560 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court another thing that I think
 
03:28:53.870 --> 03:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
was great to use whenever you have a
 
03:28:55.389 --> 03:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
question as a body that you would like
 
03:28:57.790 --> 03:28:57.800 align:start position:0%
to refer to them as a legal matter but
 
03:28:59.469 --> 03:28:59.479 align:start position:0%
really participation in this process is
 
03:29:01.550 --> 03:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
open it's it's about making a suggestion
 
03:29:03.550 --> 03:29:03.560 align:start position:0%
through rule 51 and then it's it's
 
03:29:04.710 --> 03:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
debated with the people who participate
 
03:29:06.110 --> 03:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
in rules as well as any member of the
 
03:29:08.189 --> 03:29:08.199 align:start position:0%
public who wants to participate
 
03:29:11.990 --> 03:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative McFarland thank you Mr
 
03:29:14.870 --> 03:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
chairman listening to the the previous
 
03:29:18.110 --> 03:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
testimony uh do you have a point of view
 
03:29:21.830 --> 03:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
as to the governance that exists uh in
 
03:29:24.830 --> 03:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
furtherance of the Supreme Court rule 50
 
03:29:28.110 --> 03:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
and whether or not there may be an issue
 
03:29:31.550 --> 03:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
to address with regard to the specific
 
03:29:33.469 --> 03:29:33.479 align:start position:0%
nature of the organizations that those
 
03:29:35.349 --> 03:29:35.359 align:start position:0%
funds are currently being distributed to
 
03:29:36.870 --> 03:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
and and the actions that they're taking
 
03:29:39.429 --> 03:29:39.439 align:start position:0%
with them to to give only factual
 
03:29:41.710 --> 03:29:41.720 align:start position:0%
information that I hold I I would hate
 
03:29:43.790 --> 03:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
to not know something that would be
 
03:29:46.710 --> 03:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
important to you I I believe that these
 
03:29:49.269 --> 03:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
organizations are 501c3 so they're not
 
03:29:51.550 --> 03:29:51.560 align:start position:0%
donating to political parties or persons
 
03:29:54.229 --> 03:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
or campaigns they may for example come
 
03:29:56.469 --> 03:29:56.479 align:start position:0%
to the legislature and speak to you
 
03:29:57.830 --> 03:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
about the concerns and the things that
 
03:29:59.630 --> 03:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
they observe in the course of doing that
 
03:30:02.630 --> 03:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
work um so I I I don't say that to say
 
03:30:04.870 --> 03:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
that they're a person could not have a
 
03:30:05.990 --> 03:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
concern that they would want to bring
 
03:30:08.389 --> 03:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
forward to discuss more I'm certainly
 
03:30:10.750 --> 03:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
happy to hear that but I I think there
 
03:30:13.349 --> 03:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
are legal bars to the extent of the
 
03:30:15.349 --> 03:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
different activities that that these
 
03:30:15.359 --> 03:30:16.750 align:start position:0%
different activities that that these
organizations

03:30:16.750 --> 03:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
03:30:19.990 --> 03:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
take thank you any other
 
03:30:23.030 --> 03:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Smith just
 
03:30:25.309 --> 03:30:25.319 align:start position:0%
following up let me just use an example
 
03:30:27.790 --> 03:30:27.800 align:start position:0%
of an organization that I'm quite
 
03:30:31.070 --> 03:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
familiar with um the disabilities rights
 
03:30:34.830 --> 03:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
Center um isn't it
 
03:30:38.630 --> 03:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
possible that some member of the
 
03:30:43.030 --> 03:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
legislature might believe that people
 
03:30:43.040 --> 03:30:44.229 align:start position:0%
legislature might believe that people
with

03:30:44.229 --> 03:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:30:47.429 --> 03:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
disabilities should not not be
 
03:30:51.870 --> 03:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
entitled to certain civil
 
03:30:55.389 --> 03:30:55.399 align:start position:0%
protections and uh whereas the whole
 
03:30:57.990 --> 03:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of the DRC
 
03:31:03.950 --> 03:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
funded as as it is um does believe that
 
03:31:06.349 --> 03:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
that people with disabilities should be
 
03:31:09.229 --> 03:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
entitled and is it possible then that A
 
03:31:14.070 --> 03:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
legislature might see that decision as
 
03:31:17.670 --> 03:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
political rather than constitutional
 
03:31:17.680 --> 03:31:19.550 align:start position:0%
political rather than constitutional
statutory

03:31:19.550 --> 03:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
03:31:19.560 --> 03:31:21.550 align:start position:0%
statutory
and

03:31:21.550 --> 03:31:21.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:31:23.950 --> 03:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
legitimate I believe you have given me a
 
03:31:26.349 --> 03:31:26.359 align:start position:0%
rhetorical question representative Smith
 
03:31:30.229 --> 03:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
of course I have and and I I I I think
 
03:31:33.990 --> 03:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
that um with within uh the court system
 
03:31:35.389 --> 03:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
you are famous for your excellent
 
03:31:36.950 --> 03:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
questions and I I thank you for them
 
03:31:39.030 --> 03:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
they're very good questions uh you know
 
03:31:41.389 --> 03:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
legislators they have different views on
 
03:31:42.429 --> 03:31:42.439 align:start position:0%
what's important and what they want to
 
03:31:44.189 --> 03:31:44.199 align:start position:0%
bring forward as as a part of the public
 
03:31:45.309 --> 03:31:45.319 align:start position:0%
concern and I would never want to
 
03:31:47.229 --> 03:31:47.239 align:start position:0%
discourage any legislator from bringing
 
03:31:49.790 --> 03:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
forward a concern that they have it's
 
03:31:51.150 --> 03:31:51.160 align:start position:0%
very frequent in the court system when
 
03:31:52.910 --> 03:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
we do get comments on our rules that we
 
03:31:54.150 --> 03:31:54.160 align:start position:0%
hear that people think that they are not
 
03:31:55.469 --> 03:31:55.479 align:start position:0%
working and they want to change them and
 
03:31:57.110 --> 03:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
they're changed every year the rules are
 
03:31:58.349 --> 03:31:58.359 align:start position:0%
changed every year in response to
 
03:32:01.189 --> 03:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
people's concerns so if someone has a
 
03:32:02.389 --> 03:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
concern they want to bring forward I'm
 
03:32:03.830 --> 03:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
not trying to discourage them but yes
 
03:32:05.790 --> 03:32:05.800 align:start position:0%
people can disagree about the meaning of
 
03:32:07.950 --> 03:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
a word like political which may mean
 
03:32:09.269 --> 03:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
different things to different people in
 
03:32:11.070 --> 03:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
different context I will tell you as
 
03:32:12.990 --> 03:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
someone who also serves as the Ada
 
03:32:16.309 --> 03:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the judicial branch um
 
03:32:17.950 --> 03:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
questions for Ada representation are
 
03:32:20.229 --> 03:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
common and I am I am commonly referring
 
03:32:22.670 --> 03:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
people because we cannot be their lawyer
 
03:32:25.229 --> 03:32:25.239 align:start position:0%
and be their court system I am commonly
 
03:32:28.070 --> 03:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
telling them here somewhere you can go
 
03:32:29.510 --> 03:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
if you need someone to be your lawyer
 
03:32:31.070 --> 03:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
not help you with your accommodations
 
03:32:32.990 --> 03:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
process as a neutral government official
 
03:32:35.910 --> 03:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
but advocate for you um here's here's a
 
03:32:37.750 --> 03:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
place that you can go to get those
 
03:32:41.790 --> 03:32:41.800 align:start position:0%
Services thank you representative Horgan
 
03:32:44.349 --> 03:32:44.359 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much this most may be
 
03:32:46.030 --> 03:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
somewhat rhetorical question too but
 
03:32:48.229 --> 03:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
like there was an example given the
 
03:32:49.630 --> 03:32:49.640 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor was objecting to the
 
03:32:51.950 --> 03:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center because I'm not
 
03:32:53.750 --> 03:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
sure what the story was exactly but
 
03:32:56.550 --> 03:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
apparently they had sued somebody
 
03:32:58.349 --> 03:32:58.359 align:start position:0%
because the handicap door had been
 
03:33:00.269 --> 03:33:00.279 align:start position:0%
blocked for some period of time that he
 
03:33:02.229 --> 03:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
felt was too short to be problem with
 
03:33:03.750 --> 03:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
but first of all do you do you know from
 
03:33:04.750 --> 03:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
your experience of a lawyer with the
 
03:33:07.229 --> 03:33:07.239 align:start position:0%
just ran so first of all one party's
 
03:33:10.990 --> 03:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
view of a situation may something may
 
03:33:12.670 --> 03:33:12.680 align:start position:0%
seem trivial to one side of the dispute
 
03:33:14.510 --> 03:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
may like Loom large for other people and
 
03:33:16.070 --> 03:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
also it's a related thing off don't
 
03:33:18.110 --> 03:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
people often sometimes bring complaints
 
03:33:20.269 --> 03:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
based on one incident but that's it's
 
03:33:21.630 --> 03:33:21.640 align:start position:0%
motivated because there's a larger
 
03:33:24.950 --> 03:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
pattern of conduct which they find uh
 
03:33:26.269 --> 03:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
they find objectional and that could
 
03:33:28.070 --> 03:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
certainly and that probably turns up a
 
03:33:31.830 --> 03:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
lot in U you know Ada type cases like
 
03:33:34.189 --> 03:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
what the DRC deals with and and I
 
03:33:36.030 --> 03:33:36.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't um I wouldn't say that I have a
 
03:33:37.710 --> 03:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
very good knowledge of all of the types
 
03:33:39.510 --> 03:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
of suits that uh disability rights
 
03:33:40.790 --> 03:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
Center brings I certainly think it's
 
03:33:42.309 --> 03:33:42.319 align:start position:0%
accurate that they are assisting people
 
03:33:45.510 --> 03:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
to sue in situations in which disability
 
03:33:47.510 --> 03:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
right may have been violated that's I
 
03:33:49.189 --> 03:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
think that's exactly this the purpose of
 
03:33:51.429 --> 03:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
the organization but what I would want
 
03:33:53.429 --> 03:33:53.439 align:start position:0%
to say is if if folks have concerns
 
03:33:55.150 --> 03:33:55.160 align:start position:0%
about the transparency or about the
 
03:33:57.110 --> 03:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
distribution of these funds I'm not
 
03:33:58.990 --> 03:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
trying to discourage them I think you
 
03:33:59.950 --> 03:33:59.960 align:start position:0%
know we we want to have the
 
03:34:01.950 --> 03:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
participation of the bar and the public
 
03:34:04.150 --> 03:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
in the work of the courts and so I it's
 
03:34:05.750 --> 03:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
not something where I'd say don't bring
 
03:34:08.309 --> 03:34:08.319 align:start position:0%
that forward I'd say let's bring it all
 
03:34:11.150 --> 03:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
maybe into one track and and have that
 
03:34:13.269 --> 03:34:13.279 align:start position:0%
conversation representative Alexander
 
03:34:15.189 --> 03:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
just real quick I think um what would be
 
03:34:18.150 --> 03:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
valuable for the committee is if um the
 
03:34:20.870 --> 03:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
funding and where it goes is sent to the
 
03:34:23.189 --> 03:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
committee like uh I think that it's
 
03:34:25.389 --> 03:34:25.399 align:start position:0%
available to get it's publicly available
 
03:34:27.429 --> 03:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
if I I think if you can help us track
 
03:34:29.269 --> 03:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
that down that'd be
 
03:34:31.269 --> 03:34:31.279 align:start position:0%
great any other
 
03:34:34.269 --> 03:34:34.279 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank
 
03:34:36.670 --> 03:34:36.680 align:start position:0%
you I do not have any more pink cards
 
03:34:39.990 --> 03:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
for House Bill 253 is there anyone that
 
03:34:41.550 --> 03:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak on it that hasn't filled
 
03:34:42.870 --> 03:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
out a card
 
03:34:45.189 --> 03:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
yet seeing none I'm going to close the
 
03:34:46.950 --> 03:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
03:34:49.389 --> 03:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
253 and I'm going to open up the hearing
 
03:34:52.630 --> 03:34:52.640 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 391 and recognize the
 
03:35:01.189 --> 03:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:04.990 --> 03:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
Corrin take take a few minutes
 
03:35:21.469 --> 03:35:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:47.189 --> 03:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:48.830 --> 03:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
representative corkran if you could fill
 
03:35:50.590 --> 03:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
out a pink card at ear's convenience too
 
03:36:00.070 --> 03:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:00.080 --> 03:36:02.189 align:start position:0%
 
great

03:36:02.189 --> 03:36:02.199 align:start position:0%
great
 
03:36:04.990 --> 03:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
welcome thank
 
03:36:09.150 --> 03:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you um so
 
03:36:12.269 --> 03:36:12.279 align:start position:0%
uh there is a phrase that you know um
 
03:36:14.269 --> 03:36:14.279 align:start position:0%
when an idea you know nothing can stand
 
03:36:16.269 --> 03:36:16.279 align:start position:0%
against an idea when it's time has
 
03:36:18.429 --> 03:36:18.439 align:start position:0%
and so I keep bringing this uh Bill back
 
03:36:19.870 --> 03:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
year after year and one of these years
 
03:36:22.349 --> 03:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
we'll find out that its time has come so
 
03:36:24.750 --> 03:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
um I muster a lot of uh support last
 
03:36:26.710 --> 03:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
year sadly the various attorneys who
 
03:36:28.189 --> 03:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
backed me up last time weren't able to
 
03:36:31.469 --> 03:36:31.479 align:start position:0%
make it this time but to recap the
 
03:36:35.469 --> 03:36:35.479 align:start position:0%
argument slap slap stands for strategic
 
03:36:37.429 --> 03:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
lawsuit against public
 
03:36:39.910 --> 03:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
participation um and the term sort of
 
03:36:42.229 --> 03:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
explains itself which is you know a lot
 
03:36:44.429 --> 03:36:44.439 align:start position:0%
of lawsuits are for very good intentions
 
03:36:46.389 --> 03:36:46.399 align:start position:0%
you are suing for ex exactly the thing
 
03:36:48.550 --> 03:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
you want there's been a zoning violation
 
03:36:50.030 --> 03:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
you're suing to remedy that there's been
 
03:36:52.550 --> 03:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
a civil rights violation you're suing to
 
03:36:55.550 --> 03:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
remedy that but it is possible to use a
 
03:36:58.469 --> 03:36:58.479 align:start position:0%
lawsuit Not For What on its face it is
 
03:37:01.150 --> 03:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
doing uh but for its side effects and we
 
03:37:03.389 --> 03:37:03.399 align:start position:0%
have heard this called colloquially
 
03:37:07.750 --> 03:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
lawfare um lawfare is when you sort of
 
03:37:10.469 --> 03:37:10.479 align:start position:0%
uh you know one party has Bigger Pockets
 
03:37:13.670 --> 03:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
um and sues another party basically just
 
03:37:14.990 --> 03:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
so that the process can be the
 
03:37:15.000 --> 03:37:16.070 align:start position:0%
so that the process can be the
punishment

03:37:16.070 --> 03:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
punishment
 
03:37:18.349 --> 03:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
and not only does this hurt the uh
 
03:37:20.950 --> 03:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
initial uh questions I'm on the right
 
03:37:23.830 --> 03:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
bill right yes okay yeah I'm just listen
 
03:37:26.389 --> 03:37:26.399 align:start position:0%
okay great there was just a look and uh
 
03:37:28.030 --> 03:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
it's been a bit of a day so I I didn't
 
03:37:29.110 --> 03:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
want to give a whole bunch of slap
 
03:37:31.150 --> 03:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
testimony for a open government data
 
03:37:31.160 --> 03:37:32.870 align:start position:0%
testimony for a open government data
initiative

03:37:32.870 --> 03:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
initiative
 
03:37:36.269 --> 03:37:36.279 align:start position:0%
um so uh you know especially when one
 
03:37:38.349 --> 03:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
party has much deeper Pockets than the
 
03:37:40.910 --> 03:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
other they can not only um make it
 
03:37:43.030 --> 03:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely untenable for a small party
 
03:37:46.710 --> 03:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
via a lawsuit um but you know of uh I
 
03:37:48.309 --> 03:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
can't speak French but you know poorly
 
03:37:50.229 --> 03:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
encouragement of the others or whatever
 
03:37:53.030 --> 03:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
um to make it very clear that if you go
 
03:37:54.910 --> 03:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
up against this much larger party you
 
03:37:57.389 --> 03:37:57.399 align:start position:0%
will be in for a world of pain this is
 
03:37:59.830 --> 03:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
not a left right issue this happens in
 
03:38:02.790 --> 03:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
both directions I know that uh vegan
 
03:38:05.110 --> 03:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
activists and vegetarians who are
 
03:38:06.990 --> 03:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
protesting against factory farming are
 
03:38:09.389 --> 03:38:09.399 align:start position:0%
often on the receiving side of this uh
 
03:38:11.189 --> 03:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
they will get some undercover footage of
 
03:38:12.790 --> 03:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
you know cows being treated poorly or
 
03:38:15.590 --> 03:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
whatever and they will be sued for you
 
03:38:17.510 --> 03:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
know violation of Rights and trespassing
 
03:38:21.710 --> 03:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
and this and that and the uh the large
 
03:38:23.309 --> 03:38:23.319 align:start position:0%
uh aggro business that is doing these
 
03:38:25.510 --> 03:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
lawsuits can throw you know $100,000 at
 
03:38:27.389 --> 03:38:27.399 align:start position:0%
each one and they don't need to win any
 
03:38:30.189 --> 03:38:30.199 align:start position:0%
of them what they need to do is force
 
03:38:32.110 --> 03:38:32.120 align:start position:0%
the smaller party into just giving up
 
03:38:33.830 --> 03:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
you know signing a consent decree or
 
03:38:36.510 --> 03:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
handing over uh their video footage or
 
03:38:38.750 --> 03:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
something and this has happened in other
 
03:38:40.750 --> 03:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
directions anytime there's one small
 
03:38:44.469 --> 03:38:44.479 align:start position:0%
party and one large party so um there is
 
03:38:47.229 --> 03:38:47.239 align:start position:0%
something like 30 32 or 35 States right
 
03:38:49.910 --> 03:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
now that have anti-s slap laws on the
 
03:38:52.790 --> 03:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
books and the way these laws work is
 
03:38:55.349 --> 03:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
they basically um create a cause of
 
03:38:57.590 --> 03:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
action where the courts can find that
 
03:38:59.990 --> 03:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
hey this isn't just a a lawsuit that
 
03:39:02.229 --> 03:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
didn't succeed in its merits but this is
 
03:39:05.469 --> 03:39:05.479 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit which is very clearly um
 
03:39:07.110 --> 03:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
intended not to accomplish what it
 
03:39:09.229 --> 03:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
claims to accomplish on its face but you
 
03:39:10.790 --> 03:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
know we all know what's going on here
 
03:39:12.229 --> 03:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
that you are just you know absolutely
 
03:39:14.389 --> 03:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
brutalizing the smaller party so that
 
03:39:16.630 --> 03:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
they cease engaging in the activism or
 
03:39:18.790 --> 03:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
cease engaging in the Free Speech or
 
03:39:20.349 --> 03:39:20.359 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that they're doing and
 
03:39:24.309 --> 03:39:24.319 align:start position:0%
force them to give up um so that is uh
 
03:39:26.870 --> 03:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
an outline of the bill um there are
 
03:39:28.269 --> 03:39:28.279 align:start position:0%
model slap
 
03:39:30.469 --> 03:39:30.479 align:start position:0%
legislations uh that many of the other
 
03:39:33.150 --> 03:39:33.160 align:start position:0%
states have used this bill takes largely
 
03:39:36.670 --> 03:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
from there there is uh another bill that
 
03:39:38.670 --> 03:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
is going through committees right now
 
03:39:40.550 --> 03:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if it's already been held
 
03:39:43.269 --> 03:39:43.279 align:start position:0%
um that has a uh unfortunately I forget
 
03:39:45.429 --> 03:39:45.439 align:start position:0%
her name uh representative from the
 
03:39:47.510 --> 03:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
other side of the aisle which is also an
 
03:39:50.790 --> 03:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
anti-s slap uh uh proposal and we were
 
03:39:53.150 --> 03:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
in discussions to see if perhaps our two
 
03:39:56.389 --> 03:39:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh bills could be merged um her bill is
 
03:39:59.229 --> 03:39:59.239 align:start position:0%
very much focused on one particular case
 
03:40:02.030 --> 03:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
of this David versus Goliath situation
 
03:40:05.229 --> 03:40:05.239 align:start position:0%
um where in domestic abuse situations
 
03:40:07.590 --> 03:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes the guilty party the abuser
 
03:40:10.590 --> 03:40:10.600 align:start position:0%
will sue the innocent party for saying
 
03:40:13.030 --> 03:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
things out loud uh you know making
 
03:40:15.349 --> 03:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
truthful statements and uh calling them
 
03:40:17.950 --> 03:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
you know slander lialis um and of course
 
03:40:20.790 --> 03:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
they're not truth is an absolute defense
 
03:40:22.830 --> 03:40:22.840 align:start position:0%
and so this is a decent build because it
 
03:40:25.349 --> 03:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
gets to the same things it gets to the
 
03:40:27.670 --> 03:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
disparities where one side can afford to
 
03:40:29.830 --> 03:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
just use the courts to make another side
 
03:40:32.389 --> 03:40:32.399 align:start position:0%
uh give up and cease engaging in
 
03:40:34.670 --> 03:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
constitutionally protected activities
 
03:40:38.550 --> 03:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
like speech or like activism um during
 
03:40:40.510 --> 03:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
the sort of protracted negotiations to
 
03:40:43.550 --> 03:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
see if our two bills could be merged uh
 
03:40:46.030 --> 03:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
we didn't get there and that was largely
 
03:40:48.950 --> 03:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
because um the other uh Bill did not
 
03:40:51.469 --> 03:40:51.479 align:start position:0%
have an interest in protecting um any
 
03:40:53.469 --> 03:40:53.479 align:start position:0%
sorts of constitutionally protected
 
03:40:56.710 --> 03:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
speech besides that very narrow one um
 
03:41:00.189 --> 03:41:00.199 align:start position:0%
so um some of my uh advisers on this
 
03:41:01.670 --> 03:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
said you know hey that's also a good
 
03:41:03.550 --> 03:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
bill and only does 5% of what it needs
 
03:41:06.510 --> 03:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
to uh accomplish um but you know I just
 
03:41:07.870 --> 03:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
so you know Travis I'll be writing in
 
03:41:09.269 --> 03:41:09.279 align:start position:0%
and supporting that bill because it does
 
03:41:11.189 --> 03:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
something it's a small bite forward and
 
03:41:13.790 --> 03:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
then you know 95% of the uh the Apple
 
03:41:17.189 --> 03:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
Still Remains uh Bill uh you know aims
 
03:41:20.429 --> 03:41:20.439 align:start position:0%
to get to that 90 or 95% point where it
 
03:41:23.670 --> 03:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
does not uh Target the sort of abuse of
 
03:41:26.309 --> 03:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
lawfare uh merely in the area of
 
03:41:27.830 --> 03:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
domestic abuse although it absolutely
 
03:41:30.469 --> 03:41:30.479 align:start position:0%
does cover that uh area but also covers
 
03:41:32.790 --> 03:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
lots of other areas uh I welcome any
 
03:41:35.550 --> 03:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
questions any
 
03:41:42.030 --> 03:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:52.189 --> 03:41:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:55.750 --> 03:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
did I get that right
 
03:42:02.189 --> 03:42:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:04.550 --> 03:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
it just push the
 
03:42:08.630 --> 03:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
button is it on there we go thank you Mr
 
03:42:10.349 --> 03:42:10.359 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee um
 
03:42:12.950 --> 03:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
Christopher suert you were very close um
 
03:42:14.710 --> 03:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
I practic ised in the little town of
 
03:42:16.990 --> 03:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
Franklin New Hampshire uh practice and
 
03:42:18.469 --> 03:42:18.479 align:start position:0%
law since
 
03:42:23.429 --> 03:42:23.439 align:start position:0%
1984 um we had the same bill last year
 
03:42:26.189 --> 03:42:26.199 align:start position:0%
and you ited it and for very good reason
 
03:42:29.469 --> 03:42:29.479 align:start position:0%
so we basically got the same bill again
 
03:42:31.510 --> 03:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
and the same problems with this bill as
 
03:42:34.870 --> 03:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
I testified to last year um in New
 
03:42:36.630 --> 03:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know we take very
 
03:42:38.790 --> 03:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
seriously that all parties are equal
 
03:42:41.070 --> 03:42:41.080 align:start position:0%
under the law and nobody gets more
 
03:42:43.070 --> 03:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
rights than the other what this bill
 
03:42:46.469 --> 03:42:46.479 align:start position:0%
seeks to do is give more rights to any
 
03:42:49.110 --> 03:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
person claiming a violation of their
 
03:42:52.389 --> 03:42:52.399 align:start position:0%
first amendment rights so we are picking
 
03:42:55.710 --> 03:42:55.720 align:start position:0%
the First Amendment and given it special
 
03:42:58.110 --> 03:42:58.120 align:start position:0%
privileges over our Second Amendment
 
03:42:59.990 --> 03:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
rights we all think those second
 
03:43:02.550 --> 03:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
amendment rights are pretty powerful our
 
03:43:04.790 --> 03:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
fourth amendment rights our fifth
 
03:43:06.990 --> 03:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
amendment rights the seventh the eth and
 
03:43:08.670 --> 03:43:08.680 align:start position:0%
the 10th these are all the big ones you
 
03:43:10.710 --> 03:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
know the right to not you know have
 
03:43:12.590 --> 03:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
unreasonable search and sieges cruel and
 
03:43:14.590 --> 03:43:14.600 align:start position:0%
unusual punishment right to reury Tri
 
03:43:16.670 --> 03:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
you know those those are all as
 
03:43:19.870 --> 03:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
important as the first amendment so this
 
03:43:22.229 --> 03:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
bill seeks to elevate the First
 
03:43:24.950 --> 03:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment over all those others and it
 
03:43:28.590 --> 03:43:28.600 align:start position:0%
basically creates law fair it doesn't
 
03:43:30.910 --> 03:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
protect to prevent law fair because
 
03:43:34.870 --> 03:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
anybody under this bill who alleges that
 
03:43:37.309 --> 03:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
their first amendment rights are being
 
03:43:40.110 --> 03:43:40.120 align:start position:0%
stepped upon then can ask the court for
 
03:43:43.750 --> 03:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
attorney fees and costs and damages of a
 
03:43:46.870 --> 03:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
minimum of $10,000
 
03:43:49.429 --> 03:43:49.439 align:start position:0%
we don't have any other legislation like
 
03:43:53.070 --> 03:43:53.080 align:start position:0%
this in this state just don't have it we
 
03:43:56.950 --> 03:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
treat all people and All rights equal
 
03:44:00.510 --> 03:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
under the law that's the status quo and
 
03:44:02.189 --> 03:44:02.199 align:start position:0%
that's what we should seek to do in the
 
03:44:05.550 --> 03:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
future and itl this bill once again I'll
 
03:44:07.550 --> 03:44:07.560 align:start position:0%

the plaintiff civil bar in New Hampshire
 
03:44:48.790 --> 03:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
attorney sufor is on our board and I
 
03:44:50.750 --> 03:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
agree with everything he just said I
 
03:44:52.910 --> 03:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
just wanted to add a couple small items
 
03:44:55.269 --> 03:44:55.279 align:start position:0%
um last year this bill was House Bill
 
03:44:58.229 --> 03:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
1475 and while the sponsor is right and
 
03:45:01.710 --> 03:45:01.720 align:start position:0%
I I understand his intent and think the
 
03:45:04.309 --> 03:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
intent of what um he is trying to
 
03:45:06.149 --> 03:45:06.159 align:start position:0%
accomplish is admirable please read the
 
03:45:07.349 --> 03:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
language of the bill because the
 
03:45:08.830 --> 03:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
language of the bill does not align with
 
03:45:10.950 --> 03:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
that stated intent what this bill does
 
03:45:13.030 --> 03:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
is create broad sweeping immunities
 
03:45:14.030 --> 03:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
which those of you who have been on
 
03:45:15.550 --> 03:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
Judiciary in the past I'm looking at the
 
03:45:17.830 --> 03:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
four or five of you and going to make
 
03:45:21.389 --> 03:45:21.399 align:start position:0%
friends for with the rest of you soon um
 
03:45:24.309 --> 03:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
no that's kind that's our that's our dog
 
03:45:28.229 --> 03:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
whistle uh that is a a a principle of
 
03:45:29.950 --> 03:45:29.960 align:start position:0%
our organization that we fight against
 
03:45:33.030 --> 03:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
immunity because if you grant someone
 
03:45:35.110 --> 03:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
immunity you are saying that regardless
 
03:45:36.910 --> 03:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
of what happened regardless of what
 
03:45:39.309 --> 03:45:39.319 align:start position:0%
wrong has been done to you you don't get
 
03:45:41.189 --> 03:45:41.199 align:start position:0%
to seek accountability to the person
 
03:45:42.590 --> 03:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
that harmed you or the entity that
 
03:45:45.870 --> 03:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
harmed you um there are other states
 
03:45:48.469 --> 03:45:48.479 align:start position:0%
that do have anti-s slap laws that
 
03:45:50.110 --> 03:45:50.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could work on something in
 
03:45:52.030 --> 03:45:52.040 align:start position:0%
the future I think it would take a while
 
03:45:53.950 --> 03:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
to get all the parties together um
 
03:45:55.550 --> 03:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
including some other advocacy
 
03:45:57.550 --> 03:45:57.560 align:start position:0%
organizations and I just wanted to leave
 
03:46:00.309 --> 03:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
you with the blurb that um
 
03:46:01.870 --> 03:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn chair of this
 
03:46:05.469 --> 03:46:05.479 align:start position:0%
committee obviously last year wrote um
 
03:46:08.189 --> 03:46:08.199 align:start position:0%
when um recommending this bill be
 
03:46:10.590 --> 03:46:10.600 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate was voted 20 to
 
03:46:13.149 --> 03:46:13.159 align:start position:0%
nothing on consent calendar this bill
 
03:46:14.590 --> 03:46:14.600 align:start position:0%
would establish certain special Court
 
03:46:15.710 --> 03:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
proceed procedures for handling
 
03:46:18.229 --> 03:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
so-called strategic lawsuits da da these
 
03:46:19.710 --> 03:46:19.720 align:start position:0%
are lawsuits generally filed by
 
03:46:21.630 --> 03:46:21.640 align:start position:0%
well-healed organizations or individuals
 
03:46:24.070 --> 03:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
against generally less well healed
 
03:46:25.510 --> 03:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
individuals who exercise their first
 
03:46:27.269 --> 03:46:27.279 align:start position:0%
amendment rights to protest some action
 
03:46:28.910 --> 03:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
or inaction taken by the formal
 
03:46:31.309 --> 03:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
organizations or individuals although
 
03:46:32.710 --> 03:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
the proponents of this bill asserted its
 
03:46:34.389 --> 03:46:34.399 align:start position:0%
substantive merits a closed examination
 
03:46:36.710 --> 03:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
shows that in the main this bill makes
 
03:46:39.070 --> 03:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
procedural procedural changes to court
 
03:46:40.910 --> 03:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
rules that arguably would allow such
 
03:46:42.389 --> 03:46:42.399 align:start position:0%
cases to be resolved somewhat more
 
03:46:44.349 --> 03:46:44.359 align:start position:0%
quickly by requiring the claimant to
 
03:46:46.070 --> 03:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
produce its evidence at an earlier stage
 
03:46:48.469 --> 03:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
of the case than would normally occur
 
03:46:50.429 --> 03:46:50.439 align:start position:0%
this bill makes no substantive CH
 
03:46:52.590 --> 03:46:52.600 align:start position:0%
substantive changes to the law the
 
03:46:54.309 --> 03:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
committee was unpersuaded that slap
 
03:46:55.910 --> 03:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
suits were a significant problem in New
 
03:46:57.630 --> 03:46:57.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or the current procedures were
 
03:46:59.189 --> 03:46:59.199 align:start position:0%
ineffective in addressing abuse of
 
03:47:01.990 --> 03:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
litigation end quote um and then to
 
03:47:03.830 --> 03:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
summarize I would just say that if you
 
03:47:05.790 --> 03:47:05.800 align:start position:0%
look at the language of the bill what it
 
03:47:09.630 --> 03:47:09.640 align:start position:0%
does is allows a civil defendant grants
 
03:47:13.149 --> 03:47:13.159 align:start position:0%
them incredible breadth and authority
 
03:47:16.189 --> 03:47:16.199 align:start position:0%
and gives the court um as attorney Su
 
03:47:18.309 --> 03:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
said allows the court to stack the deck
 
03:47:20.510 --> 03:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
on their side I could see civil
 
03:47:24.429 --> 03:47:24.439 align:start position:0%
defendants claiming slap for a myriad of
 
03:47:26.750 --> 03:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
cases to get that special treatment and
 
03:47:28.429 --> 03:47:28.439 align:start position:0%
that special consideration special
 
03:47:32.070 --> 03:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
weight for motions to dismiss for Ev
 
03:47:35.389 --> 03:47:35.399 align:start position:0%
every procedural instance over a civil
 
03:47:37.510 --> 03:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
plaintiff regardless of the playing
 
03:47:39.910 --> 03:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
field so with that I don't want to stand
 
03:47:43.830 --> 03:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
between you and lunch much longer any
 
03:47:47.710 --> 03:47:47.720 align:start position:0%

04:22:01.070 --> 04:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
sure I understand so when my town
 
04:22:02.630 --> 04:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
somebody from the Town Council on the
 
04:22:05.710 --> 04:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
lawyer and stuff go into bargain for the
 
04:22:05.720 --> 04:22:07.550 align:start position:0%
lawyer and stuff go into bargain for the
fire

04:22:07.550 --> 04:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
fire
 
04:22:10.469 --> 04:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
department you want that to be public a
 
04:22:12.309 --> 04:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
public meeting is that what you're
 
04:22:14.229 --> 04:22:14.239 align:start position:0%
saying saying the two parties when they
 
04:22:17.149 --> 04:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
meet together to discuss the contract
 
04:22:19.309 --> 04:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
that would be a public meeting if the
 
04:22:22.149 --> 04:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
parties are are planning strategies each
 
04:22:24.429 --> 04:22:24.439 align:start position:0%
party is allowed to confidentially plan
 
04:22:26.590 --> 04:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
their strategy but when they meet
 
04:22:28.510 --> 04:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
together it should be public meeting so
 
04:22:30.469 --> 04:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
actually when were they're actually
 
04:22:33.510 --> 04:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
negotiating yes it would be a public
 
04:22:36.990 --> 04:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
meeting correct that's a great
 
04:22:40.269 --> 04:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
idea any other
 
04:22:42.950 --> 04:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
questions representative Horgan yes
 
04:22:46.590 --> 04:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I I see there's a
 
04:22:49.189 --> 04:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
representative from the NH Nea so have
 
04:22:52.590 --> 04:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
you discussed his position with him or I
 
04:22:53.630 --> 04:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
don't know if he's going to fill out a
 
04:22:55.229 --> 04:22:55.239 align:start position:0%
pink car and testify or not but do you
 
04:22:58.229 --> 04:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
know if do you know if nhna agrees
 
04:22:59.910 --> 04:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
position on this is the same as what you
 
04:23:01.710 --> 04:23:01.720 align:start position:0%
ascribed I'm not sure of the the New
 
04:23:05.030 --> 04:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Nea chapter but um the
 
04:23:07.149 --> 04:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
national Nea has expressed interest in
 
04:23:10.910 --> 04:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
open meetings um hope hopefully they'll
 
04:23:14.109 --> 04:23:14.119 align:start position:0%
they'll support the national
 
04:23:16.550 --> 04:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
position oh thanks if they want to
 
04:23:18.670 --> 04:23:18.680 align:start position:0%
submit some I mean they might they might
 
04:23:20.550 --> 04:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
want to email us some like just
 
04:23:25.590 --> 04:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
confirmation that yes so um just so you
 
04:23:27.309 --> 04:23:27.319 align:start position:0%
could it would be possible to have them
 
04:23:29.950 --> 04:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
you know send us some documentation to
 
04:23:31.630 --> 04:23:31.640 align:start position:0%
clarify that that is indeed their
 
04:23:35.109 --> 04:23:35.119 align:start position:0%
position so they
 
04:23:38.189 --> 04:23:38.199 align:start position:0%
certainly representative Andress thank
 
04:23:40.229 --> 04:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:23:43.550 --> 04:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
question I am totally for this bill I
 
04:23:46.070 --> 04:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
have a lot to do with my school district
 
04:23:50.870 --> 04:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
my question is do you know
 
04:23:53.429 --> 04:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
why Union
 
04:23:57.630 --> 04:23:57.640 align:start position:0%
contracts are not allowed to be given to
 
04:24:04.510 --> 04:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:06.910 --> 04:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
contract I
 
04:24:09.309 --> 04:24:09.319 align:start position:0%
was I don't know does that have any
 
04:24:10.670 --> 04:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
really to do with this bill I don't
 
04:24:15.309 --> 04:24:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:18.109 --> 04:24:18.119 align:start position:0%
well as a member of the public and also
 
04:24:20.189 --> 04:24:20.199 align:start position:0%
as a school uh budget Committee Member
 
04:24:22.229 --> 04:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
when I wanted to see contracts about to
 
04:24:24.590 --> 04:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
be placed on as warrant articles I've
 
04:24:26.469 --> 04:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
always been able to get a copy to view
 
04:24:28.590 --> 04:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:24:31.109 --> 04:24:31.119 align:start position:0%
draft representative
 
04:24:34.229 --> 04:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
Manos thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:24:36.510 --> 04:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
Miss representative Brown I'm I'm
 
04:24:39.790 --> 04:24:39.800 align:start position:0%
confused about the language
 
04:24:43.550 --> 04:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
because um this is in a list
 
04:24:47.469 --> 04:24:47.479 align:start position:0%
of what is not considered a public
 
04:24:52.550 --> 04:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
meeting correct yes so you would have it
 
04:24:55.750 --> 04:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
your proposal your bill is that strategy
 
04:24:58.830 --> 04:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
with respect to collective
 
04:25:02.109 --> 04:25:02.119 align:start position:0%
bargaining where only one of the
 
04:25:05.269 --> 04:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
negotiating parties is present so I'm
 
04:25:07.710 --> 04:25:07.720 align:start position:0%
con I'm I'm confused about what it is
 
04:25:10.710 --> 04:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
exactly you want to be public and what
 
04:25:13.030 --> 04:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
it is exactly you want to have
 
04:25:16.429 --> 04:25:16.439 align:start position:0%
remain um not subject to
 
04:25:19.950 --> 04:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
disclosure so the public meeting aspect
 
04:25:21.990 --> 04:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
would be when the two parties are have
 
04:25:23.910 --> 04:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
are meeting together to negotiate or
 
04:25:25.870 --> 04:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
discuss the contract
 
04:25:27.910 --> 04:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
Provisions when they're to when they're
 
04:25:30.349 --> 04:25:30.359 align:start position:0%
separate and in their own meetings to
 
04:25:32.950 --> 04:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
strategize on their positions they would
 
04:25:35.590 --> 04:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
have the ability to have a meeting in in
 
04:25:38.109 --> 04:25:38.119 align:start position:0%
private as a confidential meeting but
 
04:25:41.229 --> 04:25:41.239 align:start position:0%
when they meet together in a public as a
 
04:25:44.550 --> 04:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
as two parties they would be um meeting
 
04:25:48.309 --> 04:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
in a public set setting an open meeting
 
04:25:51.950 --> 04:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
followup thank you but doesn't the
 
04:25:54.670 --> 04:25:54.680 align:start position:0%
strategy where only one negotiating
 
04:25:56.870 --> 04:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
party is present so how are you going to
 
04:26:00.109 --> 04:26:00.119 align:start position:0%
have a strategy session where only
 
04:26:04.910 --> 04:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
one where only one party where only one
 
04:26:07.550 --> 04:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
party is I'm I'm not I'm still not
 
04:26:09.030 --> 04:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
understanding exactly I might be able to
 
04:26:12.990 --> 04:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
clarify that a bit so a union gets the
 
04:26:14.510 --> 04:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
the members of the Union would
 
04:26:16.990 --> 04:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
strategize about what they want to see
 
04:26:19.710 --> 04:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
uh negotiated during negotiations so
 
04:26:21.309 --> 04:26:21.319 align:start position:0%
when they're meeting it's kind of like a
 
04:26:23.309 --> 04:26:23.319 align:start position:0%
caucus so it's the members of the Union
 
04:26:24.429 --> 04:26:24.439 align:start position:0%
that are meeting to say this is what we
 
04:26:26.510 --> 04:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
want this is what we'll accept we won't
 
04:26:28.349 --> 04:26:28.359 align:start position:0%
take that so that's what that separation
 
04:26:30.790 --> 04:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
is if that yes that seem like an answer
 
04:26:30.800 --> 04:26:32.030 align:start position:0%
is if that yes that seem like an answer
all

04:26:32.030 --> 04:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:26:34.550 --> 04:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
right uh representative uh
 
04:26:36.990 --> 04:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
Paige thank you thank you Mr chair and
 
04:26:38.510 --> 04:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question this is an
 
04:26:38.520 --> 04:26:39.790 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question this is an
interesting

04:26:39.790 --> 04:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
04:26:44.189 --> 04:26:44.199 align:start position:0%
concept I'm I'm wondering if um part of
 
04:26:48.189 --> 04:26:48.199 align:start position:0%
the um part of the intent of the bill is
 
04:26:50.950 --> 04:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
to get at perhaps bargaining agreements
 
04:26:53.710 --> 04:26:53.720 align:start position:0%
that um maybe the people in the local
 
04:26:56.149 --> 04:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
school district don't ultimately agree
 
04:26:57.790 --> 04:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
with and if that's
 
04:27:02.149 --> 04:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
so would the remedy be more not coming
 
04:27:04.870 --> 04:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
to us but to ask the voters the voters
 
04:27:07.070 --> 04:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
do ultimately see the contract and if
 
04:27:09.710 --> 04:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
they're upset with the terms or feel
 
04:27:12.389 --> 04:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
like it's not being leveraged to
 
04:27:14.750 --> 04:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
whatever Advantage whatever side or
 
04:27:16.510 --> 04:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
whatever wouldn't that be more
 
04:27:19.630 --> 04:27:19.640 align:start position:0%
consistent with allowing local control
 
04:27:22.910 --> 04:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
and voters to have a say to excuse the
 
04:27:25.030 --> 04:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
expression vote the bumps out at the
 
04:27:26.670 --> 04:27:26.680 align:start position:0%
school board or
 
04:27:29.269 --> 04:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
whatever well I suppose local voters
 
04:27:29.279 --> 04:27:30.870 align:start position:0%
whatever well I suppose local voters
could

04:27:30.870 --> 04:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:27:33.550 --> 04:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps Advance the idea that their
 
04:27:35.910 --> 04:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
local unions should be negotiating in
 
04:27:39.149 --> 04:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
public as public meetings but I feel
 
04:27:41.149 --> 04:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
that it's a fundamental right that as
 
04:27:43.750 --> 04:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and as Citizens we be allowed
 
04:27:46.389 --> 04:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
to see public sector negotiations
 
04:27:48.670 --> 04:27:48.680 align:start position:0%
conducted in a public setting so that we
 
04:27:50.309 --> 04:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
can appreciate both sides of the
 
04:27:52.550 --> 04:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
arguments and maybe even contribute
 
04:27:54.149 --> 04:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
input when we hear the arguments
 
04:27:58.750 --> 04:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:01.990 --> 04:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
setting I don't want to specify
 
04:28:06.030 --> 04:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
any um history or any details of past
 
04:28:09.030 --> 04:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
negotiations I've seen as an educator
 
04:28:11.149 --> 04:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
but often times small Provisions are
 
04:28:13.990 --> 04:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
made to to satisfy the needs of a
 
04:28:17.309 --> 04:28:17.319 align:start position:0%
segment or a small number of um
 
04:28:19.429 --> 04:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
participants either on one team or the
 
04:28:21.109 --> 04:28:21.119 align:start position:0%
other and it doesn't provide
 
04:28:23.149 --> 04:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
transparency to have the contracts
 
04:28:25.269 --> 04:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
formed in a closed setting where we
 
04:28:27.590 --> 04:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
don't truly understand where the origins
 
04:28:30.189 --> 04:28:30.199 align:start position:0%
of these results are coming from if it's
 
04:28:32.149 --> 04:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
in a public setting we can better
 
04:28:34.630 --> 04:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
understand exactly why the contract
 
04:28:37.149 --> 04:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
Provisions are being formed as they are
 
04:28:40.309 --> 04:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
and understand both sides of the
 
04:28:43.830 --> 04:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
arguments representative forg
 
04:28:45.910 --> 04:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I remember this bill
 
04:28:47.349 --> 04:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
coming to the community several years
 
04:28:49.389 --> 04:28:49.399 align:start position:0%
ago before you were there and I remember
 
04:28:52.389 --> 04:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
the problem I had a time would seemed to
 
04:28:56.229 --> 04:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
me um we can't the union the Union's
 
04:28:58.590 --> 04:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
bargaining committee can meet privately
 
04:29:00.269 --> 04:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
because they're not subject to 91a
 
04:29:02.229 --> 04:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
they're private organization so they're
 
04:29:05.630 --> 04:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
not even covered by 91a but the bargain
 
04:29:06.910 --> 04:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
you know the bargaining committee on the
 
04:29:10.189 --> 04:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
management side um it's part of a public
 
04:29:12.710 --> 04:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
body so I see the unless they
 
04:29:14.830 --> 04:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
unless they don't do some sneaky thing
 
04:29:17.910 --> 04:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
like hiring a a unless they do find some
 
04:29:19.950 --> 04:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
sneaky work around their public bodies
 
04:29:22.389 --> 04:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
that are covered by 91a so doesn't I'm
 
04:29:23.990 --> 04:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
concerned that might Place Management at
 
04:29:26.269 --> 04:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
a competitive disadvantage because the
 
04:29:28.269 --> 04:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
union you know the union bargaining
 
04:29:29.750 --> 04:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
committee can speak frankly amongst
 
04:29:31.469 --> 04:29:31.479 align:start position:0%
themselves and nobody's listening in but
 
04:29:33.550 --> 04:29:33.560 align:start position:0%
the other hand the management bargaining
 
04:29:34.950 --> 04:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
commiss committee they have to have
 
04:29:37.870 --> 04:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
everything in in Open Session which may
 
04:29:39.990 --> 04:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
or may may not necessarily cause a
 
04:29:42.830 --> 04:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
better result I mean I feel like anyway
 
04:29:44.670 --> 04:29:44.680 align:start position:0%
so is that uh do you understand the
 
04:29:46.109 --> 04:29:46.119 align:start position:0%
question yes so is that the accurate
 
04:29:47.950 --> 04:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
thing that the the union that the
 
04:29:49.229 --> 04:29:49.239 align:start position:0%
management bargaining committees would
 
04:29:52.109 --> 04:29:52.119 align:start position:0%
now no longer be able to meet and meet
 
04:29:54.030 --> 04:29:54.040 align:start position:0%
privately and do you feel that that
 
04:29:55.469 --> 04:29:55.479 align:start position:0%
might place them at a competitive
 
04:29:58.750 --> 04:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
disadvantage with the Union side of
 
04:30:01.550 --> 04:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
it well as I understand it when we have
 
04:30:04.269 --> 04:30:04.279 align:start position:0%
negotiations with public sector unions
 
04:30:07.070 --> 04:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
both part both parties management and
 
04:30:09.670 --> 04:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
the union Representatives can meet as
 
04:30:12.189 --> 04:30:12.199 align:start position:0%
groups to discuss their strategy and how
 
04:30:14.710 --> 04:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
they would like to see the contract uh
 
04:30:17.790 --> 04:30:17.800 align:start position:0%
formed so I don't understand exactly how
 
04:30:20.870 --> 04:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
the bill would prevent or inhibit either
 
04:30:23.149 --> 04:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
side from benefiting from private
 
04:30:26.269 --> 04:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
negotiate secret or not confidential
 
04:30:28.750 --> 04:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
negotiations in a group by themselves
 
04:30:31.670 --> 04:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
versus meeting together in
 
04:30:34.030 --> 04:30:34.040 align:start position:0%
public representative Alexander thank
 
04:30:36.070 --> 04:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you representative
 
04:30:38.070 --> 04:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
I'm right here I'm taking your question
 
04:30:41.229 --> 04:30:41.239 align:start position:0%
I don't I didn't see um so can you
 
04:30:44.269 --> 04:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
clarify this for me if this bill
 
04:30:47.149 --> 04:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
passes a quorum of the select board can
 
04:30:49.429 --> 04:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
still meet in non-public to discuss
 
04:30:50.670 --> 04:30:50.680 align:start position:0%
strategy on
 
04:30:55.510 --> 04:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:58.109 --> 04:30:58.119 align:start position:0%
union well I've never actually
 
04:31:00.070 --> 04:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
encountered the issue of a quorum for
 
04:31:02.750 --> 04:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
the select board for our our school
 
04:31:05.710 --> 04:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
board um we had a subset of school board
 
04:31:09.309 --> 04:31:09.319 align:start position:0%
members representing um the district and
 
04:31:11.750 --> 04:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
it was not a quorum of those people it
 
04:31:15.870 --> 04:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
was was a group of three but to follow
 
04:31:18.510 --> 04:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
up that would be considered strategy
 
04:31:20.830 --> 04:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
though yes right if so if if three of
 
04:31:23.309 --> 04:31:23.319 align:start position:0%
the five members of the gtown select
 
04:31:26.229 --> 04:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
board met to talk strategy about a union
 
04:31:26.239 --> 04:31:27.710 align:start position:0%
board met to talk strategy about a union
negotiation

04:31:27.710 --> 04:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
negotiation
 
04:31:29.429 --> 04:31:29.439 align:start position:0%
negotiation they could go into
 
04:31:32.030 --> 04:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
non-public still under this law they
 
04:31:34.750 --> 04:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
just couldn't go into non-public for the
 
04:31:36.389 --> 04:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
negotiation but just the strategy
 
04:31:40.070 --> 04:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
component um that sounds right to me um
 
04:31:41.670 --> 04:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
I hadn't really considered that aspect
 
04:31:44.590 --> 04:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
if it was a quorum or not but they do go
 
04:31:47.830 --> 04:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
into non-public to discuss um the
 
04:31:47.840 --> 04:31:49.910 align:start position:0%
into non-public to discuss um the
negotiations

04:31:49.910 --> 04:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
negotiations
 
04:31:52.349 --> 04:31:52.359 align:start position:0%
yes any other
 
04:31:55.870 --> 04:31:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:58.070 --> 04:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
Bergeron and thank you in advance for
 
04:31:58.080 --> 04:31:59.189 align:start position:0%
Bergeron and thank you in advance for
your

04:31:59.189 --> 04:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:32:01.790 --> 04:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
information I was just curious because
 
04:32:04.750 --> 04:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
you mentioned Nea and I'm on a school
 
04:32:06.990 --> 04:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
board as well and we have a great
 
04:32:10.030 --> 04:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
relationship with Nea but do they fall
 
04:32:12.670 --> 04:32:12.680 align:start position:0%
under a public body
 
04:32:15.510 --> 04:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
where their negotiations would have to
 
04:32:19.349 --> 04:32:19.359 align:start position:0%
be recorded as well Nea so in other
 
04:32:22.429 --> 04:32:22.439 align:start position:0%
words we could look at their recording
 
04:32:24.189 --> 04:32:24.199 align:start position:0%
and I don't know use it to our advantage
 
04:32:25.950 --> 04:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
vice versa so I'm just wondering how
 
04:32:25.960 --> 04:32:27.030 align:start position:0%
vice versa so I'm just wondering how
that

04:32:27.030 --> 04:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:32:30.870 --> 04:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
works well if your Nea um
 
04:32:32.309 --> 04:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
representatives are meeting to
 
04:32:34.429 --> 04:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
strategize they would not be recorded
 
04:32:36.229 --> 04:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
that would be a confidential meeting so
 
04:32:37.870 --> 04:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
that will be because of the strategize
 
04:32:39.469 --> 04:32:39.479 align:start position:0%
part right
 
04:32:43.910 --> 04:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay yes thank thank you representative
 
04:32:47.109 --> 04:32:47.119 align:start position:0%
trip thank you thank you for taking my
 
04:32:49.590 --> 04:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
question uh it's interesting you said
 
04:32:53.070 --> 04:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
that uh when the uh School Board is
 
04:32:56.590 --> 04:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
negotiating with the whatever
 
04:33:00.070 --> 04:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh Union that they're negotiating that
 
04:33:02.630 --> 04:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
they they there's usually only
 
04:33:06.709 --> 04:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
three uh that's the same way it is in in
 
04:33:09.830 --> 04:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh in Dairy when uh our school board
 
04:33:12.670 --> 04:33:12.680 align:start position:0%
negotiates but uh they they have an
 
04:33:16.310 --> 04:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
official uh negotiating committee
 
04:33:18.590 --> 04:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and I'm just wondering
 
04:33:22.470 --> 04:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
would you consider uh the lack of a
 
04:33:22.480 --> 04:33:23.830 align:start position:0%
would you consider uh the lack of a
Schoolboard

04:33:23.830 --> 04:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard
 
04:33:23.840 --> 04:33:27.629 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard
Quorum

04:33:27.629 --> 04:33:27.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:32.590 --> 04:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
uh since it's it's a uh a quorum for the
 
04:33:34.670 --> 04:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
negotiating committee would you consider
 
04:33:39.429 --> 04:33:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:42.189 --> 04:33:42.199 align:start position:0%
meeting that's a good question I would
 
04:33:47.189 --> 04:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
say as um the body that is in engaged in
 
04:33:49.230 --> 04:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
nego negotiations with the
 
04:33:52.310 --> 04:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
Union they will be planning their own
 
04:33:55.830 --> 04:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
strategies for those sessions and
 
04:33:59.349 --> 04:33:59.359 align:start position:0%
according to the RSA Str as we designed
 
04:34:01.789 --> 04:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
it um in
 
04:34:04.789 --> 04:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
hp400 those strategy sessions could be
 
04:34:07.390 --> 04:34:07.400 align:start position:0%
held as a non- meeting as a strategy
 
04:34:10.390 --> 04:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
session so I don't believe as a
 
04:34:12.390 --> 04:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
negotiating team they would be
 
04:34:14.830 --> 04:34:14.840 align:start position:0%
considered um a quorum of the school
 
04:34:19.070 --> 04:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:21.670 --> 04:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
meeting thank you I imagine if there's a
 
04:34:23.709 --> 04:34:23.719 align:start position:0%
subcommittee assigned strictly for
 
04:34:25.510 --> 04:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
negotiations that subcommittee would
 
04:34:28.070 --> 04:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
have its own Quorum its own numbers for
 
04:34:30.230 --> 04:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
quorums as we do here so I don't know if
 
04:34:30.240 --> 04:34:32.070 align:start position:0%
quorums as we do here so I don't know if
that

04:34:32.070 --> 04:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:34:35.070 --> 04:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
helps I imagine it would be but that's
 
04:34:37.349 --> 04:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
my opinion uh representative
 
04:34:39.789 --> 04:34:39.799 align:start position:0%
Andros thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:34:42.189 --> 04:34:42.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you know if there
 
04:34:45.230 --> 04:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
are any other New Hampshire laws
 
04:34:48.349 --> 04:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
regarding unions and negotiations which
 
04:34:52.551 --> 04:34:52.561 align:start position:0%
might be in conflict with passings this
 
04:34:55.910 --> 04:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
bill I do not but I can try to find out
 
04:34:57.551 --> 04:34:57.561 align:start position:0%
if there are any such
 
04:35:01.109 --> 04:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
conflicts um I'm I'm not aware of
 
04:35:03.551 --> 04:35:03.561 align:start position:0%
any are there any other
 
04:35:05.990 --> 04:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
04:35:11.830 --> 04:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:14.230 --> 04:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
is it Scott
 
04:35:18.070 --> 04:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:28.429 --> 04:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:31.029 --> 04:35:31.039 align:start position:0%
and Mr chairman members of the committee
 
04:35:32.349 --> 04:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
my name is Scott Gober I represent
 
04:35:33.709 --> 04:35:33.719 align:start position:0%
Teamsters in New
 
04:35:37.590 --> 04:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm going to try to be
 
04:35:40.510 --> 04:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
brief this bill HP 400 will slow down
 
04:35:43.590 --> 04:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
the bargaining process
 
04:35:45.310 --> 04:35:45.320 align:start position:0%
people will perform for public
 
04:35:47.629 --> 04:35:47.639 align:start position:0%
consumption more than they'll complete
 
04:35:49.869 --> 04:35:49.879 align:start position:0%
the bargaining process for the good of
 
04:35:52.670 --> 04:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
the public private information may be
 
04:35:54.990 --> 04:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
shared in the public
 
04:35:57.590 --> 04:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
space it will cost the public money to
 
04:36:00.990 --> 04:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
publish and live stream these
 
04:36:03.750 --> 04:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
conversations and bargaining proceedings
 
04:36:05.789 --> 04:36:05.799 align:start position:0%
and final contracts are
 
04:36:08.510 --> 04:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
already part of the record the public
 
04:36:11.150 --> 04:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
record um I'll take any questions that
 
04:36:13.789 --> 04:36:13.799 align:start position:0%
anyone might have any questions
 
04:36:17.150 --> 04:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
representative forez so why do you think
 
04:36:22.709 --> 04:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:24.949 --> 04:36:24.959 align:start position:0%
people well you hear the word secret
 
04:36:28.189 --> 04:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
used a lot we don't operate in secret
 
04:36:30.869 --> 04:36:30.879 align:start position:0%
we're very forthright with what as far
 
04:36:32.390 --> 04:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
as the teamsters go when we go into
 
04:36:36.310 --> 04:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
negotiations what we're after um as far
 
04:36:39.070 --> 04:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
as what I believe I I think people want
 
04:36:41.990 --> 04:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
to interject into that into to that
 
04:36:44.670 --> 04:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
system uh from the outside there are
 
04:36:47.949 --> 04:36:47.959 align:start position:0%
elected people that you've entrusted to
 
04:36:50.709 --> 04:36:50.719 align:start position:0%
negotiate with the teamsters or any
 
04:36:53.189 --> 04:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
other Union and I think that the trust
 
04:36:55.670 --> 04:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
should be put in them to negotiate I
 
04:36:59.109 --> 04:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
also feel that it may drive those
 
04:37:01.551 --> 04:37:01.561 align:start position:0%
conversations further away from the body
 
04:37:04.470 --> 04:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
instead of being in the room okay thank
 
04:37:06.429 --> 04:37:06.439 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
04:37:08.869 --> 04:37:08.879 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
04:37:08.879 --> 04:37:12.830 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
you

04:37:12.830 --> 04:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:33.070 --> 04:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:36.349 --> 04:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
inol good afternoon uh my name is Doug
 
04:37:38.830 --> 04:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
ingersol I'm the executive director of
 
04:37:40.510 --> 04:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
the Public Employee Labor Relations
 
04:37:44.629 --> 04:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
Board which is the board the State Board
 
04:37:48.830 --> 04:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
responsible for administering RSA 273a
 
04:37:50.269 --> 04:37:50.279 align:start position:0%
which is the states collective
 
04:37:53.869 --> 04:37:53.879 align:start position:0%
bargaining law been with the board since
 
04:37:57.230 --> 04:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
2006 and the uh public sector collective
 
04:38:00.390 --> 04:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
bargaining law has been in effect uh
 
04:38:00.400 --> 04:38:03.070 align:start position:0%
bargaining law has been in effect uh
since

04:38:03.070 --> 04:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:05.750 --> 04:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
1976 and in terms of the issue being
 
04:38:09.590 --> 04:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
discussed today um it has never been
 
04:38:12.670 --> 04:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
part of the bargaining process I do have
 
04:38:15.590 --> 04:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
I'm only here today to to give
 
04:38:18.910 --> 04:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
you uh some some statistics about the
 
04:38:22.429 --> 04:38:22.439 align:start position:0%
contracts that we have um a little
 
04:38:25.390 --> 04:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
information about the bargaining process
 
04:38:28.109 --> 04:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
so that you understand what the steps
 
04:38:28.119 --> 04:38:29.709 align:start position:0%
so that you understand what the steps
are

04:38:29.709 --> 04:38:29.719 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:38:32.590 --> 04:38:32.600 align:start position:0%
um and to and to point
 
04:38:36.390 --> 04:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
out some legislative history or
 
04:38:39.150 --> 04:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
legislative activity back in 2011 that
 
04:38:42.070 --> 04:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
relates to this the same topic
 
04:38:45.910 --> 04:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
so in terms of uh collective bargaining
 
04:38:47.789 --> 04:38:47.799 align:start position:0%
agreements today all collective
 
04:38:49.390 --> 04:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
bargaining Agreements are supposed to be
 
04:38:50.949 --> 04:38:50.959 align:start position:0%
filed with the
 
04:38:54.910 --> 04:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
plrb within two weeks uh of being
 
04:38:58.029 --> 04:38:58.039 align:start position:0%
signed um all of those Agreements are
 
04:39:00.349 --> 04:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
ultimately published on our
 
04:39:03.029 --> 04:39:03.039 align:start position:0%
website uh as well as all orders and
 
04:39:06.750 --> 04:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
decisions the board has issued since
 
04:39:10.629 --> 04:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
1976 um currently we have approximately
 
04:39:13.869 --> 04:39:13.879 align:start position:0%
6 20 collective bargaining agreements on
 
04:39:17.990 --> 04:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
file uh and if you factor in that the
 
04:39:20.349 --> 04:39:20.359 align:start position:0%
state Master agreement
 
04:39:24.269 --> 04:39:24.279 align:start position:0%
covers 25 individual bargaining units uh
 
04:39:28.029 --> 04:39:28.039 align:start position:0%
that number is actually closer to
 
04:39:31.429 --> 04:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
645 bargaining units
 
04:39:35.551 --> 04:39:35.561 align:start position:0%
which relates to uh approximately 650
 
04:39:37.990 --> 04:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
bargaining unit certifications that are
 
04:39:42.110 --> 04:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
uh currently on file of those 600 20
 
04:39:45.868 --> 04:39:45.878 align:start position:0%
bargaining units all of them are current
 
04:39:47.390 --> 04:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
meaning they haven't hit their
 
04:39:49.550 --> 04:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
expiration date by expiration date I
 
04:39:52.270 --> 04:39:52.280 align:start position:0%
mean for example uh commonly in teacher
 
04:39:55.510 --> 04:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
contracts it's June 30 but for example a
 
04:39:57.550 --> 04:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
education contract with an expiration
 
04:40:01.270 --> 04:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
date of 6 June 30 2025 would be
 
04:40:01.280 --> 04:40:02.470 align:start position:0%
date of 6 June 30 2025 would be
considered

04:40:02.470 --> 04:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
considered
 
04:40:07.430 --> 04:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
current um 43 of those 620 contracts
 
04:40:07.440 --> 04:40:08.350 align:start position:0%
current um 43 of those 620 contracts
have

04:40:08.350 --> 04:40:08.360 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:40:11.350 --> 04:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
expired uh on a percentage basis that
 
04:40:15.310 --> 04:40:15.320 align:start position:0%
means that 93% of the contracts on file
 
04:40:17.590 --> 04:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
which we which I believe is a pretty
 
04:40:20.470 --> 04:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
comprehensive inventory of the contracts
 
04:40:23.310 --> 04:40:23.320 align:start position:0%
uh currently in place in the state 93%
 
04:40:26.948 --> 04:40:26.958 align:start position:0%
are current and only 7% have
 
04:40:30.350 --> 04:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
expired that is a uh a very good
 
04:40:32.788 --> 04:40:32.798 align:start position:0%
percentage of current contracts versus
 
04:40:36.788 --> 04:40:36.798 align:start position:0%
expired contracts compared to the
 
04:40:39.510 --> 04:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
history 101 15 years ago obviously those
 
04:40:42.110 --> 04:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
percentages can fluctuate
 
04:40:44.868 --> 04:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
depending on a variety of factors um and
 
04:40:47.910 --> 04:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
I have distributed today a list of the
 
04:40:50.190 --> 04:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
43 expired
 
04:40:53.190 --> 04:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
contracts I also have a 16-page
 
04:40:54.628 --> 04:40:54.638 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet which I'm not going to hand
 
04:40:56.510 --> 04:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
out today but which I can submit to the
 
04:41:00.390 --> 04:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
board of all 620 contracts if you were
 
04:41:02.150 --> 04:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
interested in in going through that
 
04:41:05.270 --> 04:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
information but if you look at the uh
 
04:41:08.708 --> 04:41:08.718 align:start position:0%
handout of the 43 expired you'll notice
 
04:41:10.830 --> 04:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
that a lot of those expired contracts
 
04:41:12.510 --> 04:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
expired in
 
04:41:15.670 --> 04:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
2024 and a lot of those expired December
 
04:41:17.590 --> 04:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
31st of
 
04:41:20.430 --> 04:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
2024 which means that there may be new
 
04:41:22.070 --> 04:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
contracts in place yet which haven't
 
04:41:24.788 --> 04:41:24.798 align:start position:0%
made it to our office uh and another
 
04:41:28.070 --> 04:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
large category is June 30 uh
 
04:41:32.390 --> 04:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
2024 not every employer uh and every
 
04:41:36.310 --> 04:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
Union um files their contracts in a
 
04:41:38.230 --> 04:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
timely manner we go hunting for them
 
04:41:40.628 --> 04:41:40.638 align:start position:0%
from time to time on uh public employer
 
04:41:43.270 --> 04:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
websites and then we contact public
 
04:41:47.628 --> 04:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
employers um as well that's a ongoing
 
04:41:52.628 --> 04:41:52.638 align:start position:0%
process um so my input is that the
 
04:41:54.830 --> 04:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
current system of bargaining seems to be
 
04:41:57.750 --> 04:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
working very well uh we do get unfair
 
04:42:00.510 --> 04:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
labor practices in our office which uh
 
04:42:02.910 --> 04:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
require contested hearings and sometimes
 
04:42:05.708 --> 04:42:05.718 align:start position:0%
those cases relate to the bargaining
 
04:42:08.628 --> 04:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
process um I would say the number of
 
04:42:10.470 --> 04:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
those types of cases in the last few
 
04:42:12.190 --> 04:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
years is
 
04:42:15.390 --> 04:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
uh not that there was uh an accessibly
 
04:42:18.110 --> 04:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
high number before but they periodically
 
04:42:20.868 --> 04:42:20.878 align:start position:0%
uh would come in
 
04:42:23.590 --> 04:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
um I I think the only other two things I
 
04:42:26.310 --> 04:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
want to say are some comments about
 
04:42:30.628 --> 04:42:30.638 align:start position:0%
House Bill 580 which was filed in
 
04:42:33.350 --> 04:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
2011 and then just to briefly mention
 
04:42:36.070 --> 04:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
the steps in the bargaining process uh
 
04:42:37.390 --> 04:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
so beginning with the steps in the
 
04:42:41.990 --> 04:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
bargaining process um there three basic
 
04:42:46.628 --> 04:42:46.638 align:start position:0%
steps uh negotiations ratification and
 
04:42:49.150 --> 04:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
then cost item approvals by the local
 
04:42:52.830 --> 04:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
legislative body for example uh at town
 
04:42:56.190 --> 04:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
meeting so in terms of negotiations uh
 
04:42:58.830 --> 04:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
the unions and the public employer uh
 
04:43:01.550 --> 04:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
board are free to structure those as
 
04:43:05.590 --> 04:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
they see fit uh some employers employ uh
 
04:43:07.830 --> 04:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
an attorney to conduct all
 
04:43:10.230 --> 04:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
negotiations uh some have a bargaining
 
04:43:12.030 --> 04:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
team which may consist of a
 
04:43:14.830 --> 04:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
representative from a board of Selectmen
 
04:43:18.390 --> 04:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh an HR person who has
 
04:43:21.310 --> 04:43:21.320 align:start position:0%
information uh relevant to negotiations
 
04:43:24.070 --> 04:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
and then perhaps also an attorney uh
 
04:43:27.310 --> 04:43:27.320 align:start position:0%
likewise for the unions uh for not to
 
04:43:30.070 --> 04:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
pick on the Nea but uh they have
 
04:43:32.270 --> 04:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
uniserve directors for various regions
 
04:43:34.430 --> 04:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
in the state they may work on some
 
04:43:37.868 --> 04:43:37.878 align:start position:0%
contracts uh and sometimes the employees
 
04:43:40.350 --> 04:43:40.360 align:start position:0%
with who have experience in the process
 
04:43:42.628 --> 04:43:42.638 align:start position:0%
handle the neg iations on their
 
04:43:47.270 --> 04:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
own it's possible that uh a quorum of a
 
04:43:50.470 --> 04:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
public board uh conven to conduct
 
04:43:53.708 --> 04:43:53.718 align:start position:0%
negotiations and my understanding of uh
 
04:43:53.718 --> 04:43:54.830 align:start position:0%
negotiations and my understanding of uh
RSA

04:43:54.830 --> 04:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
04:43:58.110 --> 04:43:58.120 align:start position:0%
91a uh and I've been an attorney since
 
04:44:00.510 --> 04:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
1989 and I think that law is fairly
 
04:44:01.990 --> 04:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
clear in the first
 
04:44:03.990 --> 04:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph uh the public meeting
 
04:44:06.390 --> 04:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
requirements and the notice requirements
 
04:44:08.470 --> 04:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
apply if there is a quorum of a public
 
04:44:08.480 --> 04:44:09.390 align:start position:0%
apply if there is a quorum of a public
board

04:44:09.390 --> 04:44:09.400 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:44:11.628 --> 04:44:11.638 align:start position:0%
meeting uh and
 
04:44:14.350 --> 04:44:14.360 align:start position:0%
my understanding of that law uh would be
 
04:44:15.830 --> 04:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
that for example if you had a five
 
04:44:17.590 --> 04:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
member Board of Selectmen and you had
 
04:44:21.270 --> 04:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
three members of that board meeting for
 
04:44:23.150 --> 04:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
any reason that that would be considered
 
04:44:25.470 --> 04:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
a quorum which would be sufficient to
 
04:44:28.628 --> 04:44:28.638 align:start position:0%
trigger uh all the public meeting notice
 
04:44:30.550 --> 04:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
protections and requirements that are in
 
04:44:33.470 --> 04:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
91a I know there was a comment that if
 
04:44:36.310 --> 04:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
there was a subcommittee then if uh that
 
04:44:38.550 --> 04:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee had a quorum present that
 
04:44:41.030 --> 04:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
that could trigger as well I'm the I'm
 
04:44:42.868 --> 04:44:42.878 align:start position:0%
not here to offer an opinion on that I
 
04:44:44.510 --> 04:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
don't I've never encountered that and
 
04:44:46.590 --> 04:44:46.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying whether that's correct or
 
04:44:49.430 --> 04:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
not uh but my understanding of the law
 
04:44:53.830 --> 04:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
is that um you do need a a a quorum of
 
04:44:56.150 --> 04:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
the full board in order to trigger the
 
04:44:57.708 --> 04:44:57.718 align:start position:0%
public meeting requirement same thing is
 
04:45:00.350 --> 04:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
true with my board
 
04:45:05.110 --> 04:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
um so onto the uh negotiation process
 
04:45:06.750 --> 04:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
the goal of the parties is to reach a
 
04:45:08.550 --> 04:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
tenative agreement and they are under
 
04:45:11.550 --> 04:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
strict uh deadline
 
04:45:13.070 --> 04:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh and if you were interested in
 
04:45:15.350 --> 04:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
visiting our website and went to the
 
04:45:19.150 --> 04:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
FAQs you'll find a
 
04:45:22.510 --> 04:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
um document which has all the applicable
 
04:45:24.510 --> 04:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
deadlines in the bargaining process and
 
04:45:27.070 --> 04:45:27.080 align:start position:0%
and those deadlines are all based on the
 
04:45:29.788 --> 04:45:29.798 align:start position:0%
budget submission date uh and in the
 
04:45:32.470 --> 04:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
case of town meeting uh there there
 
04:45:34.830 --> 04:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
needs to be ample opportunity to get any
 
04:45:37.590 --> 04:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
new contract the cost items of any new
 
04:45:39.590 --> 04:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
contract on a warrant article so that it
 
04:45:41.628 --> 04:45:41.638 align:start position:0%
gets presented at Town meeting because
 
04:45:45.110 --> 04:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
if that deadline is missed then uh for
 
04:45:47.948 --> 04:45:47.958 align:start position:0%
most public employers that tenative
 
04:45:50.230 --> 04:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
agreement and those cost items will not
 
04:45:52.910 --> 04:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
be in front of that uh local legislative
 
04:45:55.110 --> 04:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
body for another year I think for school
 
04:45:57.750 --> 04:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
districts there may be an opportunity to
 
04:46:00.910 --> 04:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
petition for um a special meeting if
 
04:46:03.750 --> 04:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
those deadlines are missed so so it is a
 
04:46:03.760 --> 04:46:05.628 align:start position:0%
those deadlines are missed so so it is a
time-sensitive

04:46:05.628 --> 04:46:05.638 align:start position:0%
time-sensitive
 
04:46:09.670 --> 04:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
process uh parties are required to meet
 
04:46:11.270 --> 04:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh at reasonable times and place places
 
04:46:13.070 --> 04:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
which includes during the
 
04:46:18.510 --> 04:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
workday uh if there are if this process
 
04:46:21.750 --> 04:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
is subject to the requirements of 91a
 
04:46:24.788 --> 04:46:24.798 align:start position:0%
you would have to factor in uh public
 
04:46:27.190 --> 04:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
notice requirements uh maybe
 
04:46:30.510 --> 04:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
considerations of venue uh because if
 
04:46:32.948 --> 04:46:32.958 align:start position:0%
it's a public meeting now then not only
 
04:46:34.548 --> 04:46:34.558 align:start position:0%
does it need to be noticed but it would
 
04:46:36.590 --> 04:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
need to be held in an environment where
 
04:46:40.270 --> 04:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
it could be accessed either in person or
 
04:46:42.350 --> 04:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
um through video
 
04:46:44.910 --> 04:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
feed um so the parties are under
 
04:46:46.548 --> 04:46:46.558 align:start position:0%
pressure to to reach a tenative
 
04:46:48.948 --> 04:46:48.958 align:start position:0%
agreement um they typically work off of
 
04:46:50.990 --> 04:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
the existing contract there was
 
04:46:53.548 --> 04:46:53.558 align:start position:0%
discussion about what's the difference
 
04:46:55.030 --> 04:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
between when the parties are at the
 
04:46:56.470 --> 04:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
bargaining table and that's the
 
04:46:58.030 --> 04:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
expression we use when they're facing
 
04:46:58.948 --> 04:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
each other when they're at the
 
04:47:01.670 --> 04:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
bargaining table and and how does that
 
04:47:04.868 --> 04:47:04.878 align:start position:0%
differ from when they Retreat to their
 
04:47:07.670 --> 04:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
own own quarters to decide how to
 
04:47:11.510 --> 04:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
proceed um one
 
04:47:12.868 --> 04:47:12.878 align:start position:0%
when they're at the bargaining table
 
04:47:15.070 --> 04:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with each other and I
 
04:47:18.350 --> 04:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
think the the hope of this bill is to
 
04:47:21.708 --> 04:47:21.718 align:start position:0%
expose that part and make it subject to
 
04:47:25.670 --> 04:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
91a uh but when they caucus out of the
 
04:47:27.430 --> 04:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
presence of the other party then that
 
04:47:29.628 --> 04:47:29.638 align:start position:0%
would not be subject to any
 
04:47:31.670 --> 04:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
91a uh
 
04:47:33.750 --> 04:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
requirements if they reach a tenative
 
04:47:37.230 --> 04:47:37.240 align:start position:0%
agreement uh then the next step is
 
04:47:39.430 --> 04:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
ratification uh the UN the unions
 
04:47:41.270 --> 04:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
typically will present the tenative
 
04:47:43.230 --> 04:47:43.240 align:start position:0%
agreement to to the employees in the
 
04:47:46.430 --> 04:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
bargaining unit for a vote and the
 
04:47:49.030 --> 04:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
bargaining team for the employer will go
 
04:47:50.868 --> 04:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
back to the board of Selectmen for
 
04:47:53.110 --> 04:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
example and present the tenative
 
04:47:55.590 --> 04:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
agreement both sides need to approve
 
04:47:58.070 --> 04:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
that in order for them the agreement
 
04:48:00.628 --> 04:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
either become final or if there is are
 
04:48:03.750 --> 04:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
cost items also known as new money then
 
04:48:05.868 --> 04:48:05.878 align:start position:0%
the cost items would need to be approved
 
04:48:07.708 --> 04:48:07.718 align:start position:0%
for example a town meeting for the
 
04:48:11.270 --> 04:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
contract to become final uh T town town
 
04:48:14.150 --> 04:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
meeting doesn't vote on the rest of the
 
04:48:15.830 --> 04:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
contract and there are a number of New
 
04:48:17.708 --> 04:48:17.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Supreme Court decisions
 
04:48:21.070 --> 04:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
on that point under the current law if
 
04:48:23.868 --> 04:48:23.878 align:start position:0%
the parties are unable to come up with a
 
04:48:25.548 --> 04:48:25.558 align:start position:0%
a tenative agreement they're said to be
 
04:48:28.030 --> 04:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
a bargaining impass and there are formal
 
04:48:29.948 --> 04:48:29.958 align:start position:0%
procedures that they have to follow to
 
04:48:31.548 --> 04:48:31.558 align:start position:0%
try to break that impass there's
 
04:48:35.110 --> 04:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
contract mediation and fact finding uh
 
04:48:37.150 --> 04:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
we have a list of what are called
 
04:48:39.948 --> 04:48:39.958 align:start position:0%
neutrals who work in that area parties
 
04:48:41.708 --> 04:48:41.718 align:start position:0%
petition us for the appointment if they
 
04:48:43.430 --> 04:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
can't agree on somebody on their own and
 
04:48:45.470 --> 04:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
they go through that process and either
 
04:48:45.480 --> 04:48:46.270 align:start position:0%
they go through that process and either
through

04:48:46.270 --> 04:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:48:49.310 --> 04:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
mediation uh which is not a uh
 
04:48:51.190 --> 04:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
individual excuse me if you could just
 
04:48:53.948 --> 04:48:53.958 align:start position:0%
focus on the on the particulars of this
 
04:48:56.070 --> 04:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
bill okay not the whole negotiation
 
04:48:58.030 --> 04:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
process so okay I thought that might be
 
04:49:01.310 --> 04:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
helpful for the context uh obviously I'm
 
04:49:03.110 --> 04:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
not here
 
04:49:06.990 --> 04:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
uh to recommend is in terms of policy
 
04:49:08.390 --> 04:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
what what the committee how the
 
04:49:11.670 --> 04:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
committee proceeds um the last thing I
 
04:49:14.430 --> 04:49:14.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention was in 2011 House Bill
 
04:49:17.990 --> 04:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
580 essentially proposed the same thing
 
04:49:20.190 --> 04:49:20.200 align:start position:0%
uh there the the bill was referred to
 
04:49:22.948 --> 04:49:22.958 align:start position:0%
study committee uh there were six study
 
04:49:26.868 --> 04:49:26.878 align:start position:0%
committee meetings um and I researched
 
04:49:29.788 --> 04:49:29.798 align:start position:0%
that bill before I came here I I think I
 
04:49:32.470 --> 04:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
did it a month ago and there is I think
 
04:49:35.670 --> 04:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
a 79 or 80 page report on file that you
 
04:49:38.868 --> 04:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
can access which has the results of that
 
04:49:41.110 --> 04:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
the committee recommendations
 
04:49:42.990 --> 04:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
uh they did not
 
04:49:45.990 --> 04:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
adopt the proposal that's in this bill
 
04:49:48.470 --> 04:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
but they did make some minor changes to
 
04:49:50.628 --> 04:49:50.638 align:start position:0%
to 73a for
 
04:49:53.830 --> 04:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
example um they added a step in
 
04:49:56.070 --> 04:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
bargaining impass to allow with
 
04:49:58.150 --> 04:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
agreement either party to make a
 
04:50:00.910 --> 04:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
presentation directly to for example all
 
04:50:02.990 --> 04:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
of the employees in the bargaining unit
 
04:50:06.590 --> 04:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
or all the members of the board involved
 
04:50:09.868 --> 04:50:09.878 align:start position:0%
and the objective of that was to try to
 
04:50:12.030 --> 04:50:12.040 align:start position:0%
take action that might help the parties
 
04:50:15.590 --> 04:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
get contracts done um because I think
 
04:50:18.510 --> 04:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
there was a sense back then that if
 
04:50:21.350 --> 04:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
there was more information available it
 
04:50:24.310 --> 04:50:24.320 align:start position:0%
might uh it might enhance the potential
 
04:50:26.190 --> 04:50:26.200 align:start position:0%
to reach an
 
04:50:31.390 --> 04:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:36.868 --> 04:50:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:59.350 --> 04:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:00.948 --> 04:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh members of
 
04:51:02.110 --> 04:51:02.120 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record Brian
 
04:51:04.070 --> 04:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
Hawkins uh representing Nea New
 
04:51:08.230 --> 04:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we represent um uh numerous
 
04:51:11.030 --> 04:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
K uh 12 bargaining units uh across the
 
04:51:14.990 --> 04:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
state and um and some of which uh were
 
04:51:17.470 --> 04:51:17.480 align:start position:0%
referenced in earlier testimony uh we're
 
04:51:20.190 --> 04:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
here in opposition to the bill uh our
 
04:51:22.948 --> 04:51:22.958 align:start position:0%
concern here and this has come up before
 
04:51:25.548 --> 04:51:25.558 align:start position:0%
the legislature before uh as director
 
04:51:27.510 --> 04:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
inera mentioned it's been uh I think
 
04:51:29.190 --> 04:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
voted down at least a couple of times in
 
04:51:31.830 --> 04:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
the last decade uh we're worried that
 
04:51:36.510 --> 04:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
this uh will slow the process uh down as
 
04:51:38.628 --> 04:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
far as the negotiating process as was
 
04:51:41.310 --> 04:51:41.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier um the parties are
 
04:51:44.030 --> 04:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
under some very strict timelines uh to
 
04:51:47.310 --> 04:51:47.320 align:start position:0%
get uh something to put before their
 
04:51:49.910 --> 04:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
respective uh voting bodies whether it's
 
04:51:52.548 --> 04:51:52.558 align:start position:0%
the school board and the and the union
 
04:51:55.070 --> 04:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
membership or or whichever public body
 
04:51:57.990 --> 04:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
that is um especially when you're
 
04:51:59.628 --> 04:51:59.638 align:start position:0%
talking about cost items because those
 
04:52:01.750 --> 04:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
those obviously have to go before the
 
04:52:04.190 --> 04:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
voters and so the voters do see those as
 
04:52:06.830 --> 04:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
you know um they're going to be seeing a
 
04:52:08.708 --> 04:52:08.718 align:start position:0%
number of them uh in just a few weeks
 
04:52:12.948 --> 04:52:12.958 align:start position:0%
here uh in March so so um it's hard
 
04:52:15.510 --> 04:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
enough I think um especially with some
 
04:52:18.110 --> 04:52:18.120 align:start position:0%
of the workforce challenges that we have
 
04:52:23.310 --> 04:52:23.320 align:start position:0%
today um to schedule and make the time
 
04:52:26.670 --> 04:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
to even get the process going and to
 
04:52:29.788 --> 04:52:29.798 align:start position:0%
have a schedule uh and I mean that not
 
04:52:31.510 --> 04:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
only for the employees but for the for
 
04:52:36.150 --> 04:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
the employer as well um and so uh this
 
04:52:40.070 --> 04:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
adds another layer to that um the other
 
04:52:42.510 --> 04:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
thing that I want to mention um as I
 
04:52:46.230 --> 04:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
said before you know the these uh
 
04:52:47.990 --> 04:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
anything that has to do with a cost item
 
04:52:50.190 --> 04:52:50.200 align:start position:0%
do have to go before the voters which
 
04:52:54.190 --> 04:52:54.200 align:start position:0%
they can vote down um and as far as
 
04:52:56.990 --> 04:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
having an open meeting our position is
 
04:52:59.430 --> 04:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
that should be a decision made by the
 
04:52:59.440 --> 04:53:00.310 align:start position:0%
that should be a decision made by the
two

04:53:00.310 --> 04:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:53:03.070 --> 04:53:03.080 align:start position:0%
parties um when they're establishing the
 
04:53:08.070 --> 04:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
ground rules of of of going in and so um
 
04:53:12.628 --> 04:53:12.638 align:start position:0%
for those reasons uh we uh we oppose the
 
04:53:15.190 --> 04:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
bill and uh happy to take any
 
04:53:18.590 --> 04:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
questions any questions representative
 
04:53:20.990 --> 04:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
menos thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:53:23.708 --> 04:53:23.718 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so the parties
 
04:53:25.868 --> 04:53:25.878 align:start position:0%
aside from from the statute and the
 
04:53:28.548 --> 04:53:28.558 align:start position:0%
proposed changes the parties could agree
 
04:53:31.310 --> 04:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
to do their bargaining in
 
04:53:34.110 --> 04:53:34.120 align:start position:0%
public uh that yes uh there's nothing
 
04:53:36.230 --> 04:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
stopping them from doing that um if they
 
04:53:40.628 --> 04:53:40.638 align:start position:0%
wanted to um you know I think uh one of
 
04:53:44.270 --> 04:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
the things that has been is helpful is
 
04:53:46.670 --> 04:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
to be able to like I said with tight
 
04:53:48.548 --> 04:53:48.558 align:start position:0%
timelines is really you know getting
 
04:53:50.510 --> 04:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
down to those just like in the
 
04:53:52.150 --> 04:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
legislature you know when you're having
 
04:53:54.390 --> 04:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
a committee of conference there's what
 
04:53:58.070 --> 04:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
happens here and then there's the actual
 
04:54:02.270 --> 04:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
negotiation um and so uh and that's
 
04:54:07.310 --> 04:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
just that's just you know uh so um I
 
04:54:10.548 --> 04:54:10.558 align:start position:0%
think that in in this instance as as I
 
04:54:13.548 --> 04:54:13.558 align:start position:0%
said when there's um you don't this
 
04:54:15.390 --> 04:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
could actually have the opposite effect
 
04:54:17.190 --> 04:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
of driving further those conversations
 
04:54:19.628 --> 04:54:19.638 align:start position:0%
where it's you know U sort of behind the
 
04:54:22.788 --> 04:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
scenes if that's what the goal was so um
 
04:54:24.310 --> 04:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
hope that helps answer the
 
04:54:26.910 --> 04:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
question any other questions
 
04:54:26.920 --> 04:54:28.030 align:start position:0%
question any other questions
representative

04:54:28.030 --> 04:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:54:30.230 --> 04:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
Andress thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:54:33.350 --> 04:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
for taking my question can the voters
 
04:54:35.350 --> 04:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
themselves like in the school district
 
04:54:41.230 --> 04:54:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:44.310 --> 04:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh not to my knowledge but I I'll be
 
04:54:47.350 --> 04:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
honest I uh there's probably somebody
 
04:54:49.350 --> 04:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
else who could better answer whether
 
04:54:53.590 --> 04:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
there's some law that uh um indicates
 
04:54:54.750 --> 04:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
whether they can or not so I I don't
 
04:54:55.948 --> 04:54:55.958 align:start position:0%
want to I don't want to give you
 
04:54:58.510 --> 04:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
information that's that's not accurate
 
04:55:00.628 --> 04:55:00.638 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Alexander
 
04:55:02.150 --> 04:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:55:03.390 --> 04:55:03.400 align:start position:0%
my question I think representative
 
04:55:05.548 --> 04:55:05.558 align:start position:0%
Andrews asks a great question would Nea
 
04:55:09.470 --> 04:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire support a bill enabling
 
04:55:11.990 --> 04:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
towns to adopt opt the open negotiation
 
04:55:13.430 --> 04:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
process through a town
 
04:55:15.868 --> 04:55:15.878 align:start position:0%
warrant through a town warrant Town
 
04:55:15.878 --> 04:55:18.150 align:start position:0%
warrant through a town warrant Town
warrant

04:55:18.150 --> 04:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
04:55:18.160 --> 04:55:20.510 align:start position:0%
warrant
article

04:55:20.510 --> 04:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
article
 
04:55:22.990 --> 04:55:23.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I think this is I think
 
04:55:25.670 --> 04:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
this goes to the to sort of the role of
 
04:55:30.708 --> 04:55:30.718 align:start position:0%
the way uh the 273a is set up so you
 
04:55:32.910 --> 04:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
have the negotiation sessions and then
 
04:55:35.788 --> 04:55:35.798 align:start position:0%
it is the cost items that go before the
 
04:55:39.910 --> 04:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
voters as director angol said before so
 
04:55:41.510 --> 04:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh it's the responsibility of the
 
04:55:44.110 --> 04:55:44.120 align:start position:0%
parties to have that negotiations and
 
04:55:46.910 --> 04:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
bring before their respective bodies an
 
04:55:49.390 --> 04:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
agreement so if you are now saying that
 
04:55:52.948 --> 04:55:52.958 align:start position:0%
the legislative body is going to uh sort
 
04:55:55.030 --> 04:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
of impact that process I don't I don't
 
04:55:59.548 --> 04:55:59.558 align:start position:0%
think that that is the right um approach
 
04:56:03.708 --> 04:56:03.718 align:start position:0%
in uh it sort of it sort of mixes the
 
04:56:06.150 --> 04:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
the the two processes together and I I I
 
04:56:08.868 --> 04:56:08.878 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that that would be helpful
 
04:56:12.910 --> 04:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
again I'm coming here to say as as a
 
04:56:15.270 --> 04:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
policy matter for the
 
04:56:18.830 --> 04:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
legislature uh I I think you want to
 
04:56:20.910 --> 04:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
have these agreements before voters as I
 
04:56:23.070 --> 04:56:23.080 align:start position:0%
said there is huge Workforce challenges
 
04:56:25.470 --> 04:56:25.480 align:start position:0%
not only in education but in law
 
04:56:29.788 --> 04:56:29.798 align:start position:0%
enforcement in uh firefighting and so
 
04:56:33.150 --> 04:56:33.160 align:start position:0%
having um those negotiation sessions
 
04:56:34.590 --> 04:56:34.600 align:start position:0%
produce an agreement that's going to
 
04:56:38.230 --> 04:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
allow your um Community to not only
 
04:56:41.230 --> 04:56:41.240 align:start position:0%
recruit but retain Cur employees I think
 
04:56:43.070 --> 04:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
that that ought to be the goal and of
 
04:56:45.868 --> 04:56:45.878 align:start position:0%
course as I said that goes before the
 
04:56:48.548 --> 04:56:48.558 align:start position:0%
voters ultimately um every
 
04:56:52.110 --> 04:56:52.120 align:start position:0%
March I I so I guess I I'm guess I'm
 
04:56:55.708 --> 04:56:55.718 align:start position:0%
asking if this if this was amended to
 
04:56:59.708 --> 04:56:59.718 align:start position:0%
allow towns to put or or a voters to put
 
04:57:03.150 --> 04:57:03.160 align:start position:0%
a petition warrant article to mandate
 
04:57:06.590 --> 04:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
that their negotiations are done in
 
04:57:09.708 --> 04:57:09.718 align:start position:0%
public so it's a local option I guess
 
04:57:10.910 --> 04:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering
 
04:57:12.750 --> 04:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
would you still be opposed to it because
 
04:57:15.788 --> 04:57:15.798 align:start position:0%
it the I mean the local voters are the
 
04:57:15.798 --> 04:57:16.708 align:start position:0%
it the I mean the local voters are the
ones

04:57:16.708 --> 04:57:16.718 align:start position:0%
ones
 
04:57:19.070 --> 04:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
that have the say at the end of the day
 
04:57:21.708 --> 04:57:21.718 align:start position:0%
so yeah I I think we would still be
 
04:57:25.948 --> 04:57:25.958 align:start position:0%
opposed to it because again the product
 
04:57:28.590 --> 04:57:28.600 align:start position:0%
that is the purview of the legislative
 
04:57:32.390 --> 04:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
body uh goes before those voters they
 
04:57:34.150 --> 04:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
they get that on the whether it's the
 
04:57:36.788 --> 04:57:36.798 align:start position:0%
warrant or the traditional town meeting
 
04:57:38.270 --> 04:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
um or in the city council form of
 
04:57:39.788 --> 04:57:39.798 align:start position:0%
government they get they get that
 
04:57:42.548 --> 04:57:42.558 align:start position:0%
product and that um ultimately is is
 
04:57:45.670 --> 04:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
what is um voted on so I think that's
 
04:57:48.590 --> 04:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
the right balance representative paig
 
04:57:50.030 --> 04:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chairman thanks for
 
04:57:53.430 --> 04:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question piggybacking off of
 
04:57:55.788 --> 04:57:55.798 align:start position:0%
um representative Anderson the theme
 
04:57:58.670 --> 04:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
here about legislative involvement in
 
04:58:00.990 --> 04:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
this and this may surprise some of my
 
04:58:01.910 --> 04:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
colleagues but I think I'm going to
 
04:58:05.548 --> 04:58:05.558 align:start position:0%
strike a conservative tone here and um
 
04:58:08.470 --> 04:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
for limited government and I wonder if
 
04:58:10.510 --> 04:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
this scenario is possible if a candidate
 
04:58:13.030 --> 04:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
running for school board made it their
 
04:58:16.548 --> 04:58:16.558 align:start position:0%
platform that they wanted to be open and
 
04:58:17.868 --> 04:58:17.878 align:start position:0%
transparent with
 
04:58:19.910 --> 04:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
negotiations would that remove the
 
04:58:21.510 --> 04:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
legislature from any of this business
 
04:58:23.430 --> 04:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
and allow the voters directly to decide
 
04:58:25.270 --> 04:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
about that issue and how contract
 
04:58:28.830 --> 04:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
negotiations take place in their um town
 
04:58:31.230 --> 04:58:31.240 align:start position:0%
or wherever do you follow my question
 
04:58:32.708 --> 04:58:32.718 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm sorry representative I'm not
 
04:58:36.310 --> 04:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
sure I do so taking out the legislative
 
04:58:40.670 --> 04:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
idea of giving a opin or whatever
 
04:58:43.270 --> 04:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't a more direct vote a direct
 
04:58:45.430 --> 04:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
route to get the voter
 
04:58:48.750 --> 04:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
sentiment be a candidate for running for
 
04:58:51.788 --> 04:58:51.798 align:start position:0%
school board to pledge that their
 
04:58:54.310 --> 04:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
motivating force is to open up contract
 
04:58:56.548 --> 04:58:56.558 align:start position:0%
negotiations and then the voters could
 
04:58:59.070 --> 04:58:59.080 align:start position:0%
have that decision I think that could be
 
04:59:00.670 --> 04:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
a more direct route or even a more
 
04:59:02.708 --> 04:59:02.718 align:start position:0%
direct route would be you know that that
 
04:59:04.670 --> 04:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
is something that they want their
 
04:59:07.430 --> 04:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
negotiating team to explore when they
 
04:59:10.670 --> 04:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
are establishing the ground rules
 
04:59:12.470 --> 04:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
so any other
 
04:59:15.510 --> 04:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
04:59:33.788 --> 04:59:33.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:36.350 --> 04:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
Cohen good afternoon my name is Sarah
 
04:59:38.310 --> 04:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
Burke Cohen I represent the New
 
04:59:40.628 --> 04:59:40.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association
 
04:59:44.510 --> 04:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
um we are opposed to uh this bill um
 
04:59:46.390 --> 04:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining negotiations have
 
04:59:48.190 --> 04:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
always been exempt from the right to a
 
04:59:51.628 --> 04:59:51.638 align:start position:0%
law and should continue to be so um try
 
04:59:54.270 --> 04:59:54.280 align:start position:0%
I'll try not to um reiterate what some
 
04:59:56.510 --> 04:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
of my previous colleagues have said um
 
04:59:58.590 --> 04:59:58.600 align:start position:0%
the ability to negotiate in private
 
05:00:00.670 --> 05:00:00.680 align:start position:0%
Fosters compromise I think that's a key
 
05:00:02.190 --> 05:00:02.200 align:start position:0%
ingredient to
 
05:00:04.750 --> 05:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
negotiations uh requiring public bodies
 
05:00:06.628 --> 05:00:06.638 align:start position:0%
and unions representatives to hold
 
05:00:10.030 --> 05:00:10.040 align:start position:0%
negoti negotiating sessions in public
 
05:00:11.628 --> 05:00:11.638 align:start position:0%
likely could lead to grandstanding and
 
05:00:14.110 --> 05:00:14.120 align:start position:0%
hardening of additions on both sides
 
05:00:17.430 --> 05:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
which would increase the amount of time
 
05:00:20.390 --> 05:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
um and to take to get to an agreement
 
05:00:22.190 --> 05:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
delaying the agreement and it would
 
05:00:24.310 --> 05:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of cost to
 
05:00:26.830 --> 05:00:26.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities um for those negotiating
 
05:00:28.830 --> 05:00:28.840 align:start position:0%
sessions I think the other thing to
 
05:00:32.310 --> 05:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
consider is um drawing a sharp
 
05:00:33.788 --> 05:00:33.798 align:start position:0%
distinction between strategy and
 
05:00:35.868 --> 05:00:35.878 align:start position:0%
negotiations can be difficult in the
 
05:00:38.990 --> 05:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
public meeting process um if you're in a
 
05:00:42.670 --> 05:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
public meeting it would be sort of being
 
05:00:45.310 --> 05:00:45.320 align:start position:0%
in compliance with 91a and making sure
 
05:00:48.030 --> 05:00:48.040 align:start position:0%
you are popping from public meeting back
 
05:00:51.390 --> 05:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
to um a non- me a nonpublic session and
 
05:00:54.430 --> 05:00:54.440 align:start position:0%
back back into public meeting um could
 
05:00:57.830 --> 05:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
make a recordkeeping near
 
05:01:01.548 --> 05:01:01.558 align:start position:0%
impossible finally if it's the goal of
 
05:01:04.628 --> 05:01:04.638 align:start position:0%
uh the bill for more open process um
 
05:01:07.830 --> 05:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
potentially this uh could uh would not
 
05:01:10.230 --> 05:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
work just by virtue of I think what we
 
05:01:12.390 --> 05:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
were getting at with the subcommittees
 
05:01:14.628 --> 05:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
and the Quorum um there is also a
 
05:01:17.230 --> 05:01:17.240 align:start position:0%
possibility that a subcommittee could
 
05:01:19.670 --> 05:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
appoint one single person to be The
 
05:01:22.670 --> 05:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
Negotiator um and those negotiations
 
05:01:25.670 --> 05:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
then would no longer be um would no
 
05:01:27.510 --> 05:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
longer fall under 91a because it
 
05:01:30.670 --> 05:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a a quum of the public body
 
05:01:33.708 --> 05:01:33.718 align:start position:0%
um I'll take questions representative
 
05:01:35.708 --> 05:01:35.718 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you Mr chair and thank
 
05:01:38.230 --> 05:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
you great to see you again um would nhma
 
05:01:40.470 --> 05:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
support the legislation if we made it a
 
05:01:40.480 --> 05:01:41.990 align:start position:0%
support the legislation if we made it a
local

05:01:41.990 --> 05:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
local
 
05:01:44.868 --> 05:01:44.878 align:start position:0%
option I would love to see that language
 
05:01:46.788 --> 05:01:46.798 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander And if you
 
05:01:48.310 --> 05:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
would like to send it to us I'm sure we
 
05:01:51.030 --> 05:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
can take a look at it good answer thank
 
05:01:51.040 --> 05:01:53.030 align:start position:0%
can take a look at it good answer thank
representative

05:01:53.030 --> 05:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:01:56.150 --> 05:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
Horgan um yes I was wondering you know
 
05:01:58.030 --> 05:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
the this supplies only the management
 
05:01:59.788 --> 05:01:59.798 align:start position:0%
because they're they're a public body
 
05:02:02.390 --> 05:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
the Union Local isn't but would it
 
05:02:04.948 --> 05:02:04.958 align:start position:0%
workaround if we did pass this could
 
05:02:07.868 --> 05:02:07.878 align:start position:0%
some public uh could the some public
 
05:02:10.470 --> 05:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
employers try to get around it by just
 
05:02:12.788 --> 05:02:12.798 align:start position:0%
turning over the nuts and Bolson
 
05:02:14.670 --> 05:02:14.680 align:start position:0%
negotiation over to a lawyer or some
 
05:02:16.430 --> 05:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
other third party who's not a public
 
05:02:19.070 --> 05:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
body and therefore not found by
 
05:02:22.510 --> 05:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
91a I think that's what I was somewhat
 
05:02:24.430 --> 05:02:24.440 align:start position:0%
saying that if there is not a quorum of
 
05:02:25.670 --> 05:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
the public body if there's a
 
05:02:27.590 --> 05:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and they appoint one single
 
05:02:30.510 --> 05:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
person a selectman or a school board
 
05:02:32.548 --> 05:02:32.558 align:start position:0%
member to do the negotiations there
 
05:02:34.310 --> 05:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a quum of the public body so
 
05:02:36.910 --> 05:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be a a public
 
05:02:40.270 --> 05:02:40.280 align:start position:0%
meeting any other questions
 
05:02:43.910 --> 05:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you you're
 
05:03:00.430 --> 05:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:03.948 --> 05:03:03.958 align:start position:0%
Kenny button yeah thank you thank you um
 
05:03:05.510 --> 05:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon for the record again my
 
05:03:07.510 --> 05:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
name is Gail Kenny I'm a resident of
 
05:03:11.948 --> 05:03:11.958 align:start position:0%
Kanan New Hampshire um I uh wanted to
 
05:03:13.708 --> 05:03:13.718 align:start position:0%
speak just for a minute or two on this
 
05:03:16.990 --> 05:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
bill um because I have been on both
 
05:03:19.990 --> 05:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
sides both as an employe sitting at the
 
05:03:23.350 --> 05:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
table both as an employer and as an
 
05:03:26.750 --> 05:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
employee over um the times I've been
 
05:03:30.470 --> 05:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
alive and I I just urge you to think
 
05:03:33.350 --> 05:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
about any negotiation that you have been
 
05:03:36.590 --> 05:03:36.600 align:start position:0%
involved in a negotiation for a contract
 
05:03:39.190 --> 05:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
or something which is a give and take
 
05:03:42.310 --> 05:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
process where people on on both sides
 
05:03:46.430 --> 05:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
are on offering their desires and then
 
05:03:49.030 --> 05:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
you come to compromise and then you
 
05:03:52.070 --> 05:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately come to an agreement and if
 
05:03:55.430 --> 05:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
there is a policy that when you're
 
05:03:57.350 --> 05:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
involved in sensitive contract
 
05:04:00.510 --> 05:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
negotiations which require give and take
 
05:04:05.750 --> 05:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
that anybody whether they have a um an a
 
05:04:08.110 --> 05:04:08.120 align:start position:0%
financial interest or that anybody who
 
05:04:11.310 --> 05:04:11.320 align:start position:0%
wants to can sit in on those
 
05:04:13.670 --> 05:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
negotiations um whether they have a
 
05:04:17.548 --> 05:04:17.558 align:start position:0%
direct connection or not will that
 
05:04:21.470 --> 05:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
Foster positive productive negotiations
 
05:04:24.390 --> 05:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
or will it not um in this particular
 
05:04:27.670 --> 05:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
case with public bodies that are working
 
05:04:29.788 --> 05:04:29.798 align:start position:0%
with and trying to to deal with making
 
05:04:32.310 --> 05:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
decisions employment decisions are
 
05:04:36.230 --> 05:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
around wages um benefits and conditions
 
05:04:38.830 --> 05:04:38.840 align:start position:0%
of employment for their employees and
 
05:04:40.590 --> 05:04:40.600 align:start position:0%
likewise for the employees doing the
 
05:04:44.548 --> 05:04:44.558 align:start position:0%
same thing you want to get to a contract
 
05:04:46.948 --> 05:04:46.958 align:start position:0%
resolution that can then be presented to
 
05:04:46.958 --> 05:04:48.030 align:start position:0%
resolution that can then be presented to
the

05:04:48.030 --> 05:04:48.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:04:51.750 --> 05:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
municipality um or the the public entity
 
05:04:55.990 --> 05:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh School District Etc um as efficiently
 
05:04:58.868 --> 05:04:58.878 align:start position:0%
as possible as effectively as possible
 
05:05:04.110 --> 05:05:04.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:07.150 --> 05:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
and the way to do that is for the
 
05:05:10.150 --> 05:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
parties to be able to come together
 
05:05:13.310 --> 05:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
uh to really do that kind of give and
 
05:05:18.030 --> 05:05:18.040 align:start position:0%
take um without there being um a large
 
05:05:22.590 --> 05:05:22.600 align:start position:0%
audience which um every I trust me
 
05:05:24.948 --> 05:05:24.958 align:start position:0%
everybody who is involved in the
 
05:05:27.230 --> 05:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
negotiations if they have a larger
 
05:05:29.750 --> 05:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
audience of people who have a variety of
 
05:05:32.030 --> 05:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
different interests or no interests you
 
05:05:32.040 --> 05:05:33.708 align:start position:0%
different interests or no interests you
know

05:05:33.708 --> 05:05:33.718 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:05:37.910 --> 05:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
on there's you're aware you're aware of
 
05:05:39.628 --> 05:05:39.638 align:start position:0%
what you're saying to that that public
 
05:05:42.910 --> 05:05:42.920 align:start position:0%
public audience and and for um public
 
05:05:44.788 --> 05:05:44.798 align:start position:0%
employers are elected school board
 
05:05:47.110 --> 05:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
members elected select board people you
 
05:05:49.548 --> 05:05:49.558 align:start position:0%
are well aware that the things that
 
05:05:52.110 --> 05:05:52.120 align:start position:0%
you're saying may have an impact on your
 
05:05:54.628 --> 05:05:54.638 align:start position:0%
ability to be reelected that is just
 
05:05:58.230 --> 05:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
reality and that is not the best way to
 
05:06:02.190 --> 05:06:02.200 align:start position:0%
reach positive productive negotiations
 
05:06:04.910 --> 05:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
to get to a contract that's fair for
 
05:06:08.788 --> 05:06:08.798 align:start position:0%
everybody and so this this particular
 
05:06:12.230 --> 05:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
proposal again has been studied before
 
05:06:14.948 --> 05:06:14.958 align:start position:0%
and has been recognized as maybe not
 
05:06:19.350 --> 05:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
being in the best interest of all sides
 
05:06:21.590 --> 05:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
and I would encourage you to again
 
05:06:25.350 --> 05:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
realize that this is not the best way to
 
05:06:28.070 --> 05:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
achieve good contracts for the public
 
05:06:31.750 --> 05:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
good and to find this inexpedient to
 
05:06:34.030 --> 05:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
legislate any
 
05:06:36.150 --> 05:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:06:38.350 --> 05:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
Manos thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:06:41.430 --> 05:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um have you had
 
05:06:43.788 --> 05:06:43.798 align:start position:0%
experience where it's either been more
 
05:06:47.190 --> 05:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
than one public body involved in the
 
05:06:50.270 --> 05:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
negotiation or more than one Union
 
05:06:53.350 --> 05:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
involved in the negotiation and what are
 
05:06:55.910 --> 05:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
the Dynamics like in that situation and
 
05:06:55.920 --> 05:06:59.750 align:start position:0%
the Dynamics like in that situation and
your

05:06:59.750 --> 05:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:02.548 --> 05:07:02.558 align:start position:0%
experience more than one
 
05:07:05.470 --> 05:07:05.480 align:start position:0%
public body I'm thinking not directly
 
05:07:07.670 --> 05:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
involved in the negotiation session but
 
05:07:09.948 --> 05:07:09.958 align:start position:0%
I don't you know I can't speak to every
 
05:07:11.830 --> 05:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
public sector situation and I don't
 
05:07:15.390 --> 05:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
really know um there are um you just
 
05:07:17.110 --> 05:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
take the state of New Hampshire for
 
05:07:19.030 --> 05:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
example in contract negotiations there
 
05:07:22.230 --> 05:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
are a number of different unions um that
 
05:07:24.788 --> 05:07:24.798 align:start position:0%
are involved um overall working for the
 
05:07:27.628 --> 05:07:27.638 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire there are some um
 
05:07:29.910 --> 05:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
and again and I I am not an expert on
 
05:07:31.510 --> 05:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
the the state contracts and so I'm not
 
05:07:33.190 --> 05:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
speaking for the state employees or for
 
05:07:36.150 --> 05:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
the state and government itself but um
 
05:07:38.470 --> 05:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
there are some master agreements or some
 
05:07:42.430 --> 05:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
overarching foundational um tenants that
 
05:07:44.670 --> 05:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
that may involve several different
 
05:07:48.628 --> 05:07:48.638 align:start position:0%
unions uh for a public body um but then
 
05:07:51.270 --> 05:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
there are separate negotiations that
 
05:07:53.750 --> 05:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
would involve each individual Union so
 
05:07:54.910 --> 05:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
05:07:58.590 --> 05:07:58.600 align:start position:0%
subnations around some sort of Master
 
05:08:02.548 --> 05:08:02.558 align:start position:0%
tenants um
 
05:08:05.270 --> 05:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
but you don't want to make it any more
 
05:08:09.868 --> 05:08:09.878 align:start position:0%
complicated you want to get to positive
 
05:08:13.030 --> 05:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
efficient conclusions to contract
 
05:08:16.110 --> 05:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
negotiations not to to um throw a monkey
 
05:08:18.310 --> 05:08:18.320 align:start position:0%
wrench into the works to make them more
 
05:08:21.470 --> 05:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
difficult which I believe this would
 
05:08:23.990 --> 05:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
do are there any other
 
05:08:26.670 --> 05:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank
 
05:08:29.548 --> 05:08:29.558 align:start position:0%
you that's the last card I have for
 
05:08:30.948 --> 05:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
someone to speak on this bill is anyone
 
05:08:33.910 --> 05:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
else that wishes to speak on House Bill
 
05:08:36.230 --> 05:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
400 that has not
 
05:08:38.270 --> 05:08:38.280 align:start position:0%
spoken seeing none I'm going to close
 
05:08:40.270 --> 05:08:40.280 align:start position:0%
the hearing on House Bill
 
05:08:43.030 --> 05:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
400 and we are at that time so we can
 
05:08:46.270 --> 05:08:46.280 align:start position:0%
open up the hearing on House Bill 601 FN
 
05:08:48.628 --> 05:08:48.638 align:start position:0%
and I recognize the prime sponsor
 
05:08:48.638 --> 05:08:50.830 align:start position:0%
and I recognize the prime sponsor
representative

05:08:50.830 --> 05:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:08:53.390 --> 05:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:08:56.230 --> 05:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the Judiciary
 
05:08:58.628 --> 05:08:58.638 align:start position:0%
Committee um
 
05:09:02.070 --> 05:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
hp601 first of all has a faulty
 
05:09:05.270 --> 05:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
analysis um it says that the bill does
 
05:09:07.070 --> 05:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
two things creates a private cause of
 
05:09:08.708 --> 05:09:08.718 align:start position:0%
action against companies that misstate
 
05:09:10.868 --> 05:09:10.878 align:start position:0%
the impacts of their business on the
 
05:09:12.788 --> 05:09:12.798 align:start position:0%
environment and then criminal P
 
05:09:15.548 --> 05:09:15.558 align:start position:0%
penalties for that it does not create
 
05:09:20.110 --> 05:09:20.120 align:start position:0%
new Criminal penalties um it does create
 
05:09:22.390 --> 05:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
essentially in effect two different
 
05:09:24.910 --> 05:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
private rights of action one for
 
05:09:27.670 --> 05:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
misstating the impacts of your business
 
05:09:29.670 --> 05:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
on the environment which falls under the
 
05:09:31.670 --> 05:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act deceptive
 
05:09:35.030 --> 05:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
practices which is probably broadly
 
05:09:38.350 --> 05:09:38.360 align:start position:0%
interpreted to include that anyway but
 
05:09:41.708 --> 05:09:41.718 align:start position:0%
um it creat Ates a new private right of
 
05:09:46.110 --> 05:09:46.120 align:start position:0%
action against fossil fuel companies for
 
05:09:49.150 --> 05:09:49.160 align:start position:0%
the uh their proportion of Damages in a
 
05:09:49.160 --> 05:09:50.230 align:start position:0%
the uh their proportion of Damages in a
climate

05:09:50.230 --> 05:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
climate
 
05:09:52.190 --> 05:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
disaster so those are the two things
 
05:09:55.708 --> 05:09:55.718 align:start position:0%
that the bill does not what it
 
05:10:00.270 --> 05:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
says so um it will be a surprise to no
 
05:10:04.270 --> 05:10:04.280 align:start position:0%
one here that in general I support
 
05:10:06.470 --> 05:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
regulation of businesses when it comes
 
05:10:10.750 --> 05:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
to their impacts on the environment
 
05:10:13.270 --> 05:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
however traditionally historically
 
05:10:16.590 --> 05:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
conventionally the arguments go thusly
 
05:10:18.670 --> 05:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
while people may be on the left side of
 
05:10:20.270 --> 05:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
things like myself say we should
 
05:10:22.030 --> 05:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
regulate businesses before they do
 
05:10:24.548 --> 05:10:24.558 align:start position:0%
damage typically what we've heard in
 
05:10:27.868 --> 05:10:27.878 align:start position:0%
response on from the more conservative
 
05:10:32.190 --> 05:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
uh philosophy is no no let let the free
 
05:10:35.030 --> 05:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
market play out and if there are damages
 
05:10:38.110 --> 05:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
done let it all kind of come out in the
 
05:10:41.830 --> 05:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
wash in the courts so if a company is
 
05:10:43.708 --> 05:10:43.718 align:start position:0%
hurting the environment hurting people
 
05:10:46.750 --> 05:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
doing bad things you can sue them and
 
05:10:48.470 --> 05:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
get damages and then eventually that
 
05:10:51.590 --> 05:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
will become a deterrent for Bad actors
 
05:10:53.430 --> 05:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
because they will be paying so much in
 
05:10:55.910 --> 05:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
the damages that they will stop doing
 
05:10:57.708 --> 05:10:57.718 align:start position:0%
that and that's kind of the theory of
 
05:11:00.270 --> 05:11:00.280 align:start position:0%
how the free market is supposed to work
 
05:11:05.070 --> 05:11:05.080 align:start position:0%
under um kind of unfettered free market
 
05:11:09.470 --> 05:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
philosophy so knowing that um perhaps my
 
05:11:11.750 --> 05:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
idea of regulating businesses may not be
 
05:11:14.750 --> 05:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
incredibly popular at the moment if if
 
05:11:16.868 --> 05:11:16.878 align:start position:0%
the solution is to allow this to play
 
05:11:18.830 --> 05:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
out in the courts then let's allow it to
 
05:11:21.150 --> 05:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
play out in the courts let's allow
 
05:11:23.670 --> 05:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
people to sue for the damages that are
 
05:11:27.590 --> 05:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
done by companies who damage
 
05:11:27.600 --> 05:11:29.990 align:start position:0%
done by companies who damage
us

05:11:29.990 --> 05:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
us
 
05:11:33.070 --> 05:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
so now private rights of action as will
 
05:11:34.708 --> 05:11:34.718 align:start position:0%
come as no surprise to any of you there
 
05:11:37.270 --> 05:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
are thousands upon thousands of examples
 
05:11:39.390 --> 05:11:39.400 align:start position:0%
um many in this state but across the the
 
05:11:42.868 --> 05:11:42.878 align:start position:0%
country of new private rights of action
 
05:11:45.030 --> 05:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
being created most recently when it
 
05:11:47.548 --> 05:11:47.558 align:start position:0%
comes to the tech industry and privacy
 
05:11:49.910 --> 05:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
concerns and all of that but this is
 
05:11:52.628 --> 05:11:52.638 align:start position:0%
something that we do regularly in order
 
05:11:54.628 --> 05:11:54.638 align:start position:0%
to allow consumers in particular
 
05:11:58.150 --> 05:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
consumers but other people to protect
 
05:12:00.390 --> 05:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
themselves so I want to get to the two
 
05:12:02.750 --> 05:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
pieces the first piece is what I call
 
05:12:04.868 --> 05:12:04.878 align:start position:0%
the green washing piece and this is the
 
05:12:06.628 --> 05:12:06.638 align:start position:0%
idea that under the consumer protection
 
05:12:10.190 --> 05:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
act we have deceptive practices claimed
 
05:12:12.990 --> 05:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
typically these um while the government
 
05:12:15.390 --> 05:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
can enforce these typically what happens
 
05:12:18.548 --> 05:12:18.558 align:start position:0%
is it goes to a civil suit usually by a
 
05:12:21.708 --> 05:12:21.718 align:start position:0%
business against another business for
 
05:12:23.830 --> 05:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
claiming that they are doing something
 
05:12:26.070 --> 05:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
good and therefore by comparison the
 
05:12:28.548 --> 05:12:28.558 align:start position:0%
business filing the claim is saying they
 
05:12:30.708 --> 05:12:30.718 align:start position:0%
are being harmed because this other
 
05:12:31.990 --> 05:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
business is claiming that they're better
 
05:12:34.150 --> 05:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
than they actually are so very
 
05:12:35.868 --> 05:12:35.878 align:start position:0%
frequently this is how this is actually
 
05:12:39.670 --> 05:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
enforced is through actual civil suits
 
05:12:42.788 --> 05:12:42.798 align:start position:0%
um this is expanding that to say and a
 
05:12:44.990 --> 05:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
particular deceptive practice is known
 
05:12:46.470 --> 05:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
as greenwashing and here's the
 
05:12:47.708 --> 05:12:47.718 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
05:12:49.670 --> 05:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
brainwashing specifically most
 
05:12:51.590 --> 05:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
importantly around claims around Net
 
05:12:54.230 --> 05:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
Zero because a lot of those claims are
 
05:12:54.240 --> 05:12:55.510 align:start position:0%
Zero because a lot of those claims are
very

05:12:55.510 --> 05:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
very
 
05:12:58.628 --> 05:12:58.638 align:start position:0%
deceptive in
 
05:13:02.150 --> 05:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
practice so that is just that just
 
05:13:04.350 --> 05:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
basically clarifying the deceptive
 
05:13:06.270 --> 05:13:06.280 align:start position:0%
practices in the consumer protection act
 
05:13:07.990 --> 05:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
it is not creating any new Criminal
 
05:13:09.670 --> 05:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
penalties that are not already in the
 
05:13:12.590 --> 05:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act the second piece
 
05:13:15.070 --> 05:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
of it is the private right of action
 
05:13:16.948 --> 05:13:16.958 align:start position:0%
against companies fossil fuel companies
 
05:13:19.708 --> 05:13:19.718 align:start position:0%
in particular that um have contributed
 
05:13:22.230 --> 05:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
to climate disaster there are very
 
05:13:25.390 --> 05:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
definite definitions of which companies
 
05:13:28.270 --> 05:13:28.280 align:start position:0%
you can sue what the thresholds are and
 
05:13:30.030 --> 05:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
what the threshold for a climate
 
05:13:33.110 --> 05:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
disaster is so for example you can only
 
05:13:35.590 --> 05:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
Sue in this scenario if you have
 
05:13:37.470 --> 05:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
experienced say you're a farmer and
 
05:13:40.670 --> 05:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
there's a storm that destroys your farm
 
05:13:43.750 --> 05:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
if you have at least $110,000 of
 
05:13:46.868 --> 05:13:46.878 align:start position:0%
damage you can only sue a company that
 
05:13:49.830 --> 05:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
has output at least 1 billion metric
 
05:13:53.708 --> 05:13:53.718 align:start position:0%
tons of carbon since 1965 for the record
 
05:13:56.230 --> 05:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
there is no new hampshire-based company
 
05:13:57.510 --> 05:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
that meets that threshold there are
 
05:13:58.990 --> 05:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
plenty of companies that operate in New
 
05:14:01.070 --> 05:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not based in New Hampshire
 
05:14:03.110 --> 05:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
that meet that threshold but no New
 
05:14:05.510 --> 05:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire company would fall under
 
05:14:07.788 --> 05:14:07.798 align:start position:0%
this however companies that have harmed
 
05:14:09.390 --> 05:14:09.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens and new
 
05:14:13.628 --> 05:14:13.638 align:start position:0%
businesses would be subjected to this um
 
05:14:16.110 --> 05:14:16.120 align:start position:0%
there is also definitions for what would
 
05:14:18.948 --> 05:14:18.958 align:start position:0%
meet a climate disaster depending on the
 
05:14:21.070 --> 05:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
severity of the disaster and the event
 
05:14:24.110 --> 05:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
does it exceed the averages that have
 
05:14:26.750 --> 05:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
historically existed for those types of
 
05:14:30.990 --> 05:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
disasters that being one of the
 
05:14:34.670 --> 05:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
things it's extremely important to note
 
05:14:36.830 --> 05:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
that there has to be as we are engaging
 
05:14:38.628 --> 05:14:38.638 align:start position:0%
in more and more climate disasters or
 
05:14:40.948 --> 05:14:40.958 align:start position:0%
disas however you want to put
 
05:14:43.628 --> 05:14:43.638 align:start position:0%
it that we are quick quickly reaching
 
05:14:45.868 --> 05:14:45.878 align:start position:0%
the threshold as we just saw in
 
05:14:49.070 --> 05:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
California with the fires we are quickly
 
05:14:50.868 --> 05:14:50.878 align:start position:0%
reaching the threshold of what insurance
 
05:14:54.470 --> 05:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
companies will deal with they will bail
 
05:14:57.190 --> 05:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
as it gets worse and worse and so we
 
05:15:00.150 --> 05:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
need to allow people to have especially
 
05:15:02.470 --> 05:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
these people in particular experiencing
 
05:15:05.230 --> 05:15:05.240 align:start position:0%
over $10,000 of damage to have a way to
 
05:15:09.070 --> 05:15:09.080 align:start position:0%
recoup those costs here in this state
 
05:15:12.070 --> 05:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
also what the plaintiff would be suing
 
05:15:13.510 --> 05:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
for would be proportional to that
 
05:15:17.390 --> 05:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
company's contribution to overall carbon
 
05:15:21.430 --> 05:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:24.230 --> 05:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
companies so that's kind of the overview
 
05:15:27.150 --> 05:15:27.160 align:start position:0%
the the 30,000 foot
 
05:15:29.910 --> 05:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
View and I guess I'll kind of stop there
 
05:15:32.110 --> 05:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
because this is a fairly dense and Big
 
05:15:36.548 --> 05:15:36.558 align:start position:0%
Bill and a huge kind of scope kind of
 
05:15:40.628 --> 05:15:40.638 align:start position:0%
lofty uh goal but I'm I'm happy to
 
05:15:43.350 --> 05:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
engage with committee members um either
 
05:15:46.190 --> 05:15:46.200 align:start position:0%
on the details or on the the
 
05:15:49.390 --> 05:15:49.400 align:start position:0%
philosophy representative tur yeah
 
05:15:50.628 --> 05:15:50.638 align:start position:0%
thanks and thanks for taking the
 
05:15:53.830 --> 05:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
question does is this based on anything
 
05:15:55.670 --> 05:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
that any other state has done or does
 
05:15:58.230 --> 05:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
this exist in any other um state in the
 
05:16:01.230 --> 05:16:01.240 align:start position:0%
country in a similar form thank you very
 
05:16:04.030 --> 05:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
much they yes many many states have put
 
05:16:06.310 --> 05:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
forward both elements though not
 
05:16:07.750 --> 05:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
together I'm doing private right of
 
05:16:10.510 --> 05:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
action on both green washing and on
 
05:16:12.750 --> 05:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
climate disaster I kind of put them
 
05:16:14.788 --> 05:16:14.798 align:start position:0%
together kind of to more to get the
 
05:16:17.948 --> 05:16:17.958 align:start position:0%
conversation started on this um but both
 
05:16:20.510 --> 05:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
have been put forward by multiple States
 
05:16:24.670 --> 05:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
at least a half dozen um I do have uh
 
05:16:27.270 --> 05:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
someone in the audience representing a a
 
05:16:29.430 --> 05:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
a group the center for climate Integrity
 
05:16:31.030 --> 05:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
that I conferred with when writing the
 
05:16:34.230 --> 05:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
Bill who can probably give more specific
 
05:16:36.750 --> 05:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
examples of which states Pennsylvania I
 
05:16:39.030 --> 05:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
know is one of them
 
05:16:40.390 --> 05:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
any other

the public about how their products fuel
 
05:17:18.750 --> 05:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
climate change for decades the world's
 
05:17:20.350 --> 05:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
biggest oil and gas companies have
 
05:17:22.910 --> 05:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
internally known that the unabated use
 
05:17:24.750 --> 05:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
of their fossil fuel products could lead
 
05:17:28.230 --> 05:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
to in the words of one Exxon scientist
 
05:17:31.310 --> 05:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
potentially catastrophic events instead
 
05:17:33.270 --> 05:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
of disclosing these risks to the public
 
05:17:34.910 --> 05:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
and helping to usher in the transition
 
05:17:37.628 --> 05:17:37.638 align:start position:0%
to cleaner and cheaper forms of energy a
 
05:17:39.350 --> 05:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
growing body of evidence shows how the
 
05:17:41.270 --> 05:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel industry deliberately sought
 
05:17:43.390 --> 05:17:43.400 align:start position:0%
to discredit science promote climate
 
05:17:45.830 --> 05:17:45.840 align:start position:0%

knew the continued use of their products

protect their own

profits today these same companies
 
05:18:04.948 --> 05:18:04.958 align:start position:0%
continue to deceive consumers through

05:19:39.190 --> 05:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
Bill 601 would give us the tool to do
 
05:19:41.788 --> 05:19:41.798 align:start position:0%
exactly that this important legislation
 
05:19:43.990 --> 05:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
would help Define and deter some of the
 
05:19:45.788 --> 05:19:45.798 align:start position:0%
most common forms of misleading
 
05:19:47.708 --> 05:19:47.718 align:start position:0%
environmental claims commonly known as

greenwashing it would help consumers

make informed purchasing decisions and
 
05:19:53.788 --> 05:19:53.798 align:start position:0%
establish consequences for companies
 
05:19:55.470 --> 05:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
that knowingly deceive New Hampshire
 
05:19:57.548 --> 05:19:57.558 align:start position:0%
residents about their impact on the
 
05:19:59.430 --> 05:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
environment and it would create a
 
05:20:01.230 --> 05:20:01.240 align:start position:0%
pathway for residents business owners
 
05:20:03.110 --> 05:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
and others who have suffered monitary

damages as a result of climate disasters
 
05:20:07.868 --> 05:20:07.878 align:start position:0%

their losses in court at the end of the
 
05:20:12.628 --> 05:20:12.638 align:start position:0%
day this bill is about fairness
 
05:20:14.590 --> 05:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
companies cannot lie to Consumers about
 
05:20:16.350 --> 05:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
their harmful products and those that
 
05:20:18.190 --> 05:20:18.200 align:start position:0%
have suffered losses as a result of
 
05:20:19.670 --> 05:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
corporate misconduct should have an
 
05:20:21.070 --> 05:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
Avenue to seek Justice through the
 
05:20:23.310 --> 05:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
courts I urge the committee to support
 
05:20:27.628 --> 05:20:27.638 align:start position:0%
House Bill 601 thank you any
 
05:20:31.110 --> 05:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank
 
05:20:33.788 --> 05:20:33.798 align:start position:0%
you that's the last card I had for that
 
05:20:36.030 --> 05:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
bill is anyone else wish to speak on
 
05:20:38.350 --> 05:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
it seeing none I'm going to close the

public public hearing on House Bill
 
05:20:43.948 --> 05:20:43.958 align:start position:0%
601 and we have some time before the
 
05:20:45.788 --> 05:20:45.798 align:start position:0%
next one there was some questions about
 
05:20:47.270 --> 05:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
what order are in there is I guess
 
05:20:49.590 --> 05:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
there's been some revised schedules put
 
05:20:51.868 --> 05:20:51.878 align:start position:0%
out but this is the order that is on the

I'm representative Ron dun from lonere
 
05:46:22.270 --> 05:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to sponsor a bill that
 
05:46:23.468 --> 05:46:23.478 align:start position:0%
will allow individuals to remain
 
05:46:25.030 --> 05:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
anonymous when winning the lottery if
 
05:46:27.350 --> 05:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
they meet the following criteria the
 
05:46:29.468 --> 05:46:29.478 align:start position:0%
winner must be a victim of domestic
 
05:46:31.948 --> 05:46:31.958 align:start position:0%
violence the winner has to be active
 
05:46:34.150 --> 05:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
restraining order against another
 
05:46:36.430 --> 05:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
person or the commissioner of the
 
05:46:38.350 --> 05:46:38.360 align:start position:0%
lottery has determined that it would be
 
05:46:39.868 --> 05:46:39.878 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the winner to
 
05:46:39.878 --> 05:46:40.830 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the winner to
remain

05:46:40.830 --> 05:46:40.840 align:start position:0%
remain
 
05:46:42.750 --> 05:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
anonymous this bill would allow the
 
05:46:45.910 --> 05:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner to know who won the lottery
 
05:46:48.670 --> 05:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
but would not require him to to release
 
05:46:50.670 --> 05:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
the name of the winner
 
05:46:52.670 --> 05:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
publicly the winner of the lottery would
 
05:46:54.868 --> 05:46:54.878 align:start position:0%
also not be required to put money into a
 
05:46:58.150 --> 05:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
trust to remain anonymous in current law
 
05:47:00.030 --> 05:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
this is the only way for a winner to
 
05:47:00.040 --> 05:47:00.910 align:start position:0%
this is the only way for a winner to
remain

05:47:00.910 --> 05:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
remain
 
05:47:02.708 --> 05:47:02.718 align:start position:0%
anonymous I met with the lottery
 
05:47:04.868 --> 05:47:04.878 align:start position:0%
commissioner Charlie McIntyre when
 
05:47:06.670 --> 05:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
drafting this bill to get the language
 
05:47:06.680 --> 05:47:07.990 align:start position:0%
drafting this bill to get the language
right

05:47:07.990 --> 05:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:47:09.750 --> 05:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
one of his main concerns was that he
 
05:47:11.948 --> 05:47:11.958 align:start position:0%
would not know who the winner was this
 
05:47:13.270 --> 05:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
bill fixes
 
05:47:16.708 --> 05:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
that by amending 91a the current and
 
05:47:18.110 --> 05:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
future Lottery Commissioners will be
 
05:47:20.390 --> 05:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
allowed to use their best judgment to
 
05:47:21.948 --> 05:47:21.958 align:start position:0%
allow a lottery winner to remain
 
05:47:24.190 --> 05:47:24.200 align:start position:0%
anonymous if they feel it necessary for
 
05:47:26.430 --> 05:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
the well-being and safety of the
 
05:47:28.628 --> 05:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
individual this is a simple change to
 
05:47:30.670 --> 05:47:30.680 align:start position:0%
existing law that will protect
 
05:47:33.548 --> 05:47:33.558 align:start position:0%
those who win the lottery and fear for
 
05:47:35.548 --> 05:47:35.558 align:start position:0%
their safety or well-being if they were
 
05:47:37.990 --> 05:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
to come forward to claim a prize
 
05:47:39.390 --> 05:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time today I'd be
 
05:47:41.590 --> 05:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions any
 
05:47:44.910 --> 05:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative Perez thank you
 
05:47:47.310 --> 05:47:47.320 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my
 
05:47:50.750 --> 05:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
question this doesn't take away for
 
05:47:52.910 --> 05:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
other people to be able to remain
 
05:47:55.110 --> 05:47:55.120 align:start position:0%
anonymous by putting it in a trust is
 
05:47:57.270 --> 05:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
that correct thank you for the question
 
05:48:01.468 --> 05:48:01.478 align:start position:0%
it does not followup followup why not a
 
05:48:04.190 --> 05:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
bill that no one has to re no one
 
05:48:06.230 --> 05:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
everyone can remain anonymous thank you
 
05:48:07.390 --> 05:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
05:48:09.350 --> 05:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
I did that last term representative
 
05:48:11.750 --> 05:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
Perez and it was determined by the
 
05:48:14.708 --> 05:48:14.718 align:start position:0%
lottery that they felt like everybody
 
05:48:18.190 --> 05:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
remaining Anonymous aot prevented them
 
05:48:22.590 --> 05:48:22.600 align:start position:0%
from advertising and from them basically
 
05:48:24.430 --> 05:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
being transparent that everybody wins a
 
05:48:26.030 --> 05:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
lottery so when I met with the
 
05:48:28.110 --> 05:48:28.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner he he felt like this was a
 
05:48:32.948 --> 05:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
good resolution um to my concerns and to
 
05:48:36.230 --> 05:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
his any other questions representative
 
05:48:38.510 --> 05:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
Tura this one is is there any examples
 
05:48:40.270 --> 05:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
in the past of where this kind of thing
 
05:48:41.750 --> 05:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
has presented a
 
05:48:44.628 --> 05:48:44.638 align:start position:0%
problem uh thank you for the question um
 
05:48:46.628 --> 05:48:46.638 align:start position:0%
the commissioner told myself when I met
 
05:48:49.150 --> 05:48:49.160 align:start position:0%
with him that he has done this for a few
 
05:48:51.590 --> 05:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
individuals in the past and he thinks
 
05:48:53.750 --> 05:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
it'd be best to put this into statute
 
05:48:55.190 --> 05:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
because that way future Lottery
 
05:48:56.150 --> 05:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
Commissioners would have it at their
 
05:48:56.160 --> 05:48:57.830 align:start position:0%
Commissioners would have it at their
disposal

05:48:57.830 --> 05:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
disposal
 
05:49:00.590 --> 05:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
also any other questions seeing none
 
05:49:00.600 --> 05:49:02.110 align:start position:0%
also any other questions seeing none
thank

05:49:02.110 --> 05:49:02.120 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:49:06.468 --> 05:49:06.478 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Henry is it Json G
 
05:49:11.310 --> 05:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:13.510 --> 05:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
know thank you Mr chair honorable
 
05:49:15.510 --> 05:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
representatives for record
 
05:49:18.310 --> 05:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
representative Henry gon Hillsboro 29th
 
05:49:20.910 --> 05:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
District so one of the things that I try
 
05:49:23.548 --> 05:49:23.558 align:start position:0%
to remind the body of anytime I talk to
 
05:49:24.948 --> 05:49:24.958 align:start position:0%
uh to the body is that it's the
 
05:49:26.590 --> 05:49:26.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility of this body of the
 
05:49:28.150 --> 05:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
legislative body to defend the rights of
 
05:49:30.110 --> 05:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
the people and that includes the right
 
05:49:33.468 --> 05:49:33.478 align:start position:0%
to privacy um I agree with I agree with
 
05:49:34.788 --> 05:49:34.798 align:start position:0%
you honorable representative that I
 
05:49:36.670 --> 05:49:36.680 align:start position:0%
would love to see this go further into
 
05:49:39.190 --> 05:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
to privacy for all people but as the
 
05:49:41.150 --> 05:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
bill is presented right now this does
 
05:49:44.230 --> 05:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
create privacy for victims or would be
 
05:49:45.868 --> 05:49:45.878 align:start position:0%
victims of domestic
 
05:49:48.990 --> 05:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
violence um of single parents who are
 
05:49:52.628 --> 05:49:52.638 align:start position:0%
avoiding a hostile a hostile exp parent
 
05:49:56.230 --> 05:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
Etc and so it's very important that we
 
05:49:59.270 --> 05:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
are taking into account the safety of
 
05:50:01.788 --> 05:50:01.798 align:start position:0%
our citizens and prudently announcing
 
05:50:04.830 --> 05:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
publicly that somebody who may have been
 
05:50:07.350 --> 05:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
at risk now is the inher Itor of a lot
 
05:50:09.628 --> 05:50:09.638 align:start position:0%
of money or the recipient rather didn't
 
05:50:12.190 --> 05:50:12.200 align:start position:0%
inherit it they received it um does
 
05:50:15.030 --> 05:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
create its own risk including for people
 
05:50:17.868 --> 05:50:17.878 align:start position:0%
who are not victims so I think that this
 
05:50:19.310 --> 05:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
is a good start but I would like to see
 
05:50:21.030 --> 05:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
it expanded on in the future and I fully
 
05:50:25.230 --> 05:50:25.240 align:start position:0%
support this bill as it stands now any
 
05:50:28.468 --> 05:50:28.478 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank
 
05:50:30.750 --> 05:50:30.760 align:start position:0%

05:50:32.070 --> 05:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill it hasn't turned into
 
05:50:34.270 --> 05:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
pink card you have to fill out a pink
 
05:50:35.230 --> 05:50:35.240 align:start position:0%
card store but you can do that when
 
05:50:37.070 --> 05:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
you're done if you want to testify first
 
05:50:38.788 --> 05:50:38.798 align:start position:0%
and then fill that out and turn it in
 
05:50:40.310 --> 05:50:40.320 align:start position:0%

05:50:48.190 --> 05:50:48.200 align:start position:0%
front oh Sor there you go okay Sean
 
05:50:51.830 --> 05:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
Faber London der um I'm speaking in
 
05:50:54.390 --> 05:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill there's been past
 
05:50:56.590 --> 05:50:56.600 align:start position:0%
cases I've seen one in Australia where a
 
05:50:58.350 --> 05:50:58.360 align:start position:0%
non-custodial parent had actually
 
05:51:01.030 --> 05:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
kidnapped the their child because
 
05:51:03.270 --> 05:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
someone had won the lottery um this is
 
05:51:05.430 --> 05:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
something that 18 other states have um
 
05:51:06.830 --> 05:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
we have a constitutional right to
 
05:51:08.468 --> 05:51:08.478 align:start position:0%
privacy in this state I think that we
 
05:51:10.868 --> 05:51:10.878 align:start position:0%
should have it in in uh codified in the
 
05:51:13.788 --> 05:51:13.798 align:start position:0%
law in this instance um it's a safety
 
05:51:16.670 --> 05:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
hazard um you can get any kind of
 
05:51:18.990 --> 05:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
domestic violence case where someone
 
05:51:20.830 --> 05:51:20.840 align:start position:0%
just shows up at the door they suddenly
 
05:51:22.190 --> 05:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
know where the person lives if they've
 
05:51:24.830 --> 05:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
been trying to keep to themselves um
 
05:51:27.750 --> 05:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
it's an area where we really don't want
 
05:51:29.468 --> 05:51:29.478 align:start position:0%
to get into lawsuit territory with this
 
05:51:31.548 --> 05:51:31.558 align:start position:0%
this also prevents the state from having
 
05:51:33.990 --> 05:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
to incur any kind of Damages there was a
 
05:51:37.110 --> 05:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
lawsuit in miramac in 2018 um towards
 
05:51:39.030 --> 05:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
the state lottery which they lost in
 
05:51:41.230 --> 05:51:41.240 align:start position:0%
court so I also do think this bill
 
05:51:43.030 --> 05:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
should be expanded but just for this
 
05:51:44.670 --> 05:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
limited scope to get something in there
 
05:51:46.070 --> 05:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
for the citizens I think it's something
 
05:51:48.750 --> 05:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
that we really should be doing so I
 
05:51:50.548 --> 05:51:50.558 align:start position:0%
speak in favor of this bill uh any
 
05:51:52.628 --> 05:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
questions any questions at all
 
05:51:52.638 --> 05:51:53.628 align:start position:0%
questions any questions at all
representative

05:51:53.628 --> 05:51:53.638 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:51:55.910 --> 05:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
Andress thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:51:58.150 --> 05:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question okay I want to
 
05:52:00.390 --> 05:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
understand this is the only reason it's
 
05:52:02.830 --> 05:52:02.840 align:start position:0%
not expanded to everybody is for
 
05:52:02.840 --> 05:52:04.110 align:start position:0%
not expanded to everybody is for
advertising

05:52:04.110 --> 05:52:04.120 align:start position:0%
advertising
 
05:52:06.230 --> 05:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
purposes um they were worried about
 
05:52:08.030 --> 05:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
trans transparency um because I also
 
05:52:10.150 --> 05:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
testified on this last year they were
 
05:52:11.750 --> 05:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
worried that they wouldn't be able to
 
05:52:14.788 --> 05:52:14.798 align:start position:0%
find out who won internally which with
 
05:52:18.310 --> 05:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
this bill you're fully able to um take
 
05:52:19.628 --> 05:52:19.638 align:start position:0%
all the measures that make sure that the
 
05:52:21.830 --> 05:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
lottery is on the up and up um the other
 
05:52:22.868 --> 05:52:22.878 align:start position:0%
thing that they're worried about is
 
05:52:24.830 --> 05:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
promotional purposes some other states
 
05:52:27.270 --> 05:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
have got around that by putting a very
 
05:52:29.830 --> 05:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
small limit on it um but I think with
 
05:52:31.670 --> 05:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
the wording of this bill I think we
 
05:52:33.510 --> 05:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
cover that and with the blessing of the
 
05:52:34.868 --> 05:52:34.878 align:start position:0%
head of the Lottery
 
05:52:38.030 --> 05:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
Commission okay thank you y any other
 
05:52:42.830 --> 05:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:45.628 --> 05:52:45.638 align:start position:0%
you and I I don't see anyone else here
 
05:52:47.030 --> 05:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
that wishes to speak on the bill so I'm
 
05:52:50.708 --> 05:52:50.718 align:start position:0%
going to close the hearing on House Bill
 
05:52:53.230 --> 05:52:53.240 align:start position:0%
485 and if there's no other business we
 
05:52:55.390 --> 05:52:55.400 align:start position:0%
will adjourn for the
 
05:53:05.430 --> 05:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:05.440 --> 05:53:35.430 align:start position:0%
