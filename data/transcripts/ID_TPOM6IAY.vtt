00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
first meeting of the special committee
 
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
on housing my name is Joe Alexander I'm
 
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
chairman of the committee
 
00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:57.770 align:start position:0%
chairman of the committee
um

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:57.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:59.450 --> 00:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
there are a couple members that will be
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
arriving late I know of at least two
 
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
better at the crash training upstairs
 
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
but they said they'd be crass crash but
 
00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
they'll be down a little later so
 
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
um I first want to open it up by
 
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
inviting the speaker up to say a few
 
00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:12.900 align:start position:0%
words about this committee
 
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
um why it was formed why it's needed and
 
00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:17.099 align:start position:0%
then we'll go into introduction so Mr
 
00:08:17.099 --> 00:08:28.309 align:start position:0%
then we'll go into introduction so Mr
Speaker

00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:31.139 align:start position:0%
well good morning
 
00:08:33.769 --> 00:08:33.779 align:start position:0%
um why it was formed as we have a
 
00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:36.589 align:start position:0%
um why it was formed as we have a
problem

00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
um and it's it's becoming more and more
 
00:08:41.449 --> 00:08:41.459 align:start position:0%
of a problem I think every time we talk
 
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
to people that uh you know we're trying
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
to expand and
 
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:47.700 align:start position:0%
trying to get new workers into the state
 
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
trying to hire more people
 
00:08:53.449 --> 00:08:53.459 align:start position:0%
and we obviously have a
 
00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:56.700 align:start position:0%
serious housing problem in this state
 
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.370 align:start position:0%
serious housing problem in this state
so

00:08:58.370 --> 00:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
my goal for this committee is to try and
 
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
come up with some answers
 
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
nobody knows everybody knows there's no
 
00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:08.519 align:start position:0%
Magic Bullet
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
um but there's got to be some ways where
 
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
and some things that we can do that's
 
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
going to help the situation
 
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
help the people that want to hire help
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
the companies that want to come to the
 
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.550 align:start position:0%
the companies that want to come to the
state

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
and be able to offer their workers
 
00:09:27.949 --> 00:09:27.959 align:start position:0%
affordable housing that they can come to
 
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:37.019 align:start position:0%
there's a lot already out there
 
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
I think we have to be realistic about it
 
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh I I would assume you want to put
 
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
everything on the table and then start
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
sorting through it I know you uh you
 
00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:48.899 align:start position:0%
know this is an awful lot of people that
 
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:52.140 align:start position:0%
want to come in and talk about it
 
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:54.300 align:start position:0%
um you know being a uh Board of director
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
of Southern New Hampshire Services they
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
definitely said they want to get
 
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
involved and try and help because that's
 
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest problems they have is
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
is housing you know for people
 
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.730 align:start position:0%
is housing you know for people
so

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:07.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
I I'm not going to propose any answers
 
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:12.060 align:start position:0%
to you
 
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to tell you what to do and
 
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
what not to do
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
what I'm hoping and that this committee
 
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:23.100 align:start position:0%
can come up with some bipartisan answers
 
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:25.980 align:start position:0%
that we can move forward with that will
 
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
help our
 
00:10:31.009 --> 00:10:31.019 align:start position:0%
people in this state that are looking
 
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
for housing in our business owners that
 
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
are looking
 
00:10:38.329 --> 00:10:38.339 align:start position:0%
to hire more people and the businesses
 
00:10:39.769 --> 00:10:39.779 align:start position:0%
that would like to maybe come to this
 
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
state but can because they can't find a
 
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:42.590 align:start position:0%
state but can because they can't find a
place

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
and also that's the same message I want
 
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
to give to the children of the child
 
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
care committee that we set up because
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's a two-fold problem
 
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
uh you know Child Care is is is is just
 
00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
as much of a problem as housing is right
 
00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.130 align:start position:0%
as much of a problem as housing is right
now

00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
and if we're going to continue moving
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
forward then we have to find some
 
00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:03.230 align:start position:0%
forward then we have to find some
answers

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
answers
 
00:11:05.569 --> 00:11:05.579 align:start position:0%
that I mean that's it I'm you see I'm
 
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
not going to sit here and propose
 
00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
anything to you but we've got to find
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
some answers
 
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:12.660 align:start position:0%
and hopefully those answers we can put
 
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
into bills next uh you know next
 
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:16.740 align:start position:0%
September when we have our filing period
 
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
or that we do have some bills here that
 
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
we might be able to uh put some things
 
00:11:23.329 --> 00:11:23.339 align:start position:0%
onto between the Senate house bills I'm
 
00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:24.779 align:start position:0%
sure we could find something if you can
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
come up with some some some solid
 
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
so in your hands right now well thank
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker and thank you for your
 
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
leadership on this I know that other
 
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
branches of government have looked into
 
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
this but I think it's important
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
um the general court looks at this um in
 
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
particular absolutely I mean you know
 
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
we're the ones that make the laws
 
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
uh you know having said that
 
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure that you know
 
00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
we don't um overreact and try and
 
00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
trample on any
 
00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:00.180 align:start position:0%
rights of owners a property or anything
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
of that nature uh you know and I I think
 
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it in your hands see what you
 
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:14.220 align:start position:0%
guys can come up with
 
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
perfect and when you're done next week
 
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
well you know hopefully but
 
00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
realistically I know this is good this
 
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:27.980 align:start position:0%
is going to be a long drawn out process
 
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh it's very complicated uh it is like I
 
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
said we all know there's no silver
 
00:12:36.769 --> 00:12:36.779 align:start position:0%
bullets that are going to fix the
 
00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:39.180 align:start position:0%
problem overnight but
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
um and we're not going to fix the
 
00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:42.959 align:start position:0%
problem immediately but we've got to
 
00:12:44.449 --> 00:12:44.459 align:start position:0%
start working on it we've got to start
 
00:12:46.009 --> 00:12:46.019 align:start position:0%
coming up with some solutions that'll
 
00:12:46.019 --> 00:12:48.050 align:start position:0%
coming up with some solutions that'll
help

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:48.060 align:start position:0%

a lot about housing development and
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you um
 
00:14:36.769 --> 00:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
for taking my introduction my name is
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative Charlotte dilorenzo I
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
represent New Market in new Fields uh
 
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
Rock and Rockingham District 10.
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
my background is that I am a retired
 
00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:50.100 align:start position:0%
affordable housing property manager and
 
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:53.220 align:start position:0%
I manage housing in Maine New Hampshire
 
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts for the most part
 
00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.810 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts for the most part
Massachusetts

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
um and I'm surprised that I
 
00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:00.839 align:start position:0%
I suppose some of the grants that I
 
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
applied were probably one across Merle's
 
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
desk while she was working at HUD so
 
00:15:08.569 --> 00:15:08.579 align:start position:0%
I built kind of a kinship with her but
 
00:15:11.689 --> 00:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
um my experience was in managing um I
 
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
started out managing like single
 
00:15:16.129 --> 00:15:16.139 align:start position:0%
developments 50 to 75 units
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
um and then as I
 
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
gained you know knowledge and seniority
 
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:25.980 align:start position:0%
in my field I went on to make lodged
 
00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.009 align:start position:0%
in my field I went on to make lodged
properties

00:15:27.009 --> 00:15:27.019 align:start position:0%
properties
 
00:15:29.449 --> 00:15:29.459 align:start position:0%
uh up to
 
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
up to 300 units and then I went on to
 
00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
manage portfolios of affordable housing
 
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
most of the work that I did was in
 
00:15:38.449 --> 00:15:38.459 align:start position:0%
Boston Suffolk County
 
00:15:38.459 --> 00:15:39.350 align:start position:0%
Boston Suffolk County
um

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
and so I did like day-to-day management
 
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
like a property manager sitting at their
 
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
desk taking phone calls collecting rents
 
00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.990 align:start position:0%
desk taking phone calls collecting rents
um

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:50.689 --> 00:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
revising our um
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
creating a budget and then as I you know
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
gained more experience I manage
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
portfolios so I would have a bundled
 
00:16:00.889 --> 00:16:00.899 align:start position:0%
maybe five or six properties that I
 
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
would be in and I would supervise all
 
00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:07.019 align:start position:0%
the employees of that bundle I was also
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
um responsible for compliance you know
 
00:16:13.009 --> 00:16:13.019 align:start position:0%
in affordable housing there are many
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
many many rules and regulations
 
00:16:17.639 --> 00:16:18.230 align:start position:0%
many many rules and regulations
um

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
depending on the type of housing that
 
00:16:21.949 --> 00:16:21.959 align:start position:0%
you're managing I think I've probably
 
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
managed uh in every affordable housing
 
00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:26.810 align:start position:0%
managed uh in every affordable housing
um

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
genre Genera um from home
 
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:34.260 align:start position:0%

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
Mass funding Maine funding New Hampshire
 
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
funding so I have a very broad knowledge
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years of my
 
00:16:46.129 --> 00:16:46.139 align:start position:0%
career I worked for Pine Street Inn
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%

00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
housing at the time we had about 500
 
00:16:58.249 --> 00:16:58.259 align:start position:0%
units there were scattered site units
 
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
and our job was to assist homeless men
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
and women to get into housing and that
 
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
was um it was like a real challenge for
 
00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:10.140 align:start position:0%
me it was a wonderful wonderful job I
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
was sorry that I had to retire
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%

um

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
my background is a small landlord
 
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
primarily single family residences some
 
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:35.220 align:start position:0%
commercial we've developed some property
 
00:17:36.669 --> 00:17:36.679 align:start position:0%

right now seeing what's going on it
 
00:17:48.409 --> 00:17:48.419 align:start position:0%
seems to make sense to form this
 
00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
committee and see what kind of work we
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
can get done to improve the the housing
 
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
dilemma that we Face here in New
 
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at this point in time I'm
 
00:17:57.529 --> 00:17:57.539 align:start position:0%
looking forward to working with all you

done thank you
 
00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
and Joe Alexander out of Goffstown um so
 
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:06.660 align:start position:0%
I've been involved with the housing
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
issue for since I started in the
 
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
legislature four years ago I was brought
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
in the governor's housing task force
 
00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:13.799 align:start position:0%
where we
 
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
um you know had some policy
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
recommendations kind of helped Shepherd
 
00:18:18.409 --> 00:18:18.419 align:start position:0%
some bills through some of these bills
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
passed some of them didn't but
 
00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
um this issue has obviously been my
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
passion for four years now so I'm
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
excited to get started and hopefully
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
that we can all come together and find
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
figure something out here so thank you
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
hey uh I'm Amber Rudy from Manchester
 
00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:35.390 align:start position:0%
hey uh I'm Amber Rudy from Manchester
um

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:39.409 --> 00:18:39.419 align:start position:0%
long long time realtor and um
 
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
back in the 70s I started putting up
 
00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:45.500 align:start position:0%
modular homes and some of them were for
 
00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:47.940 align:start position:0%
there was a loan that was out there
 
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
Farmers home loan and it was a good way
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
for people with very little or no money
 
00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
to get into a home
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
well this company I worked with out of
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
Kennebunk Maine built a special house
 
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
for a farmer's Home Loan
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
and I put one up it went okay and then
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
after that they would give me an
 
00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:10.860 align:start position:0%
approval list of about 30 to 45 people a
 
00:19:12.289 --> 00:19:12.299 align:start position:0%
month who qualified because everybody
 
00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:13.740 align:start position:0%
wanted one
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh but I found out quickly after doing a
 
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
few that there was really no money in it
 
00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
I could make a lot more money selling a
 
00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
house getting a commission than I could
 
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
by putting up a home that you know for
 
00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
somebody and it was a great program I
 
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
wish I could have continued I wish there
 
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
was something that could have been done
 
00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:31.850 align:start position:0%
was something that could have been done
to

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
you know keep the program going and make
 
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
it more affordable for Builders to
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
actually do it so I go way back before
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
the affordable housing crisis started
 
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
now it's a real crisis and of course the
 
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
big developers are trying to get into it
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
and do it and a lot of my friends
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
several friends I've worked with
 
00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
four or five people who do developments
 
00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
with affordable housing and they tell me
 
00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
all their problems and I said well this
 
00:20:00.169 --> 00:20:00.179 align:start position:0%
is a good place to air it all out and
 
00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
maybe we can do something about it I
 
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
don't know if we can I know a lot of the
 
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
problems come with the local governments
 
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:08.940 align:start position:0%
your planning boards and zoning boards
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
and whatever but this is a great
 
00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:14.039 align:start position:0%
great effort that we're going to put
 
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
forward and hopefully we can come up
 
00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
with a solution and some of these people
 
00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:20.220 align:start position:0%
are going to come in and talk to us so
 
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
cross our fingers and roll up our
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
sleeves and maybe we can get something
 
00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:28.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
good morning representative yokella from
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 32 it's Fremont Danville and
 
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.630 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 32 it's Fremont Danville and
Brentwood

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
Brentwood
 
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
um my history on this is is uh the first
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
first board I joined in New Hampshire
 
00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
was the Zoning Board of adjustments so
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
I've been that is my longest tenure and
 
00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
that's because you know property rights
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
are probably the most important thing I
 
00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
think that um
 
00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:02.220 align:start position:0%
kind of undergirds all of the other
 
00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.610 align:start position:0%
kind of undergirds all of the other
rights

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:03.620 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:05.700 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty passionate about that and I
 
00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:13.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
restrictions uh putting their thumb on
 
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
the on the scale making it harder for
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
people to build and to build an
 
00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:24.919 align:start position:0%
affordable way
 
00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
and so I definitely would like to look
 
00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
at that and see if there's uh you know I
 
00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
do that at the lo my own local level one
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
of the things that I did was petition
 
00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:38.900 align:start position:0%
Warren articles just
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
reading my
 
00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
local zoning ordinance and all the
 
00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
things that were inappropriate or just
 
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
over restrictive one of the first things
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
that I ever did was a petition worn
 
00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:55.799 align:start position:0%
article to change my local sign
 
00:21:58.909 --> 00:21:58.919 align:start position:0%
ordinance which was 15 pages and I cut
 
00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:01.400 align:start position:0%
it down to one and a half pages
 
00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
just through just reading it and and
 
00:22:06.169 --> 00:22:06.179 align:start position:0%
trying to come up with a common sense
 
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
solution that didn't need to be so
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
complicated and so I've done other
 
00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:14.780 align:start position:0%
things like that as far as just you know
 
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
reading the zoning ordinances that come
 
00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
across like in trying to trying to make
 
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
some sense of it because a lot of it is
 
00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
put in at different times and not a lot
 
00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
of people just read the entire thing and
 
00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
and try and make sense of it and so
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
there were duplications of stuff that I
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
tried to clean up and try to identify so
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
I think that you know the government uh
 
00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
just making it unclear and making rules
 
00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.270 align:start position:0%
just making it unclear and making rules
um

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
you know trying to do their best but not
 
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
experts in the situation can sometimes
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
make make more problems than they're
 
00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
solving and so that's what one of the
 
00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
big things that I'm trying to uh
 
00:22:59.570 --> 00:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
to reduce or make it make it easier for
 
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh good morning uh representative Josh
 
00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.470 align:start position:0%
uh good morning uh representative Josh
adgerton

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
adgerton
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
um from Grafton 16 representing the town
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
of Enfield
 
00:23:15.049 --> 00:23:15.059 align:start position:0%
um outside of the legislature I don't
 
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
have a whole
 
00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
um broad bandwidth of experience of the
 
00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.149 align:start position:0%
um broad bandwidth of experience of the
issue

00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
um as far as being involved in the
 
00:23:24.289 --> 00:23:24.299 align:start position:0%
actual process however
 
00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:26.039 align:start position:0%
um I work for Dartmouth Hitchcock
 
00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
Medical Center up in Lebanon
 
00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
um and understand how this issue really
 
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
plays intersectionally
 
00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:36.440 align:start position:0%
um because
 
00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:38.460 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that we're having
 
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
um and actually Vice chairman Verdi saw
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
the same presentation and labor
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
committee uh was
 
00:23:48.649 --> 00:23:48.659 align:start position:0%
there's retail which has not really
 
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
recovered a lot of jobs post pandemic
 
00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
and then the next section up above that
 
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
is Healthcare
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
um Dartmouth has gotten around that
 
00:23:58.990 --> 00:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
right now with the travel Nurse Program
 
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:01.740 align:start position:0%
because travel nurses will get a Housing
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
Voucher and so a lot of their expenses
 
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
are covered
 
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
um but at some point that's going to end
 
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
up raising costs for the hospital to a
 
00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.830 align:start position:0%
up raising costs for the hospital to a
point

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:24:10.669 --> 00:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
um where they're going to have to
 
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
restrict the travel and there's program
 
00:24:13.789 --> 00:24:13.799 align:start position:0%
and then they're going to run into the
 
00:24:13.799 --> 00:24:15.110 align:start position:0%
and then they're going to run into the
same

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:24:18.169 --> 00:24:18.179 align:start position:0%
um low staffing issues that surround uh
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
folks not being able to afford to live
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
in the Upper Valley
 
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
um so I I think that is a pertinent
 
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:26.940 align:start position:0%
example of what the speaker mentioned as
 
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
far as folks
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
trying to hire I see that agreement
 
00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:35.220 align:start position:0%
every day I overheard a charging nurse
 
00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:37.580 align:start position:0%
the other day say that she had 156
 
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
slots to fill and about 80 people worth
 
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
of slots to put towards that so
 
00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
um it is an affordability issue but it
 
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
also definitely is a Workforce issue so
 
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:52.980 align:start position:0%
I I look forward to seeing us sort that
 
00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:56.039 align:start position:0%
out and hopefully it leads to a better
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
smoothing of the economy especially in
 
00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
highness necessity areas like healthcare
 
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
because that is really being hit hard
 
00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair my name is Tom
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
Walsh I'm a representative for Merrimack
 
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
County District 10 which is the towns of
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
Hooksett and Dunbarton starting my sixth
 
00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
term I've actually been in on the hooks
 
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
of planning board for even longer that's
 
00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:26.220 align:start position:0%
how I get started so I bring 13 plus
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
years of experience
 
00:25:30.289 --> 00:25:30.299 align:start position:0%
as both member and chairman of the
 
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
planning board I've dealt with all the
 
00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:34.860 align:start position:0%
different types of housings from cluster
 
00:25:36.769 --> 00:25:36.779 align:start position:0%
developments to affordable housing to
 
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing to high density to
 
00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
single family your duplex is your
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
triplexia quads and the pros and cons of
 
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
all of them
 
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
I don't know really have much else to
 
00:25:51.409 --> 00:25:51.419 align:start position:0%
add except I've seen a lot of this stuff
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
and it's not stopping coming from
 
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
Hooksett in particular
 
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
um obviously being next to Manchester
 
00:26:00.169 --> 00:26:00.179 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a constant constant swell if
 
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
you will of housing moving into Hooksett
 
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
um I guess as suggestions go to get
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
started on this whole process I don't
 
00:26:09.049 --> 00:26:09.059 align:start position:0%
know what your what your plan is Mr
 
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
chair but
 
00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:11.820 align:start position:0%
right out of the gate I've been thinking
 
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
since day one that
 
00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
I think good practice when you're trying
 
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
to solve problems is to figure out what
 
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
caused them so I think that would be a
 
00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:27.649 --> 00:26:27.659 align:start position:0%
representative Reed
 
00:26:30.289 --> 00:26:30.299 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Ellen Reed I represent New
 
00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:32.039 align:start position:0%
Market in new Fields that's Rockingham
 
00:26:32.039 --> 00:26:33.769 align:start position:0%
Market in new Fields that's Rockingham
10.

00:26:33.769 --> 00:26:33.779 align:start position:0%
10.
 
00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
um I have seven housing bills in this
 
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
year I'm starting my fourth term
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
I have seven housing bills in this year
 
00:26:42.529 --> 00:26:42.539 align:start position:0%
including one that I am very hopeful has
 
00:26:45.649 --> 00:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
in tremendous bipartisan support and as
 
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
well as the amazing surprising support
 
00:26:51.409 --> 00:26:51.419 align:start position:0%
of people like planners Town planners
 
00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
home builders and Municipal Association
 
00:26:57.169 --> 00:26:57.179 align:start position:0%
what you know so I'm really hopeful for
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
that one and happy to talk about that in
 
00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
detail but in terms of the housing
 
00:27:03.049 --> 00:27:03.059 align:start position:0%
crisis on the Seacoast my communities
 
00:27:06.049 --> 00:27:06.059 align:start position:0%
have been hit extremely hard
 
00:27:07.789 --> 00:27:07.799 align:start position:0%
um this is an economic issue about
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce which we all complain about
 
00:27:12.289 --> 00:27:12.299 align:start position:0%
but more importantly it's a human
 
00:27:12.299 --> 00:27:14.210 align:start position:0%
but more importantly it's a human
emergency

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
um just in the last few weeks we've had
 
00:27:18.169 --> 00:27:18.179 align:start position:0%
two people in the state die of exposure
 
00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
and increasingly the people who are
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
unhoused are working full-time they are
 
00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:25.140 align:start position:0%
literally living out of their cars
 
00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:27.020 align:start position:0%
because simply we don't have anywhere
 
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
for them to go we frequently talk about
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
it this being a supply issue and that's
 
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
true and we need to address zoning
 
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:36.900 align:start position:0%
issues that restrict the ability to
 
00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:41.820 align:start position:0%
build and that kind of prioritized rural
 
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:43.799 align:start position:0%
character over people's ability to live
 
00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
we need to address that but we also need
 
00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
to understand it's not simply a supply
 
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
issue in this state and this is far away
 
00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
and Beyond what the national average is
 
00:27:54.649 --> 00:27:54.659 align:start position:0%
the national average is that there are
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
30 three empty homes empty homes
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
for every single individual unhoused
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
person in this state it's 74. so it's
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
not supply it's not purely building it's
 
00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:08.820 align:start position:0%
building affordably so in addition to
 
00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
easing restrictions we also have to look
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
at incentives to build high quality and
 
00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
I want to stress high quality long term
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
if we can't keep people in homes long
 
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
term because the housing is not good
 
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
quality then it doesn't matter because
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
we're still not creating the stable
 
00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:25.740 align:start position:0%
communities that have stable Workforce
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
and stable consumers for our businesses
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
having said that I keep talking about
 
00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
the economic factors I still want us to
 
00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:33.900 align:start position:0%
always stay in touch with the fact that
 
00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
this is a real human emergency we cannot
 
00:28:39.169 --> 00:28:39.179 align:start position:0%
lose sight of that many of us have own
 
00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
our own homes and maybe it's been a
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
while some of us may own our own homes
 
00:28:45.769 --> 00:28:45.779 align:start position:0%
outright even we need to to stay in
 
00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
touch with those actual working class
 
00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
issues and realize that this is an issue
 
00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
of whether or not people feel like they
 
00:28:54.169 --> 00:28:54.179 align:start position:0%
know that they're going to have a roof
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
over their head in the following month
 
00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:56.220 align:start position:0%
or they're going to be living out of
 
00:28:57.529 --> 00:28:57.539 align:start position:0%
their car and what do they do with their
 
00:29:00.649 --> 00:29:00.659 align:start position:0%
or Cat when they have no place and do
 
00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:02.039 align:start position:0%
they take their kids out of school and
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
where do they shower before they go into
 
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
work this is a real issue that we need
 
00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
to constantly stay in touch with the
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
human aspect of and not only yes address
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
the economic aspect but not only that
 
00:29:15.049 --> 00:29:15.059 align:start position:0%
and stay in touch with the human impact
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
and I guess that's where I'm coming from
 
00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
 
00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:21.769 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
introduction

00:29:21.769 --> 00:29:21.779 align:start position:0%
introduction
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
um so as the speaker said I mean this
 
00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
year we're on a fact-finding mission to
 
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
Deep dive into housing crisis so our
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
goal is to meet with various
 
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
stakeholders department heads other
 
00:29:35.389 --> 00:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
groups there's a couple questions that I
 
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
have just starting out but after I'd
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
love to open it up to what we're in
 
00:29:40.909 --> 00:29:40.919 align:start position:0%
charge of steering we can steer It
 
00:29:42.169 --> 00:29:42.179 align:start position:0%
Whatever direction we want to steer it
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
so I want to open it up to have the
 
00:29:45.169 --> 00:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
committee contribute but these are the
 
00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:46.860 align:start position:0%
first things I'm thinking of what kind
 
00:29:48.529 --> 00:29:48.539 align:start position:0%
of problems do developers encounter when
 
00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:50.820 align:start position:0%
moving forward with projects how do we
 
00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:52.740 align:start position:0%
maintain property rights
 
00:29:54.769 --> 00:29:54.779 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know data on zoning laws
 
00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:56.700 align:start position:0%
like what the difference between rural
 
00:29:58.810 --> 00:29:58.820 align:start position:0%
urban zoning laws look like
 
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
what changes are towns taking upon
 
00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:02.700 align:start position:0%
themselves so I'd like to hear from
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
local I mean I just talked with my town
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
the chair of the town planning board in
 
00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:08.700 align:start position:0%
Goffstown this weekend what what changes
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
are happening on the town level or city
 
00:30:10.559 --> 00:30:11.470 align:start position:0%
are happening on the town level or city
level

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:11.480 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:13.860 align:start position:0%
what are the conflicts between the state
 
00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
and local we know some of them but how
 
00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:17.820 align:start position:0%
can how can we come to you know maybe
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
there's agreement there how are state
 
00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:22.919 align:start position:0%
agencies evolved involved is the state
 
00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:24.299 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy holding up Housing
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
Development so I want to look at things
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
like excessive code enforcement
 
00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:30.649 align:start position:0%
like excessive code enforcement
um

00:30:30.649 --> 00:30:30.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
I want to look at how the government can
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
partner with the business Community when
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
building housing
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
so in on top of that the committee might
 
00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
may identify bills as representative
 
00:30:41.159 --> 00:30:42.049 align:start position:0%
may identify bills as representative
Reed

00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:42.059 align:start position:0%
Reed
 
00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
um pointed out there are bills and other
 
00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
committees that are that have to do with
 
00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:45.769 align:start position:0%
committees that are that have to do with
housing

00:30:45.769 --> 00:30:45.779 align:start position:0%
housing
 
00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
um the committee might
 
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
um take one or a couple of particular
 
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
interests if there's something that we'd
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
like to to take over we can especially a
 
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:55.799 align:start position:0%
retain bill in another committee it
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
might be something that we could work on
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
over the summer
 
00:30:59.930 --> 00:30:59.940 align:start position:0%
um so we're we might identify those
 
00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:01.370 align:start position:0%
um so we're we might identify those
things

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
um and we can work on that as committees
 
00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
so we're not expected to have a final
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
report per se but I do want to come up
 
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
with some solid pieces of legislation
 
00:31:12.529 --> 00:31:12.539 align:start position:0%
for September so we have some sort of a
 
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
timeline but the committee is really
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
um we are free to do what we would like
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
to do so with that I want to kind of
 
00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:19.559 align:start position:0%
open it up and see what kind of
 
00:31:19.559 --> 00:31:33.649 align:start position:0%
open it up and see what kind of
Direction

00:31:33.649 --> 00:31:33.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
to number one input or whatever
 
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:49.740 align:start position:0%

00:34:16.609 --> 00:34:16.619 align:start position:0%
are protected and we're trying to really
 
00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
the what's really the goal of avoiding
 
00:34:19.849 --> 00:34:19.859 align:start position:0%
further homelessness because we know
 
00:34:19.859 --> 00:34:21.290 align:start position:0%
further homelessness because we know
that

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:21.829 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
once you lose your housing it's harder
 
00:34:26.089 --> 00:34:26.099 align:start position:0%
to get back into housing and it ends up
 
00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
costing our society financially as well
 
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
as in other ways so
 
00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
just leave it at that
 
00:34:34.849 --> 00:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
and we're happy to we're always happy to
 
00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:36.060 align:start position:0%
present to you about the work we're
 
00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
doing but I'll let the chairman decide
 
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
like when and how he'd like that to
 
00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:43.369 align:start position:0%
like when and how he'd like that to
happen

00:34:43.369 --> 00:34:43.379 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:53.700 align:start position:0%

community action programs they do a lot
 
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
of work uh you know they have a lot of
 
00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:10.740 align:start position:0%
contracts recording
 
00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
housing especially with the hotels the
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
federal programs the emergency rental
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
assistance I believe that's what it's
 
00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
called also one of our clients is
 
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:23.880 align:start position:0%

Continuous Care and assisted living
 
00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:29.940 align:start position:0%
facilities nursing nursing care and they
 
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
come at it as a employer and the
 
00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
difficulties that they're facing hiring
 
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
people because of
 
00:35:41.569 --> 00:35:41.579 align:start position:0%
of the lack of affordable housing
 
00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody my name is Jack
 
00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
Ruderman I work with Ben Frost at New
 
00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing I work on legislative
 
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
affairs my title is public affairs
 
00:36:07.849 --> 00:36:07.859 align:start position:0%
manager and I'm part of our
 
00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:09.900 align:start position:0%
policy planning and Communications
 
00:36:12.589 --> 00:36:12.599 align:start position:0%
Division and has been alluded to we do a
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
lot of research and we issue reports so
 
00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:17.940 align:start position:0%
for instance we put together the annual
 
00:36:20.569 --> 00:36:20.579 align:start position:0%
residential rent survey you know which
 
00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
gives us a very queer picture uh of
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
where costs are in a given year and what
 
00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
the trends are and how much things have
 
00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:30.260 align:start position:0%
gone up or have come down
 
00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
and I think that that is one publication
 
00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
that I think that gets a fair amount of
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
use and is referenced frequently we also
 
00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
do research on projects key policy
 
00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:43.640 align:start position:0%
issues so for instance at the moment
 
00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:46.980 align:start position:0%
we're working on a study on Accessory
 
00:36:50.569 --> 00:36:50.579 align:start position:0%
dwelling units or adus and should have a
 
00:36:50.579 --> 00:36:51.550 align:start position:0%
dwelling units or adus and should have a
report

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:36:55.849 --> 00:36:55.859 align:start position:0%
sometime by the end of March is our our
 
00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
Target there was an article over the
 
00:36:59.569 --> 00:36:59.579 align:start position:0%
weekend in the New York Times about
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
granny Flats as they are sometimes
 
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
called or adus so in any event
 
00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
um we um we've got a good team
 
00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:10.980 align:start position:0%
um following some of the key issues in
 
00:37:13.849 --> 00:37:13.859 align:start position:0%
housing and uh I'll just you know Echo
 
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
Ben's comments we're really excited that
 
00:37:17.569 --> 00:37:17.579 align:start position:0%
this committee has been formed and look
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
forward to being helpful in any way that
 
00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:37:22.609 --> 00:37:22.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:22.619 --> 00:37:23.329 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:37:23.329 --> 00:37:23.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:25.740 align:start position:0%
of course pointed out I I love the idea
 
00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:27.500 align:start position:0%
of adus I'd like to look more into that
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
co-ops smaller tiny homes maybe for
 
00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:32.690 align:start position:0%
co-ops smaller tiny homes maybe for
um

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:32.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
younger people just uh trying to find
 
00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
their first home or even the elderly
 
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
trying to settle down to something a
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
little smaller for them so I like to
 
00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
open it up to the committee
 
00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
um you know I have
 
00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
stakeholders I'd like to hear from
 
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
including the New Hampshire realtors New
 
00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Finance
 
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
um I I'm a Cena's Hawk and I think St
 
00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:52.980 align:start position:0%
Anson college has a lot of good things
 
00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
around zoning and they just published a
 
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
uh a zoning report so I'd like to hear
 
00:37:59.150 --> 00:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
from them as well but
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
um I'd like the committee to weigh in
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I I would like to include in
 
00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
the list of shareholders all those who
 
00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:08.300 align:start position:0%
are present today their organizations
 
00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire housing also Seacoast
 
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing and legal assistance
 
00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:19.140 align:start position:0%
uh it there may be other groups to add
 
00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
to that but I want to make sure that
 
00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
both sides of the coin are represented
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
um because while we can help industry we
 
00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:28.980 align:start position:0%
also need to make sure that we're
 
00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:32.460 align:start position:0%
producing the outcomes that we want
 
00:38:34.609 --> 00:38:34.619 align:start position:0%
um representative okay
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
um in order to get a unit that's
 
00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:40.790 align:start position:0%
um in order to get a unit that's
affordable

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
affordable
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
we have to get there and a way to get
 
00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
there is with the people who invest in
 
00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:49.740 align:start position:0%
rehabs or construction to build the
 
00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
units to make them more affordable and I
 
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
have a list of people that I've worked
 
00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:56.780 align:start position:0%
with in the past
 
00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
contractors investors
 
00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:01.980 align:start position:0%
that would like to come in and tell us
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
how they number one get their money
 
00:39:05.589 --> 00:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
their funding
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
construction people on on construction
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
different types of construction I know
 
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
when I did my my housing for Farmers
 
00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:17.220 align:start position:0%
home loan the materials were entirely
 
00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
different they were subgrade but um
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
that's all we could use to get people in
 
00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
and that's another reason why I wouldn't
 
00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:28.380 align:start position:0%
do them anymore but um and then we have
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
the managers and what they the problems
 
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
that they have so in order for somebody
 
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
to move into a unit we have to make it
 
00:39:37.849 --> 00:39:37.859 align:start position:0%
available to get there and how do we do
 
00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
that what's the cost what's the hurdles
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
what's uh and I think that hearing from
 
00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
these people who are in the trenches
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
doing all the work I think it's very
 
00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
important that we hear from them
 
00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
okay representative Gibbs and then
 
00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:52.550 align:start position:0%
okay representative Gibbs and then
representative

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:54.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:58.370 --> 00:39:58.380 align:start position:0%
um things that I want to mention are the
 
00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
um barriers to the development of
 
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
affordable housing that I saw while
 
00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
working at HUD as I said for 29 years
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
um and there are a number of them
 
00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
um I guess the most obvious one up front
 
00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:15.180 align:start position:0%
is always going to be funding uh but one
 
00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:18.380 align:start position:0%
thing that I saw over the course of time
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
was how much more complex the funding
 
00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.770 align:start position:0%
was how much more complex the funding
became

00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
became
 
00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:25.550 align:start position:0%
became
um

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
I saw many many proposals for affordable
 
00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:30.300 align:start position:0%
housing development some which succeeded
 
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
some of which didn't but in the
 
00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.829 align:start position:0%
some of which didn't but in the
beginning

00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
um very often the funding was the
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
funding from the um uh applicant for the
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
grant and the funding uh that they would
 
00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
um uh request to receive from HUD
 
00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes also they were requesting some
 
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
funding from say the New Hampshire
 
00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
Housing Finance Authority uh but by the
 
00:40:58.730 --> 00:40:58.740 align:start position:0%
time I left in 2016
 
00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
most of the project proposals that we
 
00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
saw had
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
about a dozen funding sources attached
 
00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
they were so complex and obviously the
 
00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:15.660 align:start position:0%
more funding sources were attached the
 
00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
more requirements that you had from from
 
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
each funding source the more complex it
 
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
was to put them all together to get all
 
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders to agree so I'm not
 
00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
making any suggestions as to how to
 
00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
address that I'm just bringing that
 
00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
forward as a problem that I saw that
 
00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
developed over time
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
that something that we're going to need
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
to work with the second barrier that I
 
00:41:44.329 --> 00:41:44.339 align:start position:0%
saw and this is something that is
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
certainly not true only in New Hampshire
 
00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:49.980 align:start position:0%
but all over New England and I would
 
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
think all over the country is
 
00:41:54.829 --> 00:41:54.839 align:start position:0%
exclusionary zoning
 
00:41:59.870 --> 00:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
um that is um uh zoning that
 
00:42:03.829 --> 00:42:03.839 align:start position:0%
um uh forbids multi-family housing
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
um and sometimes even for single-family
 
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:08.220 align:start position:0%
housing where you have the requirement
 
00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:11.460 align:start position:0%
for very large lot sizes
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
um to the point where it becomes
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
impossible uh to create affordable
 
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:18.660 align:start position:0%
housing because it simply can't it can't
 
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
be affordable if the lot size is an acre
 
00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:23.940 align:start position:0%
um so that's again that's another
 
00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:26.220 align:start position:0%
problem some other states have dealt
 
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
um by legislation in Massachusetts
 
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
um uh courts have dealt with it in some
 
00:42:36.109 --> 00:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
other states as in New Jersey
 
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:37.980 align:start position:0%
um honestly the the success of these
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
attempts have been limited
 
00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:42.900 align:start position:0%
um but this is uh always a serious
 
00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:45.060 align:start position:0%
barrier and again one that we're going
 
00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:47.220 align:start position:0%
to have to work with and the last thing
 
00:42:48.829 --> 00:42:48.839 align:start position:0%
I wanted to mention
 
00:42:48.839 --> 00:42:49.430 align:start position:0%
I wanted to mention
um

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:51.780 align:start position:0%
and I was interested to hear
 
00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:53.450 align:start position:0%
and I was interested to hear
representative

00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:42:56.569 --> 00:42:56.579 align:start position:0%
um yokola I'm sorry am I yokella thank
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
you uh representative yokella mentioned
 
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
um excessive code enforcement
 
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
um and that was wasn't something
 
00:43:05.809 --> 00:43:05.819 align:start position:0%
um that honestly I would would not have
 
00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
phrased it that way myself uh uh or
 
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
certainly not have not phrased it but I
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
have seen
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
that type of activity be a problem
 
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
um we're code enforcement has been used
 
00:43:23.329 --> 00:43:23.339 align:start position:0%
in what I can only describe as a
 
00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
discriminatory way
 
00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
um that is and again I was in the office
 
00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:30.839 align:start position:0%
of fair housing the the Civil Rights
 
00:43:34.309 --> 00:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
um unit and we saw this
 
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
um sometimes used by cities and towns
 
00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
um against certain groups
 
00:43:44.569 --> 00:43:44.579 align:start position:0%
um that is the code enforcement was
 
00:43:47.089 --> 00:43:47.099 align:start position:0%
stricter against some groups than
 
00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:50.700 align:start position:0%
against others also sometimes
 
00:43:54.349 --> 00:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
um it was used to keep out families with
 
00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
children and
 
00:43:58.849 --> 00:43:58.859 align:start position:0%
this is something
 
00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
um discrimination against family with
 
00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
children is illegal under both uh
 
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
federal fair housing law and under the
 
00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:07.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire laws against
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
discrimination uh it is nevertheless as
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you all know uh still quite
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
common and something that has been very
 
00:44:15.359 --> 00:44:16.790 align:start position:0%
common and something that has been very
common

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
common
 
00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:19.700 align:start position:0%
um for many many years
 
00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
back uh when I was director of the New
 
00:44:25.849 --> 00:44:25.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Human Rights Commission
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
um uh and I left there in in 1987 before
 
00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:33.180 align:start position:0%
it became illegal to discriminate
 
00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
against families with children
 
00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
but one of the most shocking uh things
 
00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
that I can remember was
 
00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
um people coming to us
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
families with children who were living
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
in their cars in the winter in New
 
00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because they could not find a
 
00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
landlord willing to rent to people with
 
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
children and
 
00:44:59.870 --> 00:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
that that was a terrible thing uh to
 
00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
hear about
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
um so I think those issues of Code
 
00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
Enforcement can also be a barrier thank
 
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you and I think um like I said
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
saint ansem College came out with a
 
00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
great study regarding exclusionary
 
00:45:14.809 --> 00:45:14.819 align:start position:0%
zoning and the color map of areas of the
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
state which units can be built and and
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
how and the zoning laws so I'd love to
 
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
kind of see that and have them speak to
 
00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
that research so thank you
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:27.420 align:start position:0%
on the topic of zoning
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
um on sort of a cosmic level I would
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to think about
 
00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:34.430 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to think about
longevity

00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
longevity
 
00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
um you know there's the old quote uh
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
where Tony Soprano says buy land because
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
they stopped making it
 
00:45:40.319 --> 00:45:41.270 align:start position:0%
they stopped making it
um

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a thing
 
00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:45.839 align:start position:0%
um where you know you look at
 
00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
restricting or you look at easing zoning
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
restrictions and I know that I will want
 
00:45:53.809 --> 00:45:53.819 align:start position:0%
to make sure as part of that compromise
 
00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
um that there is an active effort to
 
00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:56.630 align:start position:0%
um that there is an active effort to
build

00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
build
 
00:45:58.490 --> 00:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
um involved in that process too because
 
00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
one thing that has always worried me is
 
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
that uh easing those restrictions
 
00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:07.140 align:start position:0%
without a guarantee of building is how
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
you end up with you know somebody taking
 
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:12.780 align:start position:0%
50 acres of land that could otherwise be
 
00:46:14.809 --> 00:46:14.819 align:start position:0%
used for development and building a
 
00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar home on it there's
 
00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
always going to be a larger profit
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
incentive for those sort of 50 acre
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
developments than there would be for
 
00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
affordable housing so I'm not inherently
 
00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
against uh easing zoning restrictions I
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
think that would be a good thing but I
 
00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:31.140 align:start position:0%
do want to make sure that there's also
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
an additional emphasis on actually
 
00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:34.980 align:start position:0%
producing the units
 
00:46:37.609 --> 00:46:37.619 align:start position:0%
um before letting those floodgates open
 
00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
um and then just again the longevity of
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
it because you you know this is going to
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
be a problem so long as there are people
 
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
on the Earth and I would hate for us to
 
00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
solve this problem for five or ten years
 
00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
and then have to be back here with
 
00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:54.660 align:start position:0%
another select house committee
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
um in 5 10 20 years uh looking at all
 
00:46:59.450 --> 00:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
the same problems really trying to make
 
00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
sure that we're utilizing
 
00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
um the land that we have in the most
 
00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
productive and effective way possible
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
um because they're not making any more
 
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
of it
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Reed
 
00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
my earlier comment about both sides of
 
00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
the coin I think rep adjutant touched on
 
00:47:23.809 --> 00:47:23.819 align:start position:0%
that and that is to say that while I
 
00:47:25.849 --> 00:47:25.859 align:start position:0%
agree with a lot of zoning regulations
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
that need to be undone in communities
 
00:47:31.609 --> 00:47:31.619 align:start position:0%
because there's been a kind of
 
00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
traditionalist stick in the mud
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
mentality about what those towns what
 
00:47:38.569 --> 00:47:38.579 align:start position:0%
the people in those towns who perhaps
 
00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
already own their homes are outright
 
00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
want those towns to look like in the
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
idea of rural character for example lot
 
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
minimums I think is something that we
 
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
can talk about because
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
a lot there's ways to increase density
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
and reduce those lot minimums while
 
00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:55.380 align:start position:0%
retaining rural character there's a
 
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
design is actually what I got my
 
00:47:58.550 --> 00:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
master's degree in a design called open
 
00:48:01.849 --> 00:48:01.859 align:start position:0%
clusters designs which really retains
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
that role character while having much
 
00:48:05.809 --> 00:48:05.819 align:start position:0%
smaller lot minimums increase density
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
there's also multi-family housing
 
00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
designs that don't look multi-family at
 
00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
all and again I think that the point is
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
to one of the points needs to be to make
 
00:48:19.609 --> 00:48:19.619 align:start position:0%
sure that we're doing high quality
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
housing so while we're using
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
restrictions and going into partnership
 
00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:26.460 align:start position:0%
with industry we still need we have
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
leverage we still need to make that when
 
00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
make sure that when that happens we have
 
00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:33.060 align:start position:0%
a threat threshold that we want to make
 
00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:35.460 align:start position:0%
sure gets met and we're getting the
 
00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
outcomes that we want I was glad to hear
 
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
the chair bring up tiny homes if you'll
 
00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:42.839 align:start position:0%
permit me a one minute story there was a
 
00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
man in my region actually in the town of
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
Lee and I don't know if anybody here
 
00:48:49.309 --> 00:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
represents Lee uh named Peter McDonald
 
00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
who himself he was a vet and had spent
 
00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
some time homeless
 
00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
as a result of his wounds he later in
 
00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:00.660 align:start position:0%
his years when he he came into the
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
ability to own property he had bought 12
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
acres and went on a big campaign to do
 
00:49:08.569 --> 00:49:08.579 align:start position:0%
tiny homes for homeless vets and had
 
00:49:10.609 --> 00:49:10.619 align:start position:0%
showcased at all the fairs these tiny
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
homes that he had built for homeless
 
00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
vets they were completely well appointed
 
00:49:17.329 --> 00:49:17.339 align:start position:0%
and amazing things I donated money to
 
00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
him a small amount but he was he was
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
really pushing for something great the
 
00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:24.060 align:start position:0%
town of Lee eviscerated him completely
 
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
destroyed him in stymied him at every
 
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
turn I think it went to court and he
 
00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:29.940 align:start position:0%
ended up passing away and there was
 
00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of stress in his life and I
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
don't know to what extent that
 
00:49:35.329 --> 00:49:35.339 align:start position:0%
contributed to his passing but
 
00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
um that's the kind of thing I would like
 
00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
to see us actually incentivize and help
 
00:49:43.309 --> 00:49:43.319 align:start position:0%
out and certainly not prohibit
 
00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
um so I that's something I want to raise
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
also obviously at any point this
 
00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:49.140 align:start position:0%
committee is ready to talk about adus I
 
00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
am here I do have lots of support on my
 
00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:53.940 align:start position:0%
current Adu bill
 
00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Delorenzo
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
said I'm interested in is Thinking Out
 
00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
of the Box about housing models and I
 
00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
noticed that
 
00:50:10.849 --> 00:50:10.859 align:start position:0%
the malls are dying shopping malls are
 
00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
dying and I thought what a wonderful
 
00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:16.460 align:start position:0%
resource to build a community around
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
I think you could have like you could
 
00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
have home ownership like in condos you
 
00:50:23.809 --> 00:50:23.819 align:start position:0%
could have retail you could have
 
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
educational facilities and work sites
 
00:50:28.609 --> 00:50:28.619 align:start position:0%
right there so you have a contained
 
00:50:30.589 --> 00:50:30.599 align:start position:0%
Community I think that's something that
 
00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:33.300 align:start position:0%
me we may want to think about pursuing
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
at some point I think it's down the road
 
00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
maybe 10 years but I think we need to
 
00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:39.900 align:start position:0%
think about that I love that idea where
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
and we're supposed to be creative here
 
00:50:44.329 --> 00:50:44.339 align:start position:0%
representative just really quickly
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
because I representative De Lorenzo
 
00:50:47.569 --> 00:50:47.579 align:start position:0%
reminded me of something I wanted to say
 
00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
which is in addition because I know a
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
lot of what we're doing is focusing on
 
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
rentals and the ability to create
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
rentals in affordable high quality
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
rentals I also want this committee to
 
00:50:58.250 --> 00:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
focus on the problem of home ownership
 
00:50:59.809 --> 00:50:59.819 align:start position:0%
because when we're talking about the
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
housing crisis we're talking about the
 
00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
biggest crisis in the state but we're
 
00:51:04.609 --> 00:51:04.619 align:start position:0%
also talking about the second biggest
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
crisis in the state which is the graying
 
00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and the fact that we
 
00:51:11.089 --> 00:51:11.099 align:start position:0%
cannot keep in and attract young people
 
00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:12.900 align:start position:0%
simply because there's nowhere for them
 
00:51:16.450 --> 00:51:16.460 align:start position:0%
to affordably live so I think increasing
 
00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:19.319 align:start position:0%
the uh or decreasing the barriers to
 
00:51:20.809 --> 00:51:20.819 align:start position:0%
home ownership in the state which
 
00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:23.220 align:start position:0%
includes increasing affordability
 
00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:25.559 align:start position:0%
um whether by addressing property tax
 
00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:29.460 align:start position:0%
issues or other Market issues is
 
00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
something that I would like this
 
00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:31.740 align:start position:0%
committee to look into
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace thank you yes
 
00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
that's uh reusing repurposing and
 
00:51:38.329 --> 00:51:38.339 align:start position:0%
recycling any existing structures that
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
are currently vacant is it is an
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
excellent way to move forward thinking
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
outside the box
 
00:51:44.569 --> 00:51:44.579 align:start position:0%
um and also embracing the new technology
 
00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:45.780 align:start position:0%
of building
 
00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:47.700 align:start position:0%
um that is on the edge of the market a
 
00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
lot of these uh other parts of the world
 
00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
and parts of the country using 3D
 
00:51:55.309 --> 00:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
printed homes with styrofoam concrete
 
00:51:57.309 --> 00:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
reinforced styrofoam it's very thermally
 
00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
efficient a blended approach like that
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
including reform of the snob zoning I
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
mean let's face it got 2 000 square foot
 
00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
minimums on a two and a half acre house
 
00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:09.589 align:start position:0%
minimums on a two and a half acre house
lot

00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
lot
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
um isn't going to work in this market in
 
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
some communities but uh you know there's
 
00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
got to be a we can find a maybe a
 
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
balance you know with these additional
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
dwelling units tiny homes maybe that
 
00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:22.380 align:start position:0%
goes to a thousand square feet in some
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
of these communities at least it gives
 
00:52:26.569 --> 00:52:26.579 align:start position:0%
you the ability because right now to go
 
00:52:28.849 --> 00:52:28.859 align:start position:0%
and build a you know a 2 000 square foot
 
00:52:30.589 --> 00:52:30.599 align:start position:0%
on a first floor home
 
00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:31.740 align:start position:0%
let's face it you're going to be
 
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
spending in the vicinity of a half a
 
00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:35.220 align:start position:0%
million dollars presently that's
 
00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
probably not affordable for most young
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
people in first time home buyers we've
 
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
got to get down into that sweet spot in
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
the 250 the 350 range and you know a
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
thousand feet on the first floor might
 
00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:47.700 align:start position:0%
get us in that neighborhood with a half
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
acre lot
 
00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:52.809 align:start position:0%
acre lot
foreign

00:52:52.809 --> 00:52:52.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit more ambitious than uh
 
00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
to two to three hundred thousand dollars
 
00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:00.780 align:start position:0%
for a home and actually I I do mostly
 
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:02.940 align:start position:0%
think about it more as home ownership
 
00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:06.780 align:start position:0%
than than rental I think of it as
 
00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:07.549 align:start position:0%
than than rental I think of it as
um

00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
like the home that I bought was a
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars I want I want
 
00:53:14.569 --> 00:53:14.579 align:start position:0%
why aren't we building a hundred
 
00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:16.380 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar homes
 
00:53:21.049 --> 00:53:21.059 align:start position:0%
on and is it illegal in the state of New
 
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to build a hundred thousand
 
00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
dollar home when when there are places
 
00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:26.700 align:start position:0%
in the state that have 10 acre minimum
 
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
lot requirements
 
00:53:32.329 --> 00:53:32.339 align:start position:0%
yes that it is illegal to build a
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollar home in that in
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
that part of the state right and so
 
00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:39.780 align:start position:0%
um and also someone was mentioning
 
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
um that how how people have over time
 
00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:46.380 align:start position:0%
like my my hundred thousand dollar house
 
00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
is built on 0.17 Acres right and now my
 
00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
town has a two acre lot requirement so
 
00:53:57.370 --> 00:53:57.380 align:start position:0%
my home to build in my community
 
00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
matching the character of my street is
 
00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
illegal like you can't one street over
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
build New Lots the exact same that my
 
00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:08.220 align:start position:0%
street is
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
why is that illegal
 
00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
um it's not because of the historical
 
00:54:15.650 --> 00:54:15.660 align:start position:0%
character my house has been there since
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
the 50s right and it's pre-even
 
00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:22.200 align:start position:0%
um some of these more restrictive zoning
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
stuff and so I think that
 
00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
um a lot of that sometimes they're using
 
00:54:30.849 --> 00:54:30.859 align:start position:0%
that stuff as excuses of uh because
 
00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
there already are places in the past
 
00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
that have built in on smaller lot sizes
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
um and it didn't I my my neighbors are
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
not hurting me and and we get all along
 
00:54:48.770 --> 00:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
just fine right and so it's not harming
 
00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
the people around it
 
00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:54.900 align:start position:0%
um I think that um tiny tiny homes
 
00:54:58.130 --> 00:54:58.140 align:start position:0%
um things built you know uh that someone
 
00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
could buy for under a hundred thousand
 
00:55:02.329 --> 00:55:02.339 align:start position:0%
dollars that they could get a 30 year
 
00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:04.980 align:start position:0%
mortgage on and essentially any job in
 
00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
the state could be able to afford the
 
00:55:07.549 --> 00:55:07.559 align:start position:0%
rent of it
 
00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:09.900 align:start position:0%
or the mortgage of it because it's you
 
00:55:12.589 --> 00:55:12.599 align:start position:0%
know 400 a month
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
that is what what
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
um helps like that first starter person
 
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
that right now there are so many people
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
my age that are well maybe a little bit
 
00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:24.660 align:start position:0%
younger than me now that I'm getting
 
00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
older but are able are not able to get
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
into their first home because all the
 
00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:32.339 align:start position:0%
houses are five hundred thousand dollars
 
00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
and you have to be making you have to be
 
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
essentially married and have two incomes
 
00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
to be able to afford a single mortgage
 
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:43.069 align:start position:0%
and so
yeah

00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:45.780 align:start position:0%
um and so where is that that person that
 
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
is 20
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
that has a full-time job that is wanting
 
00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:52.980 align:start position:0%
to um you know either rent or buy why
 
00:55:54.349 --> 00:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
aren't both of those options available
 
00:55:57.290 --> 00:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
to them because there's no houses that
 
00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
are possible to be bought at that uh
 
00:56:03.049 --> 00:56:03.059 align:start position:0%
that rate and these people aren't asking
 
00:56:06.349 --> 00:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
for you know mcmansion they just want a
 
00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:09.300 align:start position:0%
place that that um
 
00:56:12.290 --> 00:56:12.300 align:start position:0%
that they can that they can call their
 
00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
own and possibly you know once they pay
 
00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:18.780 align:start position:0%
off that then use that Equity to to get
 
00:56:20.569 --> 00:56:20.579 align:start position:0%
into something nicer when they want to
 
00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
start a family because a lot of the
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
times some some of these restrictions
 
00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
are people aren't uh especially at
 
00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:31.740 align:start position:0%
zoning and zba and when we're we're
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
trying to change some of that stuff and
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
allow housing to come in people are are
 
00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
very worried about children coming in
 
00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:39.290 align:start position:0%
very worried about children coming in
and

00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:39.300 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
um and because they're very expensive to
 
00:56:45.049 --> 00:56:45.059 align:start position:0%
to teach at the school level
 
00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
um and so there there is still some
 
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
discrimination as far as like we don't
 
00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:52.380 align:start position:0%
want to allow this development or or
 
00:56:53.930 --> 00:56:53.940 align:start position:0%
work we're concerned about this
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
development because it's going to cost
 
00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
our taxpayers a lot of money
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
if they if they happen to have kids or
 
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
something like that but
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
um some of these smaller homes that my
 
00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
house is not even a thousand square feet
 
00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:09.109 align:start position:0%
house is not even a thousand square feet
um

00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
I you know there's only so many kids I
 
00:57:13.849 --> 00:57:13.859 align:start position:0%
could possibly have in my place right
 
00:57:16.609 --> 00:57:16.619 align:start position:0%
because it's not that big and so if you
 
00:57:19.210 --> 00:57:19.220 align:start position:0%
build these really small starter homes
 
00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
they are not necessarily putting a lot
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
of of uh effort on the on the school
 
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
system because there's just not enough
 
00:57:30.829 --> 00:57:30.839 align:start position:0%
room to have those those these are
 
00:57:30.839 --> 00:57:32.270 align:start position:0%
room to have those those these are
starter

00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
starter
 
00:57:35.089 --> 00:57:35.099 align:start position:0%
um starter homes right where you're just
 
00:57:36.410 --> 00:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
starting out you don't have kids you're
 
00:57:39.530 --> 00:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
not married all of that stuff and
 
00:57:42.890 --> 00:57:42.900 align:start position:0%
um so this would uh create taxpayers
 
00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
that aren't really over overburdening
 
00:57:48.049 --> 00:57:48.059 align:start position:0%
the the school system and would help
 
00:57:50.809 --> 00:57:50.819 align:start position:0%
them to be able to get the to those 300
 
00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:52.140 align:start position:0%
to 500
 
00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:53.460 align:start position:0%
000 homes
 
00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:55.140 align:start position:0%
that representative Wallace was talking
 
00:57:57.290 --> 00:57:57.300 align:start position:0%
about so thanks thank you and I find it
 
00:57:58.790 --> 00:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
I actually find it truly unfortunate
 
00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
that my two bedroom townhouse the
 
00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:02.780 align:start position:0%
mortgage on that is
 
00:58:05.569 --> 00:58:05.579 align:start position:0%
significantly less than what it would
 
00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
cost somebody to rent a two-bedroom
 
00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
townhouse in the state and that just
 
00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:12.660 align:start position:0%
goes to the the the lack of supply of
 
00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
like less homes but less like smaller
 
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
lesser value homes so
 
00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
representative Reed at risk of speaking
 
00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
too much I just want to lift up
 
00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:25.740 align:start position:0%
everything that representative yokella
 
00:58:27.290 --> 00:58:27.300 align:start position:0%
just said I think he saw me violently
 
00:58:28.609 --> 00:58:28.619 align:start position:0%
nodding my head throughout the entire
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
thing and I think that addressing home
 
00:58:30.599 --> 00:58:31.910 align:start position:0%
thing and I think that addressing home
ownership

00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
ownership
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
has the market effect of bringing down
 
00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
rental rates anyway so if we get to that
 
00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:39.540 align:start position:0%
core because I think it's it's almost
 
00:58:41.450 --> 00:58:41.460 align:start position:0%
animalistic in its need it's you know
 
00:58:44.690 --> 00:58:44.700 align:start position:0%
Maslow's you know hierarchy that we have
 
00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
a place every animal has its den we need
 
00:58:49.970 --> 00:58:49.980 align:start position:0%
a place to call our own and as while
 
00:58:52.849 --> 00:58:52.859 align:start position:0%
people can live long-term in rentals if
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
you want truly stable communities
 
00:58:56.809 --> 00:58:56.819 align:start position:0%
homeownership benefits pretty much every
 
00:58:59.390 --> 00:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
single metric in communities so really
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
overcoming those barriers to home
 
00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
ownership is is really important there
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
was another thing that you reminded me
 
00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:07.020 align:start position:0%
to say but I forget it now so I'm just
 
00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:08.700 align:start position:0%
going to tell you how great you are
 
00:59:10.970 --> 00:59:10.980 align:start position:0%
in on this because we can't agree on
 
00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:17.150 align:start position:0%
in on this because we can't agree on
everything

00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:18.839 align:start position:0%
I know that um
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
we all have good ideas on how to
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
make things more affordable but
 
00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
a lot of the problem is us us meaning
 
00:59:29.809 --> 00:59:29.819 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire the local
 
00:59:32.329 --> 00:59:32.339 align:start position:0%
zoning and planning boards nobody's
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
going to want to give up any of their
 
00:59:33.599 --> 00:59:34.430 align:start position:0%
going to want to give up any of their
power

00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
power
 
00:59:36.289 --> 00:59:36.299 align:start position:0%
and that's where your resistance is
 
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
going to come from no matter what kind
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
of ideas we have you still have the
 
00:59:44.770 --> 00:59:44.780 align:start position:0%
state with the vpa laws I know last week
 
00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:47.700 align:start position:0%
A house came on the market I called a
 
00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
client boom we went and looked at it it
 
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
was under agreement for six weeks
 
00:59:55.309 --> 00:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
it couldn't get financing because they
 
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
were going FHA and the well was too
 
01:00:00.289 --> 01:00:00.299 align:start position:0%
close to the septic system
 
01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
by not very much so they couldn't buy
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
that house so my client went in
 
01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
conventional loan boom we're all set
 
01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:10.740 align:start position:0%
so these FHA buyers have these
 
01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
guidelines FHA guidelines that are going
 
01:00:16.609 --> 01:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
to restrict them on a lot of things
 
01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
our our state government with their EPA
 
01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:22.380 align:start position:0%
laws are going to restrict people also
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
so where do we start I think we start at
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
the top and look at our state laws and
 
01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
only we can change those
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
okay that's something that we can we can
 
01:00:33.599 --> 01:00:34.430 align:start position:0%
okay that's something that we can we can
change

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
these other things
 
01:00:38.569 --> 01:00:38.579 align:start position:0%
um people selling their homes in
 
01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts coming up and outfitting
 
01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
every young couple who's been saving for
 
01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
five years to get their first home I'd
 
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
hate to be a young couple trying to get
 
01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:49.740 align:start position:0%
my first home being outbid from somebody
 
01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
from out of state because they just sold
 
01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
their house for a lot of money they came
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
in with cash I don't have a prayer and
 
01:00:58.370 --> 01:00:58.380 align:start position:0%
and I see more and more of that these
 
01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:00.299 align:start position:0%
young people that are really struggling
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
cannot buy out their first home
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
I I'm a single guy I I'm showing a
 
01:01:08.089 --> 01:01:08.099 align:start position:0%
restaurant this afternoon but I've sold
 
01:01:11.569 --> 01:01:11.579 align:start position:0%
a lot of restaurants uh and so I eat out
 
01:01:12.829 --> 01:01:12.839 align:start position:0%
all the time
 
01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:15.180 align:start position:0%
three bartenders that I know
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
have to leave to move in with their
 
01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
parents because their landlord's gone up
 
01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:21.660 align:start position:0%
on their rent so much one of them had to
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
move to Massachusetts to live with her
 
01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:24.530 align:start position:0%
move to Massachusetts to live with her
parents

01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
this is a problem that I don't know if
 
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
we can fix because
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
supply and demand it's whatever the
 
01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
market will bear and these landlords are
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
going to charge what they can charge
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
and there's nothing stopping them so we
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
have to look at the new either new
 
01:01:41.569 --> 01:01:41.579 align:start position:0%
construction or loosen up some state
 
01:01:43.849 --> 01:01:43.859 align:start position:0%
laws because I don't think this the
 
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
cities and towns are going to loosen up
 
01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
that much it's going to be a battle and
 
01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:50.460 align:start position:0%
if we can get around it and and somehow
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
get them to come around that's going to
 
01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:55.740 align:start position:0%
be a big challenge I think
 
01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:57.230 align:start position:0%
be a big challenge I think
representative

01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:01:59.510 --> 01:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair
 
01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
um full disclosure to to prove that I am
 
01:02:04.849 --> 01:02:04.859 align:start position:0%
here in a positive manner I did live in
 
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
a mobile home I loved it I wish I was
 
01:02:08.569 --> 01:02:08.579 align:start position:0%
still in it because I would have retired
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
by now so
 
01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:13.980 align:start position:0%
um but like I said before I'm still a
 
01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
firm believer that they get to solve
 
01:02:17.569 --> 01:02:17.579 align:start position:0%
problems we need to get to the root of
 
01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
how we got here so in general terms I
 
01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
think it would be good information CNAs
 
01:02:23.089 --> 01:02:23.099 align:start position:0%
might be able to help with this because
 
01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
I have seen a few of their studies how
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
long have we been trending in this
 
01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
direction is it something that's been
 
01:02:29.809 --> 01:02:29.819 align:start position:0%
happening because of spikes or has it
 
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
been a gradual thing I don't know
 
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
um as representative Broody said the
 
01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
coveted migration
 
01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
did how much of an impact did that have
 
01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
nobody wants to talk about it I'm sure
 
01:02:43.370 --> 01:02:43.380 align:start position:0%
but in terms of affordable housing
 
01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
what's the impact of illegal immigration
 
01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
and people seeking Asylum just looking
 
01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
for a better life these people are
 
01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:52.140 align:start position:0%
moving somewhere and I have a funny
 
01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
feeling they're in what used to be the
 
01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:55.740 align:start position:0%
affordable housing for your bartenders
 
01:02:59.150 --> 01:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
waitresses and everybody else why I
 
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
think it's important because some of
 
01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
these problems are created by the
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
federal government and so if we're
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
looking for Solutions then maybe we
 
01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
should be looking at them for some of
 
01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:08.420 align:start position:0%
the financial
 
01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:10.270 align:start position:0%
the financial
help

01:03:10.270 --> 01:03:10.280 align:start position:0%
help
 
01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
some of this other information I just
 
01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
jot it down again that sane as may help
 
01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:17.220 align:start position:0%
and maybe other resources
 
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
um and and some of this I think was
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
touched on it I just think it's
 
01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
important information to have
 
01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
I think you already mentioned it how
 
01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
many what are what and how many towns
 
01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
are already doing things to solve this
 
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
problem because he knows about it now
 
01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:32.460 align:start position:0%
um I know we're in in Hooksett we're
 
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
currently going through our master plan
 
01:03:35.930 --> 01:03:35.940 align:start position:0%
draft as well you know and a lot of
 
01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
these changes uh are being suggested
 
01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
we're also waiting to get the results of
 
01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
our housing needs assessment that's
 
01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
being done through the Southern New
 
01:03:45.289 --> 01:03:45.299 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Planning Commission
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
um another good question to ask how many
 
01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
towns municipalities currently
 
01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:54.299 align:start position:0%
um comply with the statute that already
 
01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
is in the books in terms of its
 
01:03:58.130 --> 01:03:58.140 align:start position:0%
percentage of affordable housing there
 
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
is a statute that says you need to have
 
01:04:01.970 --> 01:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
a percentage of units that are
 
01:04:03.950 --> 01:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
affordable and be interesting to see how
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
this works by the region
 
01:04:10.130 --> 01:04:10.140 align:start position:0%
um other ones too where
 
01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
who's not increasing their stock in
 
01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
their inventory I can tell you right now
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
Hooksett were sitting on almost 1100
 
01:04:16.319 --> 01:04:17.750 align:start position:0%
Hooksett were sitting on almost 1100
approvals

01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
approvals
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
for for residents uh some singles some
 
01:04:23.329 --> 01:04:23.339 align:start position:0%
multi-family two apartment buildings one
 
01:04:26.569 --> 01:04:26.579 align:start position:0%
400 unit assisted living facility
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
um it's just a myriad across the board
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
so I mean it's not that we're not
 
01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:34.140 align:start position:0%
growing in Hooksett but I did see a
 
01:04:35.329 --> 01:04:35.339 align:start position:0%
study somewhere and I can't remember
 
01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
where it was from that it showed at a
 
01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
lot of this towns in Southern New
 
01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire especially Merrimack Valley
 
01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
have been increasing two to three
 
01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:44.220 align:start position:0%
hundred percent over the last 10 years
 
01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:46.859 align:start position:0%
in stock in inventory
 
01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
but then the municipalities your larger
 
01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
ones your Manchester's your nashuas
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
we're only increasing at 40 percent
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
so I I just think it would be
 
01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
interesting to see what the trends are
 
01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
who's doing what uh in terms of making
 
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
decisions on what needs to change at the
 
01:05:04.849 --> 01:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
state level
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
um I think representative baruti is
 
01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:07.980 align:start position:0%
going to be our biggest one I think
 
01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
other developers should be coming in
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
here to give us the challenges of why
 
01:05:13.789 --> 01:05:13.799 align:start position:0%
these things aren't affordable to build
 
01:05:16.490 --> 01:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
without funding wow so that's
 
01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
information I welcome with open arms the
 
01:05:23.450 --> 01:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
only thing I'll say in in in
 
01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
rebut to something representative Broody
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
said about it's about the planning and
 
01:05:30.650 --> 01:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
power of uh that the power of planning
 
01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:32.339 align:start position:0%
and zoning boards
 
01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
I've been doing this for 13 years I
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
don't look at my position on the
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
planning board of having anything to do
 
01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
with power the power in these decisions
 
01:05:41.809 --> 01:05:41.819 align:start position:0%
on the zoning ordinance is the people
 
01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
that live there
 
01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
right now Hooksett is one of many towns
 
01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:48.780 align:start position:0%
that still allows the basically a
 
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
referendum for the people of the town to
 
01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
decide because you have to agree it's a
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
trust what they want their future to
 
01:05:59.530 --> 01:05:59.540 align:start position:0%
look like there is currently a challenge
 
01:06:02.270 --> 01:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
by the Town Council to strip the
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
citizens of that decision and to put it
 
01:06:06.109 --> 01:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
within the hands of the council I am
 
01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:07.980 align:start position:0%
adamantly against that we want to talk
 
01:06:09.890 --> 01:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
about a bill prohibiting that might be
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
all ears for that but this is and I
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
agree this is challenging and there's a
 
01:06:17.870 --> 01:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
lot of different angles to this and I
 
01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:19.619 align:start position:0%
just think as many things as we can get
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
from information to get started will put
 
01:06:24.410 --> 01:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
us in the place we need to be to start
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
picking away at it thank you go ahead
 
01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
represent Bertie thank you Mr chairman
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
um for the record I've never had a
 
01:06:33.549 --> 01:06:33.559 align:start position:0%
problem with the hooks at planning board
 
01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
but but um
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
the point that I made was probably a
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
personal experience I had just before
 
01:06:43.549 --> 01:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
covert I was doing a subdivision
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
in Laconia
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
and it took us 14 months to get approval
 
01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
and we went in every every month we'd go
 
01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
in and did exactly what they told us to
 
01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
do and then finally when there was
 
01:06:58.849 --> 01:06:58.859 align:start position:0%
nothing else to be said or done one of
 
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
the members said I just don't like this
 
01:07:04.010 --> 01:07:04.020 align:start position:0%
project because I'm in a butter
 
01:07:06.829 --> 01:07:06.839 align:start position:0%
that's where it comes in it's the local
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
people with personal reasons why
 
01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
something won't in these small towns you
 
01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:13.740 align:start position:0%
can't get a small town without somebody
 
01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
having a personal reason or whatever
 
01:07:16.730 --> 01:07:16.740 align:start position:0%
goes on there
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't a geared towards toxic but
 
01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:22.140 align:start position:0%
we we have a lot of small towns and I
 
01:07:24.049 --> 01:07:24.059 align:start position:0%
think a lot of small towns do have snob
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
zoning I did the first cluster for
 
01:07:29.450 --> 01:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
development in the town of Auburn
 
01:07:31.849 --> 01:07:31.859 align:start position:0%
it was on the books it was legal we went
 
01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:34.980 align:start position:0%
in we mapped it all out and they held us
 
01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:35.809 align:start position:0%
in we mapped it all out and they held us
up

01:07:35.809 --> 01:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
and that was another 14-month process
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
in the middle they changed the zoning
 
01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
from two acres to two acres here and
 
01:07:46.970 --> 01:07:46.980 align:start position:0%
three acres over here they just totally
 
01:07:49.010 --> 01:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
knocked us off rail
 
01:07:51.230 --> 01:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
so this is a personal thing with
 
01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
planning boards that do things that have
 
01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
if we did get it through but we lost a
 
01:07:57.470 --> 01:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
couple of units
 
01:07:59.690 --> 01:07:59.700 align:start position:0%
so representative Walston representative
 
01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair I don't disagree
 
01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
representative Rudy that there are some
 
01:08:06.049 --> 01:08:06.059 align:start position:0%
towns that probably operate like that I
 
01:08:07.609 --> 01:08:07.619 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's the majority
 
01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
I know I have a speech rehearsed to all
 
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
the butters that we as a planning board
 
01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:13.799 align:start position:0%
are simply here to enforce the ordinance
 
01:08:15.349 --> 01:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
that are before us and our development
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
regulations if there are issues between
 
01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
the the Butters and the developers we do
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
the best we can to you know find
 
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
Solutions but but I don't know
 
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
or I don't I don't want to believe that
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
it's that widespread that there are that
 
01:08:32.329 --> 01:08:32.339 align:start position:0%
many zoning boards that would use that
 
01:08:34.490 --> 01:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
kind of abuse so something we can
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
certainly look at I just wanted to
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
mention it
 
01:08:39.169 --> 01:08:39.179 align:start position:0%
developer it's got a lot of money
 
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
invested in a project a lot of time a
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
lot of money and to get thrown off track
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
because of personal reasons and it does
 
01:08:50.329 --> 01:08:50.339 align:start position:0%
happen in smaller towns representative
 
01:08:53.329 --> 01:08:53.339 align:start position:0%
Reed so thank you Mr chair
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the data that the
 
01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative is saying we need I
 
01:08:58.729 --> 01:08:58.739 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree I agree with all the
 
01:09:00.349 --> 01:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
data that he said we need I'm hoping a
 
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
lot of it might be provided by New
 
01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:03.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing hopefully and I'm
 
01:09:06.289 --> 01:09:06.299 align:start position:0%
seeing nods all right so I look forward
 
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
to to those presentations and that
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
documentation because it is something we
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
really do need to get into the weeds and
 
01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
and study this and get into the numbers
 
01:09:19.849 --> 01:09:19.859 align:start position:0%
um as far as you know uh zoning and how
 
01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
much of a problem it is I just have two
 
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
very quick because I also by the way
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
something else you touched on
 
01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
um you know not just mobile homes which
 
01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:30.900 align:start position:0%
any more excellent but all other kinds
 
01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:33.179 align:start position:0%
of kind of non-conventional housing
 
01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
things like Quonset homes which have
 
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
become a huge thing extremely
 
01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
inexpensive and easy to put up but more
 
01:09:42.349 --> 01:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
weather durable than even a stick built
 
01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:44.940 align:start position:0%
um thing modular homes these things we
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
should be investigating these things and
 
01:09:48.769 --> 01:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
making sure that towns are not unfairly
 
01:09:50.150 --> 01:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
prohibiting them or just even
 
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
accidentally them but in terms of zoning
 
01:09:57.169 --> 01:09:57.179 align:start position:0%
the two quick anecdotes I had an idea
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
for a bill which I ended up putting in
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
when I put it in all of my co-sponsors
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
were of the opposite party from me but
 
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
at the time I had the idea I asked a
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative who was of the same party
 
01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:12.780 align:start position:0%
as me and it was to address what is a
 
01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:14.219 align:start position:0%
regressive tax structure which is
 
01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
property tax which effectively taxes
 
01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
people out of their ability to own a
 
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
home to the point that you could inherit
 
01:10:23.570 --> 01:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
a home outright and not be able to live
 
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
in it so I was trying to address this in
 
01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
a fair way and the member that I
 
01:10:32.169 --> 01:10:32.179 align:start position:0%
proposed the idea to who was of my party
 
01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
said well if you do that you'll be
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
attracting all the wrong kinds of people
 
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
so yeah and I was like and it's just of
 
01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:42.900 align:start position:0%
my own party I'm like what
 
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
um and then the other anecdote is when I
 
01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
was trying to address the Adu situation
 
01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
before covet before the crisis was as
 
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
bad as it is now
 
01:10:52.729 --> 01:10:52.739 align:start position:0%
I called my town planner asking why we
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
were prohibiting
 
01:10:57.169 --> 01:10:57.179 align:start position:0%
um adus from being built within a
 
01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:00.780 align:start position:0%
completely pre-existing built within
 
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
completely within a pre-existing
 
01:11:04.729 --> 01:11:04.739 align:start position:0%
detached structure because what does it
 
01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
matter you've already got the footprint
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
down you've already approved the
 
01:11:09.229 --> 01:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
structure let someone live there you
 
01:11:10.729 --> 01:11:10.739 align:start position:0%
can't even tell if you're driving by if
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
someone lives in the garage and she goes
 
01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
oh because I'm talking about the need
 
01:11:16.970 --> 01:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
for more housing and she goes we already
 
01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
do enough for this is our town planner a
 
01:11:21.169 --> 01:11:21.179 align:start position:0%
previous Town planner not our current
 
01:11:23.149 --> 01:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
one we already do enough for those
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
people they have the trailers and they
 
01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
have the apartments to which I had to
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
rebut I am one of those people and I'm
 
01:11:31.010 --> 01:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
also one of your representatives so
 
01:11:32.930 --> 01:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
um I have a problem with that so this is
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
what we're battling that you know and I
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
I feel like it might be generational not
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
to offend anybody I apologize it's it's
 
01:11:41.149 --> 01:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
this broad stroke for sure but there
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
seems to be
 
01:11:45.890 --> 01:11:45.900 align:start position:0%
um an old-fashioned mindset about what
 
01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:47.460 align:start position:0%
we want our towns to look like which
 
01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:48.780 align:start position:0%
doesn't match the realities today
 
01:11:51.410 --> 01:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
because you can't just go and buy like
 
01:11:53.450 --> 01:11:53.460 align:start position:0%
people used to for like one or two years
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
income buy a house anymore there's no
 
01:11:59.209 --> 01:11:59.219 align:start position:0%
five-digit houses on the market anymore
 
01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:04.570 align:start position:0%
go ahead
myself

01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:04.580 align:start position:0%
myself
 
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
I want my town to have my kids living
 
01:12:09.229 --> 01:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
here and not have to move out of state
 
01:12:10.729 --> 01:12:10.739 align:start position:0%
because they can't afford to live here
 
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
or get a good job that's what I want my
 
01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
town to look like my town in the last
 
01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
year has had hundreds of people and
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
these are our postal workers our
 
01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
restaurant workers young professionals
 
01:12:24.350 --> 01:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
and Veterans have been pushed out not
 
01:12:26.270 --> 01:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
just out of our town but out of our
 
01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
entire region and out of the state in
 
01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
many cases so I sympathize
 
01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:32.930 align:start position:0%
many cases so I sympathize
representative

01:12:32.930 --> 01:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:12:35.149 --> 01:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
did you have something oh I I just
 
01:12:37.610 --> 01:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
wanted to say um the syndrome that we're
 
01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
talking about is NIMBY not in my
 
01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
backyard yes
 
01:12:44.209 --> 01:12:44.219 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um so regarding next steps
 
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
I think we kind of got a good idea of
 
01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
what we want to do
 
01:12:49.729 --> 01:12:49.739 align:start position:0%
um do Fridays or Mondays work I heard
 
01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
from representative agiton has a
 
01:12:52.970 --> 01:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
conflict on Mondays but does Fridays
 
01:12:56.149 --> 01:12:56.159 align:start position:0%

01:12:56.159 --> 01:12:57.229 align:start position:0%
work for everyone

no
longer

01:13:00.050 --> 01:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%

01:13:34.729 --> 01:13:34.739 align:start position:0%
um and I guess I was hoping that um if
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
this committee met it it might be more
 
01:13:39.530 --> 01:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
likely to be on Monday I mean I'll I'll
 
01:13:41.330 --> 01:13:41.340 align:start position:0%
adjust to whatever I have to because I
 
01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
think this committee is very important
 
01:13:46.010 --> 01:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'm just putting in a plug
 
01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
um for Monday if possible okay
 
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to try to schedule
 
01:13:52.490 --> 01:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
represent Broody and I came up with one
 
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
Friday moving forward in the middle of
 
01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:55.140 align:start position:0%
February but I think a lot of our
 
01:13:57.410 --> 01:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
committee responsibilities will end
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
um towards the end of February early
 
01:14:00.410 --> 01:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
March we should get most of those bills
 
01:14:01.729 --> 01:14:01.739 align:start position:0%
out of committee
 
01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:03.780 align:start position:0%
um so I'm looking at
 
01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
um February 17th starting at 10 A.M have
 
01:14:09.649 --> 01:14:09.659 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a day of it maybe listen
 
01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
to a couple presentations in the morning
 
01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
couple in the afternoon I've already
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
extended invites to the New Hampshire
 
01:14:16.570 --> 01:14:16.580 align:start position:0%
Realtors to give us a whole
 
01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:18.169 align:start position:0%
Realtors to give us a whole
all-encompassing

01:14:18.169 --> 01:14:18.179 align:start position:0%
all-encompassing
 
01:14:18.179 --> 01:14:19.729 align:start position:0%
all-encompassing
um

01:14:19.729 --> 01:14:19.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:21.900 align:start position:0%
description of what's going on
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
um we're going to have a couple
 
01:14:24.410 --> 01:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
developers come in and tell us what
 
01:14:25.490 --> 01:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
their roadblocks are from beginning
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
beginning to end uh representative Rudy
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
will send the invites out and then I'll
 
01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
also send an invite to Saint ansem
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
college for them to do their
 
01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
presentation on zoning and see if
 
01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
they're available to do that as well so
 
01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:37.860 align:start position:0%
is there anybody I mean we're gonna this
 
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
is like the most Broad and we're gonna
 
01:14:41.209 --> 01:14:41.219 align:start position:0%
try to zero in once we get more
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
information but is there anybody else
 
01:14:45.250 --> 01:14:45.260 align:start position:0%
you'd like to hear from in that meeting
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned at the beginning I would
 
01:14:49.729 --> 01:14:49.739 align:start position:0%
like to hear from New Hampshire housing
 
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
as well as New Hampshire legal
 
01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
assistance for what the needs actually
 
01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
are so when we get the data from
 
01:14:59.330 --> 01:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
Builders we can kind of match need with
 
01:15:02.570 --> 01:15:02.580 align:start position:0%
with obstacles back to scheduling are
 
01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
you planning Mr chair on every Monday
 
01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
except for the week of the 13th in which
 
01:15:09.890 --> 01:15:09.900 align:start position:0%
case it'll be Friday or is it the next
 
01:15:11.689 --> 01:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
one is the 17th the next meeting will be
 
01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:13.140 align:start position:0%
the 17th and then we'll look forward
 
01:15:15.490 --> 01:15:15.500 align:start position:0%
after that okay thank you representative
 
01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I know you're on
 
01:15:20.570 --> 01:15:20.580 align:start position:0%
Judiciary and they're hearing a lot of
 
01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
real estate bills
 
01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:25.020 align:start position:0%
can you pull together some of the bills
 
01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
that might we might look at
 
01:15:29.330 --> 01:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
to have problems that we might be
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
addressing here
 
01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:32.030 align:start position:0%
addressing here
yes

01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:15:33.649 --> 01:15:33.659 align:start position:0%
um representative Delorenzo can help
 
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
with that as well
 
01:15:37.130 --> 01:15:37.140 align:start position:0%
um we heard a number of landlord tenant
 
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
bills last week
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
um representative Reed some of
 
01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
Representative Reed's bills and uh
 
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
moving forward I think there's some
 
01:15:44.330 --> 01:15:44.340 align:start position:0%
where you can find compromise I'm
 
01:15:45.649 --> 01:15:45.659 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
um particular uh the application fee one
 
01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
we may be able to but like I said I
 
01:15:54.290 --> 01:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
think if these are bills that committees
 
01:15:55.790 --> 01:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
are retaining
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
um or you know holding on to for
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
whatever reason we can ask that those
 
01:16:00.770 --> 01:16:00.780 align:start position:0%
come to this committee and kind of work
 
01:16:03.530 --> 01:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
on those as well but representative they
 
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
come to our committee but look at it to
 
01:16:07.550 --> 01:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
see if we have a solution to whatever
 
01:16:10.490 --> 01:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
problem okay that's a I think that's a
 
01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
good idea but also I would like to make
 
01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:14.780 align:start position:0%
sure we do not forget Municipal
 
01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
committee because there are a number of
 
01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:19.140 align:start position:0%
housing bills in the municipal committee
 
01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
some of which they've already execed but
 
01:16:22.729 --> 01:16:22.739 align:start position:0%
I think it's still Worth US looking and
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
kind of maybe coming up with language
 
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
proposed for a future year
 
01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
and and just to add a lot of these bills
 
01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
may be tabled and we're able to look at
 
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
those bills or put them onto a bill that
 
01:16:38.930 --> 01:16:38.940 align:start position:0%
we end up coming together next year as
 
01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
long as they're not itl'd and they're
 
01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
um I first of all um I want to support
 
01:16:48.290 --> 01:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
representative Reed about um needing to
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
work with the municipal committee
 
01:16:51.890 --> 01:16:51.900 align:start position:0%
because I I think it's almost certain
 
01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the issues that we need to
 
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
deal with in regard to zoning
 
01:16:58.669 --> 01:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
um uh will be before the municipal
 
01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:00.900 align:start position:0%
committee and then
 
01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
um uh back to scheduling
 
01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:04.189 align:start position:0%
um uh back to scheduling
um

01:17:04.189 --> 01:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay I don't want to create a problem
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
and I will reschedule if I have to but
 
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid the 17th was the day I loaded
 
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:14.810 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
but if it's the 17th um I'll I'll do
 
01:17:20.209 --> 01:17:20.219 align:start position:0%
whatever I can to reschedule them just
 
01:17:22.610 --> 01:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
to offer a possibility
 
01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
um understanding that this is after a
 
01:17:27.649 --> 01:17:27.659 align:start position:0%
two-day session a potential two-day
 
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
session in the beginning of February
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
break um I don't have anything on the
 
01:17:31.679 --> 01:17:32.870 align:start position:0%
break um I don't have anything on the
24th

01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
24th
 
01:17:42.850 --> 01:17:42.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to have the committee stand
 
01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
by on a future date and I'll look with
 
01:17:49.850 --> 01:17:49.860 align:start position:0%
consultation with rapper Rudy on a day
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
for us moving forward
 
01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.689 align:start position:0%
for us moving forward
um

01:17:53.689 --> 01:17:53.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:55.850 --> 01:17:55.860 align:start position:0%
and we will um I'll coordinate with the
 
01:17:57.050 --> 01:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
relevant stakeholders and make sure they
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
get invites to this and I'm hoping to do
 
01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
like kind of a longer day with this so
 
01:18:01.970 --> 01:18:01.980 align:start position:0%
we can have you know three or four
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
pretty heavy presentations and get a
 
01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
holistic approach to this so maybe a
 
01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
morning and afternoon session so
 
01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
um with that does anybody else go ahead
 
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
so sorry should I go ahead and
 
01:18:13.490 --> 01:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
reschedule those things for the 17th or
 
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
wait until
 
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
um if if you can and just follow up with
 
01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
me in the next couple next day or two
 
01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
that'd be helpful for us because I can't
 
01:18:21.649 --> 01:18:21.659 align:start position:0%
start scheduling these stakeholders
 
01:18:24.290 --> 01:18:24.300 align:start position:0%
until right we have to right okay
 
01:18:26.689 --> 01:18:26.699 align:start position:0%
started that as quickly as I can thank
 
01:18:30.169 --> 01:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:31.850 --> 01:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
it's penciled yes
 
01:18:33.890 --> 01:18:33.900 align:start position:0%
pencil it in
 
01:18:35.630 --> 01:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
right is there anything else come before
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
a committee
 
01:18:40.010 --> 01:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
oh I I'm on Municipal and County
 
01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:42.060 align:start position:0%
government so
 
01:18:44.689 --> 01:18:44.699 align:start position:0%
um I can uh
 
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
and I don't care which Friday or Monday
 
01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
um but uh I think a lot of the stuff
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
coming out of Municipal and county is
 
01:18:55.729 --> 01:18:55.739 align:start position:0%
going on consent and we're pretty much
 
01:18:57.290 --> 01:18:57.300 align:start position:0%
going to be done I think we have like
 
01:18:59.810 --> 01:18:59.820 align:start position:0%
six more bills to be to hear and then
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
we're gonna like exec everything and
 
01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
maybe we have some second committee
 
01:19:05.209 --> 01:19:05.219 align:start position:0%
bills or something but pretty much
 
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
everything is going to be disposed of
 
01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:08.209 align:start position:0%
everything is going to be disposed of
pretty

01:19:08.209 --> 01:19:08.219 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
soon out of Municipal and County
 
01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:12.770 align:start position:0%
soon out of Municipal and County
Government

01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
Government
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
but I do think it's a good point that
 
01:19:16.610 --> 01:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
even if we table them on the floor they
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
can be reintroduced for next year
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
or right a version that we work on I
 
01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
mean yeah right but if they're itl even
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
on consent if they're itl'd then uh no
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
representative would be able to bring
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
forward substantially substantively
 
01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
similar language next year so that might
 
01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
be something to uh say to your committee
 
01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
if there's ever a possibility that
 
01:19:43.729 --> 01:19:43.739 align:start position:0%
instead of itl and you can table it
 
01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:45.540 align:start position:0%
um that might be something or retain it
 
01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:48.540 align:start position:0%
that would be something helpful for us
 
01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that we
 
01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um yeah I'm not sure that
 
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
the housing stuff I'm not sure that we
 
01:19:57.050 --> 01:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
have exact yet
 
01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:58.930 align:start position:0%
have exact yet
um

01:19:58.930 --> 01:19:58.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:03.229 --> 01:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
but well yeah
 
01:20:03.239 --> 01:20:05.689 align:start position:0%
but well yeah
that that's

01:20:05.689 --> 01:20:05.699 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
yeah that's
 
01:20:10.970 --> 01:20:10.980 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that that's
 
01:20:13.729 --> 01:20:13.739 align:start position:0%
I think that one what is going on the um
 
01:20:15.709 --> 01:20:15.719 align:start position:0%
on the floor
 
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
the big one is is on the floor was not
 
01:20:20.689 --> 01:20:20.699 align:start position:0%
consented to but the informational only
 
01:20:21.790 --> 01:20:21.800 align:start position:0%
one was
 
01:20:23.810 --> 01:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
informational one
 
01:20:26.510 --> 01:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not sure exactly perfect so
