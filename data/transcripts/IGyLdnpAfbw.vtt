00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
and considerate to the public trust
 
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
and committed to basic values and the
 
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
highest ethical standards
 
00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
before you should be a
 
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
seven page document uh that i prepared
 
00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
uh this is our agency budget overview
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
and uh there are some uh
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
i would say some noticeable deltas
 
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
in some of the line items uh and i'm
 
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
happy to uh self-identify those
 
00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
and and offer uh explanations uh
 
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
or i am happy to uh just entertain the
 
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.110 align:start position:0%
or i am happy to uh just entertain the
questions

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
of from any member of the committee if
 
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
that's more expedient
 
00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead and go through what all of
 
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
those are
 
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
and if we have questions we'll ask
 
00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:50.879 align:start position:0%
if i if we refer to the page
 
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
1300 of the governor's
 
00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
budget uh i'd like to just speak to some
 
00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:01.919 align:start position:0%
uh the deltas that uh exist there
 
00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:05.919 align:start position:0%
uh in on page 1300
 
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
under line zero one one
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh which is non-classified salaries
 
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
you'll see that there was between
 
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
actuals and adjusted
 
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
there's a bit of a difference there and
 
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
that is just indicative
 
00:08:25.749 --> 00:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
of the fact that i was hired in march
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
and so we did not expend all those funds
 
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
simply because
 
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
the position was not filled
 
00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:35.519 align:start position:0%
uh in line zero
 
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
two zero which is under current expenses
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
uh that line is used
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
to kind of cover the cost of consumable
 
00:08:47.519 --> 00:08:48.230 align:start position:0%
to kind of cover the cost of consumable
items

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
items
 
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
that we use during the course of our
 
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.670 align:start position:0%
that we use during the course of our
business

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
to include paper towels cleaning
 
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.190 align:start position:0%
to include paper towels cleaning
supplies

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
supplies
 
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things because of the
 
00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.110 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things because of the
pandemic

00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
and uh our inability to run our
 
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
operation in a normal way which is a
 
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
residential academy
 
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
we did not incur expenses
 
00:09:14.949 --> 00:09:14.959 align:start position:0%
uh to address 65 people living in our
 
00:09:14.959 --> 00:09:15.670 align:start position:0%
uh to address 65 people living in our
building

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
pretty much all year we conducted a vast
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
majority of our training during this
 
00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:21.670 align:start position:0%
majority of our training during this
pandemic

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
whenever possible over zoom and
 
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
only brought the recruit officers back
 
00:09:28.949 --> 00:09:28.959 align:start position:0%
into the building
 
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh when we really needed to for those
 
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
hands-on and skills development classes
 
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
that we teach
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
and that's why you see that that delta
 
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
there between
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
in line zero two four zero two four
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh speaks to the maintenance other than
 
00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%
building in grounds
 
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
and you'll notice that this is a there's
 
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
a huge
 
00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh change a huge delta between
 
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
our 2122 and
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
the budget going forward 2223
 
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
specifically the
 
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
increase is uh caused
 
00:10:18.069 --> 00:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
by two
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
new items and i'll i'll call them new
 
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
the first one is
 
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh that we were in desperate need
 
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
of a record management system slash
 
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
training management system uh presently
 
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh our uh the way that we manage
 
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
files and information is is
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
very antiquated uh we still candidly use
 
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
a fax machine
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh to have people fill out uh
 
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.630 align:start position:0%
uh to have people fill out uh
applications

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
applications
 
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
to to attend training here at the
 
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.389 align:start position:0%
to to attend training here at the
academy

00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
academy
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
uh this was uh an issue that was
 
00:10:54.959 --> 00:10:55.829 align:start position:0%
uh this was uh an issue that was
identified

00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
identified
 
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
in a 2018 i believe it was 2018
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
maybe 2019 check that it was a 2019
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
audit that had been conducted by the
 
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.389 align:start position:0%
audit that had been conducted by the
legislative

00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
budget assistance uh division
 
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
and uh and then certainly uh during the
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
leak commission
 
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh the commission recognized
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh the the vital importance of being
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
able to maintain
 
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
very accurate records to
 
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
allow us the opportunity to track uh
 
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:29.269 align:start position:0%
allow us the opportunity to track uh
each

00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
each
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
officer's training and to
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
be very organized with regard to
 
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
the if there's any disciplinary issues
 
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
so this record management system was
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
something that was identified from
 
00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
two different sources uh unrelated
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
sources the the
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh lba audit and uh the leak commission
 
00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
pstc had actually set aside
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
funding uh but in response to the
 
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.389 align:start position:0%
funding uh but in response to the
pandemic

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
initially uh the governor asked all
 
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
state agencies to
 
00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:09.519 align:start position:0%
um hold off on any purchases and so we
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
held off
 
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
using those capital funds for the
 
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
initial purchase
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
until such time as uh the state could
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
reassess the governor could reassess
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
where we were financially
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
and ultimately allowed for
 
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
us to expand those capital funds
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
the increase that you see there
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
will be the the annual cost going
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
forward to maintain that
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
learning management system record
 
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
management system uh we are working with
 
00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:41.839 align:start position:0%
uh the vendor that we ultimately went
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
with and they are in the process
 
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
of uh customizing that system so that it
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
works for us exactly the way we want it
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh there's a second piece to that
 
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.710 align:start position:0%
uh there's a second piece to that
increase

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
we have a device a training device that
 
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
we use here at the academy
 
00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
we refer to it as the vertra the virtra
 
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
360 decision making simulator
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
and uh we can train a number of police
 
00:13:08.959 --> 00:13:10.069 align:start position:0%
and uh we can train a number of police
officers

00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
officers
 
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh at a time uh without expending
 
00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:15.519 align:start position:0%
uh live ammunition or simunitions
 
00:13:15.519 --> 00:13:16.790 align:start position:0%
uh live ammunition or simunitions
ammunition

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
ammunition
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
and we can do it in a very very safe way
 
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.389 align:start position:0%
and we can do it in a very very safe way
again

00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
this is a device that relies heavily
 
00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
on uh software and computers and things
 
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
of that nature
 
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
and uh for that reason uh we have annual
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
subscriptions that we have to uh
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
put forth to maintain uh the virtual
 
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.790 align:start position:0%
put forth to maintain uh the virtual
device

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
device
 
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
and so uh two big increases there
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
and and those are the reasons uh for
 
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
the um as we move
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
and again uh i will point you to
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
line zero one zero
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
and uh that speaks to
 
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:20.150 align:start position:0%
and uh that speaks to
personnel

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
you'll see that there's a a a jump in
 
00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
the full-time line
 
00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:32.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
the the commission recognized
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
a number of uh
 
00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
things that they wanted addressed in the
 
00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:43.839 align:start position:0%
area of training
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
of our police officers here in new
 
00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:46.949 align:start position:0%
of our police officers here in new
hampshire

00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
and as a commission member uh i
 
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.550 align:start position:0%
and as a commission member uh i
supported

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
supported
 
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh all of those recommendations
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
uh the the truth is that um
 
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
the training mandates have now imposed
 
00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
uh a greater workload where our existing
 
00:15:06.079 --> 00:15:07.030 align:start position:0%
uh a greater workload where our existing
resources

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
just can't handle uh the extra workload
 
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
that came from those mandates
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
and so i requested uh
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
support from the governor to allow
 
00:15:22.949 --> 00:15:22.959 align:start position:0%
for the addition of one extra training
 
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
specialist full-time and
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh also a full-time instructional design
 
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
person uh clearly the training
 
00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:33.829 align:start position:0%
person uh clearly the training
specialist

00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
specialist
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
will assist in uh
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
looking at our curriculum helping us
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
uh deliver more scenario-based training
 
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
which was an important piece from the
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
leak commission
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh one thing that the academy really has
 
00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:51.519 align:start position:0%
never had before
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
in all the time that it's been in
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
existence and this is our 50th
 
00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
anniversary this year so we're very
 
00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
excited about that
 
00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
but we have never had an instructional
 
00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
design person
 
00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
on our staff uh candidly
 
00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
all of our training specialists who are
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
excellent trainers in every regard
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
uh their their primary uh focus
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
is law enforcement and i believe uh
 
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
we had up until a retirement last year
 
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
we had two people who have formal
 
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
educations in curriculum
 
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
development and adult education
 
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
it's important that we have an
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
instructional design person for two
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
reasons the first reason
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
is that uh the trainers
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
while they write curriculum they also
 
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
have to deliver the training
 
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
and so a vast majority of the time they
 
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
are engaged directly with
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
i don't like that the other
 
00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
very important piece is that
 
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
we are moving towards developing and
 
00:16:51.279 --> 00:16:52.710 align:start position:0%
we are moving towards developing and
deploying

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
deploying
 
00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:55.839 align:start position:0%
a high quality online training
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
using our our online training system
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
it's important that as the primary
 
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839 align:start position:0%
source of in-service training for new
 
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire police officers
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
we are able to do this so that we can
 
00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:10.710 align:start position:0%
we are able to do this so that we can
deliver

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
deliver
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
in-service training in a very fiscally
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
responsible way
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
where we can push training out online
 
00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:18.150 align:start position:0%
where we can push training out online
and

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh that assists every city in town
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
to allow their officers to receive that
 
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.189 align:start position:0%
to allow their officers to receive that
training

00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
without uh having to travel to the
 
00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:29.669 align:start position:0%
without uh having to travel to the
academy

00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
academy
 
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:32.799 align:start position:0%
and uh it alleviates the problem of
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
backfilling or paying overtime
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh from the source agency and uh this is
 
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.029 align:start position:0%
uh from the source agency and uh this is
uh

00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
clearly uh the single best way for us
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
to make sure that training is consistent
 
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
across the board
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
it is accessible across the state and
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
you know we we have a responsibility and
 
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
i have a responsibility to make sure
 
00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:54.549 align:start position:0%
i have a responsibility to make sure
that

00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
a three-person police department has the
 
00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:57.669 align:start position:0%
a three-person police department has the
same

00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
equal access to this training as as a
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
large city police agency does
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh and and so um there's going to be a
 
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
little bit of a heavy lift in the front
 
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
to develop the content and keep the
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
content going i have excellent
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh excellent bureau commander that's
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
uh leading this charge right now we i
 
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
have some excellent people that are
 
00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.350 align:start position:0%
have some excellent people that are
assisting

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
assisting
 
00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:20.799 align:start position:0%
uh but we really do need that
 
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
instructional design person to work in
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
the background
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh to help build out in the kind of the
 
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
technical side
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
of putting that training content
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
into the computer and being able to
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
manage it in an
 
00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
the um the next
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
real big delta that you'll see is i'll
 
00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:45.919 align:start position:0%
direct your attention to
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
line zero two one uh i have a question
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am you wanna do it now or do you
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
wanna wait until later
 
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
oh no i i'm happy to answer any question
 
00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
you might have
 
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
can you just say a little more about the
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
training specialists and the
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
instructional design specialists i guess
 
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
two things one
 
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
where do they get trained and you know
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
are they boots on the ground are they
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
academics is it a combination of both
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
secondly are you looking for any because
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
some of this the sensitivity training
 
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
um are you looking what particular
 
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
considerations are you giving to the
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you that uh excellent question and
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
just to answer the the first piece
 
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh the the uh training specialists
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
are uh proven law enforcement officers
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh who have a high level of experience
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
working as police officers and
 
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.909 align:start position:0%
working as police officers and
supervisors

00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
supervisors
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
of police officers before they come to
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
our target audience for the recruit
 
00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.070 align:start position:0%
our target audience for the recruit
training

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh is are those people who are coming
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
into the business so they have no
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
real foundation uh so a vast majority of
 
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
the training specialists
 
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh come to us from their agencies
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
as field training officers uh corporals
 
00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:11.990 align:start position:0%
as field training officers uh corporals
sergeants

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
sergeants
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh lieutenants they and and those are
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
really the people i need i need people
 
00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.190 align:start position:0%
really the people i need i need people
who

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
can model mentor uh
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
and speak with uh legitimacy because
 
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh they come from the very place that
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
we're preparing these officers to go to
 
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
in a police car uh responding to calls
 
00:20:32.789 --> 00:20:32.799 align:start position:0%
for service
 
00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
understand that uh and and i
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that you recognize
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
that we really have to have a foot
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
in in two different places we have to
 
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
have a foot
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
in the world of law enforcement and they
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
have to be excellent police officers to
 
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
teach here
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
on top of that they have to have a very
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
very strong
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
understanding of adult learning theory
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh curriculum design and instructional
 
00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.710 align:start position:0%
uh curriculum design and instructional
delivery

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
delivery
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
and in candidly in some of those cases
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
i have to take really really good cops
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
and then make sure that they have uh a
 
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
clear and firm understanding on
 
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
curriculum development and instructional
 
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.149 align:start position:0%
curriculum development and instructional
design

00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
design
 
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
so they receive ongoing training both
 
00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
in their their topic areas so for
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
instance i have a firearms instructor
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
the lead firearms instructors preparing
 
00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.110 align:start position:0%
the lead firearms instructors preparing
to

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
go to a a firearms instructor
 
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh program uh in connecticut once
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
once covid kind of settles down
 
00:21:39.909 --> 00:21:39.919 align:start position:0%
i have uh i have uh an
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
in-service class that we're getting
 
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
ready to deliver on instructional design
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
and then the train the trainer
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
instructional design
 
00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
and actually i'm bringing a group up
 
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
from massachusetts that i worked with
 
00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:54.799 align:start position:0%
when i was a director of a police
 
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
academy down there
 
00:21:59.830 --> 00:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
and it is very very important that
 
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
we we have sound
 
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh instructors that are working
 
00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
from uh the not only the police world
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
but also from the education world
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
with regard to that instructional design
 
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.630 align:start position:0%
with regard to that instructional design
person

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
i don't need somebody to be a law
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement person
 
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
to uh to fill that role of instructional
 
00:22:23.679 --> 00:22:25.510 align:start position:0%
to uh to fill that role of instructional
design

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
design
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
instructional design person i really
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
need them to be very strong in
 
00:22:29.039 --> 00:22:29.830 align:start position:0%
need them to be very strong in
curriculum

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
online content delivery
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh the forming of online training uh and
 
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.750 align:start position:0%
uh the forming of online training uh and
i

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
you know could i use more than one of
 
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
them yes i could
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
and and i you know i understand uh
 
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
that i have a fiduciary responsibility
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
and at the same time you know meet the
 
00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:52.390 align:start position:0%
and at the same time you know meet the
needs

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
needs
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
and challenges that are before us uh in
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
our mission
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
uh but i i foresee that this
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
instructional design person would work
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
directly with each of the training
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
specialists to kind of be the rudder in
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
the water and help
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
each one of those trainers develop
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
high content make sure that learning
 
00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:12.799 align:start position:0%
objectives are
 
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
clearly established that test questions
 
00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.070 align:start position:0%
clearly established that test questions
relate

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
relate
 
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
directly to the learning objectives and
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
that if we do
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
case studies or scenario training
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
that is tied back into learning
 
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
objectives so that we can measure
 
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
we can clearly and objectively measure
 
00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.590 align:start position:0%
we can clearly and objectively measure
competency

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
competency
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
from when the the recruit officer first
 
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
enters the police academy uh
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
during their progress during the session
 
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh measure their competency as they get
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
ready to graduate
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
and and i hope that answers your
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
question ma'am
 
00:23:51.669 --> 00:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
representative heath you have a question
 
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
yes i do madam chair thank you and thank
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
um i just i'm so pleased actually to
 
00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.190 align:start position:0%
um i just i'm so pleased actually to
hear

00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
hear
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
um the additions that you're making
 
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
because i think sensitivity is so
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
critically important
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
covid has changed the way we're all
 
00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:08.870 align:start position:0%
covid has changed the way we're all
working

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
my question is kind of related to your
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
whole budget
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
and it relates to the the
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
funds that federal funds that are coming
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
into the state of new hampshire
 
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
within your budget um you know you've
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
talked about the changes that you need
 
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
to make
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
um that you've already incurred
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to reach those
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
to whom you're responsible are any of
 
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
these costs
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
things that can be charged back
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
to costs directly associated
 
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
with covid so that maybe there'd be some
 
00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
federal reimbursement for some of these
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
things that you're
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
um including in your budget thank you
 
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am uh in fact um
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
my first day as the director of the
 
00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
police academy was march 16th
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
and my first official act was to shut
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
the academy down
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh and and it's been uh it's been quite
 
00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:06.799 align:start position:0%
a ride
 
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh since the beginning uh to that end
 
00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
we were given very clear instructions
 
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
from the governor's office
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
as department heads to
 
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
track any costs incurred
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
that were directly related to
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
sustaining our mission uh
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
but uh where those expenses came in
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
because uh of
 
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
directly from cove at impact and so uh
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
we have been very uh very cognizant
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
and and uh have have kept track
 
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
of those costs to include you know we
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
had to buy some
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
um some flat screen tvs we had to kind
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
up our game with regard to uh zoom
 
00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.350 align:start position:0%
up our game with regard to uh zoom
subscriptions

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
subscriptions
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh there was uh some work done
 
00:25:59.430 --> 00:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
for cleaning issues inside the building
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
so we have done everything we uh we can
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of tracking
 
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh those costs that are directly related
 
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
to covet response
 
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
and um and we continue to do that
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
i i don't know uh this is
 
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh clearly above my pay grade in terms
 
00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:19.039 align:start position:0%
of of being able to speak to
 
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
maybe other opportunities and i i do not
 
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that question
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
but you know i certainly uh know people
 
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
who i could ask that could
 
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
maybe fill in that blank if that's
 
00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.950 align:start position:0%
maybe fill in that blank if that's
helpful

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
i i um representative
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
uh murray i i did fail to answer the
 
00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
last piece of your question
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
uh you spoke directly to sensitivity

00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
i apologize for letting that one slip
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh i want everybody to know here that
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh even before uh
 
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
the leak commission began to meet
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh i worked uh very closely with
 
00:27:12.149 --> 00:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720 align:start position:0%

resources from the aclu we had the naacp
 
00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
uh i had academics from the university

college
 
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
and uh that working group uh
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
put together a tremendous uh
 
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
implicit bias procedural justice class
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh that i'm very proud of the lin i had
 
00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:44.149 align:start position:0%
uh that i'm very proud of the lin i had
a

00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
particular training specialist who
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
oversaw the project uh
 
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
and and they really did an excellent job
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
and uh you know our uh
 
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
the response from the recruits uh we
 
00:27:58.389 --> 00:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
just delivered the first block of
 
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
instruction this last class
 
00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:02.799 align:start position:0%
and the recruits uh loved it in every
 
00:28:02.799 --> 00:28:03.669 align:start position:0%
and the recruits uh loved it in every
way

00:28:03.669 --> 00:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh and the best part was the panel
 
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:06.789 align:start position:0%
uh and the best part was the panel
discussion

00:28:06.789 --> 00:28:06.799 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh and the biggest complaint was that
 
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
there wasn't enough time
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
for the panel discussion they want that
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
to be longer so
 
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh going to we're going to kind of
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
revisit that curriculum
 
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
but you know one of the things i think
 
00:28:21.919 --> 00:28:22.230 align:start position:0%
but you know one of the things i think
that

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
is very important to recognize is that
 
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
there is a tremendous amount of talent
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%

to help us
 
00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
in in developing high high value
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh content uh that is meaningful
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
and is uh and speaks to
 
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh the conditions and environment here
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
and i i have been very excited to work
 
00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:58.470 align:start position:0%
and i i have been very excited to work
with

with
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh all of those groups and i will
 
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
continue to work collaboratively with
 
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
those learning institutions and
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
and other other groups to help us make
 
00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
sure that we're doing the very best job
 
00:29:10.389 --> 00:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
that we can
 
00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
so i i apologize for that representative
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
murray but i wanted
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
to address that representative murray
 
00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
did you have a follow-up
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
um yeah just two quick things i was
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%

back
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
i would have if you hadn't um
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
is it possible to sit in on some of
 
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
those sessions is there an audit
 
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
available are these zoom classes
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
or is that totally inappropriate so so
 
00:29:32.559 --> 00:29:33.029 align:start position:0%
or is that totally inappropriate so so
it

00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
it uh it's an excellent question and one
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
that has been asked of me many many
 
00:29:38.559 --> 00:29:39.269 align:start position:0%
that has been asked of me many many
times

00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
since uh we've started to introduce some
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
of these classes
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
and uh you know i'm happy to share with
 
00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:46.710 align:start position:0%
and uh you know i'm happy to share with
you

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
uh the uh the lesson plan if that's
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
helpful to you
 
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
you know one of the things that i am
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
most uh
 
00:29:57.909 --> 00:29:57.919 align:start position:0%
fearful of candidly is that uh
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
you know the people who sit on this
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
panel uh
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
allow for for tough conversations to be
 
00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:04.549 align:start position:0%
allow for for tough conversations to be
had

00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
right and uh we we really are
 
00:30:07.679 --> 00:30:08.630 align:start position:0%
right and uh we we really are
encouraging

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
encouraging
 
00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
uh people to ask questions
 
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh and and and and get answers you know
 
00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.070 align:start position:0%
uh and and and and get answers you know
and

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh you know some tough answers too right
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
and my fear is if we allow
 
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
people who are not part of that class
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
and i look at this i guess from an
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
educational point of view
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
i i don't want to have a chilling effect
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
where now all of a sudden i have these
 
00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
young police recruits that
 
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to ask a question but oh my
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
goodness there's a representative from
 
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
the house of representatives in this
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
room so i
 
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to ask that question i've
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
had a lot of reporters ask the same
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
thing can we sit in on this class
 
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
and you you uh
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
you can only imagine how quiet
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
everybody's gonna get when there's a
 
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
reporter sitting there taking notes so
 
00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
um and in
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
this isn't a hard no i i'm still trying
 
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
to figure out how we do it
 
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know uh if we allow uh
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
so that people aren't in the room and
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
maybe you
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
maybe you come to my office you know at
 
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
the academy and we can sit in my office
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
and we can zoom in on the class from
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
there kind of thing
 
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
i i'm i want to be open and transparent
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
and at the same time
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
my primary function responsibility is to
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to get across during
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
this block of instruction and
 
00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
every block of instruction is going to
 
00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:38.559 align:start position:0%
have the highest value and the greatest
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
meaning to the recruit
 
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%

00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
um thank you sir you're welcome sir
 
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
i think i was getting ready to talk
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
about food zero two one
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
um you'll see that there is a pretty
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
significant delta
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
on actual expenses versus the adjust
 
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
2021 adjusted or authorized and then
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh you'll see that the again the number
 
00:33:03.909 --> 00:33:03.919 align:start position:0%
goes up a little bit
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
for 2223 and again
 
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
traditionally uh the way we deliver
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
the academy it is a 16-week
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
paramilitary residential environment and
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
uh i am a product of that environment
 
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh i graduated from the 88th session
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
uh and then i had the the privilege to
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
work as a training specialist
 
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
on the other end of the building for a
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
period of time during my career
 
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
and um and then managed that same kind
 
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
of delivery
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
system so uh you know now we're looking
 
00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:42.389 align:start position:0%
system so uh you know now we're looking
at

00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
pretty significant costs to maintain the
 
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
delivery system that we have now
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
and and there's a lot of value to to
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
continuing the way we do it and but
 
00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
there's also
 
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
you know we have to ask ourselves some
 
00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
hard questions and that is
 
00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
can we do it a better way and can we do
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
it in a more fiscally responsible way
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
and can we leverage uh
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
maybe funds directed in one direction
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
maybe we can leverage those funds
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
to further augment training so
 
00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
i i i kind of speak in generalities here
 
00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:16.950 align:start position:0%
i i i kind of speak in generalities here
but

00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
understand that that delta for food
 
00:34:19.119 --> 00:34:20.470 align:start position:0%
understand that that delta for food
institutions

00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
speaks to the fact that we we did not
 
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
have a residential session
 
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
we have not had a residential session
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
since i've been here
 
00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
because of covid and uh and that's why
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
you see those savings
 
00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
you'll see that the number went up in
 
00:34:35.399 --> 00:34:37.109 align:start position:0%
you'll see that the number went up in
2223

00:34:37.109 --> 00:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
2223
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
uh again we had to sign um a contract
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
with the with the sole food provider
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh so that we could be prepared uh in
 
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
the event
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
that we can kind of go back to our
 
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
old operation we're prepared to do that
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
so i anticipate uh based on kovid that
 
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
we're probably going to see some savings
 
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
during 22-23 um
 
00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
if i might mr scipia do you
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
do you have a quote-unquote target date
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
for um getting back
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
to the classroom style of uh
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
learning yes uh yes we do
 
00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
um one of the uh my i rely heavily
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
on uh the view and opinions of the
 
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
people that work for me
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
and the training staff came to me before
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
the session began in january
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
and expressed a lot of concern relative
 
00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
to the surge
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
that was being anticipated uh and in
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the rollout of vaccines
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
and after discussion i made the decision
 
00:35:51.119 --> 00:35:51.829 align:start position:0%
and after discussion i made the decision
to

00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
go to a completely remote uh
 
00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
delivery system until such time as we
 
00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:58.630 align:start position:0%
delivery system until such time as we
were

00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599 align:start position:0%
forced uh because of the fact that we
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
run out of
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
of lecture style classes uh we're gonna
 
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:06.390 align:start position:0%
of lecture style classes uh we're gonna
push

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
push
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
all the skills development classes to
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
the back of the session
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
and uh we were hedging our bet
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
to to get vaccinations out uh
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
so that we could return as quickly as
 
00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
possible so we're anticipating
 
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh and the the uh the date that that
 
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
we've kind of set on
 
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
is april 1 to begin
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
face-to-face in-service training again
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
still continuing
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
with all the safety measures screening
 
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
masks social distancing
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
but it is my opinion uh certainly my
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
staff i'm a little under the weather
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
right now i got my second
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
shot last night so i'm i'm kind of
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
plugging through here
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
um my staff has been vaccinated
 
00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
vaccinated uh and a vast majority of the
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
police officers that we're going to have
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
in the building will have been
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and that
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
the hope is to get back operationally uh
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
to the way we used to be so we're
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
looking at april 1st
 
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
but clearly we need to maintain
 
00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.030 align:start position:0%
but clearly we need to maintain
flexibility

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
follow the directions from the
 
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
governor's office and the department of
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
of uh health uh just to to make sure
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
that we're
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
uh we're gonna keep people safe and
 
00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
still still complete our mission
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
so we're staying flexible
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh if i could um i know that your
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
the majority of your training is for
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
brand new police officers
 
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh do they automatically get
 
00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
the shot um i mean i
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
i know that uh you know first responders
 
00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.510 align:start position:0%
i know that uh you know first responders
and

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
police and so on have have that
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity but
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
the new recruits are they automatically
 
00:37:53.589 --> 00:37:53.599 align:start position:0%
getting a shot or is that something we
 
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
can require them to have
 
00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
before they attend the academy
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's uh that's the same thought process
 
00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:02.710 align:start position:0%
it's uh that's the same thought process
process

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
that that i was using as well in terms
 
00:38:05.359 --> 00:38:06.710 align:start position:0%
that that i was using as well in terms
of

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
mandating that they get this shot before
 
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
they come back into the building
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
and i had the occasion to speak with the
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
ag's office on that
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
and you know ultimately uh because
 
00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
you must be hired by an agency before
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
you can attend the police academy
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
they automatically are considered police
 
00:38:28.079 --> 00:38:29.510 align:start position:0%
they automatically are considered police
employees

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is that a vast
 
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
majority of those recruit officers
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh are receiving um or or they have the
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to receive that vaccine
 
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
and from a continuity of operations
 
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:44.790 align:start position:0%
and from a continuity of operations
standpoint

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
and and it may sound a bit
 
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh selfish but uh
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
we i could not afford to have any of my
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
training people get sick
 
00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
because there's there's so few of us
 
00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:00.079 align:start position:0%
and and we are the sole source for
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
recruit training
 
00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
uh i am confident now that once my staff
 
00:39:05.359 --> 00:39:05.670 align:start position:0%
uh i am confident now that once my staff
has

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
received the vaccines uh and we still
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
maintain those safety
 
00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
measures uh we'll be able to continue
 
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
operations uh even if
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
uh people that are coming into the
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
building may or may not have received
 
00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
that vaccine
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
so uh while while it
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
sounds i i hate the sound that you know
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
as far as working
 
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
we're safe so everybody's safe but from
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
from a pragmatic
 
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
point of view of continuity of operation
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh i think that we'll be good to go
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
as the surge comes through the vaccines
 
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
go up
 
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
and we still maintain those those safety
 
00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.910 align:start position:0%
and we still maintain those those safety
measures

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
measures
 
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative heath
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um thank you for
 
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
um to continue on with your um
 
00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:55.839 align:start position:0%
discussion about the training
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
in the liat commission um a lot that
 
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
came out in that report that
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
our existing police force needs to be
 
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
updated could you just describe
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
the steps you're going to take to employ
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
some elements of the training and
 
00:40:14.309 --> 00:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
particularly in the sensitivity um
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
and cultural awareness areas please
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am uh the uh
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
the governor's executive order 2020-1
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh the leak commission report
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
and the 2019 lba audit
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
are literally the road map that i will
 
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:36.309 align:start position:0%
are literally the road map that i will
be

00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
following and and our organization will
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
be following
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
in the next couple of years uh
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
and and that's a good thing i think
 
00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
because there's a clear direction that
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
our organization needs to move
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
right uh some of the mandated
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh training that has been identified and
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh set forth in that executive order
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
speaks directly to ethics
 
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
de-escalation uh
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
implicit bias and cultural diversity in
 
00:41:09.119 --> 00:41:10.950 align:start position:0%
implicit bias and cultural diversity in
fact

00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
fact
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
the recommendations from leak and the
 
00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
governor's order
 
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
mandate that every police officer in the
 
00:41:19.589 --> 00:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
to maintain their certification must
 
00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
annually complete
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
those three two hour blocks of
 
00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:29.430 align:start position:0%
those three two hour blocks of
instruction

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
we have about four thousand police
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
officers in the state of new hampshire
 
00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
and my training staff presently
 
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
is i believe it is eight people
 
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
deliver training we have to rely heavily
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
on volunteers
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
from agencies throughout the state to
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
help augment
 
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
our training efforts
 
00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
to that end i clearly i understood that
 
00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
in order to reach 4 000 people
 
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
annually we have
 
00:42:05.109 --> 00:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
we have got to really build out our
 
00:42:05.119 --> 00:42:06.309 align:start position:0%
we have got to really build out our
online

00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
online
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
in-service learning program uh because
 
00:42:09.119 --> 00:42:09.829 align:start position:0%
in-service learning program uh because
the

00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
candidly there would be no way for us to
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
complete that mission
 
00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh with the with the staff that i have
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
there's just no way you know we
 
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
literally would be teaching
 
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
that that program every day throughout
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
the year
 
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
just to to keep up with those in-service
 
00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.349 align:start position:0%
just to to keep up with those in-service
people

00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
and that's just one one small piece of
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
training that we're ultimately
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
further uh it's important to recognize
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
that the leak commission
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
and the governor's executive order uh
 
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:42.950 align:start position:0%
and the governor's executive order uh
mandates

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
that the required number of hours of
 
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
in-service training
 
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
needed to be increased so presently we
 
00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:51.910 align:start position:0%
needed to be increased so presently we
have

00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
eight hours of mandatory in-service
 
00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.829 align:start position:0%
eight hours of mandatory in-service
training

00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
plus agencies are also required to
 
00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.069 align:start position:0%
plus agencies are also required to
deliver

00:43:00.069 --> 00:43:00.079 align:start position:0%
deliver
 
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
four hours annually of firearms and use
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
and then they have to qualify with their
 
00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.390 align:start position:0%
and then they have to qualify with their
firearm

00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
firearm
 
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
we are moving from eight hours annually
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
all the way up to 24 hours annually
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
and so we've increased uh by way of leak
 
00:43:24.069 --> 00:43:24.079 align:start position:0%
by way of the uh executive order uh and
 
00:43:24.079 --> 00:43:24.710 align:start position:0%
by way of the uh executive order uh and
candidly

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
candidly
 
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's the right thing to do it's
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
important and the right thing to do
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
to increase that mandatory in-service
 
00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:32.550 align:start position:0%
to increase that mandatory in-service
training

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh continuous training is going to make
 
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
our excellent police officers even
 
00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:39.349 align:start position:0%
our excellent police officers even
better

00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh but now you know
 
00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
the load is significantly increased
 
00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
with regard to the delivery of that
 
00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:50.079 align:start position:0%
training the development of that
 
00:43:50.079 --> 00:43:51.270 align:start position:0%
training the development of that
training

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
and so um you know my hope is
 
00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh and again uh i'll i'll get to that
 
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
second line but ultimately i had
 
00:43:58.560 --> 00:43:59.270 align:start position:0%
second line but ultimately i had
requested

00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
requested
 
00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh from the governor uh his his support
 
00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
for those two full-time positions that
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
i've already spoken to
 
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
and and again i was trying to be
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
financially responsible so
 
00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:14.079 align:start position:0%
i asked for two part-time training
 
00:44:14.079 --> 00:44:15.430 align:start position:0%
i asked for two part-time training
specialists

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
specialists
 
00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:18.079 align:start position:0%
as well uh understanding that it would
 
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
be less expensive to hire
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh some part-time people to help augment
 
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh these efforts to to uh
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
to take care of this these these new
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
initiatives that have been um
 
00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:34.839 align:start position:0%
uh given to us you know as an
 
00:44:34.839 --> 00:44:36.390 align:start position:0%
uh given to us you know as an
organization

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh it's candidly i i
 
00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
you know my hope is that uh these
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
increases that we're talking about here
 
00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.270 align:start position:0%
increases that we're talking about here
today

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
are going to uh set the organization up
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
to be highly successful in the mission
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know i don't know i don't we have
 
00:44:55.109 --> 00:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
to see how it goes now you know
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
we've been working in a covet
 
00:44:58.550 --> 00:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
environment uh
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
we're trying to build the airplane while
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
we're flying it in some cases
 
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh there has been we had to develop a
 
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
new ethics program
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
a new uh you know de-escalation program
 
00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
a new cultural diversity implicit bias
 
00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:13.670 align:start position:0%
a new cultural diversity implicit bias
program

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh we have to increase scenario training
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
dramatically from where we're
 
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
at now which it was another leak
 
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
recommendation and mandate from
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
from the governor's office these are all
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
very important things that have to
 
00:45:27.599 --> 00:45:29.030 align:start position:0%
very important things that have to
happen

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot of heavy lift
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's going to come with that
 
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh something else that uh we're looking
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
at right now is
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
uh the last job task analysis
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
to measure core uh components
 
00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
of a one to five year police officer
 
00:45:58.550 --> 00:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
that job task analysis
 
00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
has not been conducted in new hampshire
 
00:46:01.119 --> 00:46:01.670 align:start position:0%
has not been conducted in new hampshire
uh

00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
for 20 years and we should be doing a
 
00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:05.510 align:start position:0%
for 20 years and we should be doing a
jta

00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
jta
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
about every five years just to make sure
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
that the curriculum that we're
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
delivering right now
 
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
speaks to the the core
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
competencies that a one to five year
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
police officer
 
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
needs to be able to to demonstrate when
 
00:46:23.349 --> 00:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
they're out there working in their
 
00:46:23.359 --> 00:46:25.829 align:start position:0%
they're out there working in their
communities

00:46:25.829 --> 00:46:25.839 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
so once that job task analysis is
 
00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.710 align:start position:0%
so once that job task analysis is
completed

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
completed
 
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
i and i'm very excited i'm working with
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
the university of new hampshire's
 
00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
justice studies department that is a
 
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
capstone project that
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
a graduate student is working on right
 
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
now along with the professors at unh
 
00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
it is a very meaningful project to a unh
 
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
student it's saving the state's
 
00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money
 
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
but we are on unh's scheduled now so
 
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
i i can't make it go any faster than
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
than the semester and i want i want the
 
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
student to be successful too
 
00:47:06.309 --> 00:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
but after that jta comes out we now have
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
to do a complete
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
curriculum every single
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
block of instruction that we deliver
 
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
that makes up this curriculum
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
has now i now have to collect subject
 
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
matter experts from the state
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
this is what we do now here's the job
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
task analysis
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
what changes if any do we have to make
 
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
to be in line
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
with that jta that's going to be a huge
 
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
huge lift that's going to be a lot of
 
00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:33.430 align:start position:0%
huge lift that's going to be a lot of
work

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
and i can't call a timeout
 
00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
if i did not deliver an academy
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
one academy that would
 
00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
significantly impact
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire uh and every
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agency that's trying to
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
fill open positions so that they can
 
00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
police their communities
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
um so we have to i still have to keep
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
the plates
 
00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
spinning over here and and then we have
 
00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
some really
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
exciting challenges in front of us and
 
00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
they really are exciting challenges but
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot of work
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
attached to it so my hope is
 
00:48:11.829 --> 00:48:11.839 align:start position:0%
that the new training specialist the
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
instructional design person and then the
 
00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
two part-time
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
training specialists um
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
will be able to uh really absorb uh
 
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of what we have going on uh
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
in the in the near near future in the
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
near future
 
00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh so that we can we can address the the
 
00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
components of the mission that's before
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
us now thank you
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am representative lynn you have a
 
00:48:37.599 --> 00:48:44.870 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am representative lynn you have a
question

00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh you're on mute
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you madam chair uh uh mr
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
skip i i i guess
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
um from what you've said already my
 
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
understanding is
 
00:48:59.430 --> 00:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
that most of the recruits that you get
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
as new officers are relatively young i
 
00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:01.990 align:start position:0%
as new officers are relatively young i
would

00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
did presumably in their 20s or maybe
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
early 30s
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
yes sir and and i wonder if you could
 
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
just uh
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
tell me could you generally tell me what
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
would be the age or roughly the
 
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
you know the average age of your
 
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.390 align:start position:0%
you know the average age of your
instructors

00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
instructors
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
so uh with with uh some
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh aberrancies here and there we're
 
00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0%
probably averaging
 
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh recruit age is probably uh right
 
00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:28.950 align:start position:0%
uh recruit age is probably uh right
around

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
23 to 25 years of age uh we get a lot of
 
00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:32.870 align:start position:0%
23 to 25 years of age uh we get a lot of
these

00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh recruits who are uh military veterans
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
and or college graduates
 
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
and so that it puts them right around
 
00:49:43.109 --> 00:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
you know that mark
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
we have some people who are are hired
 
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
literally uh you only have to be 18 to
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
be a police officer here in new
 
00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:48.870 align:start position:0%
be a police officer here in new
hampshire

00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
and occasionally we'll get an 18 or 19
 
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
year old in there not not often but we
 
00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:53.990 align:start position:0%
year old in there not not often but we
do

00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:49:56.549 --> 00:49:56.559 align:start position:0%
and then uh in this present session we
 
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
have people who um
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
you know had a career and have done
 
00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
something uh for 20 years and then
 
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
they're jumping into police work
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
the candidly uh they're excellent people
 
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
to have in the
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
in the the room because they they
 
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
provide perspective
 
00:50:14.790 --> 00:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh real world perspective with their
 
00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:16.630 align:start position:0%
uh real world perspective with their
classmates

00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
classmates
 
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
the training specialist average age of a
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
training specialist that i have here
 
00:50:23.589 --> 00:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
and and instead of putting an age on it
 
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
time and service on it i generally have
 
00:50:31.119 --> 00:50:31.670 align:start position:0%
time and service on it i generally have
people

00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
that have 10 to 15 years
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
of law enforcement experience
 
00:50:42.549 --> 00:50:42.559 align:start position:0%
on staff and and in those positions as
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
training specialists so
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
you're probably looking at people
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
between the ages of
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
35 to 50. so probably
 
00:50:54.309 --> 00:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
uh you know probably 40 42 years old if
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
you're looking for one number on an
 
00:50:59.430 --> 00:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
average um now it
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that that these people
 
00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
that work as training specialists
 
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh are running a mile and a half in
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
about 10 minutes
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
and can do a hundred push-ups and
 
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
they're uh
 
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
they're in phenomenal shape and and
 
00:51:14.069 --> 00:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
they're able to
 
00:51:17.349 --> 00:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh clearly uh act as
 
00:51:19.349 --> 00:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
excellent mentors and instructors in
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
those areas that they teach
 
00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
um but they they are
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
about 10 to 15 years older than the
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
recruits that they're teaching
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
okay so so you may ask a follow-up uh
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
yes sir absolutely yeah so i guess what
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
really what what i mean what i was
 
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
where i was kind of going with these
 
00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
questions is if the recruits
 
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
are very young and the instructors are
 
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
25 to 50 let's say and are in
 
00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
you know as you just said generally in
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
excellent shape
 
00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm i'm not it's not clear to me
 
00:51:55.119 --> 00:51:56.309 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm i'm not it's not clear to me
why

00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
you haven't resumed in person
 
00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh instruction uh now
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
is in the same way that we're sort of
 
00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559 align:start position:0%
you know where we're
 
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
we we're trying to kick the the schools
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh in the fannie and excuse my excuse my
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
language but we're trying to kick the
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
schools and the fannies to get back to
 
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
in-person learning
 
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
um where there seems to be a lot of
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
reason to say that they could
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering why you're not doing
 
00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:24.710 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering why you're not doing
that

00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
you know sooner than you seem to be at
 
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
least and i guess i would understand
 
00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:29.430 align:start position:0%
least and i guess i would understand
that

00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
some of the physical training part the
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
combat kind of training that kind of
 
00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
thing i can understand where that might
 
00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:39.430 align:start position:0%
thing i can understand where that might
involve

00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
involve
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
such close contact that you couldn't do
 
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
it but for the classroom part anyway
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of curious as to why you're not
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
you're not you know back in the class
 
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
now so to speak
 
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
so in uh an excellent question the last
 
00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:54.549 align:start position:0%
so in uh an excellent question the last
session

00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:54.559 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
that we just had that just graduated we
 
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
we did bring them back into the building
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
but we uh and and we tried to be as as
 
00:53:03.119 --> 00:53:03.510 align:start position:0%
but we uh and and we tried to be as as
uh

00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
close to operational as possible um
 
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
i i can't um part of
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
part of the the normal course of duty is
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
that they're assigned a room and a
 
00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
roommate and they're using common
 
00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:19.190 align:start position:0%
roommate and they're using common
showers

00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
showers
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
common sinks they're sleeping in very
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
close proximity to each other
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
um as you spoke to representative lynn
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know a lot of the combat training
 
00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:30.559 align:start position:0%
hand uh
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
defensive tactics training ground
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
fighting uh the exposure of oc
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh where literally they're they're
 
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
coughing and spitting and
 
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
and we gotta clean them up with hoses
 
00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:42.309 align:start position:0%
and we gotta clean them up with hoses
and

00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
you know water and stuff like that
 
00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
they wear protective equipment when we
 
00:53:49.829 --> 00:53:49.839 align:start position:0%
use simulation training so these are
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
closed masks
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
um clear masks uh
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to do the best we can
 
00:53:59.109 --> 00:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
and at the same time
 
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
mitigate uh those kinds of situations
 
00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:03.270 align:start position:0%
mitigate uh those kinds of situations
where

00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
uh we're using gang showers or we have
 
00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
them in close proximity you know
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
ultimately this session when it first
 
00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.150 align:start position:0%
ultimately this session when it first
began

00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
began
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh and with the with the information
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
we were gonna get a pretty big surge
 
00:54:24.559 --> 00:54:25.510 align:start position:0%
we were gonna get a pretty big surge
after

00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
after
 
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
the holidays and into the winter months
 
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
and with the understanding that police
 
00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
officers would be getting that
 
00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:35.190 align:start position:0%
officers would be getting that
vaccination

00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
it was my decision to go completely
 
00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.430 align:start position:0%
it was my decision to go completely
remote

00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
remote
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
try to keep the building as quiet as
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
possible uh
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
get the staff vaccinated uh get through
 
00:54:46.789 --> 00:54:46.799 align:start position:0%
the surge
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that the vaccination
 
00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:50.870 align:start position:0%
make sure that the vaccination
availability

00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
availability
 
00:54:53.109 --> 00:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
was such that the recruits would have an
 
00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:54.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get vaccinated if they
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
and uh that was the reason that i had
 
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
made that decision
 
00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:01.839 align:start position:0%
uh believe me we we really do want to
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
get back to business
 
00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
um when we had the last class in
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh our facility uh
 
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
is is not equipped
 
00:55:17.589 --> 00:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
to seat the number of people we have to
 
00:55:17.599 --> 00:55:17.910 align:start position:0%
to seat the number of people we have to
see

00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:55:20.789 --> 00:55:20.799 align:start position:0%
in a room to begin with on a good day we
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
have people
 
00:55:24.549 --> 00:55:24.559 align:start position:0%
right on top of each other to maintain
 
00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
social distancing
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
we literally had to use two different
 
00:55:29.349 --> 00:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
lecture halls
 
00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
and we had to zoom the lecture
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
from one room into the other room and
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
then the instructors would walk
 
00:55:37.829 --> 00:55:37.839 align:start position:0%
up and down the hallway to just check on
 
00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
the two different groups
 
00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
were we able to do it yes we were um
 
00:55:44.789 --> 00:55:44.799 align:start position:0%
you know best case scenario no it was
 
00:55:46.789 --> 00:55:46.799 align:start position:0%
not it hasn't been best case scenario
 
00:55:48.309 --> 00:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
since i've been here so
 
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh but we we are definitely working
 
00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:51.430 align:start position:0%
uh but we we are definitely working
towards

00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
towards
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
trying to get back to that
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
normalcy whatever that might be great
 
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much yes sure

so are are you happy

00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not talking about the staff
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about

what what's it called the police
 
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.160 align:start position:0%

with the members of the council

new members uh that are coming in
 
00:59:16.710 --> 00:59:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh with the exception i think of one uh
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
new member i am familiar
 
00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:21.839 align:start position:0%
with all of the new appointees i hold
 
00:59:21.839 --> 00:59:22.710 align:start position:0%
with all of the new appointees i hold
them

00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:59:25.349 --> 00:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
in equal regard and i look forward to
 
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
working with them i think that um
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
you know at the end of the day uh new
 
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire law enforcement
 
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
you know collectively understands the
 
00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:35.270 align:start position:0%
you know collectively understands the
importance

00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
importance
 
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
of the mission of our agency and uh
 
00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
every person that uh is appointed to
 
00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
that board
 
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh fully supports our operation and uh
 
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
they've just been excellent to work with
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
and and um very support i can't say
 
00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
enough good things
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
and not because i got an answer to them
 
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
they're just they're good people to work
 
00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:55.910 align:start position:0%
they're just they're good people to work
with

00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:59:58.470 --> 00:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
i i got that uh representative bucco you
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair um so
 
01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
one of the big advantages that that all
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
um all the municipal police departments
 
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh have centralized this centralized
 
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.349 align:start position:0%
uh have centralized this centralized
training

01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
and but one of the big incentives is
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
that they send their offices at no cost
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
is that does that remain is that going
 
01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
to remain that way
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
see uh representative buko i can tell
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
you unequivocally that i have worked in
 
01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
two different environments uh police
 
01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
training environments i was a director
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
of a police academy in massachusetts i
 
01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:35.670 align:start position:0%
of a police academy in massachusetts i
was

01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
i was one of probably 15 police
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
academies across the commonwealth
 
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
and at every director's meeting that i
 
01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:44.799 align:start position:0%
would go to they would always point
 
01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
north and say we should be doing what
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is doing
 
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
we have to do what new hampshire is
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
doing uh
 
01:00:53.589 --> 01:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts it's a tuition-based
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
program in other words the
 
01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
the police agencies and or the student
 
01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:59.430 align:start position:0%
the police agencies and or the student
themselves

01:00:59.430 --> 01:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
have to pay a a tuition now it's a
 
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
it's a very modest tuition and it
 
01:01:08.069 --> 01:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
clearly does not cover the cost of
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
the the academy um
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
presently and and traditionally since
 
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
its inception uh the state has
 
01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.109 align:start position:0%
its inception uh the state has
recognized

01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire that it's the
 
01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the state to make sure
 
01:01:24.789 --> 01:01:24.799 align:start position:0%
that our police officers are trained
 
01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
appropriately and i think that's that's
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
always kind of been the vision the way i
 
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
is that this is a a governmental
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility it's a public safety
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility and then the state
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh accepts that responsibility is there
 
01:01:43.109 --> 01:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
alternative ways that we could fund this
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
i imagine there are uh i think that uh
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
you know we should we should always be
 
01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
forward leaning we should always try to
 
01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
you know figure out is there a better
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
way to do this is there is there a
 
01:01:56.069 --> 01:01:56.079 align:start position:0%
better way to cover the cost of this
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
are there public private partnerships
 
01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
that that we can start to develop
 
01:02:02.789 --> 01:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
can we charge tuition uh you know these
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
are all
 
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
discussion points that really need to be
 
01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully covered um
 
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
i i would say you know never say no to
 
01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
anything let's talk about it let's
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
figure out if this is going to be
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
you know a workable way to to help you
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
know offset these
 
01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
these costs that are in front of us
 
01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.549 align:start position:0%
these costs that are in front of us
absolutely

01:02:20.549 --> 01:02:20.559 align:start position:0%
absolutely

we also have
 
01:04:17.589 --> 01:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
the the in-service component we have to
 
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%

we have to put together facilitators
 
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.430 align:start position:0%
we have to put together facilitators
guides

01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
guides
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
i have a bureau commander who's
 
01:04:28.079 --> 01:04:28.870 align:start position:0%
i have a bureau commander who's
literally

01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
literally
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
uh along with his staff putting together
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh a brand new record management system
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
and learning management system
 
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh they are uh they're working really
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
hard and if i had
 
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
the ability to snap my fingers and and
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
you know double the size of
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
of the staff here uh we could get
 
01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
significant things done that is not a
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible thing for me to ask
 
01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:55.430 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible thing for me to ask
for

01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
and uh and i would not ask for that um
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
because i'm really happy with my job and
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
i don't want to lose it
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh but you know to that end um uh
 
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
i i think my my staff uh at least when
 
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
i'm around
 
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
they they share the same optimism and
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
and excitement that i do
 
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh they know they're working hard uh
 
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
they know i'm in here trying to help
 
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:18.710 align:start position:0%
they know i'm in here trying to help
them

01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
get the resources that they need and um
 
01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
you know i i think you know at the end
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
of the day
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
we are a service provider much like any
 
01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
other police department quite frankly
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
and the services that we provide uh
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
are so vitally important because we are
 
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
literally training every police officer
 
01:05:41.029 --> 01:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
to then go back to their communities and
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
protect and serve
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
the people who live in those towns so uh
 
01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
and cities and and
 
01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
on the highways and and out in the woods
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
you know uh so
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
it's uh the actions of my staff
 
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
and my organization are are far-reaching
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
and and vitally important to our state
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
so i uh if i could get more help it
 
01:06:07.349 --> 01:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
would be awesome
 
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
but we will do the best we can with what
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
we got
 
01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
and we do a pretty darn good job right
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
now so
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:43.589 --> 01:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
just gotta hit the right button uh thank
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question mr
 
01:06:47.829 --> 01:06:47.839 align:start position:0%
shipra how do you measure
 
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
the effectiveness of your program
 
01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
say from five years ago to today and
 
01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
what we need to do
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
because i believe that we have probably
 
01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
the greatest
 
01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
law enforcement people uh in the country
 
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
um that state police local police
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
very very few people are very you know
 
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
you hear very few stories is it is it
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
the amount of lawsuits we get or
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
or what how do you measure that
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
sir i i concur with your opinion
 
01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.510 align:start position:0%
sir i i concur with your opinion
wholeheartedly

01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly
 
01:07:19.589 --> 01:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
i think we do an excellent job here in
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire new hampshire law
 
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement i
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
i don't think that uh i think we
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
collectively hold ourselves to a very
 
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
high standard and we may
 
01:07:29.829 --> 01:07:29.839 align:start position:0%
make sure that that standard is carried
 
01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
across the board with regard to
 
01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:35.839 align:start position:0%
uh measuring uh
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
you know are are we doing the right
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
thing are we are we
 
01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
providing the right training to to make
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
sure that these officers are going to be
 
01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
competent and professional when they
 
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
when they leave the academy i i'm really
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
leaning hard on that job task analysis
 
01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
which hasn't been done in a little while
 
01:07:53.829 --> 01:07:53.839 align:start position:0%
now we are fortunate that we're a
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
smaller state we have some
 
01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
very forward-leaning police chiefs
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh the colonel of state police uh you
 
01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
know these people
 
01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
are very uh forward looking forward
 
01:08:08.549 --> 01:08:08.559 align:start position:0%
leaning people
 
01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh when they lead their agencies and and
 
01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
working with those
 
01:08:15.349 --> 01:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
with those uh peers that i have
 
01:08:17.829 --> 01:08:17.839 align:start position:0%
uh i i think you know despite or
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the fact that we've
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
we've been kind of uh i don't know
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
delinquent and not doing that jta
 
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
i still feel very confident working with
 
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
with my peers that we're able to to
 
01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:32.630 align:start position:0%
with my peers that we're able to to
still

01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh keep that high level of police
 
01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:35.910 align:start position:0%
uh keep that high level of police
services

01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:39.759 align:start position:0%
uh going uh here in the state to to
 
01:08:41.349 --> 01:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
to put a measure on it we're going to
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
need to do that jta
 
01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
and then i'm going to need to sit down
 
01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
and get those subject matter experts in
 
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
here and make sure that we're
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
we're leading the way here uh in new
 
01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:53.189 align:start position:0%
we're leading the way here uh in new

uh
 
01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
matter of fact over 50 years ago and the
 
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
big thing was common sense
 
01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
that's what the chief told and that was
 
01:09:59.830 --> 01:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
it he said common sense and actually
 
01:10:02.149 --> 01:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh i have a meeting tonight with the
 
01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
daughter of one of the first graduates
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
academy so which is which is kind of
 
01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.149 align:start position:0%
academy so which is which is kind of
neat

neat
 
01:10:12.149 --> 01:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
i didn't realize it went that went by
 
01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
that fast 50 years
 
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
yes i and and you know to your point
 
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
um common sense and treat people with
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
respect you
 
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
you can teach the academy in about you
 
01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:26.800 align:start position:0%

common sense and that
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
that is if you don't have those things
 
01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:36.880 align:start position:0%

if if i could ask you to go to 1301 page
 
01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:08.870 align:start position:0%
if if i could ask you to go to 1301 page
1301

01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
1301
 
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
at the very bottom you're gonna see line
 
01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:12.070 align:start position:0%
at the very bottom you're gonna see line
one

01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
zero two and that is
 
01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh contracts for program services
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
and this is a new line item
 
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that it goes from zero to
 
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh over the biennium
 
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
two hundred thousand dollars and this
 
01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:32.070 align:start position:0%
two hundred thousand dollars and this
money

01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
um has been added
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
through the governor's budget after
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
consultation with leak
 
01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
after consultation with director ken
 
01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
norton of new hampshire nami
 
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
and this money is specifically set aside
 
01:12:56.149 --> 01:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
to train police officers to respond
 
01:12:59.830 --> 01:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
to events where people are
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
suffering from a mental health crisis
 
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
you know all too often uh and this is
 
01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
not just in new hampshire but nationally
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh the police are called oftentimes
 
01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:12.229 align:start position:0%
uh the police are called oftentimes
because

01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
people don't know who else to call and
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh the police are called
 
01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
to an event where somebody is suffering
 
01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
from a a mental health crisis and in
 
01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:22.709 align:start position:0%
from a a mental health crisis and in
fact

01:13:22.709 --> 01:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
fact
 
01:13:26.709 --> 01:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
uh their aberrant behavior may uh
 
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
may necessitate a use of force
 
01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
and um you know we understand that
 
01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh it is vitally important for police
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
officers to have
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh a level of training so that they can
 
01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:40.630 align:start position:0%
uh a level of training so that they can
interact

01:13:40.630 --> 01:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
interact
 
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
effectively with people who are in
 
01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:43.750 align:start position:0%
effectively with people who are in
crisis

01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
so that we can try to de-escalate
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
the issue in the first instance take
 
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
them into custody in a safer way with
 
01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:52.070 align:start position:0%
them into custody in a safer way with
maybe

01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
not using uh a level of force that
 
01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
is justified but is there a better way
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
to do this right
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
and and um you know to that end i i work
 
01:14:05.189 --> 01:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
very closely with director norton
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
and um you know he he's spoken to me
 
01:14:07.679 --> 01:14:08.470 align:start position:0%
and um you know he he's spoken to me
about

01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
jesus or any way that we can we really
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
want police standards and training to
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
start delivering this
 
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
this product and this training uh
 
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
i i think it's very important and i
 
01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
think it's important not only to the
 
01:14:21.510 --> 01:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
communities that we serve honest to
 
01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
goodness it's important for the police
 
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
officers to have these tools too because
 
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
the police officers have to carry with
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
them uh
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
the results of of those actions that
 
01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
they take and
 
01:14:36.149 --> 01:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
and if there's a way that we can
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
protect the mental health of the officer
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
on top of that
 
01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
and and allow them an opportunity to
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
to maybe take on a an issue
 
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
in a different manner a different way
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
based on this new training
 
01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
then um it's better for the community
 
01:14:54.149 --> 01:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
it's better for the officer the outcomes
 
01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
are just better
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
so i i i did want to speak to that
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
directly because
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
you know this is it's kind of a special
 
01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
earmark i think it's important
 
01:15:04.149 --> 01:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
it is expensive but i think it's very
 
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
important and in the end it serves
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
the citizens of our state so
 
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
and and madam chair i i stand ready for
 
01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:12.950 align:start position:0%
and and madam chair i i stand ready for
any

01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
any further questions otherwise that
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
would that would conclude my
 
01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:17.750 align:start position:0%
would that would conclude my
presentation

01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%

for um the people the representatives to
 
01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
actually see what
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
uh what goes on over there and um

today but

i don't think that there's from my
 
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
perspective anyhow
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
that there is anything in here that we
 
01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:38.390 align:start position:0%
that there is anything in here that we
would

01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%

basically she's a performance auditor
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
with the lba audit division and she's
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%

01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:25.120 align:start position:0%

01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
about the work you've done and how long
 
01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
there we go can everyone hear me now
 
01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
good afternoon representatives um i
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
think mickey well explained
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
um a little bit of my background been
 
01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
with the office for about four years now
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
and i work in the
 
01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
audit division doing performance audits
 
01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:53.189 align:start position:0%
audit division doing performance audits
uh

01:18:53.189 --> 01:18:53.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
division two is a lot of different
 
01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
agencies that i actually haven't worked
 
01:18:59.430 --> 01:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
on yet so i'm actually really excited
 
01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
um to get some exposure to education
 
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
and police and training standards and
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
lottery which i have not worked on
 
01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
not really much more to it um i did work
 
01:19:12.709 --> 01:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
on the parole board audit that was one
 
01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
big audit that i was on
 
01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
so i guess that kind of speaks to a
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
little bit of my time there
 
01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:21.520 align:start position:0%

i'll be sharing a screen briefly um
 
01:30:59.270 --> 01:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
if i can do that and not screw it up um
 
01:30:59.280 --> 01:30:59.990 align:start position:0%
if i can do that and not screw it up um
obviously

01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
um i wanted to give a just a brief
 
01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:03.510 align:start position:0%
um i wanted to give a just a brief
background

01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
background
 
01:31:05.830 --> 01:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh to the members of the division on the
 
01:31:07.510 --> 01:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
lottery uh and its revenue
 
01:31:10.149 --> 01:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
as you obviously are aware the lottery
 
01:31:11.110 --> 01:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
is a
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
revenue agency and an enterprise account
 
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh and the budget process while we're
 
01:31:19.990 --> 01:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
subject to the budget process
 
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh the legislature doesn't actually
 
01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate any funds for us
 
01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
we spend from our own revenue stream and
 
01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
and are self-funded
 
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
and so um for us we really as you can
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
imagine focus on the revenue side
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
while obviously keeping track of the
 
01:31:35.830 --> 01:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
expense side so i wanted to run through
 
01:31:41.669 --> 01:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:44.719 align:start position:0%
so this is our sales of games
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
by the last 10 years obviously the
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
takeaway from this slide is that the
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
majority of what we sell in stores
 
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
and the majority of our revenues come
 
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
from scratch tickets
 
01:31:58.709 --> 01:31:58.719 align:start position:0%
over the last 10 years over two billion
 
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
dollars in sales of them
 
01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
um right now our second biggest selling
 
01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
product is probably keno
 
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh right now it's averaging over a
 
01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars a week
 
01:32:11.110 --> 01:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
in sales which is in excess of what we
 
01:32:12.550 --> 01:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
had estimated originally
 
01:32:15.910 --> 01:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
this slide is a breakdown of our
 
01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:19.350 align:start position:0%
this slide is a breakdown of our
revenues

01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
by fiscal year for the last 15 years
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
obviously we are very proud of the fact
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
that that number keeps going up
 
01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
and not down and this is just our the
 
01:32:30.629 --> 01:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
gross number which is
 
01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
an interesting number but certainly not
 
01:32:34.629 --> 01:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
the most important one um
 
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
this is our scratch ticket sales which
 
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
is something we can control and have
 
01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:38.390 align:start position:0%
is something we can control and have
been

01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
actively promoting as our biggest
 
01:32:40.639 --> 01:32:41.510 align:start position:0%
actively promoting as our biggest
product

01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
product
 
01:32:43.110 --> 01:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
it also has been growing over the last
 
01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:50.709 --> 01:32:50.719 align:start position:0%
this is the graph for powerball and mega
 
01:32:50.719 --> 01:32:51.750 align:start position:0%
this is the graph for powerball and mega
millions

01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
millions
 
01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
what this slide really is meant to
 
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
demonstrate is that the revenues of
 
01:32:57.110 --> 01:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
these two products which
 
01:32:58.790 --> 01:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
constitute a significant portion of our
 
01:33:01.110 --> 01:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
sales are erratic
 
01:33:03.189 --> 01:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
because they are jackpot driven and so
 
01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
as a result
 
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
jackpots drive sales 2020 as you will
 
01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:07.990 align:start position:0%
jackpots drive sales 2020 as you will
see

01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
was a very off year for that we did not
 
01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
have any large jackpots
 
01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
which thankfully we had this year we
 
01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
just in january had a very very
 
01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
good month and two significant jackpots
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
which helped
 
01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
drive revenue um
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
this is kino sales obviously it's a new
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
product but it has been growing
 
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh 2020 as you can imagine we were faced
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
with a problem
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
in that when bars and taverns were shut
 
01:33:36.229 --> 01:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
down so was kino sales so
 
01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
really march through june we in uh 2020
 
01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:40.070 align:start position:0%
really march through june we in uh 2020
were

01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
sales were minimal uh but this year
 
01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
sales ever bounded
 
01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
dramatically uh and as i suggested we're
 
01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:47.510 align:start position:0%
dramatically uh and as i suggested we're
doing

01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:33:50.229 --> 01:33:50.239 align:start position:0%
on average now a million dollars a week
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
and so we expect it to continue to grow
 
01:33:55.189 --> 01:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh and this is the important slide uh
 
01:33:56.149 --> 01:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
and our last one
 
01:33:58.870 --> 01:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
this is what our distributions education
 
01:34:00.870 --> 01:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
have been over the last 15 years
 
01:34:02.229 --> 01:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
and what they're projected to be this
 
01:34:04.950 --> 01:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
year as well as the out two years
 
01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
um and as you
 
01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
obviously we're very proud of the fact
 
01:34:11.910 --> 01:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
that the last 10 years we've essentially
 
01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
doubled sales
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
and doubled net profitability in
 
01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
education um so those
 
01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
were the slides i had for you um uh
 
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
chair umberger i don't know if you want
 
01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
any members who want any questions
 
01:34:27.189 --> 01:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
regarding slides or revenues
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
or want to sort of go into uh our
 
01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:31.270 align:start position:0%
or want to sort of go into uh our
expenses

01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
01:34:34.629 --> 01:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
i am oh representative murray you have a
 
01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:39.270 align:start position:0%
i am oh representative murray you have a
question

01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam cherry i have another
 
01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
question um where
 
01:34:44.709 --> 01:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
in this state do people typically play
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
keno is it
 
01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
distributed across the state is it more
 
01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
in the southern tier is it in the north
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
country where
 
01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
are these bars and restaurants that
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
provide keno
 
01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
um it's across the state in varied
 
01:34:56.159 --> 01:34:59.109 align:start position:0%
um it's across the state in varied
locations

01:34:59.109 --> 01:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
mostly concentrated in the south and
 
01:35:02.550 --> 01:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
south central it's really the bulk of
 
01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
our sales come from rocky and
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
millsborough county
 
01:35:09.030 --> 01:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
but that's true of all of our sales i
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
mean our 60
 
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
of our revenues come from rocky and
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county because there's a
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
lot of folks that live there
 
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine uh and lottery sales
 
01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
one of the key variables is population
 
01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:22.629 align:start position:0%
one of the key variables is population
density

01:35:22.629 --> 01:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
density
 
01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
because if you live in the north country
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
you may drive by a store once every few
 
01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:27.350 align:start position:0%
you may drive by a store once every few
days

01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
if you live in manchester you drive by a
 
01:35:30.870 --> 01:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
store you know 10 a day
 
01:35:33.030 --> 01:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
and so your access to avail to stores
 
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
that sell our stuff
 
01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
and you know bars being located
 
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
generally in large population density
 
01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:40.229 align:start position:0%
generally in large population density
areas

01:35:40.229 --> 01:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's where most of our sales are
 
01:35:44.229 --> 01:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up if i may
 
01:35:47.669 --> 01:35:47.679 align:start position:0%
please thank you um i don't suppose you
 
01:35:48.790 --> 01:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
have any sense of
 
01:35:51.270 --> 01:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
out-of-state versus in-state people who
 
01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:53.030 align:start position:0%
out-of-state versus in-state people who
play

01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
play
 
01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh actually oddly it's a good question
 
01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
in the process
 
01:35:58.629 --> 01:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
now of pulling that data really the best
 
01:35:59.109 --> 01:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
way to
 
01:36:02.229 --> 01:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
do that is to look at the cash
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
the winning tickets that have been
 
01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
cashed and the state of residence for
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
the winning tickets
 
01:36:09.669 --> 01:36:09.679 align:start position:0%
um folks tend to play where they work
 
01:36:09.679 --> 01:36:09.990 align:start position:0%
um folks tend to play where they work
not

01:36:09.990 --> 01:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:36:13.270 --> 01:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
where they live um and
 
01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
there are towns that actually don't have
 
01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:16.239 align:start position:0%
a store but they're still folks that
 
01:36:18.390 --> 01:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
play there
 
01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
so we're in the process of looking at
 
01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
that now
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
i do know we saw an increase in revenues
 
01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
particularly around the lakes region
 
01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
during coven because i think a lot of
 
01:36:30.790 --> 01:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
folks have moved up there
 
01:36:33.189 --> 01:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
who had summer homes um from
 
01:36:33.199 --> 01:36:34.870 align:start position:0%
who had summer homes um from
massachusetts

01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh also for sports betting for us we
 
01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
see about 12 of our revenues come from
 
01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
massachusetts on the sports betting
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
mobile platform
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
and i believe the majority of our
 
01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:47.910 align:start position:0%
and i believe the majority of our
revenues

01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:36:50.229 --> 01:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
in the physical locations in seabrook
 
01:36:52.229 --> 01:36:52.239 align:start position:0%
and manchester are from massachusetts
 
01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative heath you have
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:36:59.750 --> 01:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i think it's been
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%

with regard to the sports betting and
 
01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800 align:start position:0%

hampshire
 
01:37:32.229 --> 01:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
sports book revenue yes
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
so if you go to the far right section
 
01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
it'll say combined
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
um handle which is a column to the
 
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
the far right block but the far left
 
01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
column it says handle
 
01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
that is the amount of money that's
 
01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
wagered so if you and i bet 50
 
01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
on the patriots me to lose you to win
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
that would be 100
 
01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
of handle even though really my 50 went
 
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
to you because you won and i lost
 
01:37:58.709 --> 01:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
gross gaming revenue is the amount left
 
01:38:00.629 --> 01:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
over after all of the people who have
 
01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
won have been paid
 
01:38:04.870 --> 01:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
and state rev share is the amount each
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
month that the state receives in revenue
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
from sports betting
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
so if you go down to the bottom uh this
 
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
01:38:14.709 --> 01:38:14.719 align:start position:0%
we've handle has been 285 million
 
01:38:14.719 --> 01:38:15.590 align:start position:0%
we've handle has been 285 million
dollars

01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
gross gaming revenue has been 22 million
 
01:38:19.350 --> 01:38:19.360 align:start position:0%
and the state's share
 
01:38:22.709 --> 01:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
thus far has been 10.5 million
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
which is significantly better than we
 
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
had anticipated when we made their first
 
01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
um way back when
 
01:38:33.109 --> 01:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank you that's exactly what i was
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
looking for okay
 
01:38:37.350 --> 01:38:37.360 align:start position:0%
honestly it was just prepared finished
 
01:38:39.590 --> 01:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
today by our cfo and i was just looking
 
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
at it
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
before this meeting started so wonderful
 
01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
obviously the the revenue
 
01:38:58.390 --> 01:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
is going very well and um and that's
 
01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
that's great for the education trust
 
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
fund we're we're excited about that
 
01:39:06.229 --> 01:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
yes and actually to that point uh madam
 
01:39:07.590 --> 01:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
chair we um
 
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
our plan was for 110 million and we
 
01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
raised guidance with ways and means in
 
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
the governor's office
 
01:39:15.030 --> 01:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
120 million for this fiscal year
 
01:39:17.350 --> 01:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
and so that's obviously helping in terms
 
01:39:18.950 --> 01:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
of the budget issues we had
 
01:39:22.629 --> 01:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:24.310 --> 01:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
and we have seen like i said we've seen
 
01:39:26.310 --> 01:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
an influx of revenues
 
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
well over and above our comparator
 
01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:29.510 align:start position:0%
well over and above our comparator
states

01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
like maine and vermont and i think a
 
01:39:33.189 --> 01:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
large portion has been
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
influx of citizens who are playing up
 
01:39:39.990 --> 01:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
here now mass citizens i mean
 
01:39:43.270 --> 01:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh can you tell me how um
 
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
historical horse racing went in ways and
 
01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:49.030 align:start position:0%
historical horse racing went in ways and
means

01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
means
 
01:39:53.109 --> 01:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
um it went okay i think uh obviously
 
01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
a hearing where i think 180 people
 
01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
signed up
 
01:39:59.590 --> 01:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
um is tough in this times i think
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
they're gonna
 
01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
have a couple of work sessions going
 
01:40:04.149 --> 01:40:04.159 align:start position:0%
forward um
 
01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
and i think it went okay um other your
 
01:40:08.470 --> 01:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
colleagues obviously could tell you
 
01:40:11.830 --> 01:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
differently but um i think it went fine
 
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
certainly for us it's i mean i i think
 
01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
we've made the case a number of times
 
01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:17.510 align:start position:0%
we've made the case a number of times
that

01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
um for us it's how far do you want us to
 
01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
be on the dial of gambling and we'll
 
01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
happen to be there and do the best we
 
01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:23.510 align:start position:0%
happen to be there and do the best we
can

01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
we don't really sort of support or
 
01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
oppose legislation like that because
 
01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's a policy decision
 
01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
i often say that we don't make policy
 
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
with the instruments of policy
 
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
you tell us what to do and we try to do
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:41.189 --> 01:40:41.199 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative heath thank you
 
01:40:43.149 --> 01:40:43.159 align:start position:0%
i forget sometimes to
 
01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
technology-wise to raise my hand but my
 
01:40:47.030 --> 01:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
hand automatically goes up
 
01:40:49.750 --> 01:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
um a question um with regard to
 
01:40:51.030 --> 01:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
historical racing
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
um that's something we've been talking
 
01:40:54.149 --> 01:40:54.159 align:start position:0%
about now for uh
 
01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
a few years um what would your
 
01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:58.390 align:start position:0%
a few years um what would your
projection

01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
projection
 
01:41:01.590 --> 01:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
be in fact if we were to
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
um uh adopt historical racing
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
so um i made revenue estimates um uh
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
potential is a fiscal note attached to
 
01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh if i recall i don't have it in front
 
01:41:16.149 --> 01:41:16.159 align:start position:0%
of me i think that charities would
 
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
realize an additional 5 million
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
and the state would realize an
 
01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
additional i think it was 13 million
 
01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
but certainly those numbers are fluid in
 
01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
the sense of it's your call as to how
 
01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
much you want each side to get if you
 
01:41:31.590 --> 01:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
want the state to get more or less
 
01:41:34.229 --> 01:41:34.239 align:start position:0%
you know that number is not really tied
 
01:41:35.750 --> 01:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
to anything here it's just the way the
 
01:41:36.709 --> 01:41:36.719 align:start position:0%
bill was drafted
 
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
and our revenue estimates they're from
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
um if the charities
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
want to get more and more less than
 
01:41:43.109 --> 01:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
that's or you want
 
01:41:45.109 --> 01:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
to take it all it's your call all right
 
01:41:48.790 --> 01:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:56.629 --> 01:41:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:59.830 --> 01:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
sorry about being sure you got cut
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh he did you have a
 
01:42:04.629 --> 01:42:04.639 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
01:42:07.830 --> 01:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
i do um and i apologize um
 
01:42:10.229 --> 01:42:10.239 align:start position:0%
thank you so much uh for taking this
 
01:42:10.239 --> 01:42:10.950 align:start position:0%
thank you so much uh for taking this
question

01:42:10.950 --> 01:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
um in terms of charitable gaming um
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
there are um there's oversight for that
 
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
purpose and i know that there was um
 
01:42:22.229 --> 01:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
some kind of a study done
 
01:42:25.109 --> 01:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
that um recommended the number of people
 
01:42:25.119 --> 01:42:25.430 align:start position:0%
that um recommended the number of people
um

01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:28.629 --> 01:42:28.639 align:start position:0%
to really oversee charitable gaming um
 
01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
is that your department or do you know
 
01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
nothing about that
 
01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
it's my department representative um
 
01:42:35.189 --> 01:42:35.199 align:start position:0%
that was merged
 
01:42:39.189 --> 01:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
it wasn't originally but in 2016-17
 
01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
the governor put into her budget
 
01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
governor hassan and it was approved by
 
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
you folks
 
01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
the the absorption of charitable
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:51.990 --> 01:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
how many people do you have overseeing
 
01:42:54.830 --> 01:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh charitable gaming
 
01:42:57.590 --> 01:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
um in some cases there's some people do
 
01:42:58.390 --> 01:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
it part-time
 
01:43:01.109 --> 01:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
like our cfo does the numbers obviously
 
01:43:02.310 --> 01:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
he does all of our math
 
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
in his department um but directly
 
01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
it's approximately 11. so they're 10 or
 
01:43:11.109 --> 01:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
11 people to oversee childhood gambling
 
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
um there's three investigators we're
 
01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
hiring there's
 
01:43:17.830 --> 01:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
a fourth investigator hiring a fifth
 
01:43:20.950 --> 01:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
we have five financial auditors um
 
01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
which is significantly more than we have
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
when we absorb the agency i think
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
at the time they'll have one uh so we
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
have significantly greater oversight
 
01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
than we ever had before
 
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh if that's your question
 
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative yes thank you very much
 
01:43:37.189 --> 01:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
i will i will just comment that um
 
01:43:40.629 --> 01:43:40.639 align:start position:0%
i was involved in one of the charitable
 
01:43:40.639 --> 01:43:41.590 align:start position:0%
i was involved in one of the charitable
gaming

01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
sessions and um
 
01:43:47.910 --> 01:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
the state does a a very good job in
 
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
making sure
 
01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
that both the charity and
 
01:43:57.750 --> 01:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
the operator uh are um
 
01:44:01.109 --> 01:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
are are good you can't you can't just
 
01:44:05.910 --> 01:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh say well yeah let's do that tomorrow
 
01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
01:44:09.510 --> 01:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh they're doing a in my opinion anyhow
 
01:44:10.390 --> 01:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
a very good
 
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
job uh with the charitable gaming
 
01:44:15.910 --> 01:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
so representative bucco you had your
 
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
i did my question was asked and answered
 
01:44:24.070 --> 01:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
okay um where's the macintosh
 
01:44:30.149 --> 01:44:30.159 align:start position:0%
representative yeah
 
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
mr mcintyre uh yeah
 
01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
whatever you're sure you don't want to
 
01:44:37.109 --> 01:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
run for state rep
 
01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
um i know i know
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh do you want to go through your
 
01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
certainly um happy to do it the um
 
01:44:54.709 --> 01:44:54.719 align:start position:0%
this year our you'll see our expenses
 
01:44:54.719 --> 01:44:55.830 align:start position:0%
this year our you'll see our expenses
are

01:44:55.830 --> 01:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:44:57.590 --> 01:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
significantly larger than they were last
 
01:44:59.189 --> 01:44:59.199 align:start position:0%
year um
 
01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:02.639 align:start position:0%
in a couple of areas one obviously is
 
01:45:04.870 --> 01:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
personal services we did hire a few more
 
01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:05.669 align:start position:0%
personal services we did hire a few more
people

01:45:05.669 --> 01:45:05.679 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:45:07.590 --> 01:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
because we have been growing as you can
 
01:45:10.709 --> 01:45:10.719 align:start position:0%
see um
 
01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
growth comes with a cost right and so
 
01:45:16.149 --> 01:45:16.159 align:start position:0%
one of the things i'd like to sort of
 
01:45:17.590 --> 01:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
point out is
 
01:45:19.830 --> 01:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
the net profit on the slide that's up on
 
01:45:21.750 --> 01:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
the screen that's our last slide
 
01:45:25.270 --> 01:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
is net of expenses and so that growth
 
01:45:27.910 --> 01:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
is these expenses are netted out of that
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
profit and so
 
01:45:33.270 --> 01:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
you know as we grow more we have to
 
01:45:34.149 --> 01:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
spend more
 
01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
um there's a couple of expenses which
 
01:45:38.629 --> 01:45:38.639 align:start position:0%
look odd and i'll go through
 
01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
um one is um
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:49.750 --> 01:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
current expenses which in this fiscal
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
year is 682
 
01:45:54.390 --> 01:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
and drops down to 402 uh
 
01:45:57.990 --> 01:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
in 405 and 2022 and 2023
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
that was in place to essentially pay for
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
our own hosting of sports betting if
 
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
indeed we were going to do that
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
which we didn't end up doing so um even
 
01:46:10.470 --> 01:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
though that
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
figure is 682 we won't spend anywhere
 
01:46:13.510 --> 01:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
near it
 
01:46:16.470 --> 01:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
because we weren't sure if we were going
 
01:46:18.229 --> 01:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
to be the hosting entity for sports
 
01:46:18.239 --> 01:46:18.950 align:start position:0%
to be the hosting entity for sports
betting

01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
betting
 
01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
meaning we had to build out a server
 
01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
room and nice and uh
 
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
internal control which we did not have
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
to do or the expenses that went with it
 
01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
as well as sort of the support that goes
 
01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
with it um
 
01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
because of our partnership with
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
draftkings they really handle all the
 
01:46:33.990 --> 01:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
expenses there
 
01:46:37.590 --> 01:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
um and so forth so as a result
 
01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
we don't need to spend as much money um
 
01:46:40.870 --> 01:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
the request
 
01:46:44.950 --> 01:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
out years 402 500 and then 405 500
 
01:46:46.709 --> 01:46:46.719 align:start position:0%
current expenses pays for a number of
 
01:46:46.719 --> 01:46:49.109 align:start position:0%
current expenses pays for a number of
expenses

01:46:49.109 --> 01:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
one of which is obviously that the lba
 
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
audit bill we pay which is about 75 000
 
01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:54.149 align:start position:0%
audit bill we pay which is about 75 000
annually

01:46:54.149 --> 01:46:54.159 align:start position:0%
annually
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
comes out of that fund um what we pay
 
01:47:00.149 --> 01:47:00.159 align:start position:0%
for to support the retail network all
 
01:47:01.990 --> 01:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
the point of sale materials we send out
 
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
is paid from that
 
01:47:06.229 --> 01:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
line item uh and so it's a big expense
 
01:47:07.590 --> 01:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
for us but certainly it's an important
 
01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
one because it supports our retail
 
01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:10.070 align:start position:0%
one because it supports our retail
network

01:47:10.070 --> 01:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
network
 
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
um transfers to oit is certainly
 
01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
their number what it what we think what
 
01:47:19.109 --> 01:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
they think they're going to spend
 
01:47:21.510 --> 01:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
supporting us it's obviously a fluid
 
01:47:23.830 --> 01:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
number depending on what our needs are
 
01:47:26.950 --> 01:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
um i don't know
 
01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
whether whether expense sort of
 
01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
promotion i know is a big item
 
01:47:34.510 --> 01:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
if you'll see in 2020 we only spent
 
01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
2.068 million and this year we
 
01:47:40.629 --> 01:47:40.639 align:start position:0%
prospect projected to spend 2.5 and the
 
01:47:42.550 --> 01:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
reason for that i'll relate back to the
 
01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:43.830 align:start position:0%
reason for that i'll relate back to the
slide

01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
slide
 
01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
a few ago where i showed you powerball
 
01:47:47.910 --> 01:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
and megan millions being very low
 
01:47:51.990 --> 01:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
in 20. that's due to low jackpots
 
01:47:54.310 --> 01:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
and we don't promote low jackpots
 
01:47:55.830 --> 01:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
because it's not worth it
 
01:47:57.910 --> 01:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
and so we spend when the jackpots at 300
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
million and 400 million dollars
 
01:48:01.270 --> 01:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
we spent a lot of money on tv and radio
 
01:48:02.550 --> 01:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
promoting those jackpots
 
01:48:04.709 --> 01:48:04.719 align:start position:0%
because we see a return of a significant
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
return on investment
 
01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
it's like ten to one but if there's not
 
01:48:09.590 --> 01:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
we don't spend it and therefore it
 
01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:10.390 align:start position:0%
we don't spend it and therefore it
lapses

01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
lapses
 
01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
and obviously if we don't spend it
 
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
it lapses because our revenues
 
01:48:20.629 --> 01:48:20.639 align:start position:0%
are net of expenses so if it doesn't get
 
01:48:21.590 --> 01:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
spent it's a
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
profit education and those are set by
 
01:48:25.590 --> 01:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
the terms of actually the constitution
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
that formula is in
 
01:48:29.430 --> 01:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
second part article six b of the state
 
01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:30.790 align:start position:0%
second part article six b of the state
constitution

01:48:30.790 --> 01:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
and so um i'd like to think
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh and i'll use this analogy i like to
 
01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:36.719 align:start position:0%
think we act like grown-ups when it
 
01:48:37.830 --> 01:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
comes to our budget
 
01:48:40.149 --> 01:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
um we never generally spend up to the
 
01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
budget only because if we don't need to
 
01:48:43.109 --> 01:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
we don't spend it
 
01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
like 2020 we only spent 9.25 million
 
01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:46.390 align:start position:0%
like 2020 we only spent 9.25 million
dollars

01:48:46.390 --> 01:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:48:47.669 --> 01:48:47.679 align:start position:0%
despite being authorized for a
 
01:48:49.590 --> 01:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
significantly higher number
 
01:48:52.629 --> 01:48:52.639 align:start position:0%
and so in some cases these are here just
 
01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
in case we
 
01:48:55.590 --> 01:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
we need to spend it and want to capture
 
01:48:57.590 --> 01:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
every other revenues we can
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
um and i know there's another um jim you
 
01:49:02.229 --> 01:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
want to talk about our prioritized
 
01:49:02.239 --> 01:49:04.550 align:start position:0%
want to talk about our prioritized
request

01:49:04.550 --> 01:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:49:07.990 --> 01:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
sure excuse me um
 
01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
so our original um our original budget
 
01:49:14.470 --> 01:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
that we submitted for doit expense
 
01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
uh we had additional prioritized
 
01:49:18.629 --> 01:49:18.639 align:start position:0%
requests in there for
 
01:49:22.229 --> 01:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
a cnr crm system uh
 
01:49:24.550 --> 01:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
which is a bit large project so we we
 
01:49:26.229 --> 01:49:26.239 align:start position:0%
actually originally budgeted
 
01:49:30.070 --> 01:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
513 000 with an additional 220 000
 
01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
i'm rounding off for the crm project
 
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
going forward over the next few years
 
01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
this is a plan that our sales team put
 
01:49:39.109 --> 01:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
together in order to
 
01:49:41.430 --> 01:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
better gather information about our
 
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
customer base
 
01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
responses information we receive and
 
01:49:47.430 --> 01:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
request for information we receive
 
01:49:50.629 --> 01:49:50.639 align:start position:0%
to try to streamline our systems
 
01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
so the governor did add it into our
 
01:49:55.830 --> 01:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
into the governor's recommended budget
 
01:49:57.750 --> 01:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
which our sales team was very happy
 
01:49:57.760 --> 01:49:58.709 align:start position:0%
which our sales team was very happy
about

01:49:58.709 --> 01:49:58.719 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:50:00.709 --> 01:50:00.719 align:start position:0%
and if i could sort of add color to that
 
01:50:00.719 --> 01:50:01.910 align:start position:0%
and if i could sort of add color to that
um

01:50:01.910 --> 01:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:05.109 --> 01:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
we've added multiple new channels to our
 
01:50:05.119 --> 01:50:06.470 align:start position:0%
we've added multiple new channels to our
offerings

01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
offerings
 
01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
so for example we have an internet
 
01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
lottery program
 
01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
and that those customers come through us
 
01:50:13.350 --> 01:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
from one
 
01:50:15.430 --> 01:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
method we have the draftkings sports
 
01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
betting platform
 
01:50:18.149 --> 01:50:18.159 align:start position:0%
those calls come to us for another
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
method obviously we have our traditional
 
01:50:20.159 --> 01:50:21.510 align:start position:0%
method obviously we have our traditional
lottery

01:50:21.510 --> 01:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
lottery
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
those calls come into us and then now we
 
01:50:25.750 --> 01:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
have keno and those calls come into us
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
so we're not doing a very good job of
 
01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
tracking our customers who call in
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
and making sure they get response times
 
01:50:34.229 --> 01:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
as fast as we would like them to
 
01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
and so that's really what the priority
 
01:50:37.750 --> 01:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
the request is for
 
01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
is to make sure we're servicing the
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
folks who quite literally pay our
 
01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:42.550 align:start position:0%
folks who quite literally pay our
salaries

01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
salaries
 
01:50:46.070 --> 01:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
um well and making sure nobody's
 
01:50:48.390 --> 01:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
falls to the cracks the you know the i
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
didn't get a call back drives me insane
 
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
if i hear that so
 
01:50:54.149 --> 01:50:54.159 align:start position:0%
um i want to make sure we don't slip and
 
01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
fall on that
 
01:51:04.149 --> 01:51:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:51:07.270 --> 01:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
anyone has on our budget it's a pretty
 
01:51:09.270 --> 01:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
straightforward little budget i think
 
01:51:11.350 --> 01:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
thankfully there's no no grants no
 
01:51:13.589 --> 01:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
no federal money there's just i always
 
01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
get those emails i'm like i i just
 
01:51:17.189 --> 01:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
literally it's from sales it's from the
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
sale of tickets
 
01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
i uh i did i did have a question um
 
01:51:27.589 --> 01:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
i noticed that your uh
 
01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
done something different there
 
01:51:37.910 --> 01:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
jim those numbers are provided to us
 
01:51:38.950 --> 01:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
from das
 
01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
um i can tell you that our original
 
01:51:43.510 --> 01:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
amount for the year
 
01:51:45.350 --> 01:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to zoom to it here bear with
 
01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:46.950 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to zoom to it here bear with
me

01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:51:51.589 --> 01:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
um our original amount for the year was
 
01:51:53.350 --> 01:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
actually that we originally requested
 
01:51:56.149 --> 01:51:56.159 align:start position:0%
was actually higher for 2022
 
01:51:59.350 --> 01:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
and it was decreased on the governor's
 
01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:00.709 align:start position:0%
and it was decreased on the governor's
version

01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
version
 
01:52:04.229 --> 01:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
um and the same or excuse me and the
 
01:52:06.870 --> 01:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
exact opposite for 2023. so those are
 
01:52:07.910 --> 01:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
numbers provided
 
01:52:10.950 --> 01:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
by das nothing that we calculate here
 
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
same as with salaries it would roll
 
01:52:15.669 --> 01:52:15.679 align:start position:0%
right along with salary figures through
 
01:52:18.709 --> 01:52:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:21.430 --> 01:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
okay i guess i i i knew that i should
 
01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:22.229 align:start position:0%
okay i guess i i i knew that i should
have

01:52:22.229 --> 01:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
not said that yeah i'm assuming they
 
01:52:26.229 --> 01:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
made an adjustment in some way on their
 
01:52:27.669 --> 01:52:27.679 align:start position:0%
end of how they're handling things
 
01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
sort of like we've seen opeb and
 
01:52:30.870 --> 01:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
everything we've seen adjustments there
 
01:52:32.310 --> 01:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
over the last couple years because of
 
01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
changes they've made
 
01:52:36.070 --> 01:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
so that's my assumption yeah because of
 
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
our actual absorption of racing we
 
01:52:38.629 --> 01:52:38.639 align:start position:0%
picked up
 
01:52:40.310 --> 01:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
all the racing employees who had retired
 
01:52:42.390 --> 01:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
previously as well so that had jumped up
 
01:52:47.430 --> 01:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:51.589 --> 01:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
and you said that with the
 
01:52:55.669 --> 01:52:55.679 align:start position:0%
doit transfer it's because of a
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
a new system that you're implementing
 
01:53:02.310 --> 01:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
yes it's um it's called crm which
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
stands for customer relationship
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
management tool it's an ability for
 
01:53:10.709 --> 01:53:10.719 align:start position:0%
essentially software to track
 
01:53:12.470 --> 01:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
all of our relationships and all of the
 
01:53:14.229 --> 01:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
calls and emails we receive from
 
01:53:14.239 --> 01:53:15.109 align:start position:0%
calls and emails we receive from
customers

01:53:15.109 --> 01:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
customers
 
01:53:16.709 --> 01:53:16.719 align:start position:0%
of which as you can imagine we receive a
 
01:53:16.719 --> 01:53:18.950 align:start position:0%
of which as you can imagine we receive a
lot

01:53:18.950 --> 01:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
lot
 
01:53:22.390 --> 01:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
it also allows you to uh data mine to
 
01:53:25.109 --> 01:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
gather data and to create reports and
 
01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
and analyze things so that you have a
 
01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
okay i see a couple of hands and i'm
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
sorry i don't know who was first
 
01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
representative heath thank you madam
 
01:53:40.070 --> 01:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
chair and
 
01:53:42.870 --> 01:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question i
 
01:53:44.070 --> 01:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
live in manchester
 
01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh manchester uh we have a lot of
 
01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
terrible game going on in my city and
 
01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
keno seems to be quite a hit do you have
 
01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
any um figures or do i need to wait for
 
01:53:59.669 --> 01:53:59.679 align:start position:0%
the crm system to come on board
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
before you can tell me exactly how much
 
01:54:03.589 --> 01:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
money do you think the city of
 
01:54:03.599 --> 01:54:04.550 align:start position:0%
money do you think the city of
manchester

01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
01:54:08.070 --> 01:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
drives for the state of new hampshire um
 
01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
i can find that out for you i don't have
 
01:54:11.109 --> 01:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
the number on right now
 
01:54:12.390 --> 01:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
because i don't have it broken up by
 
01:54:14.470 --> 01:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
city uh obviously as you can imagine
 
01:54:16.229 --> 01:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
manchester being a large largest in the
 
01:54:16.239 --> 01:54:17.030 align:start position:0%
manchester being a large largest in the
state

01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:54:20.709 --> 01:54:20.719 align:start position:0%
but also a commercial base as well
 
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
is probably larger than its population
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of revenue growth
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
revenue from the lottery um
 
01:54:28.950 --> 01:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
but i'd have to get them before you're
 
01:54:30.310 --> 01:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
presented i'm happy to do it it just
 
01:54:31.510 --> 01:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
will take a little bit
 
01:54:34.709 --> 01:54:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:36.310 --> 01:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
representative murray you have a
 
01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
question oh thank you madam chair i
 
01:54:39.750 --> 01:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
should have lowered my hand you asked
 
01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
the question that i was going to ask
 
01:54:45.189 --> 01:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
so i'm good what do they say
 
01:54:47.350 --> 01:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
great minds think alike is that right
 
01:54:51.030 --> 01:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
01:54:54.149 --> 01:54:54.159 align:start position:0%
are there um any further questions
 
01:54:58.870 --> 01:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
for uh mr mcintyre
 
01:55:02.310 --> 01:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh i'll call you charlie i'm sorry
 
01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679 align:start position:0%
that i can't get keno
 
01:55:07.270 --> 01:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
passed in conway it's uh it's absolutely
 
01:55:08.790 --> 01:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
a losing cause
 
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
and it must be because representative
 
01:55:16.550 --> 01:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
i enjoy the drive anyway representative
 
01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
bomber i enjoy the drive up every time
 
01:55:21.589 --> 01:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh it's one of the places i actually
 
01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
personally make sure i go to
 
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
um it would be great especially now
 
01:55:27.030 --> 01:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
during ski season the bars would be
 
01:55:30.709 --> 01:55:30.719 align:start position:0%
well whatever i appreciate the effort
 
01:55:33.750 --> 01:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
well hopefully we can uh wait a couple
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
three years and see what happens but
 
01:55:37.750 --> 01:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
representative bucco it seems like you
 
01:55:40.070 --> 01:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
want to say something
 
01:55:42.790 --> 01:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
well i just wanted to can you am i yeah
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to respond to that
 
01:55:47.109 --> 01:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
remark that i i was out there trying to
 
01:55:52.470 --> 01:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i think last time they got in with
 
01:55:56.229 --> 01:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
the bathwater in terms of
 
01:55:59.350 --> 01:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
other issues yeah i don't understand it
 
01:56:02.550 --> 01:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
either but certainly obviously
 
01:56:05.189 --> 01:56:05.199 align:start position:0%
i saw the first initial fear for kino i
 
01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
get it folks who are reluctant to vote
 
01:56:07.750 --> 01:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
for it
 
01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
but we haven't had so much as a single
 
01:56:11.589 --> 01:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
call related to a problem with it in
 
01:56:12.870 --> 01:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
01:56:15.990 --> 01:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
any issue at a bar or tavern and most of
 
01:56:17.589 --> 01:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
the bars that have it love it
 
01:56:20.149 --> 01:56:20.159 align:start position:0%
and we did a study after the fact that
 
01:56:21.270 --> 01:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
i've used a couple of times in
 
01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:23.270 align:start position:0%
i've used a couple of times in
presentations

01:56:23.270 --> 01:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
presentations
 
01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
the all of the bars saw a lift between
 
01:56:27.109 --> 01:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
five to twenty five percent
 
01:56:29.510 --> 01:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
in their other stuff yeah so they sold
 
01:56:31.430 --> 01:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
more food they sold another beverage and
 
01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:31.990 align:start position:0%
more food they sold another beverage and
dessert

01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
dessert
 
01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
so um one of the bar owners put it to me
 
01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:35.270 align:start position:0%
so um one of the bar owners put it to me
like

01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:56:36.310 --> 01:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
it was the first time i thought the
 
01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
state did something for me versus you
 
01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.229 align:start position:0%
state did something for me versus you
know

01:56:40.229 --> 01:56:40.239 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:56:43.669 --> 01:56:43.679 align:start position:0%
so um bringing in a million dollars a
 
01:56:44.550 --> 01:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
week it
 
01:56:46.870 --> 01:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
makes a big difference too originally it
 
01:56:49.270 --> 01:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
was only about eight or nine million
 
01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
yeah no so you know we had estimated 40
 
01:56:53.990 --> 01:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
million when we first did evidence
 
01:56:55.990 --> 01:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates and now it's going to
 
01:56:57.270 --> 01:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
be like 50
 
01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
million at least uh it's continuing to
 
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
accelerate so
 
01:57:03.589 --> 01:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
like i said we're seeing it most along
 
01:57:04.629 --> 01:57:04.639 align:start position:0%
the border
 
01:57:06.550 --> 01:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
and then the bigger cities as you can
 
01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:08.310 align:start position:0%
and then the bigger cities as you can
imagine

01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
01:57:10.070 --> 01:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
and one of the things it does actually
 
01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
is it makes the bar more valuable if you
 
01:57:13.750 --> 01:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to sell it
 
01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:17.589 align:start position:0%
wanted to sell it
right

01:57:17.589 --> 01:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:22.229 --> 01:57:22.239 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions for
 
01:57:25.990 --> 01:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
mr mcintyre yes go ahead represent me
 
01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um i just have to ask this
 
01:57:30.550 --> 01:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
question in terms of um
 
01:57:33.830 --> 01:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
problem gambling uh are are you seeing
 
01:57:37.109 --> 01:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
um or do you know or can you identify um
 
01:57:41.270 --> 01:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
an increase in problem gambling based on
 
01:57:44.310 --> 01:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
the covet pandemic and all the offerings
 
01:57:46.070 --> 01:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
that we have now available to
 
01:57:49.270 --> 01:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
the state certainly um
 
01:57:52.070 --> 01:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
there's a council of problem gaming that
 
01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
tracks data
 
01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:55.679 align:start position:0%
we don't as a matter we're the funding
 
01:57:55.679 --> 01:57:56.629 align:start position:0%
we don't as a matter we're the funding
source

01:57:56.629 --> 01:57:56.639 align:start position:0%
source
 
01:57:59.430 --> 01:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
um one of the nice things is because the
 
01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
technology the
 
01:58:02.709 --> 01:58:02.719 align:start position:0%
both the sports betting platform as well
 
01:58:04.229 --> 01:58:04.239 align:start position:0%
as our internet platform
 
01:58:06.149 --> 01:58:06.159 align:start position:0%
both have tools which allow the player
 
01:58:08.070 --> 01:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
to help themselves
 
01:58:10.149 --> 01:58:10.159 align:start position:0%
in essence to either limit the amount
 
01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
they spend as well as
 
01:58:14.310 --> 01:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
exclude themselves we have hundreds and
 
01:58:15.430 --> 01:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people who have excluded
 
01:58:17.189 --> 01:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
themselves both from sports betting
 
01:58:19.910 --> 01:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
and internet um that we don't have the
 
01:58:21.669 --> 01:58:21.679 align:start position:0%
ability to do at a store
 
01:58:23.990 --> 01:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
um you know if that makes sense stopping
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
somebody from buying a lottery ticket is
 
01:58:26.310 --> 01:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
the equivalent of stopping somebody
 
01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
buying a cup of coffee statewide which
 
01:58:29.350 --> 01:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
is not possible so
 
01:58:33.510 --> 01:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
you know technology allows us to do that
 
01:58:35.990 --> 01:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative murray thank you madam
 
01:58:37.990 --> 01:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
chair can you speak to kino and the
 
01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
places that have in the places that
 
01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
don't have it
 
01:58:42.390 --> 01:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
does this get revisited are there
 
01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
communities that don't have it that it
 
01:58:45.750 --> 01:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
comes back up for another vote
 
01:58:47.189 --> 01:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
and have there been communities that
 
01:58:50.310 --> 01:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
have decided they don't want it anymore
 
01:58:55.030 --> 01:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:56.790 --> 01:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
there were places that initially really
 
01:58:59.430 --> 01:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
wanted it very badly
 
01:59:02.950 --> 01:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
and where uh the sponsors were bars in
 
01:59:04.470 --> 01:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
towns and cities that really wanted to
 
01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
have it and those were really along the
 
01:59:08.229 --> 01:59:08.239 align:start position:0%
mass border because mass has
 
01:59:11.669 --> 01:59:11.679 align:start position:0%
keno and the biggest locations for kino
 
01:59:14.229 --> 01:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts and coincidentally in
 
01:59:15.510 --> 01:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
north america
 
01:59:17.510 --> 01:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
are on the mass new hampshire border
 
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
three of the top five in north america
 
01:59:20.149 --> 01:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
are on the board
 
01:59:23.350 --> 01:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
so bars they're really excited to get it
 
01:59:24.870 --> 01:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine so they were really
 
01:59:26.709 --> 01:59:26.719 align:start position:0%
first jumped to it
 
01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
and and then there were places which
 
01:59:30.550 --> 01:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
were unsure
 
01:59:32.310 --> 01:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
didn't vote for the first time and voted
 
01:59:33.589 --> 01:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
for the second time
 
01:59:35.189 --> 01:59:35.199 align:start position:0%
and then there are places where it will
 
01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
never happen and to the end of time
 
01:59:41.270 --> 01:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
as long you know just won't happen um
 
01:59:43.510 --> 01:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
so you know i never say never never say
 
01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
always but
 
01:59:45.669 --> 01:59:45.679 align:start position:0%
i would be support there's certain like
 
01:59:47.669 --> 01:59:47.679 align:start position:0%
portsmouth for example has been dead set
 
01:59:49.030 --> 01:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
against it
 
01:59:52.229 --> 01:59:52.239 align:start position:0%
since it it started so um
 
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
i because we've hit our revenue target i
 
01:59:57.270 --> 01:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
stopped really going out and soliciting
 
02:00:00.629 --> 02:00:00.639 align:start position:0%
the vote we never really campaigned for
 
02:00:03.109 --> 02:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
it like you would like you folks do
 
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
um we just would go out and answer
 
02:00:07.270 --> 02:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
questions at the town meetings
 
02:00:08.950 --> 02:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
i saw a few obviously a bunch of folks
 
02:00:10.390 --> 02:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
in your towns
 
02:00:13.910 --> 02:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
and cities um but no we
 
02:00:15.669 --> 02:00:15.679 align:start position:0%
there's no i don't think there are any
 
02:00:17.189 --> 02:00:17.199 align:start position:0%
cities or towns that have on the ballots
 
02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
coming this fall
 
02:00:20.310 --> 02:00:20.320 align:start position:0%
are there any places that have it and
 
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
decided it was a bad idea
 
02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
no no
 
02:00:27.990 --> 02:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
and honestly i i haven't heard even like
 
02:00:29.030 --> 02:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
a selectmen or
 
02:00:36.709 --> 02:00:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:38.950 --> 02:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions that
 
02:00:42.709 --> 02:00:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:52.310 --> 02:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:55.510 --> 02:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
right seeing nothing i'm sorry i did not
 
02:00:58.950 --> 02:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
sorry okay no problem i've got this
 
02:01:01.109 --> 02:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
little white hand at your head so
 
02:01:01.119 --> 02:01:05.189 align:start position:0%
little white hand at your head so
um

02:01:05.189 --> 02:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
so um if there are no further questions
 
02:01:15.990 --> 02:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:19.350 --> 02:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
area that's coming in is uh fish and
 
02:01:20.830 --> 02:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
game at 1
 
02:01:24.070 --> 02:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
30. and so um
 
02:01:27.109 --> 02:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
we'll have a opportunity for lunch thank
 
02:01:27.119 --> 02:01:27.830 align:start position:0%
we'll have a opportunity for lunch thank
you

02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:01:31.109 --> 02:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
mr mcintyre for giving us that
 
02:01:35.189 --> 02:01:35.199 align:start position:0%
and um we will
 
02:01:38.229 --> 02:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
come back together at 1 30
 
02:01:41.430 --> 02:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
and uh mickey i assume that
 
02:01:44.870 --> 02:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
we probably should sign off
 
02:01:48.229 --> 02:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
and um yeah i think considering it's
 
02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
you know 90 minutes i'll probably shut
 
02:01:52.070 --> 02:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
down the webinar and then just start it
 
02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
back up again
 
02:01:55.030 --> 02:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
probably around 125 and everyone can
 
02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:56.149 align:start position:0%
probably around 125 and everyone can
re-enter

02:01:56.149 --> 02:01:56.159 align:start position:0%
re-enter
 
02:01:59.350 --> 02:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
again do we
 
02:02:01.830 --> 02:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
have to do we have to show something
 
02:02:03.350 --> 02:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
that says we're in recess
 
02:02:06.149 --> 02:02:06.159 align:start position:0%
until 1 30. that's up to you i mean it's
 
02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh we can figure out something
 
02:02:10.950 --> 02:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
it's just it occupies the screen for um
 
02:02:13.030 --> 02:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
90 minutes now that i've got to keep the
 
02:02:14.550 --> 02:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
my computer kind of shared screen but i
 
02:02:16.310 --> 02:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
can do that if you want i know
 
02:02:18.470 --> 02:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
other committees have been doing that um
 
02:02:19.750 --> 02:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know if
 
02:02:21.589 --> 02:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
it's a rule of the house that that you
 
02:02:23.109 --> 02:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
have to keep the webinar open
 
02:02:25.510 --> 02:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
or if we can just you know end it and
 
02:02:26.950 --> 02:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
then restart it again i think it's
 
02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
really up to you
 
02:02:31.109 --> 02:02:31.119 align:start position:0%
whatever you'd like to do i don't
 
02:02:33.750 --> 02:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
i don't have any idea no one has uh i
 
02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:34.149 align:start position:0%
i don't have any idea no one has uh i
mean

02:02:34.149 --> 02:02:34.159 align:start position:0%
mean
 
02:02:36.310 --> 02:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
considering you've got a fishing game
 
02:02:37.910 --> 02:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
posted at 1 30
 
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
the public will know you're getting back
 
02:02:41.430 --> 02:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
together at 1 30. i think if there was
 
02:02:43.270 --> 02:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
an open-ended recess like if you took a
 
02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:43.669 align:start position:0%
an open-ended recess like if you took a
break

02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
break
 
02:02:45.109 --> 02:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
until you know i could put something on
 
02:02:46.629 --> 02:02:46.639 align:start position:0%
the screen that says is currently in
 
02:02:46.639 --> 02:02:47.189 align:start position:0%
the screen that says is currently in
recess

02:02:47.189 --> 02:02:47.199 align:start position:0%
recess
 
02:02:48.870 --> 02:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
because it's unknown when you're coming
 
02:02:51.189 --> 02:02:51.199 align:start position:0%
back um so it's up to you i mean i can
 
02:02:52.950 --> 02:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
put it like an away message up now that
 
02:02:54.470 --> 02:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
says division 2 is in recess
 
02:02:56.550 --> 02:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
until fishing game at 1 30. if you'd
 
02:02:59.109 --> 02:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
like that just in case anyone pops in
 
02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
um i'm not expecting folks too we have
 
02:03:04.629 --> 02:03:04.639 align:start position:0%
uh two two attendees right now and one
 
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
of them is janet and she knows what
 
02:03:06.390 --> 02:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
we're up to
 
02:03:09.109 --> 02:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
so um i don't think there's gonna be
 
02:03:09.119 --> 02:03:09.589 align:start position:0%
so um i don't think there's gonna be
many

02:03:09.589 --> 02:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
many
 
02:03:11.350 --> 02:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
folks in the public looking for division
 
02:03:13.510 --> 02:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
two in the next 90 minutes so
 
02:03:15.510 --> 02:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
okay i think that's probably the best
 
02:03:16.870 --> 02:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
thing and we'll uh
 
02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
we'll come back about uh 125 and uh
 
02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
hope everyone has a a good lunch
 
02:03:28.390 --> 02:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
and we'll see you then oh
 
02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative murray mickey do you
 
02:03:32.709 --> 02:03:32.719 align:start position:0%
think we can get charlie's slides i
 
02:03:34.390 --> 02:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
think he's already gone i wanted to ask
 
02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:36.719 align:start position:0%
if he could email us his slides
 
02:03:38.470 --> 02:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
i emailed him to you this morning so you
 
02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
should you did
 
02:03:42.390 --> 02:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
and then just a reminder on on our lba
 
02:03:44.149 --> 02:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
page we do have that division two
 
02:03:46.149 --> 02:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
so anything that i get handouts
 
02:03:47.750 --> 02:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
presentations throughout this session
 
02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna throw them right online so
 
02:03:51.109 --> 02:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
you and you know sort them
 
02:03:52.470 --> 02:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
chronologically so you'll be able to
 
02:03:53.910 --> 02:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
refer back if you can't put your hands
 
02:03:54.550 --> 02:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
on something
 
02:03:56.310 --> 02:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
yeah i got police standards but i've met
 
02:03:58.069 --> 02:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
i don't have a lot actually lottery may
 
02:03:59.350 --> 02:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
have come yesterday i think i sent a
 
02:04:00.629 --> 02:04:00.639 align:start position:0%
lottery to you yesterday
 
02:04:03.270 --> 02:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
all right i'll find it thank you
 
02:04:05.189 --> 02:04:05.199 align:start position:0%
representative lynn you have a question
 
02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
yes you know i just want to make sure
 
02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
that i'm i'm
 
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
performing my duties as clerk as i'm
 
02:04:12.550 --> 02:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
supposed to be so
 
02:04:14.629 --> 02:04:14.639 align:start position:0%
the first question the first question i
 
02:04:16.149 --> 02:04:16.159 align:start position:0%
have is um
 
02:04:20.149 --> 02:04:20.159 align:start position:0%
i i got from the from clerk smith
 
02:04:22.470 --> 02:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
two forms to be used that where you know
 
02:04:23.430 --> 02:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
one of them
 
02:04:25.750 --> 02:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
the one which i thought was the one for
 
02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:27.030 align:start position:0%
the one which i thought was the one for
attendance

02:04:27.030 --> 02:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
attendance
 
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
but as i look at it more closely it it
 
02:04:31.350 --> 02:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
really seems to be
 
02:04:32.950 --> 02:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
a form that's to be used if we're
 
02:04:35.669 --> 02:04:35.679 align:start position:0%
actually voting on some particular bill
 
02:04:37.350 --> 02:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
and so i'm wondering is there another
 
02:04:39.990 --> 02:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
form that i don't have that you use to
 
02:04:46.069 --> 02:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:48.709 --> 02:04:48.719 align:start position:0%
uh mickey do you wanna i think it's just
 
02:04:49.830 --> 02:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:04:52.550 --> 02:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
there's just one form for taking
 
02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:53.910 align:start position:0%
there's just one form for taking
attendance

02:04:53.910 --> 02:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
attendance
 
02:04:57.589 --> 02:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
and normally janet should give you or
 
02:05:01.189 --> 02:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
somebody should give you the um
 
02:05:04.870 --> 02:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
the sheets for voting okay
 
02:05:06.550 --> 02:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
i do have i think i do have the sheet
 
02:05:08.149 --> 02:05:08.159 align:start position:0%
for voting but i i
 
02:05:11.109 --> 02:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
and i the last time i used that as to
 
02:05:12.709 --> 02:05:12.719 align:start position:0%
because i i didn't realize that i used
 
02:05:13.990 --> 02:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
that for taking attendance but if
 
02:05:15.510 --> 02:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
there's another form for taking
 
02:05:15.520 --> 02:05:16.470 align:start position:0%
there's another form for taking
attendance

02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
attendance
 
02:05:18.550 --> 02:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
i i i guess i don't have it and i don't
 
02:05:20.950 --> 02:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
know i don't really know if there is one
 
02:05:22.550 --> 02:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
i'll have uh janet or maybe
 
02:05:23.910 --> 02:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative buco knows because he
 
02:05:25.589 --> 02:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
clerked for us last term
 
02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
yeah well so the attendance she used to
 
02:05:30.069 --> 02:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
come on a red clipboard so it was a
 
02:05:31.830 --> 02:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
separate sheet
 
02:05:33.350 --> 02:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
i can have janet connect with you
 
02:05:34.870 --> 02:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative lin and make sure you've
 
02:05:34.880 --> 02:05:35.270 align:start position:0%
representative lin and make sure you've
got

02:05:35.270 --> 02:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
got
 
02:05:36.629 --> 02:05:36.639 align:start position:0%
the proper documents because she's the
 
02:05:38.310 --> 02:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
one who collects all those for the you
 
02:05:39.589 --> 02:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
know the minutes and the
 
02:05:41.589 --> 02:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
clerk's files so i'll have janet connect
 
02:05:42.629 --> 02:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
with you to make sure you've got the
 
02:05:43.510 --> 02:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
right stuff
 
02:05:45.270 --> 02:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
great thank you and then just one other
 
02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
question and this is probably the more
 
02:05:48.550 --> 02:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
important one is um
 
02:05:51.189 --> 02:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
i've i've been taking notes so to speak
 
02:05:51.199 --> 02:05:51.910 align:start position:0%
i've i've been taking notes so to speak
as

02:05:51.910 --> 02:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:05:55.030 --> 02:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
as we've had the two presentations and
 
02:05:57.910 --> 02:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
is i i guess what i'm really asking is
 
02:05:59.750 --> 02:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
what do i do now am i supposed to like
 
02:06:01.189 --> 02:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
write up a little
 
02:06:03.510 --> 02:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
a little report so to speak about what
 
02:06:05.109 --> 02:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
they said or
 
02:06:08.149 --> 02:06:08.159 align:start position:0%
what what do i do now
 
02:06:11.189 --> 02:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
uh yes a little report i mean
 
02:06:14.069 --> 02:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
with uh you know as we're going through
 
02:06:14.079 --> 02:06:14.830 align:start position:0%
with uh you know as we're going through
these

02:06:14.830 --> 02:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:06:18.069 --> 02:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
um budget hearings
 
02:06:20.390 --> 02:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
you know we'll be talking about a lot of
 
02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
things but
 
02:06:24.629 --> 02:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
uh janet we just need to put in the
 
02:06:27.669 --> 02:06:27.679 align:start position:0%
file you know kind of a general
 
02:06:30.870 --> 02:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
statement about what occurred during
 
02:06:35.350 --> 02:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
um during these sessions and
 
02:06:37.350 --> 02:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
the other question when you're talking
 
02:06:39.109 --> 02:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
to janet is
 
02:06:42.310 --> 02:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
we need to figure out how all of these
 
02:06:42.320 --> 02:06:43.350 align:start position:0%
we need to figure out how all of these
handouts

02:06:43.350 --> 02:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
handouts
 
02:06:47.109 --> 02:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
are going to get into the file
 
02:06:50.229 --> 02:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
because that is that is the place
 
02:06:53.430 --> 02:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
where we keep records for
 
02:06:56.629 --> 02:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
however many years but
 
02:06:59.109 --> 02:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
janet should be able to figure that out
 
02:07:00.790 --> 02:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
with you
 
02:07:04.629 --> 02:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
so daniel madam chair i i would just
 
02:07:06.709 --> 02:07:06.719 align:start position:0%
i i would take my hand scribbled notes
 
02:07:08.550 --> 02:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
down the hall and hand them to janet and
 
02:07:10.870 --> 02:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
she would type everything up so
 
02:07:13.990 --> 02:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
um i don't i didn't
 
02:07:16.310 --> 02:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
i didn't submit a summarized report i
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
gave her actually the
 
02:07:21.030 --> 02:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
the uh scribbled notes
 
02:07:25.350 --> 02:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
well i i i think i might try that at
 
02:07:26.310 --> 02:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
some point when we're
 
02:07:28.310 --> 02:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
when we're like you know in person but
 
02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:29.589 align:start position:0%
when we're like you know in person but
um

02:07:29.589 --> 02:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
my my i've never been known for having
 
02:07:33.669 --> 02:07:33.679 align:start position:0%
very clear handwriting
 
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
yeah well i can't read my own either so
 
02:07:38.629 --> 02:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
so i thought you might try at least in
 
02:07:40.229 --> 02:07:40.239 align:start position:0%
the first instance to type up a little
 
02:07:40.239 --> 02:07:41.030 align:start position:0%
the first instance to type up a little
something

02:07:41.030 --> 02:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:07:44.709 --> 02:07:44.719 align:start position:0%
i just asked janet what she needs okay
 
02:07:47.430 --> 02:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah she she uh she will
 
02:07:47.440 --> 02:07:48.310 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah she she uh she will
definitely

02:07:48.310 --> 02:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh tell you what she needs and uh
 
02:07:54.870 --> 02:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
but we do need to figure out how we're
 
02:07:55.830 --> 02:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
going to
 
02:07:59.589 --> 02:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
um get all this stuff into the file
 
02:08:03.189 --> 02:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
and i think that it will be probably
 
02:08:05.589 --> 02:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
obviously a little bit later on when we
 
02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
start getting
 
02:08:11.430 --> 02:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
written testimony from
 
02:08:15.510 --> 02:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:19.270 --> 02:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
that will become it's not a problem
 
02:08:20.390 --> 02:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
because we'll get it
 
02:08:22.870 --> 02:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
but we just need to know how to get it
 
02:08:25.109 --> 02:08:25.119 align:start position:0%
into the file
 
02:08:28.550 --> 02:08:28.560 align:start position:0%

02:47:20.710 --> 02:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
it is wonderful i think it's just this
 
02:47:22.790 --> 02:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
is running more smoothly than i ever
 
02:47:24.389 --> 02:47:24.399 align:start position:0%
imagined and
 
02:47:26.870 --> 02:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
you keep it going i am i think we have
 
02:47:28.630 --> 02:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
the best division
 
02:47:34.550 --> 02:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
oh there's no question in my mind mary
 
02:47:37.269 --> 02:47:37.279 align:start position:0%
excuse me i got a phone ringing here and
 
02:47:38.630 --> 02:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
this has worked so well
 
02:47:40.550 --> 02:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
i miss kind of the convincing and you
 
02:47:42.150 --> 02:47:42.160 align:start position:0%

02:47:42.160 --> 02:47:43.269 align:start position:0%
know note sharing and chit chat
afterwards

02:47:43.269 --> 02:47:43.279 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
02:47:44.950 --> 02:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
and just you know the small talk with
 
02:47:47.030 --> 02:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
the um the people coming in
 
02:47:49.590 --> 02:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
but this has worked so well i don't
 
02:47:51.110 --> 02:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
think we would have had i'm not sure we
 
02:47:53.030 --> 02:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
would have met with tuesday with the ice
 
02:47:53.040 --> 02:47:53.670 align:start position:0%
would have met with tuesday with the ice
storm

02:47:53.670 --> 02:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
storm
 
02:47:54.950 --> 02:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
i know i'm not sure i would have wanted
 
02:47:57.349 --> 02:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
to drive and it was worse where you guys
 
02:47:58.870 --> 02:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
are than it was here
 
02:48:00.550 --> 02:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
we might not have had that meeting on
 
02:48:02.630 --> 02:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
tuesday if we hadn't had zoom
 
02:48:05.510 --> 02:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's right i think it's working really
 
02:48:06.309 --> 02:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
well i just
 
02:48:08.790 --> 02:48:08.800 align:start position:0%

karen can i ask you a question sure you
 
02:48:38.790 --> 02:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
know your chair
 
02:48:40.550 --> 02:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes i like to ask questions just
 
02:48:41.750 --> 02:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
because i want to know something a
 
02:48:43.429 --> 02:48:43.439 align:start position:0%
little bit more it's not necessarily
 
02:48:43.439 --> 02:48:43.990 align:start position:0%
little bit more it's not necessarily
related

02:48:43.990 --> 02:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
related
 
02:48:47.750 --> 02:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
to you know something specific in the
 
02:48:49.750 --> 02:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
the budget but it's something that
 
02:48:51.990 --> 02:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
provokes a question in my mind from the
 
02:48:53.910 --> 02:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
budget and sometimes it leads to an
 
02:48:55.510 --> 02:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
interesting conversation but i don't
 
02:48:57.910 --> 02:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
know how comfortable you are with that
 
02:48:59.750 --> 02:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
i'm comfortable with anything you want
 
02:49:00.550 --> 02:49:00.560 align:start position:0%

to whatever it is i'm not uh
 
02:49:14.309 --> 02:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not i'm not going to
 
02:49:16.389 --> 02:49:16.399 align:start position:0%
tell you not to ask something if it's
 
02:49:18.550 --> 02:49:18.560 align:start position:0%

oh you did okay well i'm sure he didn't
 
02:53:17.680 --> 02:53:21.190 align:start position:0%
oh you did okay well i'm sure he didn't
forget

02:53:21.190 --> 02:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:22.710 --> 02:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
i would ask can you tell me the page
 
02:53:24.070 --> 02:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
number again the governor's bill i'm
 
02:53:25.510 --> 02:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
trying to catch up to where you guys are
 
02:53:26.710 --> 02:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
i missed the number
 
02:53:29.830 --> 02:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
yeah page 596. oh thank you i was
 
02:53:31.990 --> 02:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
looking for that myself
 
02:53:38.309 --> 02:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
oh yeah
 
02:53:40.710 --> 02:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
mickey will talk to somebody over there
 
02:53:46.309 --> 02:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:49.429 --> 02:53:49.439 align:start position:0%
so let's see um
 
02:53:52.309 --> 02:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
i guess we're uh what's today today's
 
02:53:52.319 --> 02:53:53.429 align:start position:0%
i guess we're uh what's today today's
thursday

02:53:53.429 --> 02:53:53.439 align:start position:0%
thursday
 
02:53:57.269 --> 02:53:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh we're not meeting again until monday
 
02:54:01.110 --> 02:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
and monday we have uh safety and
 
02:54:04.070 --> 02:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
transportation coming in
 
02:54:08.870 --> 02:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
i think yeah yeah and um
 
02:54:11.990 --> 02:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
the 26th um
 
02:54:15.269 --> 02:54:15.279 align:start position:0%
we have the uh
 
02:54:17.269 --> 02:54:17.279 align:start position:0%
you is it the yeah the university
 
02:54:22.950 --> 02:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:26.230 --> 02:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
what i what i want to talk to them
 
02:54:29.910 --> 02:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
about is not so much their budget
 
02:54:33.590 --> 02:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
because i personally have no problem
 
02:54:36.309 --> 02:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
with what the governor has
 
02:54:40.070 --> 02:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
outlined in 2022
 
02:54:43.190 --> 02:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
but what i do want to talk about is
 
02:54:46.469 --> 02:54:46.479 align:start position:0%
this consolidation of
 
02:54:49.590 --> 02:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
the two systems and
 
02:54:53.269 --> 02:54:53.279 align:start position:0%
i am particularly interested of course
 
02:54:57.190 --> 02:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
in um what hb2 has to say
 
02:55:00.870 --> 02:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
about that but i know we all listened
 
02:55:00.880 --> 02:55:02.070 align:start position:0%
about that but i know we all listened
yesterday

02:55:02.070 --> 02:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
02:55:04.150 --> 02:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
and the governor sure didn't say much
 
02:55:07.190 --> 02:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
else than what he had said before
 
02:55:10.660 --> 02:55:10.670 align:start position:0%
um and so i uh i am
 
02:55:10.670 --> 02:55:12.150 align:start position:0%
um and so i uh i am
[Music]

02:55:12.150 --> 02:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:55:16.630 --> 02:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
i am a little nervous about how
 
02:55:19.750 --> 02:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
how we want to proceed with that and
 
02:55:22.790 --> 02:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
um when i was uh
 
02:55:26.710 --> 02:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
i was talking to catherine provencher
 
02:55:32.230 --> 02:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
um i guess you know i don't know
 
02:55:34.630 --> 02:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
we need we need to look very carefully
 
02:55:34.640 --> 02:55:36.070 align:start position:0%
we need we need to look very carefully
because

02:55:36.070 --> 02:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:55:38.950 --> 02:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
just by just combining the two boards
 
02:55:41.190 --> 02:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't solve anything
 
02:55:44.469 --> 02:55:44.479 align:start position:0%
because there's um you know there's all
 
02:55:45.349 --> 02:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
kinds of
 
02:55:49.190 --> 02:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh rsas that deal with the
 
02:55:53.190 --> 02:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
with the two two systems and
 
02:55:56.870 --> 02:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh you can't you can't just say voila
 
02:56:00.950 --> 02:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
without digging into and figuring out
 
02:56:03.670 --> 02:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
how all that's going to work and the
 
02:56:06.990 --> 02:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
other half of the problem is that in
 
02:56:11.269 --> 02:56:11.279 align:start position:0%
2023 the governor is only giving
 
02:56:14.710 --> 02:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
a pot of money uh to the
 
02:56:17.750 --> 02:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
to the two systems so it's
 
02:56:21.510 --> 02:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
um it's going to be very complicated for
 
02:56:24.550 --> 02:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
us and i have uh
 
02:56:28.309 --> 02:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
briefly spoken to um
 
02:56:32.070 --> 02:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
representative ladd to
 
02:56:34.950 --> 02:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
try to see what his thought process is
 
02:56:35.510 --> 02:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
on that
 
02:56:39.590 --> 02:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
because it is a huge policy issue
 
02:56:42.870 --> 02:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
and i think you also know that there is
 
02:56:46.150 --> 02:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
a public higher education
 
02:56:50.469 --> 02:56:50.479 align:start position:0%
committee uh mary are you on that or
 
02:56:53.510 --> 02:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
i was the last session yes okay well
 
02:56:55.110 --> 02:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
i've been appointed to that
 
02:56:57.590 --> 02:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
this time and i don't remember who the
 
02:56:59.030 --> 02:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
other person is
 
02:57:01.670 --> 02:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
um i didn't get appointed so i'm off i
 
02:57:03.429 --> 02:57:03.439 align:start position:0%
but it's a wonderful group
 
02:57:06.309 --> 02:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
yes i know i know so i don't know if we
 
02:57:07.670 --> 02:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
want to think about
 
02:57:10.710 --> 02:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
challenging them to put this together
 
02:57:15.510 --> 02:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:19.590 --> 02:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
what any any legislation that gets
 
02:57:19.600 --> 02:57:21.269 align:start position:0%
what any any legislation that gets
submitted

02:57:21.269 --> 02:57:21.279 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
02:57:23.670 --> 02:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
more than likely wouldn't be effective
 
02:57:23.680 --> 02:57:25.190 align:start position:0%
more than likely wouldn't be effective
until

02:57:25.190 --> 02:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
until
 
02:57:28.790 --> 02:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
1 july of 22
 
02:57:33.030 --> 02:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
which would put the both systems in kind
 
02:57:34.790 --> 02:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
of a
 
02:57:37.830 --> 02:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
a catch-22 so anyhow i just
 
02:57:40.870 --> 02:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
i would just like people to be um you
 
02:57:43.590 --> 02:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
know prepared for that discussion
 
02:57:46.389 --> 02:57:46.399 align:start position:0%
whatev wherever it leads because the
 
02:57:46.399 --> 02:57:46.950 align:start position:0%
whatev wherever it leads because the
governor

02:57:46.950 --> 02:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
governor
 
02:57:48.950 --> 02:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
didn't say you know he did say the
 
02:57:51.670 --> 02:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
legislature could say no
 
02:57:53.269 --> 02:57:53.279 align:start position:0%
you know this is potentially a
 
02:57:54.710 --> 02:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
multi-year process
 
02:57:56.150 --> 02:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
that it's not something that you just
 
02:57:58.150 --> 02:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
flip a switch and one they just
 
02:58:01.670 --> 02:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
go work together oh gee you think
 
02:58:04.790 --> 02:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
i agree multiple moving parts of house i
 
02:58:04.800 --> 02:58:05.190 align:start position:0%
i agree multiple moving parts of house i
would

02:58:05.190 --> 02:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:58:07.590 --> 02:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
i think it seems i would have expected
 
02:58:08.469 --> 02:58:08.479 align:start position:0%
there to be
 
02:58:10.950 --> 02:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
a like a process paper or a white paper
 
02:58:11.830 --> 02:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
to explain
 
02:58:13.990 --> 02:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
how this would work over time and i
 
02:58:15.910 --> 02:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
expect there may needs to be if we do
 
02:58:17.429 --> 02:58:17.439 align:start position:0%
this and it has some merit you know i'm
 
02:58:18.790 --> 02:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
open to listening to it
 
02:58:20.870 --> 02:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
yeah well um there may needs to be some
 
02:58:22.710 --> 02:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
expenditures in order to help
 
02:58:24.389 --> 02:58:24.399 align:start position:0%
pull these all these different elements
 
02:58:25.910 --> 02:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
together yeah
 
02:58:28.309 --> 02:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
well that's that's what our job is going
 
02:58:32.070 --> 02:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
to be to try to sort all that out
 
02:58:34.150 --> 02:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
that's why i asked that you get your
 
02:58:35.349 --> 02:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
thinking caps on
 
02:58:37.910 --> 02:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
so let us know if i could madam chair if
 
02:58:39.190 --> 02:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
i could bring us back to fishing game
 
02:58:40.150 --> 02:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
for one more second
 
02:58:42.150 --> 02:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
i didn't want to i did want to comment
 
02:58:43.349 --> 02:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
that one of the things that's in the
 
02:58:45.510 --> 02:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
budget that's extremely important to us
 
02:58:47.030 --> 02:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
in fish and game
 
02:58:49.910 --> 02:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
and has been a a contentious uh issue
 
02:58:49.920 --> 02:58:50.389 align:start position:0%
and has been a a contentious uh issue
for

02:58:50.389 --> 02:58:50.399 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:58:53.269 --> 02:58:53.279 align:start position:0%
many many years now is the powder mill
 
02:58:55.269 --> 02:58:55.279 align:start position:0%
fish hatchery
 
02:58:58.389 --> 02:58:58.399 align:start position:0%
they have designated money to do
 
02:59:01.990 --> 02:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
a fix to the outflow
 
02:59:03.990 --> 02:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh since fish and game is not here i
 
02:59:05.750 --> 02:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
guess i will take it upon myself to
 
02:59:08.389 --> 02:59:08.399 align:start position:0%
speak to that a little bit in fact that
 
02:59:11.590 --> 02:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
jim jim they are here oh okay great okay
 
02:59:13.030 --> 02:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
and i've been waiting for that
 
02:59:14.550 --> 02:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
in our department we've been waiting for
 
02:59:15.990 --> 02:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
that and we have constantly been
 
02:59:17.830 --> 02:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
answering questions from people on that
 
02:59:20.309 --> 02:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
and and we've finally seen a resolution
 
02:59:21.190 --> 02:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
and a
 
02:59:22.870 --> 02:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
an expenditure and we're happy to see
 
02:59:24.389 --> 02:59:24.399 align:start position:0%
that in our department
 
02:59:27.990 --> 02:59:28.000 align:start position:0%

due to covert 19 more and more people
 
03:00:26.630 --> 03:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
have chosen to recreate
 
03:00:29.190 --> 03:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
in the out of doors this year we've seen
 
03:00:30.070 --> 03:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
an increase
 
03:00:32.710 --> 03:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
in almost every service we provide to
 
03:00:34.550 --> 03:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
the people of new hampshire
 
03:00:36.389 --> 03:00:36.399 align:start position:0%
like all state agencies we have
 
03:00:38.309 --> 03:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
tightened our budgets due to the
 
03:00:41.030 --> 03:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
economic impacts that cobit
 
03:00:44.070 --> 03:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
is having on our state resources
 
03:00:46.230 --> 03:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
it will be very hard for us to meet all
 
03:00:48.550 --> 03:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
the historic needs and these increased
 
03:00:50.550 --> 03:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
needs that citizens are currently
 
03:00:53.110 --> 03:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
asking for with the budget that we have
 
03:00:53.120 --> 03:00:55.269 align:start position:0%
asking for with the budget that we have
proposed

03:00:55.269 --> 03:00:55.279 align:start position:0%
proposed

while i've only been here for a few
 
03:00:58.870 --> 03:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
short months it has become very apparent
 
03:00:59.590 --> 03:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
to me
 
03:01:01.429 --> 03:01:01.439 align:start position:0%
in this short period of time the

for taking my question um from
 
03:03:54.070 --> 03:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
my what you suggested is that a fishing
 
03:03:55.429 --> 03:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
game has had a
 
03:03:57.990 --> 03:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
really strong revenue could you just

talk
 
03:04:01.190 --> 03:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
about that a little bit how um what
 
03:04:01.200 --> 03:04:01.990 align:start position:0%
about that a little bit how um what
areas

areas
 
03:04:05.349 --> 03:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
that you saw the huge increases and how
 
03:04:09.190 --> 03:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
you um how you were able to
 
03:04:12.309 --> 03:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
uh provide uh support and resources
 
03:04:14.950 --> 03:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
for the um multitude of people that came
 
03:04:15.990 --> 03:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
through our state
 
03:04:17.750 --> 03:04:17.760 align:start position:0%

03:04:27.110 --> 03:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know when the pandemic struck in in
 
03:04:28.309 --> 03:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
the spring of the year
 
03:04:31.349 --> 03:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh we saw a marked increase in license
 
03:04:34.230 --> 03:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
you know license sales um that continued
 
03:04:35.269 --> 03:04:35.279 align:start position:0%
through the summer with
 
03:04:37.750 --> 03:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
increased uh atv and or i should say
 
03:04:37.760 --> 03:04:39.190 align:start position:0%
increased uh atv and or i should say

03:04:43.590 --> 03:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
that took place is we saw a marked
 
03:04:43.600 --> 03:04:44.230 align:start position:0%
that took place is we saw a marked
increase

03:04:44.230 --> 03:04:44.240 align:start position:0%

03:04:47.190 --> 03:04:47.200 align:start position:0%

03:04:47.830 --> 03:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
spring
 
03:04:51.190 --> 03:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
for those of you we have a spring
 
03:04:54.309 --> 03:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
turkey season so quite often folks that
 
03:04:55.830 --> 03:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
don't turkey hunt may wait till the end
 
03:04:57.190 --> 03:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
of the year to buy their license but
 
03:04:57.910 --> 03:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
this year
 
03:05:00.950 --> 03:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of them had time in the spring to
 
03:05:04.389 --> 03:05:04.399 align:start position:0%
try turkey hunting so we sold a large
 
03:05:06.469 --> 03:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
increase in not only turkey permits but
 
03:05:10.870 --> 03:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
also in hunting licenses in the spring
 
03:05:14.870 --> 03:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
um we
 
03:05:18.070 --> 03:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
we have healthy herds and flocks
 
03:05:19.830 --> 03:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire of the of our species
 
03:05:21.429 --> 03:05:21.439 align:start position:0%
that that are hunted
 
03:05:24.469 --> 03:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
um we have had uh we have a very decent
 
03:05:25.510 --> 03:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
program for our
 
03:05:28.389 --> 03:05:28.399 align:start position:0%
hatchery uh trout program and we have a
 
03:05:28.399 --> 03:05:28.790 align:start position:0%
hatchery uh trout program and we have a
good

03:05:28.790 --> 03:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:05:31.110 --> 03:05:31.120 align:start position:0%

03:05:34.309 --> 03:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
and i don't believe that the increased
 
03:05:38.230 --> 03:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
pressure has caused any negative impacts
 
03:05:40.389 --> 03:05:40.399 align:start position:0%
it certainly is an uptick but the other
 
03:05:42.389 --> 03:05:42.399 align:start position:0%
thing that goes on and anybody that
 
03:05:45.590 --> 03:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
hunts or fishes can explain to you
 
03:05:47.910 --> 03:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
if you don't have a it take it's not
 
03:05:49.429 --> 03:05:49.439 align:start position:0%
something that that
 
03:05:51.750 --> 03:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
you necessarily go do the first day and
 
03:05:53.750 --> 03:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
become very successful now there are
 
03:05:54.950 --> 03:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
there are times that you're very
 
03:05:56.870 --> 03:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
successful on that first day but
 
03:05:58.630 --> 03:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of times it takes you know
 
03:06:00.309 --> 03:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
multiple trips out to the woods before
 
03:06:02.469 --> 03:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
you actually get your first turkey
 
03:06:05.030 --> 03:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
um or fish or whatever whatever you're
 
03:06:06.710 --> 03:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
you're after
 
03:06:09.190 --> 03:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
um but the other thing that took place
 
03:06:10.710 --> 03:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
is with all these extra people in the
 
03:06:12.230 --> 03:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
woods that meant you know more people
 
03:06:13.349 --> 03:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
were out hiking
 
03:06:15.510 --> 03:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
and that meant we probably i haven't we
 
03:06:17.670 --> 03:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
have not run the actual final statistic
 
03:06:18.630 --> 03:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
so i would
 
03:06:20.550 --> 03:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
hesitate to say that we actually saw an
 
03:06:22.710 --> 03:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
uptick but we did seem to
 
03:06:24.469 --> 03:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
be spending a little bit more time
 
03:06:26.309 --> 03:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
looking for lost souls
 
03:06:30.389 --> 03:06:30.399 align:start position:0%
um and we had some um rather horrendous
 
03:06:33.510 --> 03:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
you know issues this this past summer uh
 
03:06:35.030 --> 03:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
with some of our lost
 
03:06:38.070 --> 03:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
goals in the woods um and uh that's
 
03:06:39.910 --> 03:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
continued into this year with i'm sure
 
03:06:41.750 --> 03:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
you guys read the newspapers about some
 
03:06:43.190 --> 03:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
of the accidents and some of the lost
 
03:06:44.710 --> 03:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
folks we've been dealing with
 
03:06:48.070 --> 03:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
through the winter um and
 
03:06:50.309 --> 03:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
it uh that does it you know it's an
 
03:06:52.710 --> 03:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
expensive process for fish and game to
 
03:06:57.349 --> 03:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
supply those services
 
03:07:02.150 --> 03:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:04.150 --> 03:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
yes i do thank you madam chair thank you
 
03:07:05.750 --> 03:07:05.760 align:start position:0%

03:07:13.750 --> 03:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
and how does that that that budget how
 
03:07:14.950 --> 03:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
does that look like
 
03:07:18.790 --> 03:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
as far as expenditures um
 
03:07:21.510 --> 03:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
we that was something else that we saw
 
03:07:23.030 --> 03:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
record sales on
 
03:07:24.790 --> 03:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you folks are familiar with the
 
03:07:26.230 --> 03:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
hike safe card
 
03:07:28.950 --> 03:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
and i don't kathy do you have the
 
03:07:29.830 --> 03:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
numbers pulled out
 
03:07:32.309 --> 03:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
i do actually i have the final report
 
03:07:34.309 --> 03:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
for search and rescue that was submitted
 
03:07:35.670 --> 03:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
to fiscal committee
 
03:07:38.630 --> 03:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
as of june 30th and i can do a breakdown
 
03:07:40.630 --> 03:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
of those revenues for you
 
03:07:43.269 --> 03:07:43.279 align:start position:0%
the hike safe card that was implemented
 
03:07:44.870 --> 03:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
a few years ago
 
03:07:47.190 --> 03:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
has enjoyed much more success than i
 
03:07:50.070 --> 03:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
think was originally anticipated
 
03:07:52.550 --> 03:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
and the hike safe card for fiscal year
 
03:07:52.560 --> 03:07:53.750 align:start position:0%
and the hike safe card for fiscal year
20

03:07:53.750 --> 03:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
20
 
03:07:58.590 --> 03:07:58.600 align:start position:0%
actually um brought in 165
 
03:08:02.550 --> 03:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
795 dollars in revenue
 
03:08:06.230 --> 03:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
the agency response fee which is that
 
03:08:09.429 --> 03:08:09.439 align:start position:0%
fee that is paid to us for people who
 
03:08:10.550 --> 03:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
have been deemed
 
03:08:14.389 --> 03:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
negligent that we have had to rescue
 
03:08:16.550 --> 03:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
was twenty two thousand four hundred
 
03:08:18.550 --> 03:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
twenty three dollars
 
03:08:20.870 --> 03:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
and the remaining balance which is fees
 
03:08:23.269 --> 03:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
and donations which is kind of a
 
03:08:26.150 --> 03:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
melting pot of course is one dollar for
 
03:08:26.160 --> 03:08:27.030 align:start position:0%
melting pot of course is one dollar for
every

03:08:27.030 --> 03:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
every
 
03:08:30.150 --> 03:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
snow machine and ohrv registration
 
03:08:32.790 --> 03:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
as well as every boat registration that
 
03:08:33.670 --> 03:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
goes into this
 
03:08:36.950 --> 03:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
pot and that was a hundred and ninety
 
03:08:36.960 --> 03:08:37.750 align:start position:0%
pot and that was a hundred and ninety
seven

03:08:37.750 --> 03:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
seven
 
03:08:40.950 --> 03:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars 184 dollars and fifty
 
03:08:40.960 --> 03:08:42.070 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars 184 dollars and fifty
cents

03:08:42.070 --> 03:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
cents
 
03:08:44.469 --> 03:08:44.479 align:start position:0%
so for the second year in a row the
 
03:08:45.990 --> 03:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
search and rescue account
 
03:08:49.110 --> 03:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
actually closed out in the positive
 
03:08:51.990 --> 03:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
which we have not seen in a very long
 
03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:53.190 align:start position:0%
which we have not seen in a very long
time

03:08:53.190 --> 03:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:08:55.429 --> 03:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
we closed out with a paul positive
 
03:08:58.670 --> 03:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
balance of 171
 
03:08:58.680 --> 03:09:01.030 align:start position:0%
balance of 171
708.35

03:09:01.030 --> 03:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
708.35
 
03:09:03.670 --> 03:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 20. and i brought this
 
03:09:05.429 --> 03:09:05.439 align:start position:0%
with me because there's
 
03:09:07.590 --> 03:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
always questions about search and rescue
 
03:09:11.349 --> 03:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
i know you're always interested in that
 
03:09:14.710 --> 03:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
and any representatives i was just going
 
03:09:16.710 --> 03:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
to point the committee to page 627 of
 
03:09:18.150 --> 03:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget document you'll
 
03:09:20.550 --> 03:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
see those figures that kathy just
 
03:09:23.030 --> 03:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh discussed for fiscal 20 so there's a
 
03:09:24.309 --> 03:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
separate accounting unit
 
03:09:27.110 --> 03:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh for search and rescue so just so you
 
03:09:27.120 --> 03:09:27.590 align:start position:0%
uh for search and rescue so just so you
can

03:09:27.590 --> 03:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:09:30.710 --> 03:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
crosswalk from her explanation to the
 
03:09:32.309 --> 03:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
budget document
 
03:09:37.110 --> 03:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:40.389 --> 03:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
kathy maybe you could uh forward that
 
03:09:45.110 --> 03:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
to um janet or mickey so that we can get
 
03:09:46.710 --> 03:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
that in the record
 
03:09:50.150 --> 03:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
because this is a uh so i mean it's
 
03:09:53.349 --> 03:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
so unusual to have this area actually in
 
03:09:55.110 --> 03:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
the plus column
 
03:09:57.910 --> 03:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
this document is actually a fiscal
 
03:10:00.150 --> 03:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
committee report that i file with the
 
03:10:04.550 --> 03:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee on a quarterly basis
 
03:10:06.710 --> 03:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
so it's already gone through the lba but
 
03:10:08.790 --> 03:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
if you would like for me to forward it
 
03:10:12.950 --> 03:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
over there again i can certainly do that
 
03:10:15.670 --> 03:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
yeah i would i would appreciate that so
 
03:10:15.680 --> 03:10:16.550 align:start position:0%
yeah i would i would appreciate that so
that

03:10:16.550 --> 03:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:10:18.550 --> 03:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
okay our our committee doesn't
 
03:10:20.070 --> 03:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily get
 
03:10:22.309 --> 03:10:22.319 align:start position:0%
all of the information that goes to
 
03:10:22.319 --> 03:10:23.190 align:start position:0%
all of the information that goes to
fiscal

03:10:23.190 --> 03:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
03:10:26.469 --> 03:10:26.479 align:start position:0%
so certainly yeah uh okay i need
 
03:10:28.550 --> 03:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
if i could i wanted to ask a question
 
03:10:30.469 --> 03:10:30.479 align:start position:0%
about the um
 
03:10:34.070 --> 03:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
the hike safe cards does this also
 
03:10:38.070 --> 03:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
cover skiers or it or do we have a
 
03:10:41.590 --> 03:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
similar program for skiers
 
03:10:44.309 --> 03:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
the back country people that seem to be
 
03:10:46.630 --> 03:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
having a lot of trouble this year
 
03:10:48.550 --> 03:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
we don't have a specific program for
 
03:10:50.070 --> 03:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
skiers but
 
03:10:52.870 --> 03:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
yes if a skier bought a hike safe car i
 
03:10:54.309 --> 03:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
mean part of
 
03:10:56.309 --> 03:10:56.319 align:start position:0%
back country skiing you know it's it's
 
03:10:58.070 --> 03:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's partially hiking it's partially
 
03:10:59.990 --> 03:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
skiing you know you're hiking up to ski
 
03:11:01.269 --> 03:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
back down
 
03:11:02.790 --> 03:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why they couldn't buy
 
03:11:07.110 --> 03:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:09.349 --> 03:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
the other thing and people don't
 
03:11:11.030 --> 03:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
understand sometimes but
 
03:11:13.110 --> 03:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
part of your hunting license and fishing
 
03:11:13.120 --> 03:11:14.150 align:start position:0%
part of your hunting license and fishing
license

03:11:14.150 --> 03:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
license
 
03:11:15.590 --> 03:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
and that's where fishing game gets
 
03:11:17.990 --> 03:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
started looking for people is is
 
03:11:19.670 --> 03:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
is they will go get you if you're out
 
03:11:21.269 --> 03:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
hunting fishing they'll they'll go find
 
03:11:21.990 --> 03:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
you if you don't come
 
03:11:25.110 --> 03:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
home and it it's
 
03:11:28.389 --> 03:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
um it's the best of our ability
 
03:11:30.950 --> 03:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
but that's included in the price of a
 
03:11:32.950 --> 03:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
hunting and fishing license so
 
03:11:35.830 --> 03:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
um if somebody has a fishing license
 
03:11:35.840 --> 03:11:36.309 align:start position:0%
um if somebody has a fishing license
then

03:11:36.309 --> 03:11:36.319 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:11:38.469 --> 03:11:38.479 align:start position:0%
they're somewhat protected under that
 
03:11:48.469 --> 03:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:54.070 --> 03:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:56.150 --> 03:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm sorry i didn't have my i was
 
03:11:57.110 --> 03:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
still on mute
 
03:11:58.790 --> 03:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative buco you have a
 
03:11:58.800 --> 03:12:01.030 align:start position:0%
uh representative buco you have a
question

03:12:01.030 --> 03:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:12:03.830 --> 03:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you manchester so i at my at
 
03:12:05.830 --> 03:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
first glance at the source of funds i
 
03:12:06.950 --> 03:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
see that
 
03:12:09.910 --> 03:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
um you've been able to cut down on the
 
03:12:11.510 --> 03:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
use of general funds by almost
 
03:12:11.520 --> 03:12:12.309 align:start position:0%
use of general funds by almost
two-thirds

03:12:12.309 --> 03:12:12.319 align:start position:0%
two-thirds
 
03:12:15.030 --> 03:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
and and more than made it up in uh fish
 
03:12:17.030 --> 03:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
and game funds and other funds
 
03:12:18.790 --> 03:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
so i was kind of surprised to hear you
 
03:12:20.309 --> 03:12:20.319 align:start position:0%
say that the department is
 
03:12:22.710 --> 03:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
severely challenged where where are you
 
03:12:23.830 --> 03:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
challenged with
 
03:12:26.950 --> 03:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
what sorts of funds are you are not
 
03:12:29.110 --> 03:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
making up
 
03:12:33.349 --> 03:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
um we are challenged in the fact that
 
03:12:35.750 --> 03:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
we probably need more cos than we
 
03:12:37.349 --> 03:12:37.359 align:start position:0%
currently staff
 
03:12:39.429 --> 03:12:39.439 align:start position:0%
and if we fill you know if we fill the
 
03:12:41.830 --> 03:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
open positions that we have in cos
 
03:12:43.429 --> 03:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
um we wouldn't be able to meet the
 
03:12:45.670 --> 03:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
budget targets that the governor had
 
03:12:47.349 --> 03:12:47.359 align:start position:0%
suggested to us
 
03:12:50.389 --> 03:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
um and some of some of our
 
03:12:52.309 --> 03:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
some of these other open staff positions
 
03:12:54.790 --> 03:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
that have gone unfunded over the years
 
03:12:59.429 --> 03:12:59.439 align:start position:0%
are are places where we should um
 
03:13:03.190 --> 03:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
try to seek funding but um
 
03:13:05.269 --> 03:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
with the budget crisis that we're
 
03:13:07.110 --> 03:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
looking at right now
 
03:13:09.030 --> 03:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
with uh you know coming off a covered
 
03:13:10.950 --> 03:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
knight you know covert 19
 
03:13:12.309 --> 03:13:12.319 align:start position:0%
i think it's you know like all
 
03:13:14.309 --> 03:13:14.319 align:start position:0%
departments we need to tighten our belts
 
03:13:17.269 --> 03:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
as best we can and keep going
 
03:13:20.469 --> 03:13:20.479 align:start position:0%
it also wasn't a
 
03:13:22.710 --> 03:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
like an open that we could just say we
 
03:13:24.790 --> 03:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
needed this much general funds we were
 
03:13:24.800 --> 03:13:25.670 align:start position:0%
needed this much general funds we were
provided

03:13:25.670 --> 03:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
provided
 
03:13:28.229 --> 03:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
a number of general funds this is all
 
03:13:29.590 --> 03:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
you can have
 
03:13:32.229 --> 03:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
and this is the governor's target dollar
 
03:13:35.030 --> 03:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
value of what you have to meet
 
03:13:38.229 --> 03:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
so you have to make your budget work
 
03:13:40.389 --> 03:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
and that is why we have those 10
 
03:13:43.269 --> 03:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions
 
03:13:46.550 --> 03:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:49.990 --> 03:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative
 
03:13:53.269 --> 03:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
murray you have a question yeah thank
 
03:13:55.269 --> 03:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
you i had some line item questions too i
 
03:13:55.990 --> 03:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
don't know if we should do
 
03:13:59.429 --> 03:13:59.439 align:start position:0%
that later on um but i guess right now i
 
03:14:01.110 --> 03:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
got a partial answer to it i think
 
03:14:01.120 --> 03:14:02.870 align:start position:0%
got a partial answer to it i think
before

03:14:02.870 --> 03:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:14:05.030 --> 03:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
you said that there's a 600 000 from
 
03:14:06.710 --> 03:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
03:14:09.590 --> 03:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
and in the budget i found the five
 
03:14:11.429 --> 03:14:11.439 align:start position:0%
hundred thousands but i can't find
 
03:14:12.950 --> 03:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
i'm missing the hundred thousand you
 
03:14:14.630 --> 03:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
said something about a match
 
03:14:15.990 --> 03:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
but where do i find that hundred
 
03:14:17.910 --> 03:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
thousand in the budget it's on
 
03:14:22.229 --> 03:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh it's on page 602 it's on the exact
 
03:14:24.870 --> 03:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
on the first page of the budget in
 
03:14:29.190 --> 03:14:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:33.510 --> 03:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
accounting unit which 5068
 
03:14:36.870 --> 03:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:40.150 --> 03:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
it's on sorry i was looking at one of my
 
03:14:41.349 --> 03:14:41.359 align:start position:0%
questions but it's on
 
03:14:44.389 --> 03:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh it's right at the very beginning okay
 
03:14:45.670 --> 03:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
at the very bottom of the page that's
 
03:14:47.269 --> 03:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
why i don't find that
 
03:14:51.349 --> 03:14:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:54.469 --> 03:14:54.479 align:start position:0%
so that went up from 50 to 100 000
 
03:14:54.479 --> 03:14:55.830 align:start position:0%
so that went up from 50 to 100 000
recently

03:14:55.830 --> 03:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
recently
 
03:14:55.840 --> 03:15:01.010 align:start position:0%
recently
yes

03:15:01.010 --> 03:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:01.020 --> 03:15:03.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:15:03.510 --> 03:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:15:04.950 --> 03:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
murray go ahead with your other
 
03:15:07.269 --> 03:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
questions is um
 
03:15:16.469 --> 03:15:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:18.710 --> 03:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
can you speak to the debt service this
 
03:15:21.030 --> 03:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
is on page 603
 
03:15:24.309 --> 03:15:24.319 align:start position:0%
um it's gone down significantly um
 
03:15:28.389 --> 03:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
just a word about how that is going
 
03:15:31.910 --> 03:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
well the reason for that is there was
 
03:15:34.950 --> 03:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
two or three bienniums that we did not
 
03:15:38.229 --> 03:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
put in any capital budget request
 
03:15:41.030 --> 03:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is we knew that
 
03:15:42.389 --> 03:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
we were not going to
 
03:15:44.710 --> 03:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
have the funding to pay those 20-year
 
03:15:46.389 --> 03:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
bonds back
 
03:15:50.070 --> 03:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
so for this biennium i reduced our
 
03:15:52.710 --> 03:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
debt service it will definitely go up in
 
03:15:55.030 --> 03:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
the next biennium we've had
 
03:15:57.190 --> 03:15:57.200 align:start position:0%
for this past biennium we have had
 
03:15:59.110 --> 03:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
capital budget requests out there and we
 
03:15:59.120 --> 03:15:59.990 align:start position:0%
capital budget requests out there and we
certainly

03:15:59.990 --> 03:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
03:16:01.190 --> 03:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
have a big one out there that we're
 
03:16:03.269 --> 03:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
requesting now in this
 
03:16:04.950 --> 03:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
new biennium coming up for the powder
 
03:16:10.150 --> 03:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:14.150 --> 03:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you on 610 contracts for program
 
03:16:16.790 --> 03:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
services is am i on the right line
 
03:16:18.150 --> 03:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
yeah what was that that's gone away
 
03:16:19.910 --> 03:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
completely is that something that you
 
03:16:21.269 --> 03:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
were cutting that you didn't want to go
 
03:16:22.550 --> 03:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
away or is that a
 
03:16:25.590 --> 03:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
program that's simply gone actually
 
03:16:27.030 --> 03:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
class 102
 
03:16:30.389 --> 03:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
uh das informed us that class 102 is not
 
03:16:32.469 --> 03:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
an appropriate class to use for what we
 
03:16:34.870 --> 03:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
were using it for class 103 is more
 
03:16:34.880 --> 03:16:35.990 align:start position:0%
were using it for class 103 is more
appropriate

03:16:35.990 --> 03:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
03:16:38.389 --> 03:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
so if you go through our budget anywhere
 
03:16:40.790 --> 03:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
any accounting unit that had a class 102
 
03:16:42.469 --> 03:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
we have zeroed them out in
 
03:16:51.750 --> 03:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:56.830 --> 03:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:58.630 --> 03:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
615 where that
 
03:17:02.070 --> 03:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
where's that 360 000 coming from on
 
03:17:05.990 --> 03:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
intra-agency transfer 0-9
 
03:17:07.349 --> 03:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
that's new i assume it's coming from
 
03:17:10.469 --> 03:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
someplace else but i wasn't able to
 
03:17:13.110 --> 03:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
that is the same type of class line
 
03:17:14.630 --> 03:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
switch if you look down
 
03:17:20.309 --> 03:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
on class 217 interagency payments
 
03:17:23.670 --> 03:17:23.680 align:start position:0%
for fiscal years 20 and 21 there was
 
03:17:27.750 --> 03:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
a large expense there and for 22 and 23
 
03:17:30.389 --> 03:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
it is zeroed out that expense went up to
 
03:17:32.469 --> 03:17:32.479 align:start position:0%
class 29.
 
03:17:35.670 --> 03:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
thank you and
 
03:17:37.670 --> 03:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh what land acquisition and easements
 
03:17:39.110 --> 03:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
do you do
 
03:17:41.510 --> 03:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's 6 17. i said that's in the budget
 
03:17:43.429 --> 03:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
from last time and before it's gone up
 
03:17:45.269 --> 03:17:45.279 align:start position:0%
but can you speak about your program for
 
03:17:49.429 --> 03:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:53.510 --> 03:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh do you want to speak to that or
 
03:17:56.389 --> 03:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
we have an active program um where we
 
03:17:56.399 --> 03:17:57.190 align:start position:0%
we have an active program um where we
purchase

03:17:57.190 --> 03:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
purchase
 
03:17:59.349 --> 03:17:59.359 align:start position:0%
usually we're purchasing easements but
 
03:18:01.670 --> 03:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's in fee
 
03:18:04.710 --> 03:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
um and the purpose is usually to
 
03:18:06.389 --> 03:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
uh protect have you know crucial
 
03:18:08.229 --> 03:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
habitats in the state
 
03:18:11.510 --> 03:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
um it also one of the requirements we do
 
03:18:11.520 --> 03:18:11.830 align:start position:0%
um it also one of the requirements we do
is

03:18:11.830 --> 03:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:18:15.670 --> 03:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
is that it when we put an easement on a
 
03:18:16.790 --> 03:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
piece of property
 
03:18:19.429 --> 03:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
it will allow for public trespass
 
03:18:22.790 --> 03:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
including hunting fishing and traffic
 
03:18:25.990 --> 03:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
unless we're in a very specific
 
03:18:27.670 --> 03:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
habitat where we're trying to protect
 
03:18:29.349 --> 03:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
some you know an endangered species or
 
03:18:29.359 --> 03:18:30.229 align:start position:0%
some you know an endangered species or
something

03:18:30.229 --> 03:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:18:32.550 --> 03:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
where that type of trespass would
 
03:18:35.190 --> 03:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
threaten the species at that question
 
03:18:37.429 --> 03:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
thank you and one last thing you weren't
 
03:18:38.469 --> 03:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
here i don't know if you were here the
 
03:18:39.830 --> 03:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
last time can you update me on the
 
03:18:41.750 --> 03:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
blending turtles and the cottontails i
 
03:18:43.269 --> 03:18:43.279 align:start position:0%
see that those programs are
 
03:18:45.830 --> 03:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
zeroed out now i worry about those
 
03:18:45.840 --> 03:18:48.870 align:start position:0%
zeroed out now i worry about those
turtles

03:18:48.870 --> 03:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:51.670 --> 03:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
um i'm afraid i wasn't here last year so
 
03:18:52.790 --> 03:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what was
 
03:18:56.309 --> 03:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
said last year state wildlife grants
 
03:18:58.070 --> 03:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
are a little bit different than a
 
03:19:00.550 --> 03:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
regular ongoing appropriation of
 
03:19:02.630 --> 03:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
pr and dj grants meaning they are
 
03:19:04.070 --> 03:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
competitive grants
 
03:19:06.389 --> 03:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
at the federal level and they were given
 
03:19:07.590 --> 03:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
out specifically
 
03:19:10.630 --> 03:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
for those programs and the grants that
 
03:19:13.190 --> 03:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
we received were named specifically new
 
03:19:15.269 --> 03:19:15.279 align:start position:0%
england cottontail and blandings
 
03:19:17.590 --> 03:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
that does not mean in any way that we
 
03:19:20.389 --> 03:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
are not continuing work on those species
 
03:19:22.550 --> 03:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
we just do not have a specific grant
 
03:19:24.389 --> 03:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
named for that species
 
03:19:26.870 --> 03:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
at this point in time so don't you worry
 
03:19:29.670 --> 03:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
about the turtles or the cottontails
 
03:19:31.110 --> 03:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you madam
 
03:19:33.349 --> 03:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
chair for letting me go on here
 
03:19:36.630 --> 03:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
not a problem representative petry
 
03:19:38.070 --> 03:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mayor chair and thank you
 
03:19:39.910 --> 03:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh
 
03:19:41.910 --> 03:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
of course we know we got stars with uh
 
03:19:43.110 --> 03:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
on northwoods law
 
03:19:45.110 --> 03:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
how much revenue do we recognize from
 
03:19:45.120 --> 03:19:46.710 align:start position:0%
how much revenue do we recognize from
that

03:19:46.710 --> 03:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:19:50.870 --> 03:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
the state doesn't um each
 
03:19:54.469 --> 03:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
episode i believe pays a fee of 2500
 
03:19:56.790 --> 03:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
and that goes to the new hampshire
 
03:19:58.710 --> 03:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
wildlife heritage
 
03:20:02.870 --> 03:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh foundation they in turn
 
03:20:05.910 --> 03:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
write grants to fish and game they they
 
03:20:08.150 --> 03:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
also do other fundraisers
 
03:20:10.950 --> 03:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh you know besides that but they all
 
03:20:12.550 --> 03:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
then they turn around and write grants
 
03:20:14.469 --> 03:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
specifically to new hampshire
 
03:20:17.590 --> 03:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
fish and game for specific issues
 
03:20:20.469 --> 03:20:20.479 align:start position:0%
they underwrite our canine program very
 
03:20:20.479 --> 03:20:21.670 align:start position:0%
they underwrite our canine program very
heavily

03:20:21.670 --> 03:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
heavily
 
03:20:24.389 --> 03:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
search and rescue issues you know maybe
 
03:20:24.399 --> 03:20:25.830 align:start position:0%
search and rescue issues you know maybe
equipment

03:20:25.830 --> 03:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
03:20:27.269 --> 03:20:27.279 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff as well as it could
 
03:20:29.670 --> 03:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
be programming now going back to the new
 
03:20:32.229 --> 03:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
england cottontail
 
03:20:36.070 --> 03:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh you're pushing my ability
 
03:20:38.710 --> 03:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
there is a disease that's running
 
03:20:40.389 --> 03:20:40.399 align:start position:0%
through rabbits right now
 
03:20:42.550 --> 03:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
and we're putting up a boundary fence
 
03:20:43.429 --> 03:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
around uh
 
03:20:45.269 --> 03:20:45.279 align:start position:0%
one of our facilities that does research
 
03:20:47.990 --> 03:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
on a new england cottontail
 
03:20:51.349 --> 03:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
and and the foundation paid for it
 
03:20:54.469 --> 03:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
wrote a grant to do that one of the
 
03:20:57.349 --> 03:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
other very successful programs they did
 
03:20:57.359 --> 03:21:00.710 align:start position:0%
other very successful programs they did
um

03:21:00.710 --> 03:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:03.750 --> 03:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
at our hatcheries um
 
03:21:06.710 --> 03:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
basically uh what what's gone on is is
 
03:21:06.720 --> 03:21:07.429 align:start position:0%
basically uh what what's gone on is is
it

03:21:07.429 --> 03:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:21:10.790 --> 03:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
um basically they've granted us money to
 
03:21:12.710 --> 03:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
build greenhouse structures over our
 
03:21:12.720 --> 03:21:14.070 align:start position:0%
build greenhouse structures over our
raceways

03:21:14.070 --> 03:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
raceways
 
03:21:16.389 --> 03:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
and on on these instead of having like
 
03:21:18.150 --> 03:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
like plastic like you'd see in a plant
 
03:21:18.160 --> 03:21:19.190 align:start position:0%
like plastic like you'd see in a plant
greenhouse

03:21:19.190 --> 03:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
greenhouse
 
03:21:22.389 --> 03:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
on the pipes it's actually netting
 
03:21:24.870 --> 03:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
and this is used to keep uh wild uh
 
03:21:27.429 --> 03:21:27.439 align:start position:0%
predators out of our hatcheries and it's
 
03:21:30.389 --> 03:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's made a huge difference
 
03:21:31.670 --> 03:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
made a huge difference almost a ten
 
03:21:33.429 --> 03:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
percent difference in survivability of
 
03:21:35.830 --> 03:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
our trout running through the hatcheries
 
03:21:38.070 --> 03:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
um so they've done they underwrite a lot
 
03:21:41.910 --> 03:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:44.150 --> 03:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative lynn you had a question
 
03:21:45.269 --> 03:21:45.279 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
03:21:47.349 --> 03:21:47.359 align:start position:0%
madam chair um yeah i wonder if i could
 
03:21:48.550 --> 03:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
ask um
 
03:21:52.309 --> 03:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
on page 617 towards the bottom
 
03:21:57.030 --> 03:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
the uh classification 217
 
03:21:59.190 --> 03:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
the interagency transfer there it went
 
03:22:00.070 --> 03:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
from 300
 
03:22:02.389 --> 03:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
000 to 493 i'm just wondering is that
 
03:22:04.070 --> 03:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
another one where
 
03:22:06.070 --> 03:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
classification is just a classification
 
03:22:06.080 --> 03:22:15.110 align:start position:0%
classification is just a classification
change

03:22:15.110 --> 03:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:19.349 --> 03:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry are we looking at the on 217
 
03:22:23.510 --> 03:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay page 617 yeah uh
 
03:22:26.630 --> 03:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
down towards the bottom line 217 i think
 
03:22:29.110 --> 03:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
it goes from
 
03:22:31.190 --> 03:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
300 am i reading that correctly it goes
 
03:22:34.229 --> 03:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
from 300 000. to
 
03:22:38.389 --> 03:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
uh well i'm sorry i'm i'm reading
 
03:22:41.349 --> 03:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
four it's research i guess maybe i'm
 
03:22:43.030 --> 03:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
sorry it's research and management is
 
03:22:46.309 --> 03:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
that correct it goes from 300 000 to 493
 
03:22:49.110 --> 03:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
that is correct and we actually fund a
 
03:22:49.590 --> 03:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
03:22:54.150 --> 03:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:56.630 --> 03:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of research contracts especially
 
03:22:58.070 --> 03:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
with unh
 
03:23:02.150 --> 03:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
and other partners
 
03:23:03.990 --> 03:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
so have you ever may have asked a
 
03:23:04.000 --> 03:23:05.910 align:start position:0%
so have you ever may have asked a
follow-up

03:23:05.910 --> 03:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:23:08.870 --> 03:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
certainly yeah so in other words i so
 
03:23:09.910 --> 03:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
03:23:13.030 --> 03:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
almost a 200 000 increase in that could
 
03:23:13.510 --> 03:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
you just
 
03:23:16.469 --> 03:23:16.479 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about what that's for
 
03:23:18.150 --> 03:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
i would not be the expert
 
03:23:20.469 --> 03:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
sir to talk about that that would be
 
03:23:22.870 --> 03:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
more the wildlife division chief
 
03:23:25.429 --> 03:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
um i'm not the expert on the wildlife
 
03:23:27.110 --> 03:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
habitat account
 
03:23:30.389 --> 03:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
and when we when we
 
03:23:32.229 --> 03:23:32.239 align:start position:0%
do budget i can say this when we do
 
03:23:34.349 --> 03:23:34.359 align:start position:0%
budget we it we have
 
03:23:37.750 --> 03:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
anticipated future expenditures
 
03:23:40.630 --> 03:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
based on what we think potentially could
 
03:23:40.640 --> 03:23:41.269 align:start position:0%
based on what we think potentially could
be

03:23:41.269 --> 03:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:23:44.469 --> 03:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
coming down the pipeline
 
03:23:48.550 --> 03:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
i do know that we use this class line
 
03:23:50.950 --> 03:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
for a lot of rental equipment a lot of
 
03:23:52.550 --> 03:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
on the ground work
 
03:23:57.990 --> 03:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
at our wildlife management areas
 
03:24:00.630 --> 03:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
be happy to uh sit down and chat with
 
03:24:01.590 --> 03:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
the wildlife
 
03:24:03.990 --> 03:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
chief and we'll get back to you with a
 
03:24:06.229 --> 03:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
exact answer we we could do that
 
03:24:07.990 --> 03:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
okay yeah that would be that would be
 
03:24:11.510 --> 03:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:14.070 --> 03:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh did you have anything else
 
03:24:15.349 --> 03:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
representative lynn
 
03:24:18.630 --> 03:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
i i did not thank you very much okay
 
03:24:21.910 --> 03:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative petry i think you were
 
03:24:21.920 --> 03:24:23.349 align:start position:0%
uh representative petry i think you were
next

03:24:23.349 --> 03:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
next
 
03:24:25.269 --> 03:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thank you for
 
03:24:27.269 --> 03:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
taking my next question
 
03:24:30.710 --> 03:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh windmills and bird strikes do we
 
03:24:34.070 --> 03:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
record how many birds we take out
 
03:24:37.349 --> 03:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
are they reported to you and what is
 
03:24:38.389 --> 03:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
your budget
 
03:24:40.309 --> 03:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
is that a big budget or i don't imagine
 
03:24:42.070 --> 03:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
would be a big one but uh is there a
 
03:24:44.389 --> 03:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
cost involved
 
03:24:46.389 --> 03:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
i don't believe i know anything about
 
03:24:47.590 --> 03:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
that yeah i i
 
03:24:50.870 --> 03:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
once again i'm afraid i don't know um
 
03:24:53.190 --> 03:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
an answer to the question let me speak
 
03:24:54.630 --> 03:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
to our folks i know
 
03:24:58.630 --> 03:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
um once again let me speak to my
 
03:25:00.070 --> 03:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
wildlife department i'll get back to you
 
03:25:01.349 --> 03:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
with an answer on that
 
03:25:05.030 --> 03:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative heath
 
03:25:08.389 --> 03:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
you had a question
 
03:25:12.790 --> 03:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
um my my question is on um page 634
 
03:25:15.269 --> 03:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
and it's not a big increase but i'm more
 
03:25:16.790 --> 03:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
curious about the overall
 
03:25:19.910 --> 03:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
um line item um it's
 
03:25:23.429 --> 03:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
um statewide public boat access
 
03:25:25.750 --> 03:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
and everything we've gone through um i
 
03:25:27.990 --> 03:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
see it's it's an increase of um
 
03:25:31.030 --> 03:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
just about 60 000 but
 
03:25:34.950 --> 03:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
um it seems like there'd be more um
 
03:25:38.389 --> 03:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
action around that line um considering
 
03:25:39.349 --> 03:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
the number of
 
03:25:42.309 --> 03:25:42.319 align:start position:0%
tourists and and people that are using
 
03:25:44.950 --> 03:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
those public boat accesses right now can
 
03:25:47.429 --> 03:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
you just describe what's happening how
 
03:25:48.550 --> 03:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
did it go
 
03:25:51.510 --> 03:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
um did you see huge increases over the
 
03:25:51.520 --> 03:25:51.990 align:start position:0%
um did you see huge increases over the
summer

03:25:51.990 --> 03:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
summer
 
03:25:56.229 --> 03:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
did it work well or did it have problems
 
03:25:59.349 --> 03:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
yes it worked well yes we saw increases
 
03:26:00.790 --> 03:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
yes we have problems yes we have
 
03:26:02.389 --> 03:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
problems um
 
03:26:05.750 --> 03:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
other than that no no uh
 
03:26:08.229 --> 03:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
that's funded when somebody registers
 
03:26:09.590 --> 03:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
their boat
 
03:26:11.910 --> 03:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
so unless boat you know when boat
 
03:26:13.590 --> 03:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
registration numbers change
 
03:26:16.389 --> 03:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
that's that's how that funds out to us
 
03:26:16.399 --> 03:26:17.670 align:start position:0%
that's that's how that funds out to us
um

03:26:17.670 --> 03:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:20.790 --> 03:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
so if you register your boat and use it
 
03:26:20.800 --> 03:26:21.510 align:start position:0%
so if you register your boat and use it
once

03:26:21.510 --> 03:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
once
 
03:26:23.030 --> 03:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter how many times you use
 
03:26:25.110 --> 03:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
it so um
 
03:26:26.550 --> 03:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
in the year like last year i'm sure
 
03:26:28.150 --> 03:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
people got out and did a lot more with
 
03:26:29.110 --> 03:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
their boats
 
03:26:31.349 --> 03:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
than they normally do so it increased it
 
03:26:31.359 --> 03:26:32.389 align:start position:0%
than they normally do so it increased it
um

03:26:32.389 --> 03:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:34.389 --> 03:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
the other issue that shows up is is we
 
03:26:36.870 --> 03:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
had a lot of non-boaters i mean
 
03:26:39.590 --> 03:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
a boat ramp becomes a access to water
 
03:26:40.870 --> 03:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
for people that aren't
 
03:26:45.269 --> 03:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
um boating and uh um
 
03:26:48.469 --> 03:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
we the other source of income is
 
03:26:51.349 --> 03:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
is is a we use this we use the money
 
03:26:52.550 --> 03:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
coming in from the boat
 
03:26:54.710 --> 03:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
registrations as a state match with
 
03:26:55.670 --> 03:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
federal money
 
03:26:58.550 --> 03:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
when we take the federal money one of
 
03:27:00.150 --> 03:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
the strings that's attached to that
 
03:27:01.830 --> 03:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
is the only thing that can take place at
 
03:27:03.910 --> 03:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
a boat landing is let you know
 
03:27:06.070 --> 03:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
launching boats and recovering boats not
 
03:27:07.590 --> 03:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
you know it's not a place to go swimming
 
03:27:09.030 --> 03:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
it's not a place for fishing
 
03:27:11.110 --> 03:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
et cetera et cetera so we have to
 
03:27:12.790 --> 03:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
actually make sure that that
 
03:27:15.990 --> 03:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
activity doesn't take place um
 
03:27:18.070 --> 03:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
which can create some issues from time
 
03:27:20.229 --> 03:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
to time but at the end of the day we've
 
03:27:22.469 --> 03:27:22.479 align:start position:0%
been able to live with it pretty well
 
03:27:26.950 --> 03:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
um and and try to get people to go to
 
03:27:28.469 --> 03:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
other places
 
03:27:30.870 --> 03:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
our basic issue is if it's not a safety
 
03:27:32.790 --> 03:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
issue then we try not to
 
03:27:34.710 --> 03:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
you know be too aggressive in the
 
03:27:36.790 --> 03:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement of it but if it becomes a
 
03:27:38.550 --> 03:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
safety issue then we really do need to
 
03:27:38.560 --> 03:27:40.070 align:start position:0%
safety issue then we really do need to
be

03:27:40.070 --> 03:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:27:42.550 --> 03:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh excuse let me interrupt just a second
 
03:27:43.510 --> 03:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
03:27:46.070 --> 03:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh are there any capital projects this
 
03:27:48.309 --> 03:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
year for boat ramps or are we
 
03:27:51.030 --> 03:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
um we're finishing one up on alton bay
 
03:27:51.990 --> 03:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's not a capital
 
03:27:55.030 --> 03:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry no i'm not a catholic
 
03:27:58.070 --> 03:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
my my mistake we are finishing up a
 
03:27:58.080 --> 03:27:58.790 align:start position:0%
my my mistake we are finishing up a
large

03:27:58.790 --> 03:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
large
 
03:28:01.510 --> 03:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
boat landing at alton bay it's not a
 
03:28:03.030 --> 03:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
capital project
 
03:28:05.910 --> 03:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
um but it it is over a million dollars
 
03:28:07.269 --> 03:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
so it's a public
 
03:28:11.269 --> 03:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
um works right it is going through dpw
 
03:28:13.990 --> 03:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
yes and that's one of our bigger
 
03:28:15.590 --> 03:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
projects that i think we've done on boat
 
03:28:15.600 --> 03:28:17.349 align:start position:0%
projects that i think we've done on boat
landings

03:28:17.349 --> 03:28:17.359 align:start position:0%
landings
 
03:28:19.110 --> 03:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
um i believe we've got two other boat
 
03:28:20.870 --> 03:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
landings that they'll be working on this
 
03:28:20.880 --> 03:28:21.910 align:start position:0%
landings that they'll be working on this
year

03:28:21.910 --> 03:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:28:23.910 --> 03:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
but they're much smaller in size and
 
03:28:23.920 --> 03:28:27.349 align:start position:0%
but they're much smaller in size and
steel

03:28:27.349 --> 03:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:29.750 --> 03:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
repairs and you know one of the problems
 
03:28:31.349 --> 03:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
that happens with boat launches
 
03:28:33.349 --> 03:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
you know sand moves in so we we're
 
03:28:35.110 --> 03:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
constantly out doing
 
03:28:36.870 --> 03:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
even minor repairs but and then of
 
03:28:39.429 --> 03:28:39.439 align:start position:0%
course sometimes you're out there
 
03:28:41.269 --> 03:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
quite often these boat launches are
 
03:28:42.469 --> 03:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
either plank
 
03:28:45.510 --> 03:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
or or concrete ties that are
 
03:28:47.269 --> 03:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
that are chained or roped together and
 
03:28:49.110 --> 03:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
we need to get in and you know do some
 
03:28:50.830 --> 03:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
maintenance and whatnot on some of the
 
03:28:50.840 --> 03:28:52.710 align:start position:0%
maintenance and whatnot on some of the
structures

03:28:52.710 --> 03:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
structures
 
03:28:54.630 --> 03:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
03:28:54.640 --> 03:28:56.309 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
murray

03:28:56.309 --> 03:28:56.319 align:start position:0%
murray
 
03:28:58.469 --> 03:28:58.479 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i have my hike
 
03:29:00.710 --> 03:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
state cards by the way my husband and i
 
03:29:03.830 --> 03:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
have our hike safe so um since we're on
 
03:29:06.309 --> 03:29:06.319 align:start position:0%
the public boat access i've well one
 
03:29:07.590 --> 03:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
question there and then just another
 
03:29:07.600 --> 03:29:08.389 align:start position:0%
question there and then just another
question

03:29:08.389 --> 03:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:29:10.070 --> 03:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
what do the consultants do you've got an
 
03:29:12.229 --> 03:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
uptick in consultancy fees here
 
03:29:13.510 --> 03:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
can you give an example of what the
 
03:29:15.910 --> 03:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
consultants do and my second question
 
03:29:17.990 --> 03:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
is can you address your your federal
 
03:29:19.990 --> 03:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
funds is that a reliable source of
 
03:29:22.070 --> 03:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
funding i know that some agencies stress
 
03:29:23.510 --> 03:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
what the federal government's going to
 
03:29:23.520 --> 03:29:24.229 align:start position:0%
what the federal government's going to
do

03:29:24.229 --> 03:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:29:26.150 --> 03:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
um are the federal funds that come to
 
03:29:28.070 --> 03:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
you are you are they
 
03:29:30.309 --> 03:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
do you feel secure and the federal
 
03:29:32.150 --> 03:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
funding in terms of how that money comes
 
03:29:32.630 --> 03:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
to you
 
03:29:34.630 --> 03:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
do you think let me know does that make
 
03:29:35.750 --> 03:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
sense do you understand what i'm trying
 
03:29:36.389 --> 03:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
to ask
 
03:29:38.950 --> 03:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely and the federal funds
 
03:29:39.750 --> 03:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
are very
 
03:29:41.510 --> 03:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
elegant to the second part first the
 
03:29:43.429 --> 03:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
federal funding is very secure
 
03:29:47.269 --> 03:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
it's part of our um uh dj funds right
 
03:29:48.150 --> 03:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
bengal johnson
 
03:29:50.870 --> 03:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
part of idj funds they are very secure
 
03:29:52.870 --> 03:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
it's an annual apportionment
 
03:29:55.510 --> 03:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
from the feds every every year the
 
03:29:56.630 --> 03:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
reason why
 
03:29:59.110 --> 03:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
you see an uptick in class 46 the only
 
03:30:01.110 --> 03:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
thing that line is used for
 
03:30:03.429 --> 03:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
is a contract with our engineering
 
03:30:03.439 --> 03:30:04.870 align:start position:0%
is a contract with our engineering
consultants

03:30:04.870 --> 03:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
consultants
 
03:30:06.870 --> 03:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
and every couple years we do go out to
 
03:30:08.309 --> 03:30:08.319 align:start position:0%
bid for that
 
03:30:11.830 --> 03:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
and the reason why it's 125 000 in the
 
03:30:13.670 --> 03:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
first year of this budget is
 
03:30:16.630 --> 03:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
for the project at alton bay the
 
03:30:19.030 --> 03:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
downings landing project
 
03:30:20.790 --> 03:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
that is going to be coming in as the
 
03:30:22.870 --> 03:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
director said it over a million dollars
 
03:30:25.110 --> 03:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
between the federal funds and the state
 
03:30:27.110 --> 03:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
match it's a very large project there's
 
03:30:28.950 --> 03:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot of engineering fees
 
03:30:34.630 --> 03:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:37.670 --> 03:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
i would record you all for those of you
 
03:30:39.429 --> 03:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
that are familiar where
 
03:30:41.750 --> 03:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
you know as you come up route 16 when
 
03:30:43.190 --> 03:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
you first start seeing the waters of
 
03:30:45.590 --> 03:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
lake winnipesaukee right there in alton
 
03:30:48.469 --> 03:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
um the the east side of the lake that's
 
03:30:49.910 --> 03:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
where this piece of property is it's
 
03:30:52.070 --> 03:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
right at the very beginning of the lake
 
03:30:54.790 --> 03:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
and it um it's a beautiful piece of
 
03:30:54.800 --> 03:30:55.910 align:start position:0%
and it um it's a beautiful piece of
property

03:30:55.910 --> 03:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
property
 
03:30:57.510 --> 03:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
and it was a great opportunity the
 
03:30:59.110 --> 03:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
fishing game was able to purchase it a
 
03:31:00.469 --> 03:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
few years ago
 
03:31:02.790 --> 03:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
and we've been kind of pitching away at
 
03:31:04.309 --> 03:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
building the land and this
 
03:31:06.630 --> 03:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
this summer we hope to finish it and i
 
03:31:07.990 --> 03:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
encourage you all if you're in that
 
03:31:09.670 --> 03:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
neighborhood to stop by and take a quick
 
03:31:09.680 --> 03:31:10.309 align:start position:0%
neighborhood to stop by and take a quick
peek

03:31:10.309 --> 03:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
peek
 
03:31:12.469 --> 03:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
it's very critical that we hold on to
 
03:31:13.830 --> 03:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
our boat access
 
03:31:16.309 --> 03:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
funds in the dedicated account because
 
03:31:17.990 --> 03:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
we're counting on those to pay for this
 
03:31:18.000 --> 03:31:22.150 align:start position:0%
we're counting on those to pay for this
project

03:31:22.150 --> 03:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:24.309 --> 03:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
representative lynn you had a question
 
03:31:26.469 --> 03:31:26.479 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you madam chair um
 
03:31:29.030 --> 03:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner murray i wonder um you
 
03:31:30.790 --> 03:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh with regard to the ten
 
03:31:34.309 --> 03:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
positions that you uh that um are
 
03:31:36.710 --> 03:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
are vacant and unfunded could you just
 
03:31:37.429 --> 03:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
tell us
 
03:31:40.389 --> 03:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
how long how long have those positions
 
03:31:43.910 --> 03:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:46.229 --> 03:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
i don't have that information in front
 
03:31:47.110 --> 03:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
of me
 
03:31:51.110 --> 03:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
um i can okay i can give you a
 
03:31:54.389 --> 03:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
uh round idea the
 
03:31:56.950 --> 03:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
four conservation officers have been
 
03:31:56.960 --> 03:31:59.110 align:start position:0%
four conservation officers have been
vacant

03:31:59.110 --> 03:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
vacant
 
03:32:02.710 --> 03:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
for at least the last three bienniums
 
03:32:05.750 --> 03:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
so for several years
 
03:32:09.030 --> 03:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
the two positions in our public affairs
 
03:32:09.040 --> 03:32:09.990 align:start position:0%
the two positions in our public affairs
division

03:32:09.990 --> 03:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
division
 
03:32:12.870 --> 03:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
the same thing they have been vacant for
 
03:32:13.670 --> 03:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
at least
 
03:32:18.790 --> 03:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:22.469 --> 03:32:22.479 align:start position:0%
the wildlife biologist position at least
 
03:32:23.110 --> 03:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
the last
 
03:32:26.630 --> 03:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:30.309 --> 03:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
landowner relations justice
 
03:32:34.710 --> 03:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
current biennium um
 
03:32:37.750 --> 03:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
and the fisheries biologists
 
03:32:41.110 --> 03:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
at least three bienniums and then the
 
03:32:41.120 --> 03:32:41.670 align:start position:0%
at least three bienniums and then the
new

03:32:41.670 --> 03:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
new
 
03:32:44.150 --> 03:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
the number 10 we're just unfunding is
 
03:32:46.309 --> 03:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
another fisheries biologist
 
03:32:50.229 --> 03:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
um no i'm sorry that wasn't a fishery a
 
03:32:52.070 --> 03:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
fisheries biologist i'm sorry
 
03:32:55.269 --> 03:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
that was the hatchery manager position
 
03:32:58.870 --> 03:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
that has been at least three bienniums
 
03:33:02.229 --> 03:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:04.790 --> 03:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much you're
 
03:33:04.800 --> 03:33:05.750 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much you're
welcome

03:33:05.750 --> 03:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
03:33:08.630 --> 03:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
so these are basically not new unfunded
 
03:33:08.640 --> 03:33:09.830 align:start position:0%
so these are basically not new unfunded
positions

03:33:09.830 --> 03:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
positions
 
03:33:13.030 --> 03:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
we only have one that is new the nine
 
03:33:15.750 --> 03:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
other ones are not new they're currently
 
03:33:17.910 --> 03:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
unfunded for this biennium and they were
 
03:33:17.920 --> 03:33:19.349 align:start position:0%
unfunded for this biennium and they were
unfunded

03:33:19.349 --> 03:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
03:33:22.070 --> 03:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
the last biennium all right thank you
 
03:33:23.110 --> 03:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
very much
 
03:33:25.190 --> 03:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
are there oh uh representative petry you
 
03:33:29.190 --> 03:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:31.910 --> 03:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh and thank you
 
03:33:33.269 --> 03:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
for taking this new question
 
03:33:36.630 --> 03:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
um ticks where are we at on that and uh
 
03:33:37.269 --> 03:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
what are we
 
03:33:38.790 --> 03:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
what kind of money are we throwing at
 
03:33:43.190 --> 03:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:47.590 --> 03:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
um which ticks are you referencing sir
 
03:33:50.870 --> 03:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
the deer ticks in this here i
 
03:33:52.710 --> 03:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
didn't realize we had a problem in both
 
03:33:54.309 --> 03:33:54.319 align:start position:0%
places but uh
 
03:33:56.469 --> 03:33:56.479 align:start position:0%
well one one set of ticks that moose
 
03:33:57.429 --> 03:33:57.439 align:start position:0%
ticks are
 
03:34:00.550 --> 03:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
are quite harmful to our northern moose
 
03:34:00.560 --> 03:34:01.910 align:start position:0%
are quite harmful to our northern moose
population

03:34:01.910 --> 03:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
population
 
03:34:05.830 --> 03:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
that ticks that um create lyme disease
 
03:34:06.630 --> 03:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
in humans
 
03:34:08.469 --> 03:34:08.479 align:start position:0%
that's a different tip they're not
 
03:34:09.910 --> 03:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of different ticks in
 
03:34:11.750 --> 03:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
the world they're not all the same
 
03:34:14.229 --> 03:34:14.239 align:start position:0%
um so if you're talking about lyme
 
03:34:14.239 --> 03:34:16.229 align:start position:0%
um so if you're talking about lyme
disease

03:34:16.229 --> 03:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
disease
 
03:34:18.870 --> 03:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
um i don't think we deal with that in
 
03:34:20.870 --> 03:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
this department
 
03:34:24.469 --> 03:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
really but do we i mean what what are we
 
03:34:25.750 --> 03:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
doing about the ticks
 
03:34:27.830 --> 03:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
you know i i haven't seen a moose uh in
 
03:34:29.910 --> 03:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
the south here for a while
 
03:34:32.950 --> 03:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
and uh you know i know we've talked
 
03:34:34.710 --> 03:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
about it in the past of uh
 
03:34:38.790 --> 03:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
yeah um well we've actually kind of
 
03:34:42.309 --> 03:34:42.319 align:start position:0%
this year we're suggesting a little
 
03:34:43.910 --> 03:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
different management technique with our
 
03:34:45.349 --> 03:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
moose population
 
03:34:48.710 --> 03:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
and we've bifurcated the state um
 
03:34:52.070 --> 03:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
the issue up north are the ticks that
 
03:34:54.710 --> 03:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
in fact that latch onto the moose and
 
03:34:55.990 --> 03:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
basically what happens
 
03:34:58.950 --> 03:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
this time of year from now until the end
 
03:35:00.150 --> 03:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
of winter beginning of
 
03:35:03.349 --> 03:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
the spring up north um these ticks
 
03:35:06.309 --> 03:35:06.319 align:start position:0%
basically bleed the moose out and and it
 
03:35:07.750 --> 03:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
does two things number one it
 
03:35:09.750 --> 03:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
kills the younger moves the yellow and
 
03:35:11.349 --> 03:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
most and number two is
 
03:35:14.630 --> 03:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
it it reduces the reproductive
 
03:35:17.910 --> 03:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
um success
 
03:35:20.950 --> 03:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
of other moves so instead of having a
 
03:35:24.790 --> 03:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
set of twins you end up with a single um
 
03:35:27.750 --> 03:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
that that or or she's not able to have a
 
03:35:29.190 --> 03:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
successful birth
 
03:35:31.030 --> 03:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
and and raise a calf up to being a
 
03:35:32.710 --> 03:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
yearling um so
 
03:35:35.990 --> 03:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
so it's depleted our population
 
03:35:39.670 --> 03:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
um there's been research at
 
03:35:43.030 --> 03:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
and it sounds a little counter-intuitive
 
03:35:45.510 --> 03:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
but maine and vermont have been pursuing
 
03:35:47.110 --> 03:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
a course where they're trying to reduce
 
03:35:48.309 --> 03:35:48.319 align:start position:0%
the number of moose
 
03:35:51.910 --> 03:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
in this in this particular and it is a
 
03:35:52.469 --> 03:35:52.479 align:start position:0%
kind of a
 
03:35:56.070 --> 03:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
a southern uh a southern bottom to the
 
03:35:58.229 --> 03:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
zone and a northern bottom to the zone
 
03:35:59.830 --> 03:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh so like if you get up into canada you
 
03:36:01.670 --> 03:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
can actually get above this zone of
 
03:36:03.030 --> 03:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
ticks but
 
03:36:05.910 --> 03:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
from like grafton north of new hampshire
 
03:36:07.910 --> 03:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
from northern grafton county north it
 
03:36:09.429 --> 03:36:09.439 align:start position:0%
falls into the zone
 
03:36:12.309 --> 03:36:12.319 align:start position:0%
where these ticks live and what we're
 
03:36:13.670 --> 03:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
trying to do is reduce the number a
 
03:36:14.710 --> 03:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
little bit and hopefully
 
03:36:16.309 --> 03:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
that in turn will reduce the number of
 
03:36:18.070 --> 03:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
ticks and allow the population to move
 
03:36:19.349 --> 03:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
to rebound
 
03:36:21.190 --> 03:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
the southern part of the state it's a
 
03:36:24.550 --> 03:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:27.910 --> 03:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
what happens there is is um you have
 
03:36:27.920 --> 03:36:28.309 align:start position:0%
what happens there is is um you have
brain

03:36:28.309 --> 03:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
brain
 
03:36:31.190 --> 03:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
worm that gets that impacts the the
 
03:36:33.349 --> 03:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
moose population down there
 
03:36:36.710 --> 03:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
and reduces the moose population and
 
03:36:40.309 --> 03:36:40.319 align:start position:0%
um there we are trying to
 
03:36:43.110 --> 03:36:43.120 align:start position:0%
we've uh reduced uh the moose tags that
 
03:36:44.630 --> 03:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to be
 
03:36:46.469 --> 03:36:46.479 align:start position:0%
we've suggested that we reduce the
 
03:36:48.389 --> 03:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
number of moose tags that we will be
 
03:36:48.399 --> 03:36:49.349 align:start position:0%
number of moose tags that we will be
issuing

03:36:49.349 --> 03:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
issuing
 
03:36:52.550 --> 03:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
over the next hunting seasons in the
 
03:36:53.830 --> 03:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
southern southern tier
 
03:36:55.349 --> 03:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
of the state to try to rebound the
 
03:36:58.229 --> 03:36:58.239 align:start position:0%
population a bit down there
 
03:37:01.269 --> 03:37:01.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representative murray i
 
03:37:03.030 --> 03:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
believe you were next
 
03:37:05.670 --> 03:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you again madam chair when you say
 
03:37:05.680 --> 03:37:07.750 align:start position:0%
thank you again madam chair when you say
unfunded

03:37:07.750 --> 03:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
03:37:10.389 --> 03:37:10.399 align:start position:0%
is that unfilled or are you saying that
 
03:37:11.750 --> 03:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
there are other people who are covering
 
03:37:13.349 --> 03:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
these positions that aren't funded can
 
03:37:15.030 --> 03:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
you just clarify when you say unfunded
 
03:37:16.150 --> 03:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
is that a person who
 
03:37:17.990 --> 03:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
is not working there or is someone kind
 
03:37:20.309 --> 03:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
of doing double time
 
03:37:21.910 --> 03:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
taking care of the fish hatcheries if
 
03:37:25.030 --> 03:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
you have an un funded position there
 
03:37:28.150 --> 03:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
unfunded is an authorized position
 
03:37:31.750 --> 03:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
number that has no funding associated
 
03:37:31.760 --> 03:37:32.070 align:start position:0%
number that has no funding associated
with

03:37:32.070 --> 03:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:37:35.349 --> 03:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
it for the biennium meaning we cannot
 
03:37:37.830 --> 03:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
fill it we have no authority to fill it
 
03:37:39.990 --> 03:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
because there's no funds associated with
 
03:37:40.000 --> 03:37:40.469 align:start position:0%
because there's no funds associated with
it

03:37:40.469 --> 03:37:40.479 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:37:44.229 --> 03:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
so unfunded is unfilled correct
 
03:37:45.910 --> 03:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
and so are there other people covering
 
03:37:49.190 --> 03:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
this or is there stuff not getting done
 
03:37:52.309 --> 03:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
uh there is stuff not getting done
 
03:37:54.229 --> 03:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
and there are other people covering what
 
03:37:56.150 --> 03:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
can be covered
 
03:37:59.269 --> 03:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
03:38:01.590 --> 03:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative heath my question
 
03:38:03.590 --> 03:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
continues with that topic
 
03:38:08.229 --> 03:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
so if we were to populate those funds
 
03:38:10.630 --> 03:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
would that equate to higher revenues in
 
03:38:11.670 --> 03:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
fish and game
 
03:38:14.790 --> 03:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
so are we being penny foolish by not
 
03:38:17.830 --> 03:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
populating those lines with people and
 
03:38:19.269 --> 03:38:19.279 align:start position:0%
would it result in
 
03:38:22.469 --> 03:38:22.479 align:start position:0%
higher income and what might that
 
03:38:25.110 --> 03:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
possibly be
 
03:38:27.189 --> 03:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
well it depends on how you know it
 
03:38:29.510 --> 03:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
depends on which positions
 
03:38:33.349 --> 03:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
um if you give me more cos that probably
 
03:38:34.150 --> 03:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
is not going to
 
03:38:37.670 --> 03:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
increase um license sales
 
03:38:40.550 --> 03:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
what it does do is it helps to increase
 
03:38:40.560 --> 03:38:42.790 align:start position:0%
what it does do is it helps to increase
safety

03:38:42.790 --> 03:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
safety
 
03:38:46.710 --> 03:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:49.670 --> 03:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
for example i can't remember the date
 
03:38:52.790 --> 03:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
but a couple weekends ago
 
03:38:54.229 --> 03:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
coming from the north country's a little
 
03:38:55.990 --> 03:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
different than the rest of the state uh
 
03:38:57.750 --> 03:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
we might be a little bit more laid back
 
03:39:00.229 --> 03:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
i i actually get people stopping at my
 
03:39:00.239 --> 03:39:01.030 align:start position:0%
i i actually get people stopping at my
farm

03:39:01.030 --> 03:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
farm
 
03:39:02.870 --> 03:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
and talking to my wife about problems
 
03:39:04.469 --> 03:39:04.479 align:start position:0%
with fish and game now so it's
 
03:39:06.710 --> 03:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
it's a very different type of atmosphere
 
03:39:08.870 --> 03:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
up north than it is in other places
 
03:39:10.630 --> 03:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
so on a saturday afternoon at two
 
03:39:13.189 --> 03:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the afternoon my phone rings
 
03:39:15.590 --> 03:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
and it's somebody complaining about snow
 
03:39:17.429 --> 03:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
machines driving off trail
 
03:39:20.309 --> 03:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
on private property being disrespectful
 
03:39:21.429 --> 03:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
and causing
 
03:39:24.630 --> 03:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
problems which um being off trail is
 
03:39:27.830 --> 03:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
is a ticketable offense but in general
 
03:39:32.150 --> 03:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
you know negative interaction between
 
03:39:34.950 --> 03:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
outdoors people and landowners usually
 
03:39:36.070 --> 03:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
ends up in
 
03:39:37.670 --> 03:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
landowners shutting their property down
 
03:39:39.189 --> 03:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
to outdoor activities so
 
03:39:41.110 --> 03:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
the fishing game takes these these these
 
03:39:43.670 --> 03:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
calls very very seriously
 
03:39:46.710 --> 03:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
um so i i got a hold of our colonel
 
03:39:48.710 --> 03:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
and he was getting ready to dis he
 
03:39:50.229 --> 03:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
dispatched a
 
03:39:52.790 --> 03:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
co to go to this town in stewart's town
 
03:39:54.229 --> 03:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
and before we could get
 
03:39:56.870 --> 03:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
up to stewart's town we had two calls
 
03:39:56.880 --> 03:39:57.830 align:start position:0%
up to stewart's town we had two calls
that

03:39:57.830 --> 03:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:40:00.630 --> 03:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
that we that were rescue calls hiking
 
03:40:02.630 --> 03:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
rescue calls
 
03:40:04.229 --> 03:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
one of which we flew national guard
 
03:40:05.910 --> 03:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
helicopter the airlift a
 
03:40:07.590 --> 03:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
a person off the side of one of the
 
03:40:09.830 --> 03:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
mountains and in grafton county and the
 
03:40:10.790 --> 03:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
other one
 
03:40:12.469 --> 03:40:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh the weather had getting so bad the
 
03:40:14.150 --> 03:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
helicopter no longer could fly and we
 
03:40:15.910 --> 03:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
were dispatching two groups of people to
 
03:40:18.229 --> 03:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
climb the mountain to try to rescue
 
03:40:19.189 --> 03:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
these folks
 
03:40:21.750 --> 03:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
and then we ended up by four o'clock we
 
03:40:23.189 --> 03:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
had four more
 
03:40:25.670 --> 03:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh snowmobile wrecks and we had to
 
03:40:27.750 --> 03:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
dispatch cos to that
 
03:40:30.070 --> 03:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
so the co that was supposed to go up and
 
03:40:31.429 --> 03:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
try to
 
03:40:33.750 --> 03:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
catch these folks never got there until
 
03:40:35.670 --> 03:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
the next the next day
 
03:40:38.389 --> 03:40:38.399 align:start position:0%
and um that's what we run into is
 
03:40:39.670 --> 03:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
especially on weekends
 
03:40:42.950 --> 03:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
busy times we run out of cos we have 41
 
03:40:44.830 --> 03:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
cos in the state
 
03:40:47.750 --> 03:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
um the entire state
 
03:40:50.309 --> 03:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
and uh city of concord has more police
 
03:40:52.070 --> 03:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
officers than we have ceos
 
03:40:53.830 --> 03:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
and and i understand it's a different
 
03:40:55.590 --> 03:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
job i understand it's a
 
03:40:58.389 --> 03:40:58.399 align:start position:0%
um you know a different level of
 
03:40:58.399 --> 03:40:59.110 align:start position:0%
um you know a different level of
staffing

03:40:59.110 --> 03:40:59.120 align:start position:0%
staffing
 
03:41:01.510 --> 03:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
but at the same time we are spread
 
03:41:02.790 --> 03:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
pretty soon
 
03:41:06.630 --> 03:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
um now one of the places like in our
 
03:41:08.710 --> 03:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
communications department uh there's a
 
03:41:11.110 --> 03:41:11.120 align:start position:0%
program in
 
03:41:13.510 --> 03:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
the world of fishing game called r3 and
 
03:41:14.630 --> 03:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
what it's all about
 
03:41:17.830 --> 03:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:20.229 --> 03:41:20.239 align:start position:0%
re r3 is what recruit retrain
 
03:41:20.239 --> 03:41:21.590 align:start position:0%
re r3 is what recruit retrain
recruitment

03:41:21.590 --> 03:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
recruitment
 
03:41:25.189 --> 03:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
retain and reactivate um license holders
 
03:41:26.150 --> 03:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
so what it's about
 
03:41:27.910 --> 03:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
is how do you get somebody and we have
 
03:41:29.750 --> 03:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
different types like like i've always
 
03:41:31.189 --> 03:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
bought my license by
 
03:41:32.630 --> 03:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
you know the end of january i
 
03:41:34.229 --> 03:41:34.239 align:start position:0%
religiously go buy a hundred and fishing
 
03:41:34.239 --> 03:41:35.110 align:start position:0%
religiously go buy a hundred and fishing
license

03:41:35.110 --> 03:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
license
 
03:41:37.030 --> 03:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh so you got people like me and you
 
03:41:38.389 --> 03:41:38.399 align:start position:0%
have other people that might buy one
 
03:41:40.710 --> 03:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
every five years every 10 years
 
03:41:42.469 --> 03:41:42.479 align:start position:0%
trying to get those folks to buy more
 
03:41:44.630 --> 03:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
often and then you've also got
 
03:41:47.110 --> 03:41:47.120 align:start position:0%
other folks that just didn't get exposed
 
03:41:48.870 --> 03:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
to hunting and fishing growing up and
 
03:41:51.670 --> 03:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
and trying to get them to try it and buy
 
03:41:52.710 --> 03:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
a license
 
03:41:54.790 --> 03:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
and this is a national program that a
 
03:41:56.070 --> 03:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
lot of states have bought
 
03:41:58.710 --> 03:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
into and have been working hard at uh to
 
03:42:01.030 --> 03:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
try to increase their license sales
 
03:42:02.790 --> 03:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
so that would be an example of where a
 
03:42:04.469 --> 03:42:04.479 align:start position:0%
position might help us
 
03:42:08.630 --> 03:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:12.389 --> 03:42:12.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for anyone else with questions
 
03:42:12.870 --> 03:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
because i
 
03:42:17.510 --> 03:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:20.150 --> 03:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
but director mason my question is as i
 
03:42:21.590 --> 03:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
went through
 
03:42:24.630 --> 03:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
your budget it appears that you are
 
03:42:27.030 --> 03:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
moving people around within the various
 
03:42:27.040 --> 03:42:28.469 align:start position:0%
moving people around within the various
departments

03:42:28.469 --> 03:42:28.479 align:start position:0%
departments
 
03:42:31.349 --> 03:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
could you kind of explain that a little
 
03:42:31.359 --> 03:42:34.070 align:start position:0%
could you kind of explain that a little
bit

03:42:34.070 --> 03:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:38.070 --> 03:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not sure we are
 
03:42:40.950 --> 03:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
moving people around what we did
 
03:42:40.960 --> 03:42:41.830 align:start position:0%
moving people around what we did
representative

03:42:41.830 --> 03:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:42:44.870 --> 03:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
umberger is um in order to meet
 
03:42:49.349 --> 03:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
the governor's target we moved
 
03:42:52.070 --> 03:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
several positions from accounting units
 
03:42:52.710 --> 03:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
that were
 
03:42:56.070 --> 03:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
funded mainly by fish and game funds
 
03:42:59.189 --> 03:42:59.199 align:start position:0%
into dedicated sources of funding
 
03:43:01.349 --> 03:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
in order to free up some fish and game
 
03:43:01.359 --> 03:43:02.309 align:start position:0%
in order to free up some fish and game
funds

03:43:02.309 --> 03:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
funds
 
03:43:04.389 --> 03:43:04.399 align:start position:0%
we moved a couple of people from
 
03:43:05.990 --> 03:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
fisheries into the fisheries
 
03:43:08.710 --> 03:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
habitat account which is dedicated we
 
03:43:08.720 --> 03:43:09.349 align:start position:0%
habitat account which is dedicated we
moved

03:43:09.349 --> 03:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
moved
 
03:43:11.910 --> 03:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
two conservation officers in the
 
03:43:14.389 --> 03:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
northernmost part of the state
 
03:43:17.510 --> 03:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
from accounting unit 7887 into
 
03:43:21.670 --> 03:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
dedicated account 1183 ohrv
 
03:43:26.309 --> 03:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:32.790 --> 03:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:34.309 --> 03:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
representative hamburger you have you
 
03:43:36.150 --> 03:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
need to turn the mute button we can't
 
03:43:38.630 --> 03:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:42.630 --> 03:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
sorry um for example
 
03:43:46.389 --> 03:43:46.399 align:start position:0%
under um statewide public
 
03:43:50.469 --> 03:43:50.479 align:start position:0%
boat access yes you go from two to three
 
03:43:53.189 --> 03:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
and so that was that was my question was
 
03:43:53.910 --> 03:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
were they
 
03:43:55.750 --> 03:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
were the areas where you moved the
 
03:43:57.189 --> 03:43:57.199 align:start position:0%
people short
 
03:44:00.309 --> 03:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
or was it because of your
 
03:44:05.030 --> 03:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
ability to fund within that particular
 
03:44:05.040 --> 03:44:10.070 align:start position:0%
ability to fund within that particular
area

03:44:10.070 --> 03:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:13.189 --> 03:44:13.199 align:start position:0%
it was in order to meet
 
03:44:15.990 --> 03:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
the guidelines that we were provided by
 
03:44:17.910 --> 03:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
the governor's office
 
03:44:22.309 --> 03:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
and maintain our 192
 
03:44:26.550 --> 03:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
people without having to let anybody go
 
03:44:30.229 --> 03:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
okay i have another question and this
 
03:44:31.110 --> 03:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
deals with
 
03:44:34.229 --> 03:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:38.550 --> 03:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:43.030 --> 03:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
um if i'm not mistaken here
 
03:44:46.070 --> 03:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
it shows the uh
 
03:44:48.229 --> 03:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
commission with a two million dollar
 
03:44:48.239 --> 03:44:50.070 align:start position:0%
commission with a two million dollar
budget

03:44:50.070 --> 03:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:44:54.070 --> 03:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
and maybe i'm reading it wrong but it uh
 
03:44:57.189 --> 03:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
what people ask what page you're on
 
03:45:04.070 --> 03:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:08.389 --> 03:45:08.399 align:start position:0%
i uh i i check marked it but
 
03:45:11.429 --> 03:45:11.439 align:start position:0%
now of course i can't find it but
 
03:45:17.590 --> 03:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:21.510 --> 03:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
oh you're on page 602 at the end of that
 
03:45:37.429 --> 03:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:39.189 --> 03:45:39.199 align:start position:0%
yeah that number there representative
 
03:45:40.790 --> 03:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
umberger is a subtotal
 
03:45:43.910 --> 03:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:46.070 --> 03:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
okay i was waiting for a question mickey
 
03:45:47.910 --> 03:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry okay i think
 
03:45:51.750 --> 03:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:56.790 --> 03:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
so okay so the um
 
03:45:59.670 --> 03:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
the x oh that's it says expenditure
 
03:46:01.990 --> 03:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
total for fish and game commission
 
03:46:05.269 --> 03:46:05.279 align:start position:0%
is 2 million that's a subtotal of the
 
03:46:06.309 --> 03:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
accounts above it
 
03:46:10.229 --> 03:46:10.239 align:start position:0%
for that um section of their budget
 
03:46:13.910 --> 03:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
okay so this is all the wildlife stuff
 
03:46:16.389 --> 03:46:16.399 align:start position:0%
no we refer to this section of the
 
03:46:19.110 --> 03:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
budget as the office of the director
 
03:46:21.510 --> 03:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
it's not under a specific division like
 
03:46:23.429 --> 03:46:23.439 align:start position:0%
the wildlife division the business
 
03:46:23.439 --> 03:46:23.990 align:start position:0%
the wildlife division the business
division

03:46:23.990 --> 03:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
division
 
03:46:26.550 --> 03:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
public affairs law enforcement this
 
03:46:28.309 --> 03:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
first section of the budget
 
03:46:31.349 --> 03:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
is the office of the director or
 
03:46:33.670 --> 03:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
fish and game commission is what it's
 
03:46:34.550 --> 03:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
referred to
 
03:46:37.990 --> 03:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
so that is the subtotal
 
03:46:42.550 --> 03:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
of that section of the department
 
03:46:46.309 --> 03:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
so like our grant writer works in my
 
03:46:49.189 --> 03:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
works in the commissioner's office uh
 
03:46:50.389 --> 03:46:50.399 align:start position:0%
our ag
 
03:46:52.309 --> 03:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
works in the commissioner's office we
 
03:46:54.229 --> 03:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
have well it's all those accounting
 
03:46:57.510 --> 03:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
rights right yeah so this is all the
 
03:46:59.510 --> 03:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
accounts from the beginning of fish and
 
03:46:59.520 --> 03:47:00.070 align:start position:0%
accounts from the beginning of fish and
game

03:47:00.070 --> 03:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
game
 
03:47:03.189 --> 03:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
through page 602 correct
 
03:47:06.070 --> 03:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
okay all right fine i'm i'm like this
 
03:47:08.630 --> 03:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
didn't make any sense to me so
 
03:47:12.309 --> 03:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
no that is correct i appreciate that
 
03:47:16.070 --> 03:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
okay uh i do have some i think
 
03:47:19.510 --> 03:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
that includes if i may say a big portion
 
03:47:21.030 --> 03:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
of that
 
03:47:24.150 --> 03:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
is our transfers to doit
 
03:47:26.309 --> 03:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
that interagency transfer to the
 
03:47:28.950 --> 03:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
department of information technology
 
03:47:31.189 --> 03:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
which is well over nine hundred thousand
 
03:47:31.199 --> 03:47:35.670 align:start position:0%
which is well over nine hundred thousand
dollars

03:47:35.670 --> 03:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:39.269 --> 03:47:39.279 align:start position:0%
what what's your 600
 
03:47:42.870 --> 03:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
you can see that in 600 that transfer to
 
03:47:47.030 --> 03:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
oit eoit yeah
 
03:47:52.229 --> 03:47:52.239 align:start position:0%
okay um you had mentioned dispatch
 
03:47:54.790 --> 03:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
and i think i heard the governor say the
 
03:47:55.510 --> 03:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
fish and game
 
03:48:02.710 --> 03:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:04.309 --> 03:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
we believe that that's going to be in
 
03:48:04.319 --> 03:48:07.030 align:start position:0%
we believe that that's going to be in
hb2

03:48:07.030 --> 03:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
03:48:12.830 --> 03:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:12.840 --> 03:48:15.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:48:15.670 --> 03:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:19.349 --> 03:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
how many people in fish and game are
 
03:48:23.030 --> 03:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
associated with dispatch one full time
 
03:48:25.110 --> 03:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
three part time
 
03:48:28.150 --> 03:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry what one full-time and three
 
03:48:30.150 --> 03:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
part-time people
 
03:48:32.229 --> 03:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
but one of the issues that takes place
 
03:48:34.070 --> 03:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
is our dispatch
 
03:48:38.389 --> 03:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
um does more than just um dispatch cos
 
03:48:41.510 --> 03:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
and uh the plan will be that we will
 
03:48:41.520 --> 03:48:42.150 align:start position:0%
and uh the plan will be that we will
maintain

03:48:42.150 --> 03:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
03:48:45.990 --> 03:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
one of our phone lines in and
 
03:48:47.910 --> 03:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
that will create and you know they'll
 
03:48:50.550 --> 03:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
deal with people calling in looking for
 
03:48:52.790 --> 03:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
answers to questions about wildlife
 
03:48:54.469 --> 03:48:54.479 align:start position:0%
issues that they are having
 
03:48:57.750 --> 03:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
at home um you know you got a bear
 
03:48:59.750 --> 03:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
what do i how do i get a bear out of my
 
03:49:01.269 --> 03:49:01.279 align:start position:0%
garage how do i
 
03:49:03.429 --> 03:49:03.439 align:start position:0%
you know stop a bear from attacking my
 
03:49:04.710 --> 03:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
chickens um
 
03:49:06.389 --> 03:49:06.399 align:start position:0%
what do i do with a skunk or my front
 
03:49:07.990 --> 03:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
door yard um
 
03:49:10.229 --> 03:49:10.239 align:start position:0%
we receive a lot of questions like that
 
03:49:11.590 --> 03:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna have to
 
03:49:14.710 --> 03:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
restructure uh the way we manage some of
 
03:49:16.870 --> 03:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
our outreach to these folks
 
03:49:18.550 --> 03:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh traditionally it's gone through our
 
03:49:21.750 --> 03:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
dispatch and it's handled that way
 
03:49:25.349 --> 03:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
um so the uh right now the plan is for
 
03:49:27.510 --> 03:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
us to continue to manage that here
 
03:49:34.309 --> 03:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:38.150 --> 03:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
okay so um of the one full time
 
03:49:41.189 --> 03:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
and three part time how many will be
 
03:49:44.309 --> 03:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
retained one
 
03:49:48.790 --> 03:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:51.189 --> 03:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
sorry i keep forgetting to unmute myself
 
03:49:52.229 --> 03:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
03:49:55.590 --> 03:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
one full time will remain correct
 
03:49:58.870 --> 03:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
and he'll be called uh
 
03:50:02.150 --> 03:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
outreach person yeah we don't have a
 
03:50:04.309 --> 03:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
title we haven't done it yet
 
03:50:18.150 --> 03:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:21.510 --> 03:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
i'll be back with you in uh in just uh
 
03:50:25.189 --> 03:50:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:28.630 --> 03:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
um on the land
 
03:50:31.830 --> 03:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
acquisition and easements
 
03:50:34.550 --> 03:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
are you planning any large purchases
 
03:50:35.750 --> 03:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
this year
 
03:50:39.349 --> 03:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
or or is this mostly uh
 
03:50:42.630 --> 03:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
easement kind of
 
03:50:48.309 --> 03:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
quite often it's mostly easement we
 
03:50:50.550 --> 03:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
we are looking at several parcels uh
 
03:50:50.560 --> 03:50:51.590 align:start position:0%
we are looking at several parcels uh
currently

03:50:51.590 --> 03:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
currently
 
03:50:55.030 --> 03:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
um but i i
 
03:50:57.590 --> 03:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i just i'm not sure i can
 
03:51:00.830 --> 03:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
say whether they're big or small at this
 
03:51:00.840 --> 03:51:04.309 align:start position:0%
say whether they're big or small at this
point

03:51:04.309 --> 03:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:06.550 --> 03:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
are those mostly up north or are they
 
03:51:08.309 --> 03:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
down south
 
03:51:10.550 --> 03:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
all over the state which creates the
 
03:51:12.309 --> 03:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
issue with big and small
 
03:51:14.790 --> 03:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
um a small piece of property we're
 
03:51:16.389 --> 03:51:16.399 align:start position:0%
actually looking at a piece
 
03:51:19.750 --> 03:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:22.630 --> 03:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
let me it's in the exeter area i won't i
 
03:51:23.269 --> 03:51:23.279 align:start position:0%
won't say
 
03:51:25.830 --> 03:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
definitely exeter but this is a small
 
03:51:27.990 --> 03:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
it's a very small piece of property but
 
03:51:30.469 --> 03:51:30.479 align:start position:0%
it it hooks up with a bunch of other
 
03:51:30.479 --> 03:51:31.830 align:start position:0%
it it hooks up with a bunch of other
properties

03:51:31.830 --> 03:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
properties
 
03:51:33.990 --> 03:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
and it helps us uh to defend a rather
 
03:51:34.950 --> 03:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
large uh
 
03:51:37.990 --> 03:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
conservation area um
 
03:51:41.189 --> 03:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
and so i approve the i approved our
 
03:51:42.150 --> 03:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
people going forward
 
03:51:43.590 --> 03:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
whether we actually get there or not i
 
03:51:46.070 --> 03:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
don't know um
 
03:51:49.990 --> 03:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
but up north you can obviously buy more
 
03:51:52.150 --> 03:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
more acres for your dollar than you can
 
03:51:53.510 --> 03:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
down south but
 
03:51:55.349 --> 03:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
and especially when you get critical
 
03:51:56.870 --> 03:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
habitat some you know
 
03:51:59.990 --> 03:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
there are habitats that you got to be
 
03:52:01.670 --> 03:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
down south by and they don't exist up in
 
03:52:04.150 --> 03:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
the north country so
 
03:52:06.550 --> 03:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
the other place that over the years fish
 
03:52:08.070 --> 03:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
and game has
 
03:52:09.590 --> 03:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
spent quite a bit of money is around
 
03:52:11.750 --> 03:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
great bay and you know we're obviously
 
03:52:11.760 --> 03:52:11.990 align:start position:0%
great bay and you know we're obviously
not

03:52:11.990 --> 03:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:52:14.710 --> 03:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
the only folks down there nature
 
03:52:14.720 --> 03:52:15.990 align:start position:0%
the only folks down there nature
conservancy

03:52:15.990 --> 03:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
conservancy
 
03:52:17.750 --> 03:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
i believe u.s fish and wildlife service
 
03:52:19.750 --> 03:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
and others have have uh
 
03:52:22.229 --> 03:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
protected a large area around great bay
 
03:52:24.070 --> 03:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
but it's certainly one of our special
 
03:52:27.590 --> 03:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
special areas in the state
 
03:52:31.750 --> 03:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
how do how do you um work between
 
03:52:35.349 --> 03:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
fish and game and the other conservation
 
03:52:38.309 --> 03:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
things that are all around the state do
 
03:52:38.790 --> 03:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
you have
 
03:52:42.630 --> 03:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
working agreements with them or is it
 
03:52:44.630 --> 03:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
often a sharing on a piece of property
 
03:52:46.150 --> 03:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
we you know we might hold an easement
 
03:52:46.630 --> 03:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
where they
 
03:52:48.870 --> 03:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
they own it outright or you know we
 
03:52:50.469 --> 03:52:50.479 align:start position:0%
different groups will come together with
 
03:52:50.479 --> 03:52:51.269 align:start position:0%
different groups will come together with
money

03:52:51.269 --> 03:52:51.279 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:52:55.750 --> 03:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
and and buy you know buy parcels um
 
03:52:58.070 --> 03:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
and but then each parcel will have its
 
03:52:58.790 --> 03:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
have its own
 
03:53:02.070 --> 03:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh easement or i don't want to say an
 
03:53:03.030 --> 03:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
mou but
 
03:53:05.030 --> 03:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
at least the plan on how to manage that
 
03:53:06.389 --> 03:53:06.399 align:start position:0%
that piece of land
 
03:53:08.229 --> 03:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh but yes we do work with other
 
03:53:10.389 --> 03:53:10.399 align:start position:0%
conservation organizations quite well in
 
03:53:12.229 --> 03:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
03:53:15.590 --> 03:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
um um both the large ones and also
 
03:53:19.590 --> 03:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:19.600 --> 03:53:26.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:53:26.870 --> 03:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:29.030 --> 03:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
but we have a person in our agency that
 
03:53:32.469 --> 03:53:32.479 align:start position:0%
maintains those relationships
 
03:53:35.990 --> 03:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
okay um as i'm looking at
 
03:53:39.910 --> 03:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
the uh last page of your budget
 
03:53:43.030 --> 03:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
it shows that you have an
 
03:53:47.269 --> 03:53:47.279 align:start position:0%
increase of one position
 
03:53:50.550 --> 03:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
in 2022
 
03:53:55.830 --> 03:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
from 2019 or 2020 and 2021
 
03:53:59.750 --> 03:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
it goes from 190 to 191
 
03:54:03.110 --> 03:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:06.150 --> 03:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
interested in uh
 
03:54:08.229 --> 03:54:08.239 align:start position:0%
you know as i mentioned before i saw a
 
03:54:09.349 --> 03:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
lot of changes
 
03:54:11.910 --> 03:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
throughout your uh out your budget in
 
03:54:13.070 --> 03:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
the number of um
 
03:54:13.080 --> 03:54:14.389 align:start position:0%
the number of um
[Music]

03:54:14.389 --> 03:54:14.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:54:17.510 --> 03:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
solutions but that position
 
03:54:21.510 --> 03:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
is represented on page 632
 
03:54:30.710 --> 03:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:34.550 --> 03:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
that position is the result of a
 
03:54:38.229 --> 03:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
very large donation uh
 
03:54:40.070 --> 03:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
benefactor if you will is that what you
 
03:54:41.910 --> 03:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
call a person who makes a very large
 
03:54:41.920 --> 03:54:43.750 align:start position:0%
call a person who makes a very large
donation

03:54:43.750 --> 03:54:43.760 align:start position:0%

to our great bay sandy point
 
03:54:50.630 --> 03:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
research center and
 
03:54:52.550 --> 03:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
this is a donation that is going to go
 
03:54:55.269 --> 03:54:55.279 align:start position:0%
on for many many many years
 
03:54:57.510 --> 03:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
a million dollars a year she wanted to
 
03:55:02.229 --> 03:55:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:05.750 --> 03:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
the reader's digest version is
 
03:55:09.269 --> 03:55:09.279 align:start position:0%
we created a class 59 which is
 
03:55:12.469 --> 03:55:12.479 align:start position:0%
temporary full-time
 
03:55:15.510 --> 03:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
100 percent funded by the proceeds of

this donation
 
03:55:20.790 --> 03:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
to be a management
 
03:55:23.349 --> 03:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
or a program management position out at
 
03:55:24.229 --> 03:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
our sandy
 
03:55:28.870 --> 03:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh great bay research reserve and
 
03:55:31.349 --> 03:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
that is where that position will be and
 
03:55:32.309 --> 03:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
it will be funded
 
03:55:37.269 --> 03:55:37.279 align:start position:0%
in perpetuity by this donation from this

that's
 
03:55:59.910 --> 03:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's for darn sure so
 
03:56:01.750 --> 03:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions that
 
03:56:08.870 --> 03:56:08.880 align:start position:0%

03:56:38.550 --> 03:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
03:56:42.189 --> 03:56:42.199 align:start position:0%
increases in habitat expenditures in the
 
03:56:45.269 --> 03:56:45.279 align:start position:0%
2155 org 304 yep
 
03:56:47.510 --> 03:56:47.520 align:start position:0%

regarding the habitat increased
 
03:57:01.840 --> 03:57:03.269 align:start position:0%
regarding the habitat increased
expenditures

03:57:03.269 --> 03:57:03.279 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
03:57:06.229 --> 03:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
i simply wanted to mention that those
 
03:57:07.110 --> 03:57:07.120 align:start position:0%
monies which
 
03:57:11.910 --> 03:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
are both federal funds matched with
 
03:57:15.189 --> 03:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
dedicated habitat camp revenue those
 
03:57:18.150 --> 03:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
increases reflect a significant increase
 
03:57:21.189 --> 03:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
in investments and infrastructure on the
 
03:57:24.389 --> 03:57:24.399 align:start position:0%
80 000 or so acres that we manage and
 
03:57:24.399 --> 03:57:25.510 align:start position:0%
80 000 or so acres that we manage and
oversee

03:57:25.510 --> 03:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
oversee
 
03:57:28.309 --> 03:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
throughout the state the commission
 
03:57:29.349 --> 03:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
through policy
 
03:57:32.710 --> 03:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
has directed us to uh to
 
03:57:34.710 --> 03:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
intensify fire management of those
 
03:57:37.030 --> 03:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
properties and those expenditures are a
 
03:57:39.269 --> 03:57:39.279 align:start position:0%
reflection of that effort
 
03:57:42.030 --> 03:57:42.040 align:start position:0%
the type of work done in that
 
03:57:44.389 --> 03:57:44.399 align:start position:0%
circumstance includes the maintenance of
 
03:57:44.399 --> 03:57:45.429 align:start position:0%
circumstance includes the maintenance of
roads

03:57:45.429 --> 03:57:45.439 align:start position:0%
roads
 
03:57:48.389 --> 03:57:48.399 align:start position:0%
replacement of undersized culverts the
 
03:57:51.429 --> 03:57:51.439 align:start position:0%
establishment of parking areas
 
03:57:54.950 --> 03:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
and the placement of educational kiosks
 
03:57:56.630 --> 03:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
in addition there's some additional
 
03:57:59.110 --> 03:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
money being spent in that or
 
03:58:01.189 --> 03:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
in that specific class for
 
03:58:03.590 --> 03:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
non-commercial habitat management on
 
03:58:03.600 --> 03:58:04.229 align:start position:0%
non-commercial habitat management on
those

03:58:04.229 --> 03:58:04.239 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:58:08.710 --> 03:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:12.710 --> 03:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
oh yeah you need to unmute yourself
 
03:58:17.030 --> 03:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
so sorry uh can you answer the bird
 
03:58:17.040 --> 03:58:17.590 align:start position:0%
so sorry uh can you answer the bird
strike

03:58:17.590 --> 03:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
strike
 
03:58:21.030 --> 03:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
question all right i'll take a stab at
 
03:58:22.309 --> 03:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
it and tell you that
 
03:58:24.469 --> 03:58:24.479 align:start position:0%
we don't expand appreciable funds
 
03:58:25.510 --> 03:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
related to that
 
03:58:27.670 --> 03:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
except as it pertains to the sighting of
 
03:58:29.030 --> 03:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
those types of
 
03:58:32.150 --> 03:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
facilities we try to guide
 
03:58:34.070 --> 03:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
all interests in a state in terms of how
 
03:58:37.670 --> 03:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
to minimize potential impacts
 
03:58:41.030 --> 03:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
typically permits that provide for the
 
03:58:42.710 --> 03:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
establishment of
 
03:58:45.590 --> 03:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
wind farms as an example require that
 
03:58:46.389 --> 03:58:46.399 align:start position:0%
the actual
 
03:58:48.950 --> 03:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
commercial interests collect that data
 
03:58:51.110 --> 03:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
we have access to it
 
03:58:53.189 --> 03:58:53.199 align:start position:0%
but we're not specifically spending
 
03:58:55.590 --> 03:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
money in that regard
 
03:58:58.630 --> 03:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
so the commercial entities provide that
 
03:59:02.710 --> 03:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:05.110 --> 03:59:05.120 align:start position:0%
i believe we have access to it through
 
03:59:06.870 --> 03:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
their data collection
 
03:59:10.070 --> 03:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
yes do they provide
 
03:59:12.469 --> 03:59:12.479 align:start position:0%
also the best fish and uh joe does that
 
03:59:18.309 --> 03:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:20.309 --> 03:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
i think that'll suffice for the time uh
 
03:59:21.750 --> 03:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
i think it's going to be a problem and
 
03:59:22.710 --> 03:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
the more
 
03:59:25.189 --> 03:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
wind farms we put up because we're
 
03:59:25.990 --> 03:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
losing you know
 
03:59:29.269 --> 03:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
eagles and uh you know protected birds
 
03:59:32.469 --> 03:59:32.479 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mark
 
03:59:34.790 --> 03:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
if an eagle is struck does that go to us
 
03:59:35.670 --> 03:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
or does that go
 
03:59:38.070 --> 03:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
to u.s fish and wildlife service um that
 
03:59:38.950 --> 03:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
would go to the u.s
 
03:59:41.189 --> 03:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
fish and wildlife service specifically
 
03:59:43.590 --> 03:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
but we are close partners with them and
 
03:59:45.590 --> 03:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
that information would be shared with us
 
03:59:46.870 --> 03:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
as well
 
03:59:49.670 --> 03:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
there's a close partnership there i'm
 
03:59:49.680 --> 03:59:50.070 align:start position:0%
there's a close partnership there i'm
not

03:59:50.070 --> 03:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:59:51.590 --> 03:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
aware of that happening here
 
03:59:53.990 --> 03:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
specifically we don't have substantial
 
03:59:56.950 --> 03:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
wind power farms at this point but we're
 
03:59:59.110 --> 03:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
keenly aware of the controversies and
 
04:00:00.469 --> 04:00:00.479 align:start position:0%
the potential if
 
04:00:03.349 --> 04:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
misplaced to have adverse impacts so we
 
04:00:05.110 --> 04:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
very much appreciate your interest in
 
04:00:08.950 --> 04:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
the subject
 
04:00:10.710 --> 04:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
04:00:13.590 --> 04:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
further questions that anyone has
 
04:00:17.269 --> 04:00:17.279 align:start position:0%
for fishing game representative i just
 
04:00:19.429 --> 04:00:19.439 align:start position:0%
would like to clarify something with uh
 
04:00:21.830 --> 04:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
kathy on the debt service specifically
 
04:00:23.590 --> 04:00:23.600 align:start position:0%

04:00:26.150 --> 04:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
um does the debt service line kathy
 
04:00:26.160 --> 04:00:27.269 align:start position:0%
um does the debt service line kathy
include

04:00:27.269 --> 04:00:27.279 align:start position:0%

04:00:29.670 --> 04:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
um if the powder mill hatchery in the
 
04:00:35.030 --> 04:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:38.229 --> 04:00:38.239 align:start position:0%
well yes it would however if it is
 
04:00:40.309 --> 04:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
approved by the time that
 
04:00:42.950 --> 04:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
treasury actually goes out and secures
 
04:00:43.910 --> 04:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
those bonds
 
04:00:46.790 --> 04:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
it will the timing of it i really don't
 
04:00:46.800 --> 04:00:49.189 align:start position:0%
it will the timing of it i really don't
anticipate

04:00:49.189 --> 04:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
anticipate
 
04:00:51.429 --> 04:00:51.439 align:start position:0%
too much of that debt being repaid
 
04:00:53.189 --> 04:00:53.199 align:start position:0%
within this biennium
 
04:00:56.389 --> 04:00:56.399 align:start position:0%
okay so in all actuality okay
 
04:00:58.309 --> 04:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
so there's no contingency on what you
 
04:01:00.790 --> 04:01:00.800 align:start position:0%
have appropriated in there based on that
 
04:01:02.309 --> 04:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
capital budget item
 
04:01:08.870 --> 04:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
