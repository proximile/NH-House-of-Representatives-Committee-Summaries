that are coming up
 
00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 align:start position:0%
uh to be heard that coming over from the
 
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
senate i believe we also have
 
00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
another bill which has been sent to us
 
00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 align:start position:0%
so we won't
 
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
that will be a later item though
 
00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
i would encourage everybody be looking
 
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
at those bills for thursday
 
00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 align:start position:0%
look them over um if we're able to get
 
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
through some of the hearing
 
00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 align:start position:0%
on those we may get and we most likely
 
00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 align:start position:0%
will try to exact
 
00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 align:start position:0%
some the last bill which we have set for
 
00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
on thursday is a finance bill
 
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
or a bill which deals with funding of
 
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.830 align:start position:0%
or a bill which deals with funding of
schools

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh we may want to really look at that
 
00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.869 align:start position:0%
uh we may want to really look at that
seriously

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
and and and get it moving it looks back
 
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
at the previous year for
 
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
setting the enrollment for the funding
 
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
of the next year
 
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
rather than using the enrollment of the
 
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic year we're in right now
 
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh serious issue so look that over
 
00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
please and be wise that if we can
 
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
move some of that along in terms of i
 
00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 align:start position:0%
know contracts are
 
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
our districts are in the process this
 
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
spring of making contracts with
 
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.270 align:start position:0%
spring of making contracts with
personnel

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
um they're knowing or understanding
 
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.550 align:start position:0%
um they're knowing or understanding
where

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
you know how the budgets can be promised
 
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful to them so
 
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
i i hope we can uh address some of that
 
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
on on thursday
 
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 align:start position:0%

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.070 align:start position:0%
i do plan on introducing two amendments
um

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 align:start position:0%
on that during the hearing uh
 
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
particularly because they're relevant to
 
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
the work that we did last session with
 
00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
respect to the
 
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 align:start position:0%

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
move the um move the school
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 align:start position:0%

grassroots
 
00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 align:start position:0%

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
it's good to know that if you're going

right als also i'm not sure the
 
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
committee is aware of it or not but the
 
00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
con val decision was rendered today and
 
00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
it was basically remanded back
 
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
to the original court which means they
 
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
start all over again
 
00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
and i think rick much of the work that
 
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
we worked on the school funding
 
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
commission last summer
 
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
will become foundational to that
 
00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
particular case as it goes forward
 
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
yeah only the attorneys know okay
 
00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:49.919 align:start position:0%

the department of education

um there is already an rsa rsa 189
 
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
11a which prohibits the public
 
00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:05.839 align:start position:0%

meal or who owe a debt the prohibition
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
um the the issue of prohibiting a child
 
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%

4330-2 so that's already taken care of
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
then as far as communicating anything to
 
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
the parents instead of the children
 
00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
is also covered in federal guidelines
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
and if we look at this
 
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
there have not been any issues uh
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
there's already
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
clear language on that communication in
 
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
the cfr and also in some of the other
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
roles that are there
 
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240 align:start position:0%

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
near and dear to my heart as somebody
 
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:51.680 align:start position:0%

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
already in there and if there's any
 
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
problems we just need to make sure that
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.910 align:start position:0%

turning back well i see you were
 
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%

representative here took a lot of time
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study school
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
meal programs in new hampshire public
 
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.269 align:start position:0%
meal programs in new hampshire public
schools

00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
and non-secretariat schools that accept
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
public funds
 
00:14:31.279 --> 00:14:37.509 align:start position:0%
public funds
uh

00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative allard for motion thank

that house bill 203 the ito
 
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
i'll second represent leon second set
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
prep salary like to speak to your motion
 
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair just briefly
 
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
school meals programs have been
 
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
instituted and evolving since the 1930s
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire they have been studied
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
six ways to sunday uh and
 
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
this this particular bill in light of
 
00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
202 being itl
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
this bill becomes superfluous so
 
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
great volume of superfluous bills
 
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire i would
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
suggest we withdraw it
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
do you have anything to add uh no i
 
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
think that that's whatsoever
 
00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
perhaps that mullen i'll jump right in
 
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
here thank you mr chairman
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
um poor sherry white i'm sure that she
 
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:55.670 align:start position:0%
um poor sherry white i'm sure that she
uh

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
is has had enough of house education
 
00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.110 align:start position:0%
is has had enough of house education
because

00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
i understand that representative leon
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
spent some time with her
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh gathering information about school
 
00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
lunches perhaps
 
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know but uh i spent an hour with
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
her last week
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
and um while i concur
 
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
that we it'll the previous bill
 
00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:19.519 align:start position:0%
because the three points that
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative oregon needed to make had
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
already been made
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
my conversation with sherry white really
 
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
revealed the fact that we still have
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions about the
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
difference between the federal
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
regulations the state level regulations
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
and the local regulations
 
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that in my discussion
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
with her
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
we talked about the fact that local
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
school boards
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
develop their own lunch charging
 
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.710 align:start position:0%
develop their own lunch charging
policies

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
policies
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
and that they vary from school to school
 
00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
she indicated to me that she has some
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
private schools that do in fact
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
participate in the usda program and some
 
00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
public schools that don't
 
00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
that have privatized their programs uh
 
00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
and also that there are differences in
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
regulation between federal state and
 
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:11.990 align:start position:0%
regulation between federal state and
local

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
local
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
statutes so i i um
 
00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:17.839 align:start position:0%
i i would like to recommend that we go
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
ahead with the study committee
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
if for no other reason than to develop
 
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
a list of specific questions to be
 
00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:26.230 align:start position:0%
a list of specific questions to be
answered

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
answered
 
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think we need to reinvent the
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
wheel but
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
we had a lot of discussion the last time
 
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
around about no children going hungry
 
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
and my apologies again for not being
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
here for the discussion on 202 but
 
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
the federal regulations say that we only
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
have to provide a safety net k-3
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
grades k through three and uh
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of kids grades four
 
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
through 12
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
who may in fact need some sort of
 
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
clarification or intervention
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
on what happens if you're hungry at
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
school and you're
 
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
not a free and reduced lunch student
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
because if you're a free and reduced
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
lunch student you're okay
 
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
but if you're not then at the moment
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
middle school and high school
 
00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:12.799 align:start position:0%
kids don't get fed if their accounts are
 
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
in arrears if their local
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
school board has that as the charging
 
00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.549 align:start position:0%
school board has that as the charging
policy

00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
so i i i will stop there
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
and not talk for an hour but say that i
 
00:18:25.039 --> 00:18:25.510 align:start position:0%
and not talk for an hour but say that i
would

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
um i would encourage that we move
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
forward with the study committee
 
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent tanner
 
00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:37.039 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair can you hear me
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
okay yes
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
um so i have uh two observations
 
00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:45.039 align:start position:0%
on this one is that um in newport
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
there's a group who actually do backpack
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
uh meals for the kids um for weekends
 
00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:53.029 align:start position:0%
uh meals for the kids um for weekends
and

00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
and school holidays and
 
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
other times when they go without food
 
00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
and there's also the issue that
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
during this pandemic schools have become
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
the center for people to get food
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
and a lot of people have moved uh from
 
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
being kind of on the edge to maybe being
 
00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
to the point where they now
 
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
could uh qualify for free and reduced
 
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
hot lunch um
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
but i think that because of that because
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
we see
 
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
i i mean you see the overwhelming
 
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
numbers of kids
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
now getting lunches uh and
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
actually being fed i think it's
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
something that
 
00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
as a state we need to address
 
00:19:41.679 --> 00:19:42.390 align:start position:0%
as a state we need to address
particularly

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
with representative mullen's uh insight
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
state regulations and the federal
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
regulations and the local regulations
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
i think we need to come up with some
 
00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:53.990 align:start position:0%
i think we need to come up with some
directives

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
directives
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
if not anything else and i i don't think
 
00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
um a major lift to have a committee
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
on this to study it for next year thank
 
00:20:03.919 --> 00:20:05.510 align:start position:0%
on this to study it for next year thank
you

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
is it possible for the department of
 
00:20:07.679 --> 00:20:08.710 align:start position:0%
is it possible for the department of
education

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
with uh miss white uh form a group over
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
there to do
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
exactly what you were just talking about
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative owens
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
i wish i could answer that question for
 
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
you representative i don't know
 
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
i certainly would be happy to
 
00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.029 align:start position:0%
i certainly would be happy to
participate

00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
participate
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
in something like that but i i don't
 
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
know what
 
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
what ms white's intention was she did
 
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
know that we had a study
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:44.149 --> 00:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
go ahead and represent um just you know
 
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
if we had our committee then certainly
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
we would
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
have uh sherry white and and people
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
uh that could come in and give us
 
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
information and give us some statistics
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
on what is actually happening in
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and i think that that uh
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
just adds one more
 
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
check to why we should have a committee
 
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
on this particular subject thank you
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
my only question there was do we need to
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
have a legislative committee do that
 
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
when the department has the capability
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
of putting a group together
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
to you know review and discuss uh the
 
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
the pluses and the minuses associated
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
with the uh
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh further further further represent
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair right now as an
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
economist i value data
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure that uh our others on this
 
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
committee do as well
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh right now our data wouldn't be very
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
good because we are we have waivers
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
where everybody's getting the free
 
00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:45.909 align:start position:0%
where everybody's getting the free
lunches

00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:45.919 align:start position:0%
lunches
 
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
um i know that this this seems like a
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
very intriguing area but right now this
 
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be comparable to what
 
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
happens on the other side of this
 
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.350 align:start position:0%
happens on the other side of this
pandemic

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
so i think asking some questions and
 
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
just trying to get a better
 
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
understanding makes sense but right
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
now having a committee to review what's
 
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
happening when we're in the middle of an
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
unprecedented shift
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
isn't going to inform laws that we would
 
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:13.280 align:start position:0%

provisions as well as the manifest
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%

00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:07.039 align:start position:0%
provisions it adds the ability
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
for a student to transfer to a public
 
00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:10.789 align:start position:0%
for a student to transfer to a public
school

00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
public academy or an approved private
 
00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.390 align:start position:0%
public academy or an approved private
school

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that throughout the
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
in addition um
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
on page two at the top lines
 
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
four through seven you'll see
 
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
that if the student is reassigned to a
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
private school
 
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
that school may charge tuition to the
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
parent or may enter
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
into an agreement for tuition with the
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
ascending school district and that is
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
the same language
 
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
that is found in the existing
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
statute which is
 
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
should be on page 3 lines 22
 
00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
proceeding on you'll see several more
 
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
areas where we added the
 
00:27:20.549 --> 00:27:20.559 align:start position:0%
approved private school
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh in
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
on page four on lines nine
 
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
through thirteen uh or really that whole
 
00:27:30.559 --> 00:27:31.029 align:start position:0%
through thirteen uh or really that whole
section

00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:31.039 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
day in current statute
 
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh it specifies that this
 
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
school district or public academy may
 
00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:41.669 align:start position:0%
school district or public academy may
deny

00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
deny
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
but cannot base that decision on
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
the disability of a child
 
00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
so we added in there that if a parent
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
believed that denial was based on a
 
00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.430 align:start position:0%
believed that denial was based on a
disability

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
disability
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
we referred to several provisions
 
00:28:06.789 --> 00:28:06.799 align:start position:0%
uh for appeal that the department
 
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
consuming to the
 
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
state board that the parent would have
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
as well as their ability to file a
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
complaint with the human rights
 
00:28:18.149 --> 00:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
commission both
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
going on on page four also you'll see
 
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.230 align:start position:0%
going on on page four also you'll see
several

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
several
 
00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:30.559 align:start position:0%
places where we remove non-sectarian
 
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
language in accordance with the
 
00:28:40.389 --> 00:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
and again on the last page page

thank you mr chairman uh i've got i have
major

00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
major
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh issues with this uh first of all
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
we spent significant amount of time
 
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
last session dealing with the current
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
outline for manifest hardship we had a
 
00:29:50.159 --> 00:29:51.590 align:start position:0%
outline for manifest hardship we had a
subcommittee

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
we work with the school boards
 
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
association and we outlined that
 
00:29:57.909 --> 00:29:57.919 align:start position:0%
that was just last year so this this
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
bill hasn't really been had a chance to
 
00:30:00.149 --> 00:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
even be
 
00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
implemented this year so i
 
00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%
i first question is seriousness
 
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
of radically changing this bill
 
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
after we had a lot of time a lot of
 
00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.149 align:start position:0%
after we had a lot of time a lot of
conversation

00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
to form the current piece of statute
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
then mr chairman i've got a major
 
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
concern is because
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
the current the initial proposal
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
cited 193 colon
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
2 dash a
 
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
this bill refers to 93
 
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
colon 3. so it changes
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
the initial presentation of this bill
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
and i'm i i seriously question whether
 
00:30:50.399 --> 00:30:50.789 align:start position:0%
and i'm i i seriously question whether
this

00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:50.799 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
amendment is appropriate because of its
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
change not only in the change in the
 
00:30:59.190 --> 00:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
cited statute
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
but in the content of this amendment
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
and i would like to request the clerk
 
00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
to clarify whether or not this is
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
germaine this bill is germaine
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
this amendment is germane to the initial
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
bill as proposed
 
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
because it seems to me that the the it's
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
a major change
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
and that a frankly a hearing
 
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
should be conducted on this amendment
 
00:31:29.509 --> 00:31:29.519 align:start position:0%
before this committee act so i would
 
00:31:30.549 --> 00:31:30.559 align:start position:0%
like to have
 
00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919 align:start position:0%
the clerk give a ruling on exactly the
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
status of this amendment as it relates
 
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
to his germaness
 
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
one and two whether or not the content
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
would demand a public hearing on it
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
before we can
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
conclude it in executive session so i'd
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
like that request to be
 
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh dealt with the clerk first before we
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
thanks very much mr chair um i um
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
concur with everything representative
 
00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519 align:start position:0%
miler just um just said i think when we
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
when we heard the bill back on
 
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
march 4th it was really clear that the
 
00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:17.830 align:start position:0%
march 4th it was really clear that the
um

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
that the language that um that
 
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
the bill was based on um was was not
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
currently in statute at all and had no
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
connection with the um with the
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
substantial work that this committee did
 
00:32:31.679 --> 00:32:32.389 align:start position:0%
substantial work that this committee did
uh

00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:35.509 --> 00:32:35.519 align:start position:0%
two years ago with respect to manifest
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
educational hardship
 
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
and um and then further i think when you
 
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
take a look at um
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
at some of the some of the changes
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
that have now been uh suggested in the
 
00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.269 align:start position:0%
that have now been uh suggested in the
amendment

00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
based on uh finally based on
 
00:32:55.029 --> 00:32:55.039 align:start position:0%
the the current statute so that's a
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
that's a huge improvement i'm not
 
00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not uh you know denying that that at
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
least we're starting with current
 
00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.310 align:start position:0%
least we're starting with current
statute

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
but but the changes for example on page
 
00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
four the amendment lines nine through
 
00:33:07.279 --> 00:33:08.470 align:start position:0%
four the amendment lines nine through
thirteen

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
thirteen
 
00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
that that was never even contemplated in
 
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
the original
 
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
in the original bill and and now you're
 
00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.269 align:start position:0%
in the original bill and and now you're
actually

00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
holding non-resident public school
 
00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.430 align:start position:0%
holding non-resident public school
districts

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
accountable for decisions
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
to you know affecting um
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
uh intake of students from outside of
 
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
their district
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
i mean we we we had no hearing on this i
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
mean this affects
 
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
every school district in the state
 
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
um uh uh in their decision-making
 
00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.669 align:start position:0%
um uh uh in their decision-making
capacity

00:33:41.669 --> 00:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%
to to enroll out of district students i
 
00:33:44.559 --> 00:33:44.950 align:start position:0%
to to enroll out of district students i
mean

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
i i i think this is such a an enormous
 
00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.029 align:start position:0%
i i i think this is such a an enormous
change

00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
um uh that um that that it
 
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
certainly deserves a public hearing and
 
00:33:58.789 --> 00:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
you know if there's no um you know if
 
00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
no uh you know deadline or timeline
 
00:34:05.909 --> 00:34:05.919 align:start position:0%
um on the bill that that prohibits it
 
00:34:05.919 --> 00:34:07.029 align:start position:0%
um on the bill that that prohibits it
from

00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh from uh necessarily have us having to
 
00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.109 align:start position:0%
uh from uh necessarily have us having to
execute

00:34:11.109 --> 00:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
execute
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh or requires it to be exact today then
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
i would i would suggest that we
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
we open open the door uh maybe put it on
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
put it on a subsequent week for a
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i'll just point
 
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
out that
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
the section previously just mentioned
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
on page four d
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh it is current statute that
 
00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh the decision of a school district
 
00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
to deny enrollment uh cannot be based
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
on uh disability of a child that's
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
current statute
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
line right excuse me um
 
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
so all we are doing is uh adding that
 
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
the parent has the ability to appeal
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
that decision
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
which again is a current statute and
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh filing a complaint with the disrupted
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
commission for human rights um which is
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
also in statute
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
is an option so are you
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
are you suggesting that just because all
 
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
you're doing is adding stuff
 
00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
to existing statute that that
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
transparency goes out the window and
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
public input
 
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what uh what is
 
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
intended by public input goes out the
 
00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.630 align:start position:0%
intended by public input goes out the
window

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
window
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
well when you're when you're when you're
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
when you're just dismissing
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh something is being innocuous it's
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
just an addition to
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
current statute we don't need to take
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
any public input
 
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
i think that's a total breakdown of the
 
00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:55.599 align:start position:0%
legislative process
 
00:35:59.190 --> 00:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
and and and you know denies uh granite
 
00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.150 align:start position:0%
and and and you know denies uh granite
staters

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
staters
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh their right to weigh in on um
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
all you're doing is
 
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
transparency in providing parents with
 
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
um what is in current statute with their
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
abilities under law
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i think you're arguing it on the
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
merits and i think that's fine glenn
 
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
i'm arguing the process which which i
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
think is about is opaque
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
and and does not allow public
 
00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:33.990 align:start position:0%
and and does not allow public
participation

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
participation
 
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman i'd just like
 
00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
to clarify something
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
193 dash column 2
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
which ridley reference was probably a
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
bad reference because it doesn't exist
 
00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
and repealed in
 
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
1990 so adding a 2a they're in the two
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
so that was probably a mistake 193.3
 
00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:08.079 align:start position:0%
is the correct place to put it so
 
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
and an argument with uh what was said
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
before 193.2
 
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist then looks like oh well
 
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
that's probably messed up
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
it should have been in 193 and it was
 
00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.829 align:start position:0%
it should have been in 193 and it was
covered

00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
covered
 
00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
the bill was covered the rsa
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
further further discussion representing
 
00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:30.870 align:start position:0%
further further discussion representing
woodside

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%

i was waiting to hear from your response
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
from the request from
 
00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:58.400 align:start position:0%

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
i didn't know if you were denying his
 
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
request or this goes
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
it goes to the clerk afterwards i know
 
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%

well i'm going to let you know right now
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%

00:38:11.839 --> 00:38:13.270 align:start position:0%
i'm denying the request i see this
journey

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
journey
 
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um if i may then move your
 
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.270 align:start position:0%
thank you um if i may then move your
representative

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh on page
 
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
three uh
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
line line three through six let's talk
 
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
it's um actually it's actually line four
 
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
where it says the district in which the
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
student resides
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
i realize this is current shall pay the
 
00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
tuition for the district
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
to the child but in the in the uh
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
start of the bill um it indicates that
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
the the tuition may be
 
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
paid for by the parent in in page 2
 
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
of that 456 area the new language h
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
says it may be charged to the parent um
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
and agreeing with the school district or
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
tuition so i'm trying to decide why
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
find out if h is accurate that the
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
school district must pay
 
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
why on page two lines four five and six
 
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
does the parent get
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead uh yes i believe on those two
 
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
sections where we add the ability
 
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
for um the parent to pay or a
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
payment agreement um those will lead to
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
approved private schools as opposed to
 
00:39:29.109 --> 00:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
would you just just well representative
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
but isn't that contrary because on page
 
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
three it
 
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
says in current law that the district
 
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
shall pay
 
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
it's not will or may it says shall we
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
and then you're
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
saying on the on four five and six
 
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
that's contrary to the current
 
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
if i'm understanding correctly on page
 
00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.030 align:start position:0%
if i'm understanding correctly on page
three

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
he added if they're assigned to a public
 
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
or public academy
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
then the tuition payment
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
provisions applied in the lines of five
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
and six so
 
00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
one for so clear it's my own mind so
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
that the page
 
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
two four five and six only
 
00:40:23.589 --> 00:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
uh is relevant if they're going to a
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
private academy
 
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
and not a public school is that what you
 
00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.069 align:start position:0%
and not a public school is that what you
mean

00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
right line five it says an approved
 
00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:31.839 align:start position:0%
private school
 
00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
okay so that okay okay
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
so no there's no ratio there it's just
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
okay it goes that way
 
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for that uh
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
correction or understanding
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative yeah so you since
 
00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:51.589 align:start position:0%
uh representative yeah so you since
you've

00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
you've
 
00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:54.079 align:start position:0%
just now given notice to denying my
 
00:40:54.079 --> 00:40:54.790 align:start position:0%

am i correct you're denying my request
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
clerk to intervene on a clarification of
 
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
the germaness of this particular bill
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
i'm saying that i'm i'm saying that
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
it's in my opinion that this amendment
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
which deals with manifest education
 
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
hardship as the internet
 
00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
introduced bill does is germane i
 
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
understand that's what you're saying
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
i'm asking for the clerk's opinion not
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
your opinion you may go to the clerk
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
that you so desire
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
well i i would do that that's what i'm
 
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
requesting right now
 
00:41:34.309 --> 00:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
as we're discussing this if you
 
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
if you feel it's not germany you may go
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
to the clerk
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
but i see it is jermaine
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
it's dealing with exactly the same topic
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
that we have had in the bill that was
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
introduced yes there was
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
a error in the first bill in terms of
 
00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
reference to the proper statute
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
this is making that correction i
 
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
further discussion well i challenge the
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
ruling of the chair
 
00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:06.319 align:start position:0%

so i'm saying uh some emotional be
 
00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:20.240 align:start position:0%

challenge
 
00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes you may thank you i just
 
00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
again i i don't mean to be an
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
obstructionist here but i do believe
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
that with the work that we did last year
 
00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
that included the school community
 
00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559 align:start position:0%
and legislators that this bill
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
basically changes that substantively
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
and i believe that it needs a hearing
 
00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
that's all i'm asking for was to take
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
some time to have a hearing on this
 
00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
to really look at it because it is a
 
00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
significant bill
 
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
that um that we we have spent time on
 
01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
and that's all i'm asking for rick is to
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh i'm challenge the chair because i do
 
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
believe that there needs to be
 
01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
a hearing on this bill thank you
 
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%

with this house education committee
 
01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
on this particular manifest hardship

01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
amendment that replaces the bill uh
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%

have no voice in this
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
uh the public has no voice in this and

bill

01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:51.039 align:start position:0%
and have a hearing at a later date
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
that we could have people come in like
 
01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
barrett christina and actually talk
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
about this amendment and um how it
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
how it's going to actually change what
 
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
what has been done
 
01:03:07.029 --> 01:03:07.039 align:start position:0%
uh and what's going on right now out in
 
01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
the public schools because we have no
 
01:03:08.799 --> 01:03:10.309 align:start position:0%
the public schools because we have no
idea

01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
idea
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
after that bill was changed um what went
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
on out in the
 
01:03:17.349 --> 01:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
in the public schools um i think that's
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
that's really important and i would like
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
a ruling from you whether
 
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
you would actually um entertain a motion
 
01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:23.670 align:start position:0%
you would actually um entertain a motion
to

01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
to have to recess and um
 
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
have a hearing where we could get some
 
01:03:32.789 --> 01:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
input on this bill thank you
 
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
we already have a motion on the floor
 
01:03:36.069 --> 01:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
representative cornelli
 
01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you i would just uh
 
01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
indicate that the original
 
01:03:42.799 --> 01:03:50.950 align:start position:0%
indicate that the original
talk

01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
so that was the main
 
01:03:59.430 --> 01:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
focus of the amendment as well as
 
01:04:03.670 --> 01:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
the placement in statute so i do not see
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
representative thank you representative
 
01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:11.109 align:start position:0%
representative thank you representative
vlad

01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
vlad
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
just just a point of cl point of
 
01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.309 align:start position:0%
just just a point of cl point of
information

01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
um this is a new new idea a new bill
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
and the last bill we had 126 people
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
uh sign into that bill of that only
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
four were in favor 122 of the public
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
were against the the bill
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
at a public hearing so it seemed to me
 
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
this is a pretty important bill
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
and since it's significantly different
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
we at least allow the public
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
since there's an overwhelming group
 
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
against it to bring back their ideas to
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
make this better
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
i think it's unfair that you you're
 
01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
doing this representative
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
at this time i think you're hearing as
 
01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
well well uh and i understand the
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
procedural motion
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
you're sitting there you can make the
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
you can make a ruling to retain or
 
01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:55.990 align:start position:0%
you can make a ruling to retain or
recess

01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
recess
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
this bill so the public can get involved
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
further discussions
 
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
yes um i'm not sure why we're going on
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
about this the changes that are in this
 
01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:16.789 align:start position:0%
about this the changes that are in this
bill

01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
were presented before the public
 
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
they were put on the wrong wording of
 
01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
the bill

discussion
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
yes just briefly there's been a number
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
of bills and
 
01:10:02.149 --> 01:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
other committees and even in the senate
 
01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
on the same issue
 
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh and trying to get more information
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
from other states the problem is new
 
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire's laws are a lot different
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
than other states on
 
01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
suing reliability and whatnot so i
 
01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
recommend that we retain this
 
01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh keep in mind that all retain bills i
 
01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
believe still have to be out by november
 
01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:23.990 align:start position:0%
believe still have to be out by november
first

01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
so this gives us some time to see if
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
anything happens in new hampshire and
 
01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:28.550 align:start position:0%
anything happens in new hampshire and

01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%

01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
