parts to run the microphone will pick up
 
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
every sound we care about side
 
00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:26.070 align:start position:0%

conversations
 
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
those will also be picked up in the
 
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.150 align:start position:0%
those will also be picked up in the
background

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:30.160 align:start position:0%

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
noise up
 
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:39.200 align:start position:0%

to share the uh the amendment number
 
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:19.519 align:start position:0%

00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
that's just for the record two zero two
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%

mr chairman to yield for you to um talk
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
that's our problem so with this
 
00:11:29.279 --> 00:11:30.069 align:start position:0%
that's our problem so with this
amendment

00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
first of all just to clarify the
 
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
underlying senate bill of 92 that was
 
00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:35.839 align:start position:0%
presented to the committee
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
um in addition to having sections on
 
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
bail he'd have a
 
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
section on involving background checks
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
to the mark
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer he was being
 
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
hired and also had a section on
 
00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
vandalism or instructional property
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
those sections have been stripping uh
 
00:11:55.519 --> 00:11:56.310 align:start position:0%
those sections have been stripping uh
respect

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
respect
 
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
to candidates for uh to be hired
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
as a police officer this party uh we
 
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
passed senate bill
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
i believe the house bill 530
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
and that was also passed in the senate
 
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.150 align:start position:0%
and that was also passed in the senate
so

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
there was no under any circumstance
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
there was no need to pass the same
 
00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.069 align:start position:0%
there was no need to pass the same
section

00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
twice so that
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
i will check the docket right now i
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
don't know the status of that i know
 
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
it was voted on my incentive for
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
the recognition pass so that should be
 
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
on its way at some point to the
 
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
corner off of the executive office for
 
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh consideration
 
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
so with respect to what this what this
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
change is and i'll focus on section
 
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
a1 and you see that there's a series of
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
lists of expenses that are listed there
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
what is consistent with these offenses
 
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
and although
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
they vary between murder rape sexual
 
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.829 align:start position:0%
they vary between murder rape sexual
assault

00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839 align:start position:0%
assault
 
00:13:04.829 --> 00:13:04.839 align:start position:0%
different forms of battery and child
 
00:13:04.839 --> 00:13:06.069 align:start position:0%
different forms of battery and child
pornography

00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
pornography
 
00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519 align:start position:0%
they all involve a crime against an
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
individual person as opposed to
 
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
a crime against a property or a white
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
collar crime
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
what it does it changed it from being a
 
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
72 hours
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
being held for up to 72 hours excluding
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
weekends and holidays
 
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
you then have the entertainment or the
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
bail commission hearing what this does
 
00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:31.519 align:start position:0%
is it lowered that for 24 to 36 hours
 
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
the 36 hours would be ineffective
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
depending on when the arrest itself is
 
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.230 align:start position:0%
depending on when the arrest itself is
made

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
the problem with that is if someone's
 
00:13:40.949 --> 00:13:40.959 align:start position:0%
arrested around eight nine o'clock in
 
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
the morning on a weekday
 
00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
they may not make the court in time to
 
00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
be arraigned that day so that's why you
 
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
change it for 36 hours for the members
 
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
on the committee
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh who served in the committee last term
 
00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:54.020 align:start position:0%
we had a similar issue where
 
00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.189 align:start position:0%
we had a similar issue where
[Music]

00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
a person they may not be from a time
 
00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.470 align:start position:0%
a person they may not be from a time
perspective

00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
if they're processing the person while
 
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
they're in custody
 
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
these violent offenses and crimes
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
against individuals
 
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
and also who's felony use for firearm
 
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
under sex rsa
 
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
650-8 on cold war
 
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
it would be 24 hours excluding weekends
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
and holidays
 
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
the courts are not open on the weekend
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
so if you were arrested on saturday
 
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
there's not much that can be done with
 
00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:22.959 align:start position:0%
respect to that
 
00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
unless we have the courts open on the
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
weekend which i don't believe anyone's
 
00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.710 align:start position:0%
weekend which i don't believe anyone's
advocate

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
i under the current law it this is that
 
00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:33.519 align:start position:0%
is consistent with how the war is today
 
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
with the irs on the weekend the report's
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
not open there are circumstances where
 
00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
you would be
 
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
held uh the next
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
next day the court is over if you are
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
charged one of these
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
violent offenses or crimes against the
 
00:14:48.079 --> 00:14:50.150 align:start position:0%
violent offenses or crimes against the
person

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
you would go directly you have an
 
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
arraignment before the court as opposed
 
00:14:53.839 --> 00:14:54.230 align:start position:0%
arraignment before the court as opposed
to

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:56.839 align:start position:0%
a hearing book without the bail
 
00:14:56.839 --> 00:14:58.150 align:start position:0%
a hearing book without the bail
commission

00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
and that person would have
 
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
could be retained uh detained if
 
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
the the uh the state isn't able to make
 
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
a demonstration by clear and convincing
 
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.750 align:start position:0%
a demonstration by clear and convincing
evidence

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
that by releasing the person they posing
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
danger to themselves
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
or to any member of the public including
 
00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:17.839 align:start position:0%
these residents
 
00:15:20.949 --> 00:15:20.959 align:start position:0%
so by being charged with one of these
 
00:15:22.949 --> 00:15:22.959 align:start position:0%
there's no uh consumptive burden
 
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
on our at the person being charged
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
that's not common
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
it's going to fall on the individual
 
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
who's been charged
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
and if that's it's going to be some
 
00:15:35.189 --> 00:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
fallen state
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
the state would have to present evidence
 
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
why they feel someone
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
committed or charges that offense to
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
remain together
 
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
it can also if a person is then held
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
under that paragraph
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
meaning the state would have to meet
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
their burden for proof that the person
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
poses a danger to themselves
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
the individual does have a right to
 
00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
request a subsequent hearing that
 
00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839 align:start position:0%
is under romanian four remember four
 
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
would allow the defendant to then call
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
they would be able to present any
 
00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
evidence that they wish if they wish to
 
00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:17.670 align:start position:0%
evidence that they wish if they wish to
over

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
try to overcome a challenge that you're
 
00:16:20.079 --> 00:16:20.710 align:start position:0%
try to overcome a challenge that you're
interested

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
interested
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
also you also in the circuit board there
 
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
is a procedure
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
that you could appeal it to the superior
 
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.790 align:start position:0%
that you could appeal it to the superior
court

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519 align:start position:0%
but in the short term you would be able
 
00:16:31.519 --> 00:16:31.829 align:start position:0%
but in the short term you would be able
to

00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:34.839 align:start position:0%
have a full evidentiary hearing
 
00:16:34.839 --> 00:16:36.790 align:start position:0%
have a full evidentiary hearing
involving

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
involving
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
my testimony if that's of course a
 
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
personal wishes to take
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
the other section in it what it did
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
what i did was that this amendment
 
00:16:47.279 --> 00:16:49.670 align:start position:0%
what i did was that this amendment
rewrites

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
rewrites
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
well i thought it would capture the
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
intent of the paragraphs when we look at
 
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
our roman numeral three uh section b
 
00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
two uh the original bill there was some
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
confusion on
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
how that that would operate in other
 
00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.429 align:start position:0%
how that that would operate in other
words

00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
words
 
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
assumption whether what's the standard
 
00:17:09.669 --> 00:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
along with the evidence there was some
 
00:17:09.679 --> 00:17:11.909 align:start position:0%
along with the evidence there was some
confusion

00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:11.919 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
what this does is
 
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:20.959 align:start position:0%
to do in cases where a person who's
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
charged with defense within the last
 
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
three years has
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
uh failed to appear at subsequent
 
00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:27.510 align:start position:0%
uh failed to appear at subsequent
coordinators

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
coordinators
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
so an example would be you have a
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
suppression hearing just
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
press you know research you know
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
some of the governance from the area and
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
you have the police officer who's going
 
00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
prosecutor a county attorney president
 
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
you can have a court president
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
everyone's going to be present
 
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
but if the person driving does not
 
00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.830 align:start position:0%
but if the person driving does not
appear

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
appear
 
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
they normally they would be considered
 
00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
being in default
 
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
well if a person fails to appear at
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
subsequent coordinators
 
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
three times um
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
in a three year period or two times on
 
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
the present case
 
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
and the case that they fail to appear on
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
is a felony
 
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
a class a misdemeanor or drunk driving
 
00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:15.909 align:start position:0%
a class a misdemeanor or drunk driving
that

00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
that under that case by the state can
 
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
show by preponderance
 
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
if a person has done that that person
 
00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.510 align:start position:0%
if a person has done that that person
would

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
then be detained now
 
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
and the reason why is that there's a
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
finding that
 
00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
a person is detained on that section the
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
assumption is that the person is not
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
going to appear at the next quarter so
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
they would have had to commit that
 
00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
or default three times in a three-year
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
period so
 
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that there's anything
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
egregious about that if a person
 
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
continuously does not show up for court
 
00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
hearings to arrive at the conclusion
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
that if we release the person
 
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
it's unlikely that they will appear at
 
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
the next court hearing well
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
there is a track record for that but
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
again and that can be over or
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
you can overcome that that finding an
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
example i kind of came up with
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
hypothetical if there's a person in the
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
hospital but doesn't notify the court
 
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
well that person would be defaulting
 
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
because they didn't appear
 
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
but i highly doubt that that a judge or
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
the court would
 
00:19:17.669 --> 00:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
hold that default uh you know in a
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
prejudicial management person especially
 
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
their their reason for not showing up
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
the what remains the same is the um
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
this doesn't compose or change anything
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
to do with
 
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
the idea of cash bail i understand that
 
00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of discussions on the
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
cash bail and how that can have a
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
discriminatory effect and have a
 
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
hardship on certain
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
people they they don't want people being
 
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
held on a thousand dollar bail simply
 
00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
because a person cannot
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
pay a post that bit
 
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
so that that that if a person is
 
00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
as assessely cash bail and they're
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
unable to pay it
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to demonstrate
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
without the demonstration by clearing
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
that by requiring a cash flow
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
that that will assure that the person
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
will appear at the next year
 
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
so that's a higher burden
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
than hypothesis then under section
 
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
three c this has to move a person
 
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
is released on veil already
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
and they're charged with a felony class
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
or drunk driving and they get arrested
 
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.710 align:start position:0%
or drunk driving and they get arrested
again

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
and they're before a felony classity
 
00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.870 align:start position:0%
and they're before a felony classity
machine

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
machine
 
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
with drunk driving and then so now i'm
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
that there will be a presumption fine
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
the state will have the excuse the
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
statewide the burden of proof
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
of probable cause that that person will
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
not abide by the conditions of their
 
00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:09.510 align:start position:0%
not abide by the conditions of their
release

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
release
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
when a person is released on bail is
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
i want to say universally always a
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
condition that you don't commit any
 
00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.669 align:start position:0%
condition that you don't commit any
offenses

00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
in this case this does not include class
 
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
b misdemeanors the reason for that is
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
if a person is charged with the class b
 
00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.870 align:start position:0%
if a person is charged with the class b
misdemeanor

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
that person would not be facing any gl
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
time so it wouldn't
 
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
make a lot of sense to hold a person
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
named custody for committing a classmate
 
00:21:35.039 --> 00:21:36.390 align:start position:0%
named custody for committing a classmate
misdemeanor

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
or to provoke their conditions of their
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
release or revoke their bail
 
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
because of that when the underlying
 
00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.070 align:start position:0%
because of that when the underlying
defensemen

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
defensemen
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
actually improve jail again this can be
 
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
these all can be rebutted
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
under the hearing discussion in section
 
00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.870 align:start position:0%
under the hearing discussion in section
four

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
but again the reason why that standard
 
00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
is probable cause
 
00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the evidence because this
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
has to do with someone who's being
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
arrested and that's the standard for
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
wrestling so that you want the burdens
 
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
findings to be consistent consistent
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%
burden of proof throughout the process
 
00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
since you're dealing with subsequent
 
00:22:11.679 --> 00:22:13.029 align:start position:0%
since you're dealing with subsequent
arrests

00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
arrests
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
so there was a case i know last year
 
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
where there was a person in new
 
00:22:21.029 --> 00:22:21.039 align:start position:0%
hampshire in a two month time period was
 
00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:22.070 align:start position:0%
hampshire in a two month time period was
arrested

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
arrested
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
five times for drunk driving in a
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
two-month time period
 
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
and the concern and people ask well what
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
happens happen well because you're not
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
convicted of any crime
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
if there are open charges the person is
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
really being charged with
 
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
five first offenses in the problem the
 
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
reason why that can happen
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
is because of the bail system by the
 
00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.070 align:start position:0%
is because of the bail system by the
third

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
third
 
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
that would happen today by the third
 
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
drug driving
 
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
charge the court would then
 
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
they found probable cause would have the
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
detain the person and not earn these
 
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.230 align:start position:0%
detain the person and not earn these
things

00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
so i i think getting to the point where
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
someone has five of these because
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
i might i don't i don't know the uh
 
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
you know details of the case beyond what
 
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
was reported in the media
 
00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:11.919 align:start position:0%
but what i would say is that what this
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
is trying to do is avoid
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
situations like that we had a case where
 
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
you know if you go back to the other
 
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
paragraph involving the violent offenses
 
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:20.470 align:start position:0%
paragraph involving the violent offenses
that's

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
rule number three that's romeo381
 
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
we had a situation where a person
 
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
committed they were arrested for
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
domestic violence
 
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
and within two hours that person was
 
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
released not
 
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
not they weren't brought before a judge
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
there's a bail commissioner
 
00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
they were released and went back to that
 
00:23:43.039 --> 00:23:43.990 align:start position:0%
they were released and went back to that
person

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
and committed uh sexually sexually
 
00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
assault that first person in front of
 
00:23:47.679 --> 00:23:48.830 align:start position:0%
assault that first person in front of
their

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
child so we're trying to avoid
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
situations where people commit violent
 
00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:53.510 align:start position:0%
situations where people commit violent
crimes

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
crimes
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
against people
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
and then they're released and they
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
commit similar offenses
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
and those egregious situations have
 
00:24:03.039 --> 00:24:03.990 align:start position:0%
and those egregious situations have
happened

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
several times really in a short
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
time period we had a situation where a
 
00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.510 align:start position:0%
time period we had a situation where a
person

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
was broad the person is released
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
and the bra began within a 24-hour time
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
so it's my thought that we're trying to
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
avoid those
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
egregious situations it's the reason why
 
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioners
 
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
would not be making the determination of
 
00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence that's an
 
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
evidentiary that the
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
evidentiary standard it's a burden of
 
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
proof and its belief
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
my thought is that that should be
 
00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
something that is decided by a judge
 
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
decided by the poor and we talk about
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about the crimes that are
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
violent really when it comes to domestic
 
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
violence that's what i'm i'm referring
 
00:24:47.919 --> 00:24:48.630 align:start position:0%
violence that's what i'm i'm referring
to

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
murder rape child pornography these are
 
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
the crimes that i think we
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
we can make a suggestion of our pose a
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
threat to publicly
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
and i think in domestic violence it's
 
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
statistically showing that that's a
 
00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
crime that elevates
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
and is often repeated and on the report
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
so when you have a situation where
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
elevation stop
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
and this is really taking consideration
 
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
by the nature of defense but also to
 
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
protect the victims of these crimes
 
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they're not going to
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
be repeatedly a victim
 
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
of the same curvature so i can answer
 
00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:25.909 align:start position:0%
of the same curvature so i can answer
any

00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
questions about this and hopefully
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative bradley you recognized
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman abbas
 
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
so just to be clear this amendment focus
 
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
so well in respect of roman numeral 3
 
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
a1 yes and that has to do the difference
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
between that section and the other two
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
sections i discussed
 
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
the other two sections discuss violently
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
dividing the conditions of your beliefs
 
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
so you those are not necessarily if you
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
don't show reporting
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
you're not committing a crime but
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
reviving the condition of the police
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
these i say determine violent crimes
 
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
some people make the argument that
 
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
statutory rape is not violent
 
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
maybe violence i'm looking at is that
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
still a serious crime against a person
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
so is it violent in nature perhaps not
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
but i would say the overwhelming
 
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
perpetra all these robbery i think
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
that's violent trafficking of a
 
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
i'm going to consider that to be a
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
serious offense against the person
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
you know this is violence i think that
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
it entails a threat that goes along with
 
00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.710 align:start position:0%
it entails a threat that goes along with
kidnapping

supporting a crime against a child

you can prostitute you convict the
 
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
person they can serve jail time

involving crimes against
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%

00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
represented the defendants
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
and i've represented victims so i've had
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
a very
 
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
hands-on approach with dealing with this
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
and i i don't know
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
if it's if victims
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
truly ever recover from somebody the
 
00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
person can serve jail time
 
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
they pay their debt but i think his own
 
00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:18.559 align:start position:0%
the victim it's a tough situation
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not sure if they ever get
 
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:23.840 align:start position:0%

chair

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
um you're the mission domestic violence
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
and protective orders
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
but aren't those two uh uh
 
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
crimes are aren't they already taken
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
care of
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
in present law
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
yes there the law addresses when you're
 
00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
arrested for domestic violence or
 
00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.630 align:start position:0%
arrested for domestic violence or
violating

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
violating
 
00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
a restraining order if those are already
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
a crime and you're arrested for a crime
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
there are circumstances where you can be
 
00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:01.039 align:start position:0%
held but one of the examples i
 
00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:03.919 align:start position:0%
gave was a person who was arrested for
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and released
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
in within two hours and went back to the
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
alleged victims house
 
00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
and then sexually assault that that
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
person in front of that person's child
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
so i would say is it addressed by the
 
00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
law yes
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
but is it is it doing justice
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
i i think it's not in the interest of
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
the public
 
00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:26.559 align:start position:0%
they have a system where people are
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
being released on these kinds of
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
domestic violence like crimes
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
where they're able to repeal and that's
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
why the state can
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
prove this by clear and convincing
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
evidence that they feel that that person
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
poses any type of threat
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
to whether it's the public or through
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
the u.s victim
 
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
themselves again just because you're
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
arrested for violating a restraining
 
00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.029 align:start position:0%
arrested for violating a restraining
order

00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
order
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
or you're arrested with domestic
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
violence does not mean you're going to
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
be held the state has to demonstrate
 
00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
why they feel that you are a threat to
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
the public now in order to do that we
 
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0%
can talk hypotheticals but there needs
 
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
some some basis maybe the person has
 
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
several other violent convictions on
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
their record
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
maybe the evidence that they have been
 
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
presented during the hearing is
 
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
overwhelming whether there's text
 
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
messages or bruising or
 
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
or it's on video i mean we've seen that
 
00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:19.990 align:start position:0%
or it's on video i mean we've seen that
where

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
things are captured on video so they
 
00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
have situations like that if a person's
 
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
violating a restraining order
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
i understand there's already been
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
already have a victim of abuse
 
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
and now there's an order that's intended
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
to protect that person
 
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
and that person's not complete not
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
following the order
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
now just because someone violates the
 
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
order doesn't mean that they're
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
per se a danger to the public but i
 
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
would say that
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
they're certainly not following the
 
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
order they're unlikely following the
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
conditions of their obese if there is
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
an underlying criminal case so
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think the law sufficiently
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
addresses and provides enough protection
 
00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
however president law does
 
00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
make an exception for uh releasing on
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh without bond
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
for uh crimes of domestic violence
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
and validating a crim a protection order
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
that is in present law
 
00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039 align:start position:0%
the addition of other violent crimes
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
we have to consider that those are
 
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
accused they are not found guilty of
 
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
of having committed those crimes anybody
 
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
can be charged with a crime
 
00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:41.919 align:start position:0%
that without net well evidence
 
00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
so well i while i agree
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
that your amendment does narrow the
 
00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:49.519 align:start position:0%
scope of
 
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
sb 92 i do not think it is ready
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
for becoming law
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
thank thank you in respect to that
 
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
anyone who's arrested who's not on bail
 
00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:04.549 align:start position:0%
anyone who's arrested who's not on bail
or

00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
is going for a bail hearing hasn't been
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
detected so under that
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
logic you wouldn't have any jail system
 
00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.190 align:start position:0%
logic you wouldn't have any jail system
whatsoever

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
so i think it's important to understand
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
that you're not you're right you're not
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
dealing with someone's being addicted
 
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
but the highest burden of proof is
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
beyond a reasonable doubt that's what
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
you need to get the conviction
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
the next step down is clear and
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence if the person is
 
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
simply charged
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
with it with one of these violent
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
offenses and
 
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
the district attorney or the county
 
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
attorney does not have
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
their uh their ducks on the road to
 
00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.190 align:start position:0%
their uh their ducks on the road to
present

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
present
 
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
why that they believe that persons in
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
continued danger simply saying well they
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
were accused of this
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think that comes anywhere close
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
to using the burden of proof
 
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
you would have to provide some type of
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
phys if there is physical evidence or
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
it's photographs
 
00:32:55.029 --> 00:32:55.039 align:start position:0%
often uh whether it's text messages
 
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
in writing and making threats there
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
would need to be more to meet that
 
00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.669 align:start position:0%
would need to be more to meet that
burden

00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
burden
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
that's why they want to actually hold
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
the person and
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
if the state is able to do that
 
00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
the defendant still has the option
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
to then have get a second hearing
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
under paragraph four where they can then
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
summons witnesses to actually appear
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
and testify and demonstrate again
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
why they're not a threat to policy but
 
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
the state can't meet that burden
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
you can be charged with any one of these
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
if they're unable to prove that
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
then the person should not be held i
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
mean that's that's a that's a pretty
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
high burden of food
 
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
for me really you're early on
 
00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
but at this point when you're
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
investigating a crime it's either
 
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
something that just happened or the
 
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
person's been invited if the person's
 
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
been indicted
 
00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
you're going to have a long list of
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
evidence to get gotten to the point
 
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
where you can make that argument
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
if if the crime just happened again
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
they're gonna have to be relying on
 
00:33:58.630 --> 00:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
evidence why they're arresting that
 
00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.710 align:start position:0%
evidence why they're arresting that
person

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
again the surveillance video you're
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
gonna have something
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
to actually demonstrate why remain
 
00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.509 align:start position:0%
to actually demonstrate why remain
attractive

00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:07.519 align:start position:0%
attractive
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
so that's up to the state to meet that
 
00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.750 align:start position:0%
so that's up to the state to meet that
bird

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
representative thank you thank you good
 
00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.109 align:start position:0%
representative thank you thank you good
question

00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
um do we have any statistics
 
00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
on how many people are arrested and what
 
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
percentage of those
 
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
eventually go through the court system
 
00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:29.909 align:start position:0%
eventually go through the court system
and

00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:36.230 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:46.950 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
so from when people are charged with any
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
type of offense and whether they're
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
actually convicted
 
00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
i don't have statistics
 
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
my i'm just speaking generally when you
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
have minor offenses meaning like class b
 
00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.630 align:start position:0%
have minor offenses meaning like class b
misdemeanors

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors
 
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
or a classic involving when it's not a
 
00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
crime against a person
 
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
if if a person there are different type
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
of plea deals that are
 
00:35:13.109 --> 00:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
this guy oh these violent offenses
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
on okay so my understanding i don't have
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
the conviction rate
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
but my understanding that the belief is
 
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
there's about four to five thousand
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
these types of charges per year
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
now it's hard to just because sometimes
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
you can be charged with
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
second degree assault but also first of
 
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
all so some there is a little bit of
 
00:35:35.359 --> 00:35:36.630 align:start position:0%
all so some there is a little bit of
overlap

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
overlap
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
so one incident may involve well
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
the reason why they charge both they may
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
not get
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
first degree to solve this condition but
 
00:35:45.839 --> 00:35:47.109 align:start position:0%
first degree to solve this condition but
so

00:35:47.109 --> 00:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the consensus
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
is there will be about 4
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
000 of these types of arrests
 
00:35:55.349 --> 00:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
involving an individual but that the
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
offense is higher than that for that
 
00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.069 align:start position:0%
offense is higher than that for that
reason

00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:58.079 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
so like child pornography you may have
 
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
several images or pieces of
 
00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
videos or whatever child pornography
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
each one in of itself
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
would involve a potential charge
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to get is
 
00:36:19.349 --> 00:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
how many people who are charged with
 
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
these kinds of defenses
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:55.599 align:start position:0%
i worry about all of them
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
so i don't have the conviction rates and
 
00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
then again
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
just because the person's not convicted
 
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
again if you plead down to something
 
00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.750 align:start position:0%
again if you plead down to something
else

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
the num the numbers can be deceiving but
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
i don't have the exact
 
00:37:06.839 --> 00:37:14.950 align:start position:0%
i don't have the exact
same

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i just had a i had a
 
00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
the specific changes
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh in this amendment uh were any of
 
00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
those actually
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
vetted by the bail commission uh before
 
00:37:34.829 --> 00:37:34.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
so did i are you asking if i even
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
vetted this bill for the bill the bail
 
00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.430 align:start position:0%
vetted this bill for the bill the bail
commission

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
is the amendment that i vetted for them
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
that commission that's either the bill
 
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
or your amendment
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
i did not get the amendment before the
 
00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:54.150 align:start position:0%
i did not get the amendment before the
commission

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh and i will tell you that i don't
 
00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
believe the underlying senator was
 
00:37:58.640 --> 00:37:59.670 align:start position:0%
believe the underlying senator was
either

00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh in respect to the the commission and
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
uh i believe
 
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
vice chairman welsh is a member of that
 
00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
this was something that was before the
 
00:38:07.599 --> 00:38:07.990 align:start position:0%
this was something that was before the
senate

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
there was a public hearing on it and
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
then there was a public hearing for our
 
00:38:11.599 --> 00:38:12.470 align:start position:0%
then there was a public hearing for our
committee

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
as well right
 
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:31.030 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
up to 72 hours of schooling weekends and
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
holidays if they were charged with one
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
of these offenses
 
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
before they were brought to court i
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
dialed that down for 24 to 36 hours
 
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
and explained that why so i
 
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
reduced that time period where person
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
would be held
 
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
and you obviously you still have to take
 
00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
into consideration the weekends and
 
00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:53.829 align:start position:0%
into consideration the weekends and
politics

00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839 align:start position:0%
politics
 
00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
so that's the what this what this did
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
what this also did i because i added the
 
00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
00:39:05.589 --> 00:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
to if they're gonna in order for the
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
person to be held
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
it would be by clear convincing evidence
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
and my understanding
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
and of peace large new hampshire
 
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
if a person is going to be healthy and
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
it's involving a life sentence
 
00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
and if you're going to deny that person
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
bail their
 
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
partner proof would be clear and
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence if you're going to
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
detain your personal life that's that's
 
00:39:29.109 --> 00:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
the existing
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
law in the answer but i am doing not
 
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
some of these offenses as egregious
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
and as they are and violent as they are
 
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
towards a person
 
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
i'm putting that same standard ignorance
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
on a life sentence so it's a higher
 
00:39:41.359 --> 00:39:41.990 align:start position:0%
on a life sentence so it's a higher
standard

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
standard
 
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
in my opinion with more narrow reply to
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
a person being held would say on
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
my domestic violence uh just a
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor address allowance charge
 
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
i'm putting that clearing convincing
 
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
evidence standard that would apply to
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
someone facing a life center so it's
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
i in my opinion it's actually upping or
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
increasing the burden
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
but no it was not invented for folks
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
mr chair i i appreciate the the time and
 
00:40:12.069 --> 00:40:12.079 align:start position:0%
the effort
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh that it took to go through uh the
 
00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:15.190 align:start position:0%
uh that it took to go through uh the
bill

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh and to make these changes and to uh
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
to make these recommendations and i
 
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
think that based on the problem that's
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
before us
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
um it's very possible that uh
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
the members of the dale commission could
 
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
have come up with exactly the same thing
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
um it's also possible that they could
 
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
have come up uh
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
with something very different uh and and
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
part of the problem
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
that i have with the process used to
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
create this bill
 
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
is we will never know that um because
 
00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
we've short-circuited the role of the
 
00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
bail commission uh in this process
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
um so my point isn't necessarily
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
that the changes uh the way that they're
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
framed in this bill
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
are are bad uh
 
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
um the i think the problem is is we had
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
a narrow set of stakeholders
 
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:08.079 align:start position:0%
that actually crafted this bill uh and
 
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
we had two legislators uh following the
 
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
senate hearings
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
who sort of went over the bill again um
 
00:41:15.359 --> 00:41:15.750 align:start position:0%
who sort of went over the bill again um
and

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
and crafted this amendment what we
 
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
really don't have
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
is full representation of all of the
 
00:41:23.589 --> 00:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
different stakeholders
 
00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:26.079 align:start position:0%
on the on the bail commission i think we
 
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
have a lot of representation
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
from the members of of of our police
 
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.510 align:start position:0%
from the members of of of our police
departments

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
departments
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
and i think they're important
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and they should have
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of representation but i think that
 
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
this is a state
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
where where ultimately legislators need
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
to write bills
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
based on the input especially a bill
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
like this
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh that's so complex and with so many
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
moving parts
 
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
we need to write bills advised by by all
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
of the stakeholders not just one narrow
 
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
set of stakeholders
 
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
so that's my issue uh with this bill and
 
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
that's my issue
 
00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.079 align:start position:0%
with this amendment well i
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
can assure you of this that no
 
00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839 align:start position:0%
stakeholder wrote this on that board
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
i will i will assure you of that this
 
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
was something that was worked on
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
uh by myself with the input of another
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
representative who's not a member of the
 
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.470 align:start position:0%
representative who's not a member of the
committee

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
but who has a legal background of their
 
00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.309 align:start position:0%
but who has a legal background of their
own

00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
so this is not something that
 
00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily was
 
00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
this was not written by any organization
 
00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:34.790 align:start position:0%
this was not written by any organization
so

00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
this the way this was written
 
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
i don't care who writes it if i put my
 
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
name on it
 
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
i would stand by it so it wasn't but
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's not not something that would
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
talk i would say it was written by an
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
organization or statement
 
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
i understand that thank you mr chair
 
00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.589 align:start position:0%
i understand that thank you mr chair
representative

00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh i i appreciate
 
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
the chairman's long explanation of this
 
00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:00.790 align:start position:0%
the chairman's long explanation of this
amendment

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
and it confirms my assessment uh of the
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
amendment and that it contains many
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
substantial changes from the original
 
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.069 align:start position:0%
substantial changes from the original
bill

00:43:08.069 --> 00:43:08.079 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
as far as i can tell the language in
 
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
1549 it hasn't been reviewed in a public
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
hearing or work session
 
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
make no mistake this amendment will roll
 
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
back bail reform
 
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
in a large way in new hampshire and in
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
doing so it bypasses the established
 
00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:22.470 align:start position:0%
doing so it bypasses the established
process

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
they'll commission entirely this
 
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
language do not come out of the bail
 
00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:27.430 align:start position:0%
language do not come out of the bail
commission

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
it does not reflect any of the
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
recommendations of the commission as far
 
00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:32.079 align:start position:0%
as i can tell
 
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
and in fact the language contradicts our
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
critical finding from the commission's
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
latest report
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
which specifically states that failures
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
to appear have actually gone down
 
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic in part due to the
 
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
expansion of telephonic
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
check-ins additionally the language in
 
00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
this amendment would impose significant
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
changes to a statute that was modified
 
00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:51.430 align:start position:0%
changes to a statute that was modified
just

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
this past summer since the enactment of
 
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
those reforms we've been in the midst of
 
00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
a pandemic
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
resulting in numerous unprecedented
 
00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
conditions and circumstances
 
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
to me it seems like we've not given the
 
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
most recent statutory change the chance
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
to soak in
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
we've not given the bail commission a
 
00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
chance to review the effects of those
 
00:44:11.119 --> 00:44:11.990 align:start position:0%
chance to review the effects of those
changes

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
and instead of waiting and listening to
 
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
the suggestions of the bail commission
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
this amendment seeks to place the card
 
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
before the horse
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
and push through some substantially
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
complex changes
 
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
how can we expect the bail commission to
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
do their work if we keep moving the
 
00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.150 align:start position:0%
do their work if we keep moving the
target

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
target
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
for this reason alone we should reject
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
this amendment but it's not the only
 
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
compelling reason
 
00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
the second reason to oppose this
 
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
amendment is a financial one
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
as you know county delegations are
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
setting their budgets
 
00:44:41.829 --> 00:44:41.839 align:start position:0%
currently i happen to be on the house of
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
corrections budget subcommittee in
 
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
and they've reduced their budget
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
significantly due to a large reduction
 
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
in jail population
 
00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
due to bail reform if this amendment
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
passes and bail reform is rolled back
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
this can cause a huge budget shortfall
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
of the county level
 
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
now i don't want to be responsible for
 
00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
breaking the bank county level
 
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
and finally another compelling reason to
 
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
reject this amendment is legislative
 
00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:07.750 align:start position:0%
reject this amendment is legislative
liability

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
liability
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
and what do i mean by that this
 
00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:11.839 align:start position:0%
amendment attempts to convert an omnibus
 
00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
bill into a single issue bill which i
 
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
certainly can respect however we must
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
not lose sight of the fact that amending
 
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
will result in a committee of conference
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure that most of you are aware
 
00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
that the committee of conference can
 
00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:26.790 align:start position:0%
that the committee of conference can
generally

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
generally
 
00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
do whatever it wants to with the bill
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
and no doubt the members of the other
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
body will be pushing hard to reinstate
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
the pieces of the bill
 
00:45:36.069 --> 00:45:36.079 align:start position:0%
which we're proposing to remove here
 
00:45:36.079 --> 00:45:37.589 align:start position:0%
which we're proposing to remove here
today

00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
who's going to be selected to be put on
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
that committee of confidence
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
no one knows at that point the members
 
00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
of this committee
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
will not have any real influence over
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
what happens to the bill
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to vote against this 11
 
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
hour amendment i would suggest that
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment were to fail that we
 
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
seriously consider retaining the bill so
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
the committee can use it as a possible
 
00:45:57.359 --> 00:45:57.910 align:start position:0%
the committee can use it as a possible
vehicle

00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
00:45:59.829 --> 00:45:59.839 align:start position:0%
for future changes recommended by the
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
best commissioner
 
00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
and just to clarify there's been less
 
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
court hearings all together
 
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
there was a good portion of the time
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic where the courts
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
weren't open at all unless it was an
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
emergency hearing
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
so yes the video hearings have
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
somewhat resulted in less defaults
 
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
but when the courts were closed in
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
general unless you were it was an
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
emergency hearing
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to have less defaults as
 
00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of having lessons
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
processed in in regards to rolling back
 
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
bail reform
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
respectfully this doesn't roll back the
 
00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:40.710 align:start position:0%
respectfully this doesn't roll back the
entire

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
entire
 
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
failed reform operation this is only
 
00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
applying to
 
00:46:47.589 --> 00:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
violent crimes against crimes against
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
the person
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
once again felonies sexual assaults
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%

00:46:56.069 --> 00:46:56.079 align:start position:0%
children rape and
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
this is not this is not rolling it back
 
00:46:58.800 --> 00:46:59.349 align:start position:0%
this is not this is not rolling it back
on

00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
people who are charged with something to
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
charge and trying to thrive in class
 
00:47:07.109 --> 00:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
in regards to what happens at the
 
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
community conference i hope to be i
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
i can't if this were to pass and it's
 
00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
not concurred by the senate i have no
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
i can't speak to the motives of what
 
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
would happen in there
 
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
um but i know that i if i i said i put
 
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
my name on an amendment
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
i put some time into it and uh
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of suggestions about
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps removing some of the violent
 
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
offenses from this list
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
to make it more to lower the impact on
 
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
the court and the lower the impact of
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
the county for the expenses
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
and the people i've talked to whether
 
00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:44.549 align:start position:0%
and the people i've talked to whether
it's

00:47:44.549 --> 00:47:44.559 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
law enforcement or accounting levels
 
00:47:48.549 --> 00:47:48.559 align:start position:0%
they are supportive
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
of this because of the public safety
 
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
aspect even though it could have any
 
00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:53.270 align:start position:0%
aspect even though it could have any
potential

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
financial impact but i look at these
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
lists of offenses
 
00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
and from a moral perspective i'm not i
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't willing to remove any of these
 
00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:03.829 align:start position:0%
wasn't willing to remove any of these
offenses

00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
and if that if i am to be on the
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
committee of arms just like
 
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
yeah that's not my decision i wouldn't
 
00:48:11.829 --> 00:48:11.839 align:start position:0%
compromise on removing any of these
 
00:48:11.839 --> 00:48:12.549 align:start position:0%
compromise on removing any of these
offenses

00:48:12.549 --> 00:48:12.559 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
just that's just my position i wouldn't
 
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
if i was going to just kind of
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
pass it through my goal is not to just
 
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
pass on the task i would stand by this i
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill i i thought the 72
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
hours was
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
a little uh too much so
 
00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:31.640 align:start position:0%
and i still think it was representative
 
00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:44.220 align:start position:0%
and i still think it was representative

[Music]
 
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
i have a question just for you could you
 
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
tell me who the representative was that
 
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
was speaking just before we can't tell
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
who who's in the room and i or i didn't
 
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
hear it
 
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
understand that that was representative
 
00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.589 align:start position:0%
understand that that was representative

vanderbilt oh okay thank you very much
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
you're staying with everything you've
 
00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:17.910 align:start position:0%
you're staying with everything you've
said

00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
excuse me we're referring to my first
 
00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
and last name just
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
it's just substantive for someone to
 
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
similar to me we have two greens today
 
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
i agree uh with what he says especially
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
the financial part i was on the uh
 
00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
on the uh the jail the way the jail
 
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
works now
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
the in hillsborough county they're down
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
by a hundred prisoners due to bail
 
00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:47.349 align:start position:0%
by a hundred prisoners due to bail
reform

00:49:47.349 --> 00:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
reform
 
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
i think this is a made a massive uh
 
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
change to the bail commission
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
process the way it works now
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
in previous um meetings that we've had
 
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
i asked that what um the words
 
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
that it should be considered by the uh
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
by the court and the
 
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
bail commission what that meant and i
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
never did get a
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
satisfactory explanation but now as i
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
see in your amendment
 
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say the court and the bail
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner it says
 
00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:26.079 align:start position:0%
the court and if applicable the bail
 
00:50:26.079 --> 00:50:27.589 align:start position:0%
the court and if applicable the bail
commissioner

00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
and then later on it goes on to say that
 
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
in these cases as i understand it
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
it says that in in any of these cases
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
that the bail commissioners shall not be
 
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
assigned these cases um
 
00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
so that leads me to believe that this is
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
an attempt to change the whole
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
all of the things that the bail
 
00:50:52.319 --> 00:50:53.349 align:start position:0%
all of the things that the bail
commission

00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
recommended it's an attempt to change
 
00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
the legislation that was passed seven
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
months ago
 
00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
without any data and i appreciate all of
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
the anecdotal cases that you gave to us
 
00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:08.559 align:start position:0%
and usually those anecdotal cases are
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
the most egregious
 
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
types of crimes and so that is kind of
 
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
i believe is intended to make us believe
 
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:17.829 align:start position:0%
i believe is intended to make us believe
that

00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
that this bill should pass as as you
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
would like to see it amended
 
00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:31.829 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
and i've talked i talked to a bail
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner an example of
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
things that could happen even
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
even if you change the hours to 36
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
people if i'm correct people that are
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
accused of these crimes now
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
go before bail commissioners and bail
 
00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
commissioners make those decisions
 
00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
i think you said something when you were
 
00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
describing to us
 
00:51:58.950 --> 00:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
all of the changes that were made you
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
didn't believe that the bail
 
00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
commissioners could make a correct
 
00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
judgment about the
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
various types of of necessary proof that
 
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
you have in this
 
00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
and so you get to some anecdotal cases
 
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
that i heard from a bail commissioner
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
where there was a domestic violence case
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
with a with a man who had
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
alzheimer's and came before the bail
 
00:52:21.359 --> 00:52:22.470 align:start position:0%
alzheimer's and came before the bail
commissioner

00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%
and it looks to me that if this
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
amendment passes
 
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
that man would have gone would have
 
00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
remained in custody
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
but he did not remain in custody he was
 
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
released to a family member
 
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
with conditions that he could not have
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
he had to stay away from the other
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
person and
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
then there was another example that he
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
gave was something about child
 
00:52:45.119 --> 00:52:45.910 align:start position:0%
gave was something about child
pornography

00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
pornography
 
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
for someone that for whatever reason had
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
it on their computer maybe even
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
unbeknownst to them
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
that it was downloaded because they
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
visited a site
 
00:52:59.349 --> 00:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
somewhere in in all of those people
 
00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
would be retained in custody
 
00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
because of that and they wouldn't see a
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner and if they don't see
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
a bail commissioner and they're arrested
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
at friday night at eight o'clock
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
they won't get to see a bail commission
 
00:53:14.309 --> 00:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
they'll have to go to court and my
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
thinking would be
 
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
that the court would not happen until
 
00:53:19.109 --> 00:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
the following monday and it was holiday
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
the following tuesday for those reasons
 
00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
i am not going to support this amendment
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
represent newman used to clarify the
 
00:53:29.829 --> 00:53:29.839 align:start position:0%
procedure if a person is
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
does appear before bail commissioner and
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
they are released or they have to they
 
00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:37.430 align:start position:0%
they are released or they have to they
post

00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
post
 
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
bail not to the bail commission the
 
00:53:42.069 --> 00:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
common practices
 
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
that the defendant would waive their
 
00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
arrangements it wouldn't be
 
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
recording for an arraignment
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
and the reason why is that the
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
arraignment would be you would only do
 
00:53:54.790 --> 00:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
that to challenge
 
00:53:56.069 --> 00:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
because you disagree with the bail
 
00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
commission with their determinations if
 
00:53:58.640 --> 00:53:59.030 align:start position:0%
commission with their determinations if
you

00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
are uh i suppose
 
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
there's nothing uh no precedence for
 
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
someone challenging
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
a finding of a bail commission when they
 
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
paid and posted the
 
00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:12.559 align:start position:0%
bail that the bail commission assessed
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
this is when i say that a bail
 
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner shouldn't be making
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
said finding if the finding is to detain
 
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
an individual
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
who's been charged with one of these uh
 
00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
violent offenses
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
that that's a high burden of proof it's
 
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
and that is a high evidence for standard
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
my my belief that it's more appropriate
 
00:54:35.109 --> 00:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
that the court
 
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
made that determination because that's a
 
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
that's an evidentiary
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
determination that is often it should be
 
00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
determined by a court and we can go
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
through several hypotheticals
 
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
but ultimately the state would have to
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
meet that burden
 
00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
so whether a person's missed this
 
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
offense or not
 
00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
there's no presumption that they'd be
 
00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
held in the chart itself
 
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh in regards to child pornography and
 
00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:02.390 align:start position:0%
uh in regards to child pornography and
that's

00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
i'm to be honest i'm surprised that
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
that's one of the offenses listening
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
that's come up the most
 
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
so in my understanding
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
the internet crimes is children division
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
when they they're able to tell
 
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh we really follow the data in a way
 
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
difficult to explain that they know how
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
long you've been on a website
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
they can tell if you've been whether you
 
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
meant to go to that website i guess you
 
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
can be like redirected to a
 
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
website and you're not sure you can they
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
can just tell
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
how long you've been there whether and
 
00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
they also can tell whether you've
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
on a website and actually watched or
 
00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
downloaded data websites from the
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
meaning you would have watched
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
some type of video so in that case
 
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with
 
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
if i were to make an arrest and i was
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
from i understand it's common
 
00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
that no not warrants are often used in
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
these type of arrests
 
00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
one about you know fear of the
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
destruction of evidence but to
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
the fear out of the officers
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
he was in florida some state but he was
 
00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:11.109 align:start position:0%
he was in florida some state but he was
certainly

00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
knocked in the door and two federations
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
were shot right through the door
 
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
and they were serving a warrant on
 
00:56:17.829 --> 00:56:17.839 align:start position:0%
childcare um
 
00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of belief that a lot of
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
people charge this offense
 
00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
tries to commit suicide by coughing
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
so in that type of case they're gonna
 
00:56:27.599 --> 00:56:28.870 align:start position:0%
so in that type of case they're gonna
have

00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
i would say they should they state if
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
they wish for the person to be
 
00:56:36.069 --> 00:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
detained would need to present that
 
00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:37.839 align:start position:0%
evidence in court and why they
 
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
they feel that person continue to pose a
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
direct public safety
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
so again that burdens on the state but
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
00:56:47.589 --> 00:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
that's again that's not uh that
 
00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
shouldn't involve someone who's
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
incidentally on a website for a short
 
00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
i mean the states have to prove that
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
case at least at least in regards to
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
the burden to have the person detained
 
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
if that's what the state's asking for
 
00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
maybe i don't understand the wording in
 
00:57:23.109 --> 00:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
the amendment that deals with bail
 
00:57:23.119 --> 00:57:24.309 align:start position:0%
the amendment that deals with bail
commissioners

00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
and it it says that
 
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
um these people shall not be brought
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
before a baal commissioner and shall be
 
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:34.799 align:start position:0%
held in custody
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
pending arraignment before the court
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
which shall without unreasonable delay
 
00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
and within 24 hours of the time of your
 
00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:43.349 align:start position:0%
and within 24 hours of the time of your
arrest

00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
arrest
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
excluding sundays and holidays etc so
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
does that not mean that anybody that is
 
00:57:49.589 --> 00:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
charged with
 
00:57:52.789 --> 00:57:52.799 align:start position:0%
these crimes
 
00:57:55.589 --> 00:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
no matter what the circumstances are
 
00:57:57.510 --> 00:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
will not be able to try
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
and refute the decision not to release
 
00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:02.710 align:start position:0%
and refute the decision not to release
them

00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
just explain that particular change to
 
00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:06.309 align:start position:0%
just explain that particular change to
me

00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
so i understood during our conversation
 
00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
there was some concern that bail
 
00:58:12.309 --> 00:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
commissioners would be eliminated
 
00:58:12.319 --> 00:58:13.670 align:start position:0%
commissioners would be eliminated
altogether

00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
altogether
 
00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
they would bail commissions would still
 
00:58:17.589 --> 00:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
exist they just
 
00:58:19.349 --> 00:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
if you're charged with any of these
 
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
violent defenses
 
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
in that scenario you would not be
 
00:58:25.829 --> 00:58:25.839 align:start position:0%
brought before bill commissioner
 
00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
you would be pro you would be held to be
 
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
proper for the court so
 
00:58:31.829 --> 00:58:31.839 align:start position:0%
depending on when you are arrested will
 
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
depend on when you were brought before
 
00:58:35.349 --> 00:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
the court
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
so that's that's how that would work and
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
then there
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
so what would then happen you would have
 
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
your pale hearing
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
at the court which is that
 
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
during the time of your arraignment and
 
00:58:53.349 --> 00:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
then what you can do is challenge that
 
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
if they make a finding by clearing
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
you can then request the subsequent
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
hearing on character for
 
00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
to summons witnesses and basically get
 
00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:02.870 align:start position:0%
to summons witnesses and basically get
another

00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
another chance to uh demonstrate why
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
you're not afraid privacy
 
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
is that instant good question well
 
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm looking at the exact words
 
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
and it says they shall
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
be held in custody and to me
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
my fear is that anyone
 
00:59:25.109 --> 00:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
that is arrested and charged with one of
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
these crimes
 
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
shall be held in custody they won't see
 
00:59:31.589 --> 00:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
a bail commissioner
 
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
who could make a decision to have them
 
00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
released in the current system
 
00:59:38.069 --> 00:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
and they will remain in custody and if
 
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
it happens
 
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
depending on the timing they could be
 
00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
held up
 
00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
held in custody for much longer than 36
 
00:59:49.349 --> 00:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
hours so unless we're going to have
 
00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
court hearings i i don't know how they
 
00:59:52.079 --> 00:59:52.549 align:start position:0%
court hearings i i don't know how they
would

00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:52.559 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
get released maybe you can explain it to
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
me so
 
00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
if if you get arrested for one of these
 
00:59:58.160 --> 00:59:59.589 align:start position:0%
if if you get arrested for one of these
appointments

00:59:59.589 --> 00:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
appointments
 
01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
you you can be held for up to 24 hours
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
but no more than 36 hours it has to
 
01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
exclude the weekends and holidays if you
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
have to be brought before
 
01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
the court that when you're brought
 
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
before the court that would be
 
01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
the arraignment if the state does not
 
01:00:17.589 --> 01:00:17.599 align:start position:0%
ask me to be
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
detained which again i would
 
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure the will on every single
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
one that's up to the state to ask
 
01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:27.839 align:start position:0%
if that is the case and the state meets
 
01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
the burden of proof
 
01:00:31.109 --> 01:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
then you'll be detained if you don't it
 
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
insists to attend the paragraph
 
01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
if the court does not find by convincing
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
evidence that a person must be detained
 
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
of course i'll order the person at least
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
so is so is everybody detained or not
 
01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
excuse me can i have a follow-up yes
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
yeah not everybody that is my follow-up
 
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
so you are arrested who have been placed
 
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
under arrest
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
when i use their term detained that
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
would be impact when you
 
01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
your bail is when you have your bail
 
01:01:13.109 --> 01:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
hearing for the court
 
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
it's you're going to remain in custody
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
until you have you're probably
 
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
24 to 36 hours and you
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
you are then you could be detained if
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
was that newman yes thank you for the
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
follow-up especially since it's probably
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:38.549 --> 01:01:38.559 align:start position:0%
the so you said when brought before the
 
01:01:38.559 --> 01:01:39.750 align:start position:0%
the so you said when brought before the
court

01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
if they're arrested on a friday night
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
when are they going to be
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
brought before the court because now
 
01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
that the bail commissioner is not
 
01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.270 align:start position:0%
that the bail commissioner is not
involved

01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
there is not a person who can make a
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
determination whether he can be released
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
or the person can be released meaning
 
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
all of them
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
and they it's subject to a burden of
 
01:02:00.079 --> 01:02:00.470 align:start position:0%
and they it's subject to a burden of
proof

01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
proof
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
that happens before a court but i think
 
01:02:05.829 --> 01:02:05.839 align:start position:0%
our understanding is that the
 
01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
person in that circumstance would not
 
01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
get to a court
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
until the following monday or tuesday i
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
i'm just confused on how this thing is
 
01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
going to work
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
all of a person's arrest
 
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
felonious sexual assault
 
01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
robbery possession manufacturing
 
01:02:31.349 --> 01:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
distribution of child
 
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse images you're arrested on a
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
friday night
 
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
and you would you would have to be
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
brought before the court within 24 hours
 
01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:41.039 align:start position:0%
of them
 
01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
being open now it's schools weekends and
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
holidays and that's the bypark
 
01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:46.839 align:start position:0%
court not being open and that's
 
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
currently um
 
01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:51.039 align:start position:0%
not every not every situation the
 
01:02:53.029 --> 01:02:53.039 align:start position:0%
person's necessarily thoughtful
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's not always done that so
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
that's something that's sometimes at the
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
auction so
 
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:02.559 align:start position:0%
they're going to be held for that time
 
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
period waiting wait if they're ready
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's how this will work if if they
 
01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
don't bring the person within the 24
 
01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
hours and the weekend
 
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
and holiday exclusion doesn't apply with
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
the 36 hour which doesn't apply
 
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
they're not being they're holding that
 
01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:17.029 align:start position:0%
they're not being they're holding that
person

01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
i would say illegal they need to be
 
01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0%
brought within a reasonable time
 
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
even 24 hours the person should they
 
01:03:25.109 --> 01:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
should not be up against the clock
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
they should be processed and brought to
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
the court as soon as possible within a
 
01:03:31.109 --> 01:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
reasonable time
 
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
and i believe it's not done very much
 
01:03:35.829 --> 01:03:35.839 align:start position:0%
and just to clarify even if you're
 
01:03:38.309 --> 01:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
brought within a 24-hour time period
 
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
24 hours to the court it doesn't
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that that was not a
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
reasonable time period
 
01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
just sitting i would find that to be
 
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification but
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
right now they see bail commissioners
 
01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
and for these laws they won't see those
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners now
 
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight thank you
 
01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:09.829 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight thank you
chair

01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:04:13.029 --> 01:04:13.039 align:start position:0%
um i i think it's inappropriate for us
 
01:04:15.029 --> 01:04:15.039 align:start position:0%
to kind of skip the line and
 
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
not uh take the advice of a of a whole
 
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
commission that just
 
01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:24.799 align:start position:0%
passed a law that we haven't even
 
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
been able to see the effects of because
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
the courts have been
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
shut down because of kovid so we haven't
 
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
even been able
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
to see how this new law
 
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
that all the stakeholders met to
 
01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
effectively come up with in a bipartisan
 
01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
and collaborative
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
way i just don't think
 
01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
the democratic the democratic process is
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
is is getting a fair shake if we're
 
01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:55.190 align:start position:0%
is is getting a fair shake if we're
bypassing

01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
bypassing
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
a whole group of people from all over
 
01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
that have the most important voices
 
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
to to an experience
 
01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:08.799 align:start position:0%
to raise in this issue and
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
we're basically you know ignoring their
 
01:05:12.799 --> 01:05:13.670 align:start position:0%
we're basically you know ignoring their
advice

01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
advice
 
01:05:17.029 --> 01:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
by not even seeing how what they came up
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
with first is going to affect our state
 
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
and i don't think anybody is going to
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
argue that these are really heinous
 
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
crimes and we take them very seriously
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
but due process and you know fair
 
01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:31.750 align:start position:0%
but due process and you know fair
democratic

01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
democratic
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
instances for people getting their time
 
01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
to you know prove to everyone that they
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
are innocent and heaven forbid
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
like you know we round people up that
 
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
are innocent and then they
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
they aren't treated fairly and we have
 
01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
to wait days
 
01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
um i just i think we open this state up
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
to litigation
 
01:06:02.069 --> 01:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
um by uh by not
 
01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
fairly incarcerating people
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know we just got sued because we
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
were doing that in the er
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
you know and we even have inmates right
 
01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
now waiting for
 
01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
psychiatric care we can't even house the
 
01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:15.910 align:start position:0%
psychiatric care we can't even house the
public

01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
effectively for that kind of situation i
 
01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:19.029 align:start position:0%
effectively for that kind of situation i
don't

01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
see us throwing more resources at our
 
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
um inmate population so this is
 
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
this is a really big issue that i don't
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
think we've had enough time
 
01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
to get everybody's opinions on
 
01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
that will be affected by this if it were
 
01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
to pass and i
 
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
i think it would be really irresponsible
 
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
of us to pass this
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
without hearing all those voices from
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
the people that have the most experience
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
on this issue um thank you
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i will just
 
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
point out there was
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
public hearings from the senate you know
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
public hearing police committee so any
 
01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
stakeholder any member of any commission
 
01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:58.010 align:start position:0%
stakeholder any member of any commission
anyone

01:06:58.010 --> 01:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
01:06:58.020 --> 01:06:59.670 align:start position:0%
anyone
[Music]

01:06:59.670 --> 01:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
multiple opportunities to offer their
 
01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:03.270 align:start position:0%
multiple opportunities to offer their
input

01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
input
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
on this on senate bill 92
 
01:07:08.549 --> 01:07:08.559 align:start position:0%
there was plenty of opportunity to do
 
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
that so no one's been excluded from any
 
01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:12.630 align:start position:0%
that so no one's been excluded from any
process

01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
i think looking at what we have before
 
01:07:17.109 --> 01:07:17.119 align:start position:0%
us here
 
01:07:19.589 --> 01:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
where this is not something that is
 
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
being done
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
to go around anyone's
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation there are commissions
 
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
that exist
 
01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
that put together recommendations uh
 
01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
those recommendations
 
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
are up for this committee to evaluate
 
01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:34.789 align:start position:0%
are up for this committee to evaluate
and

01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's up to other the legislator
 
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
is the one that actually is the body
 
01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
that actually decides which part of his
 
01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:43.589 align:start position:0%
that actually decides which part of his
recommendations

01:07:43.589 --> 01:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
sure should not be involved so i don't
 
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
think that we are necessarily bound by
 
01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
another whether it's a interest group or
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
a commission's recommendation
 
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
it's certainly helpful but no one's been
 
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
excluded from the process
 
01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
any any insight on this i'm looking at
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
it as
 
01:08:05.109 --> 01:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
i would i would ask a question you can
 
01:08:05.119 --> 01:08:05.910 align:start position:0%
i would i would ask a question you can
answer

01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
which part of section 381 do you feel
 
01:08:12.549 --> 01:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
that is inappropriately included
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
what part of that process is
 
01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
inappropriate because i'm under the
 
01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
existing law
 
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
if you're charged with homicide for
 
01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
instance any offense with a life
 
01:08:20.319 --> 01:08:21.430 align:start position:0%
instance any offense with a life
sentence

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
the standard is clear and convincing
 
01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
evidence whether you're going to be
 
01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
detained or not
 
01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
so that's already a practice being
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
followed in the state
 
01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
and we are adding well other
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
less seriousness and homicide we're
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
adding other offenses to that
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
standard to that category where it could
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
be detained
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
by meaning that if the state needs that
 
01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
high burden of proof
 
01:08:49.269 --> 01:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:50.789 --> 01:08:50.799 align:start position:0%
so i guess the question is do we want a
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
i think we need to get more of the
 
01:08:59.590 --> 01:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in the room and see what
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
their thoughts are not just the chief of
 
01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:02.229 align:start position:0%
their thoughts are not just the chief of
police

01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
police
 
01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
and i i think that we need to heal hear
 
01:09:08.149 --> 01:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
from the bail commissioners
 
01:09:11.349 --> 01:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
um you know i i just don't think this is
 
01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
giving a fair shake to all parties
 
01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:14.149 align:start position:0%
giving a fair shake to all parties
involved

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
and what really troubles me is an
 
01:09:19.349 --> 01:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
overnight stay
 
01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
or a whole holiday stay just because we
 
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
the judges or or the time to book people
 
01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:26.390 align:start position:0%
the judges or or the time to book people
properly

01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
properly
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
and that right there leads us open
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
for um involuntary incarceration
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
that you know that we just got sued for
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
like i'm saying it i just think that
 
01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
there this
 
01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
we didn't have enough time to study the
 
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
potential effects
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
of how this is going to be after it's
 
01:09:47.749 --> 01:09:47.759 align:start position:0%
implemented how
 
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's going to affect everyone so that
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
that and this is the community put in
 
01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:53.990 align:start position:0%
that and this is the community put in
consideration

01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
last week representative knights
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
corrected the case
 
01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
came out of the supreme court in new
 
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire if you were involuntarily
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
detained you had a right to rehearing of
 
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
the 72 hours well the issue was that
 
01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
there wasn't
 
01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
enough room in the facility for people
 
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
who were
 
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
being involuntarily detained and
 
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
the question was when does the clock the
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
72 hour clock begin
 
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
and some people took the position that
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
it doesn't begin until you have your
 
01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
placement so people were in who were
 
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
sitting in the emergency room let's say
 
01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:27.110 align:start position:0%
sitting in the emergency room let's say
for

01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
two weeks waiting for availability they
 
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
were being held during that time
 
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
in the new hampshire supreme court ruled
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
that the unconstitutional
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
i agree with that decision and i don't
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
just because there's not enough
 
01:10:42.149 --> 01:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
resources that a person should
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
be held representative
 
01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
a person is being held over a weekend or
 
01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
holiday because the court itself is not
 
01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.070 align:start position:0%
holiday because the court itself is not
open

01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
open
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
and that's currently a problem that i
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
many courts that are old they don't open
 
01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
on the weekend
 
01:10:59.189 --> 01:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
so that's not that's not something that
 
01:10:59.199 --> 01:11:00.470 align:start position:0%
so that's not that's not something that
we're

01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
we're changing so that's that
 
01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
i will say in regards to resource issues
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
when we
 
01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
when hb 2 passed in the house we did
 
01:11:10.239 --> 01:11:11.270 align:start position:0%
when hb 2 passed in the house we did
create

01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
create
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
two additional positions for circuit
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
court judges
 
01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
my understanding the senate is of course
 
01:11:18.159 --> 01:11:18.470 align:start position:0%
my understanding the senate is of course
the

01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
budget hasn't passed but they've created
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
two more additionally so there'll be
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
four additional circuit court judges
 
01:11:28.149 --> 01:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
to address this
 
01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
and so i think that the resource
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
argument issue has been at least
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
somewhat addressed by what is uh what is
 
01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
being done but that we have no control
 
01:11:38.719 --> 01:11:39.270 align:start position:0%
being done but that we have no control
over

01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
what the two additional ones pass on
 
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's not that's for finance
 
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
committee to i support the adding of
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
those judges but i can't
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
control whether they remain or they get
 
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
posted taken out
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:59.830 --> 01:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
sorry can i just add a comment
 
01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
i i don't think this is this
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
may be a bad idea i i'd like to
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
retain it or i'd like to to have more
 
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
time on it is what i'm saying
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
so we can really study all the details
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
of how it's going to affect the whole
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
process the bail commissioners the
 
01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:18.630 align:start position:0%
process the bail commissioners the
police

01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
police
 
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
the person incarcerated you know i just
 
01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
don't think
 
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
there's so many moving parts to this
 
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
that i just don't think we have spent
 
01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:26.870 align:start position:0%
that i just don't think we have spent
enough

01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
time on it for to to make it the best it
 
01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
representative you're recognized thank
 
01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
i respect the bail commission
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
very much but they were appointed by the
 
01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.149 align:start position:0%
very much but they were appointed by the
government

01:12:46.149 --> 01:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
we are the legislators that are sent up
 
01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:50.149 align:start position:0%
we are the legislators that are sent up
here

01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
to respect the people and protect them
 
01:12:58.630 --> 01:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
so many things have gone on in the past
 
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
seven months that we are laughed at
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
because we made a building
 
01:13:09.189 --> 01:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
and i want you to know that the film has
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
been in place before for many years
 
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
and it seemed to work all right none of
 
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
us want to put
 
01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
anybody in jail because they did
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
a minor thing and it doesn't happen that
 
01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:25.669 align:start position:0%
a minor thing and it doesn't happen that
way

01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
my apologies to my fellow democrats
 
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
but i will vote for this amendment
 
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:40.090 align:start position:0%
representative rose you're recognized
 
01:13:40.090 --> 01:13:41.189 align:start position:0%
representative rose you're recognized
[Music]

01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:13:45.189 --> 01:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to say here and the first
 
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
thing i would like to say is
 
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
with respect to what representative
 
01:13:52.229 --> 01:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
pandalatas just said
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
is one of the things i have written on
 
01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
my notes we aren't talking about keeping
 
01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:57.189 align:start position:0%
my notes we aren't talking about keeping
somebody

01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
in jail that ran a stop sign
 
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about keeping somebody
 
01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
in jail they was arrested for smoking
 
01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:04.390 align:start position:0%
in jail they was arrested for smoking
marijuana

01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
we were talking about keeping somebody
 
01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
in jail
 
01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
that has done horrendous horrendous
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
or is accused of doing a horrendous
 
01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:14.870 align:start position:0%
or is accused of doing a horrendous
thing

01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
and it's very easy to stand back and say
 
01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
well the person needs to be heard
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
what about the victim why are we we are
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
protecting the wrong people here
 
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
and when it's your family member or it's
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
your child
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
that is the victim that is this
 
01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
child pornography it's their image
 
01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
that's on the computer
 
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
you're going to think differently about
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
that person being released
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
they did that and it's very easy to
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
stand there and say
 
01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
you're protecting these people but
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
you're not you're not protecting these
 
01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:48.470 align:start position:0%
you're not you're not protecting these
people

01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
you're you're riding this justice horse
 
01:14:54.229 --> 01:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
and you're getting nowhere what if it's
 
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
your child
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
that was held down that was raped to
 
01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:58.870 align:start position:0%
that was held down that was raped to
death

01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
death
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
oh we'll let the guy out he it's been
 
01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
three days we need to protect him no we
 
01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:03.669 align:start position:0%
three days we need to protect him no we
don't

01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
you need to think of the victims
 
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's not as simple we're not
 
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
talking about a mistake
 
01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
right we're not talking about calling a
 
01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.709 align:start position:0%
right we're not talking about calling a
tomato

01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
tomato
 
01:15:16.229 --> 01:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
a vegetable going into fruit we're
 
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
this isn't this is insanity we are not
 
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about small things
 
01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:26.390 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about small things
here

01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
and i think everybody that's sitting
 
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
here protecting the people because they
 
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
may have to sit in jail for three days
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
well lucky then it's only three days
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
because the victim
 
01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
is being affected for the rest of their
 
01:15:38.719 --> 01:15:39.510 align:start position:0%
is being affected for the rest of their
life

01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
and so is their family these are huge
 
01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
consequences the people when they're
 
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
convicting these crimes
 
01:15:46.229 --> 01:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
they're not thinking about because
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
you're only thinking about themselves
 
01:15:53.189 --> 01:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
they deserve to be in jail
 
01:15:56.709 --> 01:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
that's all i have to say thank you
 
01:16:00.149 --> 01:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
just clarify it too for the person
 
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
the person's help they're detained
 
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
again the state that's what their
 
01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:07.510 align:start position:0%
again the state that's what their
request

01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
has to present enough evidence to
 
01:16:10.709 --> 01:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
demonstrate by
 
01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
clearing against the evidence that
 
01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
person is a threat to
 
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
the public or themselves so again this
 
01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
the court would be needing to make a
 
01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:19.430 align:start position:0%
the court would be needing to make a
determination

01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
determination
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
this individual who's been charged with
 
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
a violent offense against someone
 
01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
is continues to be a threat to public
 
01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:28.070 align:start position:0%
is continues to be a threat to public
safety

01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
and that's that's the point i'm trying
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
to get across you need to
 
01:16:34.149 --> 01:16:34.159 align:start position:0%
it's not just to be committed to crime
 
01:16:36.630 --> 01:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
itself it's
 
01:16:40.149 --> 01:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
it's whether you actually remain a
 
01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
threat to public safety
 
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
is the issue of whether you'll be
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
pleased so
 
01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
whether that's done by a judge or a bail
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner i i think having a judge
 
01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:48.790 align:start position:0%
commissioner i i think having a judge
evaluate

01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
evaluate
 
01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
that burden and prove by having a higher
 
01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:51.990 align:start position:0%
that burden and prove by having a higher
standard

01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
standard
 
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
is allowed really lets you identify the
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
individuals who
 
01:16:58.709 --> 01:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
actually have a more accurate findings
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's a higher burden done by a judge
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
i think i'm not saying that i don't know
 
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
what they're doing but i
 
01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
would put the credibility of a judge
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:18.229 --> 01:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'll start by uh
 
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
thanking you for the good faith effort i
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
think you put into addressing concerns
 
01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
that were in the initial bill
 
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
um i'll also echo comments by
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
made by several members that you know we
 
01:17:32.709 --> 01:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
don't really have all the information
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
the premise behind the initial bill that
 
01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:35.750 align:start position:0%
the premise behind the initial bill that
we're

01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
considering the amendment on was that
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
the effort from a few years ago
 
01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
had flaws and so now we have
 
01:17:46.149 --> 01:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
an effort to quote unquote fix it that
 
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
hasn't been thoroughly vetted
 
01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm inclined to to support this
 
01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:51.510 align:start position:0%
so i'm inclined to to support this
effort

01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
effort
 
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
i would also be inclined to support it
 
01:17:55.590 --> 01:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
in a year when we have more time to look
 
01:17:57.189 --> 01:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
at the effects
 
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
so that's all i'll say but um
 
01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
so i remain torn on this but i would i
 
01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
think we can
 
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
get a bill we all can support if we hold
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
on to this
 
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
for a few months work on it in the fall
 
01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
bring it back early next year and get it
 
01:18:14.229 --> 01:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
and representative collins let me ask
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
and i i respect the dialogue that we're
 
01:18:21.189 --> 01:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
having today
 
01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
i understand i think we're all doing
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
we're all boys and concerns i appreciate
 
01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:28.070 align:start position:0%
we're all boys and concerns i appreciate
that

01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
when it comes to making changes or
 
01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
potential changes to what
 
01:18:34.630 --> 01:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
the amendment that's being presented i
 
01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
what will we change about i i look at it
 
01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:43.669 align:start position:0%
what will we change about i i look at it
as

01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
we have a limited scope of the offenses
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
where this would apply to
 
01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh that's the crux of what this is
 
01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
and is it the preference that that's
 
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
that is decided by a bail commissioner's
 
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
postal judge
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
i i guess my question is if there's
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
suggestions to be made i'm more than
 
01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
willing to listen
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
and i took i've consulted a lot of
 
01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:08.470 align:start position:0%
and i took i've consulted a lot of
different

01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh members and a lot of different people
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
when putting this together
 
01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
and took into consideration a lot of
 
01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
different that's if you notice there's a
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
couple amendments floating around
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
and every time when i say that i
 
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
respected a lot of different opinions on
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
this is one
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
opinion satisfied in its entirety no
 
01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
but there was some other balance we have
 
01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
to kind of
 
01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
juggle some of the things together to
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
make it address
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
all uh a lot a lot of concerns i guess
 
01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
i'm asking you guys what concerns do you
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
have that you would prefer change do you
 
01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
want to limit eliminate some of these
 
01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
offenses would you rather bail
 
01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:45.990 align:start position:0%
offenses would you rather bail
commissioners

01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh decide bail when someone's charged
 
01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
with aggravated felon
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
sexual assault as opposed to judge
 
01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
so i go back to the fact that i am not
 
01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
an expert on these things
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
and i listen uh
 
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
to people who know more than i do and
 
01:20:03.990 --> 01:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
consider the arguments they make
 
01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
and there seem to be compelling
 
01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
arguments on
 
01:20:10.149 --> 01:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
truly compelling arguments on both sides
 
01:20:10.159 --> 01:20:11.110 align:start position:0%
truly compelling arguments on both sides
so

01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:13.510 --> 01:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
i think your amendment goes a long way
 
01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
to addressing the concerns i had
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
at the same time um
 
01:20:21.669 --> 01:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
i look back at some other bills we've
 
01:20:21.679 --> 01:20:22.950 align:start position:0%
i look back at some other bills we've
retained

01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
retained
 
01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
in my mind were great didn't need more
 
01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
work but i think that retaining them
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
ended up being the correct decision
 
01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:34.639 align:start position:0%
because i think it's going to get us to
 
01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
a final product that we can all
 
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
or hopefully a large majority of our
 
01:20:40.709 --> 01:20:40.719 align:start position:0%
committee can support
 
01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
and i see this as part of the same that
 
01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:44.070 align:start position:0%
and i see this as part of the same that
same

01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
in that same vein if there are problems
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
with bail
 
01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
we absolutely should fix it i think
 
01:20:51.669 --> 01:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
we're on the right track
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
rather than identifying individual
 
01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
issues i think it's more about getting
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
members to be more comfortable with the
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
potential effects
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
of this amendment that we haven't had
 
01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
testimony on
 
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh at all so that's that's what i would
 
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
where my argument comes from for
 
01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:10.070 align:start position:0%
where my argument comes from for
retaining

01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
retaining
 
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
nothing suggesting there's a problem
 
01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
with this more about to slow down
 
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
this process and do it right so that we
 
01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
don't have more bail reform
 
01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
coming back before this body in this
 
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh but when we retained some of the
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
bills those are house bills and we had
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
we had a specific deadline to meet and
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
we had 59 bills i i think i
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
i think our committee had the most so
 
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
some of those bills we were not you know
 
01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
i wasn't ashamed to admit
 
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
we were only going to meet on limited
 
01:21:50.229 --> 01:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
basis as well based on what was
 
01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:50.790 align:start position:0%
basis as well based on what was
available

01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:59.510 align:start position:0%
 
more

01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
for this bill this has been assigned to
 
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
our committee for over a month
 
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
and i said last meeting before
 
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
the rules only allow us to put forward
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
one of them
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
you can't have multiple amendments to a
 
01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
bill and if there's any
 
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
amendment or any change anyone wants to
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
work with anyone else putting forward an
 
01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:19.189 align:start position:0%
work with anyone else putting forward an
amendment

01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:22:21.669 --> 01:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
so they can you know take it to consider
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
and put all things together
 
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
um i respectfully i haven't had many
 
01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:29.590 align:start position:0%
um i respectfully i haven't had many
people

01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
especially your caucus come to me and
 
01:22:34.709 --> 01:22:34.719 align:start position:0%
asking me to make any specific changes
 
01:22:34.719 --> 01:22:35.430 align:start position:0%
asking me to make any specific changes
to

01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:22:37.189 --> 01:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
the prior amendment that was circulated
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
around or
 
01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
or the one that was i think this is now
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
the third version of my draft it's kind
 
01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:43.510 align:start position:0%
the third version of my draft it's kind
of

01:22:43.510 --> 01:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
floating so i'm just i haven't been
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
no suggestions and they've got me in a
 
01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:50.470 align:start position:0%
no suggestions and they've got me in a
month

01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
month
 
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm still all ears but a lot of
 
01:22:54.790 --> 01:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
people want to say that we want to study
 
01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
more but we've had the bill for
 
01:22:59.430 --> 01:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
quite some time so i'm just wondering if
 
01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
we retain it
 
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious on the time frame that
 
01:23:05.669 --> 01:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
if we're actually going to
 
01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:08.639 align:start position:0%
be looking into this so i'm not i
 
01:23:08.639 --> 01:23:09.030 align:start position:0%
be looking into this so i'm not i
haven't

01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
haven't
 
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
haven't been presented any ideas so
 
01:23:12.629 --> 01:23:12.639 align:start position:0%
chairman can i
 
01:23:14.310 --> 01:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
respond and then i'll i'll mute myself
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
and we'll talk again so i
 
01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
my concern is again as a layperson
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
making changes on this broad scale that
 
01:23:24.239 --> 01:23:25.669 align:start position:0%
making changes on this broad scale that
affect

01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
affect
 
01:23:28.149 --> 01:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
uh you know a vast number of people who
 
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
are arrested
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
will be detained will have costs
 
01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
involved uh stresses on the court system
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
these are legitimate things that we just
 
01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
don't have information on
 
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
and you know there are bad faith efforts
 
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
in this house to delay and delay and
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully kill
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
my suggestion is not one of those
 
01:23:48.239 --> 01:23:49.510 align:start position:0%
my suggestion is not one of those
efforts

01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
let's get something that we can all
 
01:23:52.629 --> 01:23:52.639 align:start position:0%
support or the majority of us can
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
support and address the concerns
 
01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
so that we're not having um
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
these we just haven't we don't have all
 
01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
the information so
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's the point that i'm raising not
 
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
that it's a bad amendment doesn't seem
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
but there's just things that a lot of us
 
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
have raised that we don't have answers
 
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
and can't get answers at this moment
 
01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm calling from sam green
 
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh i represented dennis green
 
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh my thing is that
 
01:24:31.590 --> 01:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
i think you put a lot of work into it
 
01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
and we've had time to work on this
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
and no one has come forth other than the
 
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
time that you put into it
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
and i think if we pass it
 
01:24:43.590 --> 01:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
then if there's some discrepancy that
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
somebody could put in a bill next fall
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
and change maybe one or two parts of it
 
01:24:51.189 --> 01:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
but i think it's time to
 
01:24:54.229 --> 01:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh pass it and put away some of these
 
01:24:54.239 --> 01:24:55.910 align:start position:0%
uh pass it and put away some of these
criminals

01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
criminals
 
01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:22.709 --> 01:25:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
a long time ago i never did that's right
 
01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:41.830 align:start position:0%
a long time ago i never did that's right
yeah

01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
that involved so i just let you run with
 
01:25:48.170 --> 01:25:48.180 align:start position:0%
it um first of all
 
01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:49.669 align:start position:0%
it um first of all
[Music]

01:25:49.669 --> 01:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
i just want to address something that i
 
01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:52.719 align:start position:0%
just heard that no one's ever said
 
01:25:52.719 --> 01:25:53.350 align:start position:0%
just heard that no one's ever said
anything

01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:25:57.189 --> 01:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
to or or had conversations with you and
 
01:25:59.110 --> 01:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
i've had conversations with you
 
01:26:01.669 --> 01:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
in regards to this particular bill and
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
the reason why i had the conversation
 
01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:04.310 align:start position:0%
the reason why i had the conversation
because

01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
um bradley raymond
 
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
sent us that commission on pre-trial
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
detention pre-trial scheduling
 
01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
and the services and i took the
 
01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to read through it i hope
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
that the rest of my colleagues read
 
01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
through it
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
because that was an important um
 
01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:20.470 align:start position:0%
because that was an important um
commission

01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:26:22.149 --> 01:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
and i just want to say let me give you
 
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
an idea who was on that commission
 
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
even though two people wrote the
 
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
amendment that you had
 
01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
so and i also want to speak to another
 
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
colleague who talked about the passion
 
01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
of the victim i don't think anybody in
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
this room was more passionate
 
01:26:38.229 --> 01:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
about a victim than myself but i am
 
01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
about due process of law

public defender
 
01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
those are people that were on that
 
01:27:30.790 --> 01:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
committee and believe me
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
they have a lot more uh education than
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
most of us in this room today
 
01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
and take that a little further chief of
 
01:27:39.199 --> 01:27:40.550 align:start position:0%
and take that a little further chief of
police

01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
police
 
01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh department of corrections everyone
 
01:27:44.470 --> 01:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
had the
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come and testify before
 
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
and the community the people our
 
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:52.950 align:start position:0%
and the community the people our
constituents

01:27:52.950 --> 01:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
came and spoke before this committee
 
01:27:59.189 --> 01:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
so we had so as far as i'm concerned it
 
01:27:59.199 --> 01:28:00.550 align:start position:0%
so we had so as far as i'm concerned it
was

01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
a huge number of people that
 
01:28:07.110 --> 01:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
vetted this for roughly what three years
 
01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
david i think about three years so when
 
01:28:12.310 --> 01:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
you tell me that you can walk in and fix
 
01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
this and uh
 
01:28:16.229 --> 01:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
what 60 days whatever days you said i
 
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
have a problem with that
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
and i should have everyone in this room
 
01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
should have a problem with that
 
01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
because these are the people that wrote
 
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
it and if you think that there's a flaw
 
01:28:26.470 --> 01:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
to it
 
01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:28.719 align:start position:0%
then do the right thing and then be
 
01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
vector i'm not talking about necessarily
 
01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
our committee
 
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
yes maybe those from alchemy but it
 
01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
needs truly needs to go back or it needs
 
01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
to be vetted whether we retained it
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
i have no problem retaining the bill but
 
01:28:43.510 --> 01:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
the proper people come before us
 
01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:44.310 align:start position:0%
the proper people come before us
remember

01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
remember
 
01:28:46.950 --> 01:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
the only people that testified was the
 
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
chief of police department
 
01:28:50.070 --> 01:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that i asked that
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
day if
 
01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:54.639 align:start position:0%
the bail bondsmen disagree or you have a
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
disagreement what is your request
 
01:28:58.950 --> 01:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
and he said contact the judge so there
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
is an avenue
 
01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
today for them that disagree the other
 
01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
piece of that that came up was what
 
01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:05.990 align:start position:0%
piece of that that came up was what
percentage

01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
01:29:08.709 --> 01:29:08.719 align:start position:0%
all right and talking and looking at
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
some of the data here
 
01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
you're probably talking about two
 
01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
percent maybe
 
01:29:16.629 --> 01:29:16.639 align:start position:0%
maybe and maybe not even that so i'm
 
01:29:17.990 --> 01:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
still gonna say i have a problem with
 
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:18.390 align:start position:0%
still gonna say i have a problem with
the

01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
number one i definitely have a problem
 
01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
with the amendment but i haven't had a
 
01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
problem with the entire bill
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
from day one that we had the bill and we
 
01:29:28.149 --> 01:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
have had the conversation
 
01:29:30.629 --> 01:29:30.639 align:start position:0%
i actually talked to another colleague
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
here um do you think that the commission
 
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
might be meeting anytime
 
01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
soon you know are you guys the phone or
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
whatever which i couldn't really get an
 
01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:40.719 align:start position:0%
answer about that i think it was because
 
01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
of covet
 
01:29:44.470 --> 01:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
they weren't meeting anymore but i think
 
01:29:46.709 --> 01:29:46.719 align:start position:0%
there's a possibility that we can
 
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
give this to a group of people that
 
01:29:49.910 --> 01:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
really can vet this
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
issue that was brought before us by the
 
01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
chief police
 
01:29:56.229 --> 01:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
and mind you the day that we had that
 
01:29:56.239 --> 01:29:56.870 align:start position:0%
and mind you the day that we had that
hearing

01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:29:59.189 --> 01:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
i got home played my voicemail a
 
01:29:59.199 --> 01:30:00.550 align:start position:0%
i got home played my voicemail a
commissioner

01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately he couldn't be there he
 
01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
said but we didn't know
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
you even had that bill so i struggle
 
01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:07.590 align:start position:0%
you even had that bill so i struggle
with

01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
the fact that nobody else testified
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
outside of the chief of police
 
01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:14.719 align:start position:0%
there's a problem because the
 
01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
stakeholders were many
 
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
and i would like to see the stakeholders
 
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
there again
 
01:30:23.590 --> 01:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
i would like to hear from uh
 
01:30:25.270 --> 01:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
rape and assault i would like to hear
 
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
from all the different groups
 
01:30:29.669 --> 01:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
that came out to testify and to work on
 
01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
this to make this
 
01:30:34.709 --> 01:30:34.719 align:start position:0%
a a unique thing for a pre-trial
 
01:30:37.750 --> 01:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
so with that said i can't support the
 
01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:38.870 align:start position:0%
so with that said i can't support the
amendment

01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
and i definitely did not support the uh
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
the bill so representative i
 
01:30:46.709 --> 01:30:46.719 align:start position:0%
i don't remember i don't have the list
 
01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
of every member who testified
 
01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not excuse me members i remember the
 
01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:52.950 align:start position:0%
i'm not excuse me members i remember the
public

01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
i do know it was beyond it was more than
 
01:30:55.199 --> 01:30:56.149 align:start position:0%
i do know it was beyond it was more than
just

01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:30:57.270 --> 01:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
you know someone from the chief of
 
01:30:59.350 --> 01:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
police associations and
 
01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
that testimony was in support of the
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
underlying bill which i think that
 
01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
the amendment um dials that
 
01:31:09.110 --> 01:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
when i see thousands of back i mean this
 
01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
is less
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
restrictive than the underlying senate
 
01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
bill that came
 
01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
so what the chief of police association
 
01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
of the government
 
01:31:24.149 --> 01:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
testified for the committee this is not
 
01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
this is not exactly um this is again 72
 
01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:28.830 align:start position:0%
this is not exactly um this is again 72
hours

01:31:28.830 --> 01:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
hours
 
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
so and now i'm not going to speak for
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
members of the public that i consulted
 
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
with because i don't want to
 
01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
put words in them but i did speak with
 
01:31:41.110 --> 01:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
several more than one judge about this
 
01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:42.229 align:start position:0%
several more than one judge about this
topic

01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
topic
 
01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
that was done i did speak with uh
 
01:31:47.590 --> 01:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
practice interns in the state of new
 
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire among us
 
01:31:52.149 --> 01:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
and there was input in that regard i
 
01:31:53.110 --> 01:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
spoke with uh
 
01:31:56.229 --> 01:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
members of the court system so
 
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
i those police officers yes
 
01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
i there was a lot of consultations in
 
01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:03.830 align:start position:0%
i there was a lot of consultations in
mind

01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
mind
 
01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
that with this and i've been open about
 
01:32:09.189 --> 01:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
discussing this with anyone who wants to
 
01:32:09.199 --> 01:32:10.470 align:start position:0%
discussing this with anyone who wants to
discuss

01:32:10.470 --> 01:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
the policies of how to how this should
 
01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
be drafted
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
um and i would say the co-sponsor has a
 
01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
legal background
 
01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
as well of the amendment and is also a
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
retired judge
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
so when i say that i work with
 
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
i think this is a senator i did i
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
discussed this bill with
 
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
members of the senate that's correct i
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
did so
 
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying that i have this
 
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
supermind that's greater than the
 
01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:35.510 align:start position:0%
supermind that's greater than the
commission

01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
put together but there was a lot of
 
01:32:38.790 --> 01:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
consultation done
 
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
and arriving at what is being presented
 
01:32:42.629 --> 01:32:42.639 align:start position:0%
for the king today
 
01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
even the amendment that was that was
 
01:32:47.669 --> 01:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
being floated around last i believe last
 
01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
week the week before
 
01:32:52.629 --> 01:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
again since that was out
 
01:32:54.149 --> 01:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
the reason why there's some changes made
 
01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
to take into consideration
 
01:32:59.590 --> 01:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
some of the thoughts are right
 
01:33:01.350 --> 01:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
some thoughts and just because someone
 
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
makes a recommendation doesn't mean
 
01:33:04.950 --> 01:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
supportive of the entire amendment
 
01:33:06.550 --> 01:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
but it did kind of when i said it's a
 
01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
balance in but that was done
 
01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
and again from a due process perspective
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
a person is being
 
01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
arrested if the state can demonstrate
 
01:33:16.709 --> 01:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
the burden of proof by clearing
 
01:33:17.910 --> 01:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence
 
01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
that they remain a threat to public
 
01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:22.390 align:start position:0%
that they remain a threat to public
safety

01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
then that they're allowed that's that is
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
satisfying due process that's
 
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
consistent with the new hampshire spring
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
course prior decisions
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
they can make a determination and that's
 
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
involved in life sentences but this is
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
that's the burden of proof you can have
 
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
a lower burden of proof if it doesn't
 
01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:38.709 align:start position:0%
a lower burden of proof if it doesn't
involve

01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
involve
 
01:33:41.110 --> 01:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
life sentence but i am putting i believe
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
the higher burden of proof is what's
 
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have and
 
01:33:47.110 --> 01:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
that's what this would yeah
 
01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
so i i don't believe anyone was excluded
 
01:33:51.189 --> 01:33:51.199 align:start position:0%
from the process again i understand it
 
01:33:56.790 --> 01:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
so recognized okay so i'm going to say
 
01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
that yesterday
 
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
they were excluded because you said that
 
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
you had the conversations with
 
01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
so many people okay this should have
 
01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:07.510 align:start position:0%
so many people okay this should have
been

01:34:07.510 --> 01:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
something that there was committee or
 
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
detained so that
 
01:34:12.629 --> 01:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
everyone could hear what these people
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
were saying
 
01:34:16.390 --> 01:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that because you had a
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
conversation with um
 
01:34:22.629 --> 01:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
a judge uh a lawyer and whatever else
 
01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
you named
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
that that's enough giving what it took
 
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
two and a half years for people to do
 
01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
and you're saying that you were able to
 
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
get this
 
01:34:34.629 --> 01:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
done um and then reassess within a
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
what 60 day period however how long he
 
01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
had to build
 
01:34:40.629 --> 01:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
but i will say again that there's too
 
01:34:40.639 --> 01:34:41.189 align:start position:0%
but i will say again that there's too
many

01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
if he's about this this situation
 
01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
in terms of the
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
in terms of the documentation that was
 
01:34:52.709 --> 01:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
provided to us
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
that the committee did so i would like
 
01:34:57.109 --> 01:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
to see this go
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
um be retained and that we have
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
the judge or the police officer or
 
01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:04.550 align:start position:0%
the judge or the police officer or
whoever

01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
whoever
 
01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
the citizen anyone that cares about
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
the system in terms of due process as
 
01:35:13.030 --> 01:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
well and as well as our victims
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
come before us and uh give us that
 
01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:17.990 align:start position:0%
come before us and uh give us that
feedback

01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
feedback
 
01:35:20.070 --> 01:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
because otherwise i feel as though the
 
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
two and a half years that folks spent
 
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
truly digging digging into this i look
 
01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:25.990 align:start position:0%
truly digging digging into this i look
at

01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
notes like from friday october 18th on
 
01:35:32.229 --> 01:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
pretty much every month through october
 
01:35:36.310 --> 01:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
20th of 2020 what they did to um
 
01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
to come up with this document and to
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
come up with the recommendations
 
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
and if there's if there's a issue
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's training or whatever it is
 
01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:47.510 align:start position:0%
whether it's training or whatever it is
that

01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
the chief we seem to have with the
 
01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
veiled bondsmen
 
01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
i think that's an issue that should be
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
resolved i don't think that should be
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
resolved through law i think that should
 
01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:56.229 align:start position:0%
resolved through law i think that should
be

01:35:56.229 --> 01:35:56.239 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
resolved in training if i remember
 
01:36:00.229 --> 01:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
correctly we had a bill
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
about this additional training and uh
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
and any changes in the law
 
01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
and how quickly this stuff funnels down
 
01:36:09.109 --> 01:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
to the mailbox we went through all this
 
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
what a couple months ago so again i'm
 
01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:13.030 align:start position:0%
what a couple months ago so again i'm
gonna

01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
um reach out to my colleagues and say
 
01:36:16.709 --> 01:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
i would appreciate if we get together
 
01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
and retain this and i think there'll be
 
01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
several people
 
01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
because if there's a two percent and
 
01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
you're trying to change the law for two
 
01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
percent of the state of new hampshire i
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
have a problem with that too
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
well let me just clarify when i say
 
01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:44.159 align:start position:0%
people are
 
01:36:47.189 --> 01:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
no one's been deprived of offering an
 
01:36:47.199 --> 01:36:47.669 align:start position:0%
no one's been deprived of offering an
import

01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
import
 
01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
again there's been a public hearing
 
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
schedule not just
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
for this group this is a senator so
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
there were multiple public hearings
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
available for any member of the public
 
01:36:59.350 --> 01:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
to express themselves
 
01:37:00.709 --> 01:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
whether they were a member of the bail
 
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
commission or not
 
01:37:04.629 --> 01:37:04.639 align:start position:0%
now i don't know the senators who sit on
 
01:37:04.639 --> 01:37:05.980 align:start position:0%
now i don't know the senators who sit on
that

01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:05.990 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:18.950 align:start position:0%
that

01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
but let's just send it to me for her
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
my point is that when you have multiple
 
01:37:27.669 --> 01:37:27.679 align:start position:0%
public hearings it's my opinion
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
i don't feel that anyone's being
 
01:37:30.870 --> 01:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
excluded in the process
 
01:37:32.950 --> 01:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
they're free to come testify before the
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
committee and offer
 
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
their their opinion on what's being
 
01:37:39.669 --> 01:37:39.679 align:start position:0%
brought forward then
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
for the two percent again that not every
 
01:37:43.990 --> 01:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
single person is going to be
 
01:37:45.910 --> 01:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
the changer when you have people being
 
01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
arrested and
 
01:37:49.750 --> 01:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
for domestic violence and they're
 
01:37:51.030 --> 01:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
literally being released within the
 
01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:52.390 align:start position:0%
literally being released within the
knowledge

01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
about paying that offense and they can't
 
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
that same exact defense or even worse
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
that's under the current bail system
 
01:38:00.790 --> 01:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
that has been put into place
 
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
that is what we have happened now does
 
01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
it happen does it happen all the time no
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
but this put if you can make a
 
01:38:08.950 --> 01:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
demonstration to the poor
 
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
that that type of defense this person is
 
01:38:13.109 --> 01:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
likely to commit another violent crime
 
01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
against someone else that's when they
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
would lead the team it's not a
 
01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
per se you are being held simply for
 
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
your child being charged
 
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
so i i don't feel that there's a due
 
01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:24.390 align:start position:0%
so i i don't feel that there's a due
process

01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
right i believe a person is innocent
 
01:38:28.629 --> 01:38:28.639 align:start position:0%
until he's proven guilty
 
01:38:31.109 --> 01:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
that's overall that's the way i should
 
01:38:31.119 --> 01:38:31.990 align:start position:0%
that's overall that's the way i should
work

01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh some i'm gonna vote for those
 
01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:44.850 align:start position:0%
by the way but i don't agree with that
 
01:38:44.850 --> 01:38:47.270 align:start position:0%
by the way but i don't agree with that

so representative thank you mr
 
01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
chairman i hope that you will not retain
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
it's been long enough that this bail
 
01:39:02.709 --> 01:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
commission or any of these other people
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
have been taught
 
01:39:07.750 --> 01:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
we have to think of the people out there
 
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
that can get hurt
 
01:39:12.790 --> 01:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
if we have flaws in this amendment we
 
01:39:14.470 --> 01:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
can correct it
 
01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
representative oh excuse me uh
 
01:39:25.910 --> 01:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative hawker hasn't spoken so
 
01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
let me know i'll just uh
 
01:39:34.229 --> 01:39:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:37.669 --> 01:39:37.679 align:start position:0%
well that's not an appropriate motion
 
01:39:39.590 --> 01:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
um i will accept that as a
 
01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:40.790 align:start position:0%
um i will accept that as a
recommendation

01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:39:42.070 --> 01:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
i will say i know it's been going on for
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
a little while i'm sorry that it's uh
 
01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
but i don't i don't want to end cut off
 
01:39:48.550 --> 01:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
the discussion people have the hand
 
01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
story so
 
01:39:51.430 --> 01:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
i think after we have represented
 
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
boarding representative newman
 
01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:54.719 align:start position:0%
with the hands raised and uh
 
01:39:57.430 --> 01:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative andrew bolden so
 
01:39:59.030 --> 01:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
i would like to recognize them to speak
 
01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
again to respond to any uh
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
comments and then i i think after that
 
01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
that despite her avid strong
 
01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:29.270 align:start position:0%
that despite her avid strong
disagreement

01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
representative you recognized
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman well after reading
 
01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:36.790 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman well after reading
the

01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
present law and uh your proposed
 
01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:40.070 align:start position:0%
present law and uh your proposed
amendment

01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to look at
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
page 1 uh line 17.
 
01:40:50.229 --> 01:40:50.239 align:start position:0%
it looks like according to what i'm the
 
01:40:52.149 --> 01:40:52.159 align:start position:0%
way i'm reading it because
 
01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
one of the choices is detained is that
 
01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
even now we don't need anything
 
01:41:05.189 --> 01:41:05.199 align:start position:0%
we can retain anyone uh
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
then we'll go down to uh uh
 
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
section three are you on the amendment
 
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
that we represent the amendment yes it's
 
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
it's the same as as it is in
 
01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:20.310 align:start position:0%
it's the same as as it is in
rsa

01:41:20.310 --> 01:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
the choices are to uh
 
01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
be released on personal resonance
 
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
released on condition of combinational
 
01:41:33.350 --> 01:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
conditions retained
 
01:41:36.629 --> 01:41:36.639 align:start position:0%
are temporary retained i would propose
 
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
that since we are
 
01:41:40.950 --> 01:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
looking at this section of law
 
01:41:47.590 --> 01:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
that c should probably be removed
 
01:41:50.310 --> 01:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
then we go down to paragraph three which
 
01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
is in the rsa
 
01:41:55.189 --> 01:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
not in your not in your amendment
 
01:41:58.629 --> 01:41:58.639 align:start position:0%
um i'll read it a paragraph section
 
01:41:58.639 --> 01:41:59.189 align:start position:0%
um i'll read it a paragraph section
three

01:41:59.189 --> 01:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:42:02.629 --> 01:42:02.639 align:start position:0%
paragraph a what
 
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
can you repeat the rsa or yes this is
 
01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
back to the rsa
 
01:42:10.950 --> 01:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh paragraph a safety of the public are
 
01:42:14.149 --> 01:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
are the defendant if a person is charged
 
01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
with any criminal offense our offense
 
01:42:19.350 --> 01:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
listed in
 
01:42:22.629 --> 01:42:22.639 align:start position:0%
uh domestic violence are are
 
01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
vali in a predictive order or etc so
 
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
by looking at the words any criminal
 
01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:30.870 align:start position:0%
by looking at the words any criminal
offense

01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
offense
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
what has happened is with you listing
 
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
a laundry list of offenses you have
 
01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
narrowed the sculptable law
 
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh as well as uh
 
01:42:48.310 --> 01:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
making us reveal revisit
 
01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
this section of law uh anytime we
 
01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
need to to add on a different
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
another offense so
 
01:43:01.910 --> 01:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
we can we can retain it and try and fix
 
01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:03.030 align:start position:0%
we can we can retain it and try and fix
up

01:43:03.030 --> 01:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
all of uh rsa
 
01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
598 colon 2 or we can just let it go as
 
01:43:16.229 --> 01:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
the idea was to limit the scope of when
 
01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
it would apply to what type of offenses
 
01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:21.350 align:start position:0%
it would apply to what type of offenses
and

01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:24.390 --> 01:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
i don't again i don't if it's not
 
01:43:26.070 --> 01:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
included in that list it will fall
 
01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:27.590 align:start position:0%
included in that list it will fall
outside

01:43:27.590 --> 01:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
outside
 
01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm not aware of any violent crimes
 
01:43:31.109 --> 01:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
against a person that could be added to
 
01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
that list if there is one i would
 
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
certainly support adam that's
 
01:43:41.430 --> 01:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
representative uh andrew bolden thank
 
01:43:42.629 --> 01:43:42.639 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
01:43:43.990 --> 01:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
um i think it's more important that we
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
get this right and get it done
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
today i've heard a couple of members on
 
01:43:49.830 --> 01:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
this committee say
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
well maybe the language isn't quite
 
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
right but we can fix it later we'll fix
 
01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
it next year
 
01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
in fact we have a few amendments which
 
01:43:58.790 --> 01:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
have been floated around as the chairman
 
01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
stated via email
 
01:44:03.030 --> 01:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
um it's clear that there's a lot of
 
01:44:05.189 --> 01:44:05.199 align:start position:0%
discussion on this bill
 
01:44:06.629 --> 01:44:06.639 align:start position:0%
we've got a bail commission that we
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
should be looking for guidance from
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
let's give ourselves some time to do
 
01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
this the right way
 
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
get language that we can not just agree
 
01:44:16.870 --> 01:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
on but we can feel good about it
 
01:44:26.229 --> 01:44:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:28.470 --> 01:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'll be brief i i
 
01:44:30.550 --> 01:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
also believe that someone who's charged
 
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
with a crime they're innocent until
 
01:44:33.030 --> 01:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
proven guilty
 
01:44:34.870 --> 01:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
and i know there are egregious places
 
01:44:36.550 --> 01:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
where people got out and did bad things
 
01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:36.790 align:start position:0%
where people got out and did bad things
and

01:44:36.790 --> 01:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
and those are terrible and should be
 
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
stopped and i think they're entitled to
 
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
due process
 
01:44:44.550 --> 01:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
and under the current system of bail
 
01:44:47.189 --> 01:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
under the current law they have their
 
01:44:48.149 --> 01:44:48.159 align:start position:0%
due process
 
01:44:50.790 --> 01:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
served by i don't know what bail
 
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
commissioners are members of the court
 
01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:53.679 align:start position:0%
but they are certainly
 
01:44:55.350 --> 01:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
part of the government and those people
 
01:44:57.510 --> 01:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
make decisions about whether they should
 
01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
be released or not considering their
 
01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:00.390 align:start position:0%
be released or not considering their
dangerousness

01:45:00.390 --> 01:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
dangerousness
 
01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
and threat to public safety and
 
01:45:07.030 --> 01:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
and probably um uh
 
01:45:10.390 --> 01:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
flight and so i think that by removing
 
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioners and
 
01:45:14.550 --> 01:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
it was not explicit in the original bill
 
01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
that that was going to be
 
01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
the effect of the bill but it is
 
01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
explicit in
 
01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:22.159 align:start position:0%
this amendment that bail commissioners
 
01:45:22.159 --> 01:45:22.550 align:start position:0%
this amendment that bail commissioners
will

01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
not hear anybody who is
 
01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
charged with these particular offenses
 
01:45:31.270 --> 01:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
and without that they're denied due
 
01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
process in it
 
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
but the process they do get may fall
 
01:45:38.550 --> 01:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
in line with what the court decisions
 
01:45:39.590 --> 01:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
are on
 
01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
when only a court is involved so my big
 
01:45:43.990 --> 01:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
problem is the removal
 
01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
of the bail commission is completely
 
01:45:47.109 --> 01:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
from these crimes
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
and for that reason i will not vote for
 
01:45:53.109 --> 01:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:54.709 --> 01:45:54.719 align:start position:0%
well i'm waiting for a member to return
 
01:45:56.709 --> 01:45:56.719 align:start position:0%
to the room representing
 
01:46:00.790 --> 01:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
i can inquire a question so
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
do you believe that a per a person's
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
due process is being violated if they
 
01:46:07.669 --> 01:46:07.679 align:start position:0%
are not
 
01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
afforded an opportunity to be presented
 
01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
you're muted if that's the question for
 
01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
me i think that's how
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
they get that due process today
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
so if there's any circumstance where a
 
01:46:30.390 --> 01:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
person is not
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
before bail commissioner like if they
 
01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
commit capital murder
 
01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
or homicide and that's an area where
 
01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
they're not normally brought before bill
 
01:46:39.990 --> 01:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner anyway
 
01:46:42.070 --> 01:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
i mean do you believe that that's a due
 
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
process violation
 
01:46:46.709 --> 01:46:46.719 align:start position:0%
i don't know what actually i don't know
 
01:46:48.149 --> 01:46:48.159 align:start position:0%
what the process
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
is for who makes the decision when the
 
01:46:52.229 --> 01:46:52.239 align:start position:0%
police come
 
01:46:55.030 --> 01:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
to charge somebody with a crime and the
 
01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner makes a judgment based
 
01:46:57.990 --> 01:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:47:00.149 --> 01:47:00.159 align:start position:0%
i don't know who the arbiter is at that
 
01:47:02.629 --> 01:47:02.639 align:start position:0%
point and i think that perhaps it's the
 
01:47:04.229 --> 01:47:04.239 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner
 
01:47:06.229 --> 01:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
i think that in those cases the bail
 
01:47:06.239 --> 01:47:07.350 align:start position:0%
i think that in those cases the bail
commissioner

01:47:07.350 --> 01:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:47:10.470 --> 01:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
in in the capital murder case would
 
01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:11.750 align:start position:0%
in in the capital murder case would
probably

01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
detain the person because of the
 
01:47:18.629 --> 01:47:18.639 align:start position:0%
conditions of the that particular case
 
01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
and my concern is is that in those cases
 
01:47:23.750 --> 01:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
people like that should be retained
 
01:47:26.229 --> 01:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
but my fear is that if you completely
 
01:47:28.870 --> 01:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
eliminate the bail commissioners
 
01:47:31.590 --> 01:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
everyone who is charged for any of these
 
01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:32.470 align:start position:0%
everyone who is charged for any of these
offenses

01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
01:47:35.669 --> 01:47:35.679 align:start position:0%
especially the ones like um
 
01:47:38.790 --> 01:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
domestic violence that's that's a a big
 
01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:40.070 align:start position:0%
domestic violence that's that's a a big
one

01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
but you can do very small amounts of
 
01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
inappropriate or unwarrant i forget
 
01:47:47.669 --> 01:47:47.679 align:start position:0%
exactly the language
 
01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
unwarranted touching and it ends up that
 
01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:50.950 align:start position:0%
unwarranted touching and it ends up that
people

01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:47:53.669 --> 01:47:53.679 align:start position:0%
end up that all of those people would be
 
01:47:53.679 --> 01:47:55.030 align:start position:0%
end up that all of those people would be
retained

01:47:55.030 --> 01:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
retained
 
01:47:57.270 --> 01:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
and i think that people underestimate
 
01:47:59.669 --> 01:47:59.679 align:start position:0%
for the normal person who got
 
01:48:01.990 --> 01:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
into the criminal justice system under
 
01:48:04.229 --> 01:48:04.239 align:start position:0%
those kinds of circumstances
 
01:48:07.430 --> 01:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
for them to spend the weekend in jail
 
01:48:12.550 --> 01:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
or or be there for a period of 72 hours
 
01:48:14.950 --> 01:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
especially if they are not very wealthy
 
01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:15.669 align:start position:0%
especially if they are not very wealthy
and

01:48:15.669 --> 01:48:15.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:17.830 --> 01:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
and can't need to have their job and
 
01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
everything there's a lot of things that
 
01:48:21.270 --> 01:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
can happen to those people
 
01:48:22.790 --> 01:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't have to them if they get
 
01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
what i think now is proper
 
01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
due process
 
01:48:37.189 --> 01:48:37.199 align:start position:0%

296 right okay that's that's that's one
 
02:30:06.230 --> 02:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
with a set of change
 
02:30:08.150 --> 02:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
i think you're just going to discuss
 
02:30:09.750 --> 02:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
maybe they're changed
 
02:30:12.389 --> 02:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
but it was was it a house club 296 i
 
02:30:13.510 --> 02:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
don't remember
 
02:30:16.630 --> 02:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
yes because the senate changed you sent
 
02:30:18.550 --> 02:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
it to them all right
 
02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:21.600 align:start position:0%

official notes
 
02:30:32.630 --> 02:30:32.640 align:start position:0%

mostly it's mostly administrative work
 
02:31:31.910 --> 02:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
but it's mostly administrative work not
 
02:31:31.920 --> 02:31:33.190 align:start position:0%
but it's mostly administrative work not
only

only
 
02:31:35.990 --> 02:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so there was a new piece of
 
02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:36.870 align:start position:0%
yeah so there was a new piece of
personnel

02:31:36.870 --> 02:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
02:31:42.309 --> 02:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
if you put somebody in the county jail
 
02:31:45.510 --> 02:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
yes the jail populations have gone down
 
02:31:47.349 --> 02:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
and in some cases they don't have enough
 
02:31:51.349 --> 02:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:52.309 --> 02:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
yes the reason why it's in the
 
02:31:53.670 --> 02:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
determinant of the website when you have
 
02:31:54.870 --> 02:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
a new standard
 
02:31:54.880 --> 02:32:13.590 align:start position:0%
a new standard
determine

02:32:13.590 --> 02:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:15.190 --> 02:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
it says indeterminable because they
 
02:32:15.200 --> 02:32:16.790 align:start position:0%
it says indeterminable because they
can't

02:32:16.790 --> 02:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
can't
 
02:32:36.950 --> 02:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:39.349 --> 02:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
how many if you had four thousand of
 
02:32:40.710 --> 02:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
these type of charges you have to
 
02:32:42.309 --> 02:32:42.319 align:start position:0%
determine how those four thousand how
 
02:32:43.670 --> 02:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
many would be
 
02:32:45.349 --> 02:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
held there's no way to determine that
 
02:32:47.349 --> 02:32:47.359 align:start position:0%
because there's no sample
 
02:32:51.510 --> 02:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
or you'll pull to pull it so
 
02:32:53.750 --> 02:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
if they even if they gave you a number
 
02:32:55.349 --> 02:32:55.359 align:start position:0%
it would be a guess or an estimation
 
02:32:55.359 --> 02:32:55.990 align:start position:0%
it would be a guess or an estimation
because

02:32:55.990 --> 02:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:32:58.150 --> 02:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
any time any case you have to be very
 
02:32:59.590 --> 02:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
back specifically
 
02:33:02.870 --> 02:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
why that person was held or not so
 
02:33:04.550 --> 02:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
then when it comes to administrative
 
02:33:06.150 --> 02:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
tasks of course from during the
 
02:33:08.630 --> 02:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
administering process that's not only
 
02:33:11.110 --> 02:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
put into a distance so that wouldn't be
 
02:33:13.110 --> 02:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
there now
 
02:33:15.270 --> 02:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
hiring the additional judges and that's
 
02:33:15.280 --> 02:33:16.150 align:start position:0%
hiring the additional judges and that's
just

02:33:16.150 --> 02:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:33:18.870 --> 02:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
yeah having that we have to the cast in
 
02:33:18.880 --> 02:33:32.150 align:start position:0%
yeah having that we have to the cast in
our

02:33:32.150 --> 02:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:35.590 --> 02:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
until it's passed i mean
 
02:33:41.429 --> 02:33:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:46.830 --> 02:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:46.840 --> 02:34:00.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:34:00.870 --> 02:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:02.550 --> 02:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
reconvene the criminal justice public

apologies for delay
 
02:34:09.990 --> 02:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
see a few hands raised does that the
 
02:34:11.349 --> 02:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
members have questions they wish to ask
 
02:34:13.270 --> 02:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
for some pancreas
 
02:34:16.550 --> 02:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
this is damn i would like to know if we
 
02:34:18.630 --> 02:34:18.640 align:start position:0%
i could make a motion
 
02:34:23.270 --> 02:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
92 senate bill 92
 
02:34:24.710 --> 02:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
are you are you asking if there's going
 
02:34:26.870 --> 02:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
to be a motion
 
02:34:29.349 --> 02:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
if i couldn't make a motion or if
 
02:34:29.359 --> 02:34:29.990 align:start position:0%
if i couldn't make a motion or if
there's

02:34:29.990 --> 02:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:34:33.349 --> 02:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:34.950 --> 02:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
and representative before we make
 
02:34:39.190 --> 02:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:39.200 --> 02:34:43.349 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:34:43.349 --> 02:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:45.910 --> 02:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
so you remember uh one of the statements
 
02:34:47.910 --> 02:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
i made earlier
 
02:34:52.070 --> 02:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
concerning your amendment page 1
 
02:34:55.830 --> 02:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:58.870 --> 02:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
yes i went back
 
02:35:03.110 --> 02:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
to the 2018-2019
 
02:35:06.710 --> 02:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
annual dated criminal law and
 
02:35:10.550 --> 02:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
that is not in there i also
 
02:35:14.389 --> 02:35:14.399 align:start position:0%
checked the changes for 2019
 
02:35:17.110 --> 02:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
and found out that section of law had
 
02:35:19.030 --> 02:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
not been amended
 
02:35:22.070 --> 02:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
so i think that that detained
 
02:35:25.270 --> 02:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
is a error that has crept in
 
02:35:28.630 --> 02:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
from paragraph two
 
02:35:31.910 --> 02:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:34.550 --> 02:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
it says accept as provided in paragraph
 
02:35:34.560 --> 02:35:35.030 align:start position:0%
it says accept as provided in paragraph
three

02:35:35.030 --> 02:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:35:40.150 --> 02:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
or four these are the options so
 
02:35:41.670 --> 02:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
that person is not going to generally
 
02:35:43.030 --> 02:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
just be detained simply because they
 
02:35:44.150 --> 02:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
were arrested
 
02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
for no reason at all it's in the current
 
02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:47.590 align:start position:0%
for no reason at all it's in the current
law

02:35:47.590 --> 02:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:35:50.870 --> 02:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
it isn't that i mean
 
02:35:52.870 --> 02:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
i thought it was the current law it's in
 
02:35:52.880 --> 02:35:53.620 align:start position:0%
i thought it was the current law it's in
the

02:35:53.620 --> 02:35:53.630 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:35:53.630 --> 02:36:03.990 align:start position:0%
the

02:36:03.990 --> 02:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:06.550 --> 02:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
it is in that book it isn't in the
 
02:36:08.150 --> 02:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
previous book
 
02:36:11.190 --> 02:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
so and we did not make any changes
 
02:36:13.670 --> 02:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
because i just looked at all the changes
 
02:36:16.309 --> 02:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
for 2019 and 2018
 
02:36:20.830 --> 02:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
there was no change to that section of
 
02:36:20.840 --> 02:36:23.429 align:start position:0%
there was no change to that section of
597.

02:36:23.429 --> 02:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
597.
 
02:36:25.590 --> 02:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
okay now i understand what you're saying
 
02:36:25.600 --> 02:36:26.630 align:start position:0%
okay now i understand what you're saying
okay

[Music]

02:36:48.830 --> 02:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:48.840 --> 02:36:51.910 align:start position:0%
 
mute

02:36:51.910 --> 02:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:55.110 --> 02:36:55.120 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if i could make a motion
 
02:36:58.950 --> 02:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:01.429 --> 02:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
all right student representative you
 
02:37:04.150 --> 02:37:04.160 align:start position:0%

02:37:06.150 --> 02:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
i wanted to know if i could make a
 
02:37:06.160 --> 02:37:07.190 align:start position:0%
i wanted to know if i could make a
motion

02:37:07.190 --> 02:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
motion
 
02:37:10.230 --> 02:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 92
 
02:37:11.990 --> 02:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
you were recognized to make a motion on
 
02:37:13.429 --> 02:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
senate bill 92
 
02:37:17.510 --> 02:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
i make a motion that we reconsidered
 
02:37:25.110 --> 02:37:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:28.790 --> 02:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
is that seconded by anyone
 
02:37:32.790 --> 02:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
i'll second all hello representative
 
02:37:36.070 --> 02:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh i appreciate you stepping up the
 
02:37:37.750 --> 02:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
second announcement
 
02:37:38.870 --> 02:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
because you're a substitute you're not
 
02:37:40.150 --> 02:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
allowed to i'm not doing that all right
 
02:37:41.670 --> 02:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
would any member
 
02:37:44.950 --> 02:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:46.950 --> 02:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
we discussed it long enough it's been
 
02:37:48.550 --> 02:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
hard to add to the discussion
 
02:37:51.510 --> 02:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
that the motion to reconsider has been
 
02:37:54.150 --> 02:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative rose
 
02:37:55.830 --> 02:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
of representative pandolas who wish to
 
02:37:57.830 --> 02:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion to reconcile
 
02:38:00.469 --> 02:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
i would like to make another motion
 
02:38:01.429 --> 02:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
after this
 
02:38:10.070 --> 02:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:23.349 --> 02:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:25.830 --> 02:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
without a motion to reconsider that's
 
02:38:27.670 --> 02:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
what i'd like to do
 
02:38:31.030 --> 02:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the bill can be
 
02:38:32.230 --> 02:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
retained without
 
02:38:35.990 --> 02:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:39.590 --> 02:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
whether the amendment a subcommittee
 
02:38:42.790 --> 02:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
would be appointed in uh as everyone
 
02:38:44.070 --> 02:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
said that they're so interested in
 
02:38:44.080 --> 02:38:44.870 align:start position:0%
said that they're so interested in
working

02:38:44.870 --> 02:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
working
 
02:38:47.670 --> 02:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
diligently to master the craft of this
 
02:38:47.680 --> 02:38:48.550 align:start position:0%
diligently to master the craft of this
bill

02:38:48.550 --> 02:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:38:50.790 --> 02:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
that i'm sure that the subcommittee
 
02:38:50.800 --> 02:38:52.070 align:start position:0%
that i'm sure that the subcommittee
would

02:38:52.070 --> 02:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:38:53.590 --> 02:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
make some changes whether it would be
 
02:38:54.870 --> 02:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
amended underlying bill but just
 
02:38:54.880 --> 02:38:55.270 align:start position:0%
amended underlying bill but just
remember

02:38:55.270 --> 02:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
remember
 
02:38:59.030 --> 02:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:03.349 --> 02:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
am i able to recommend your amendment
 
02:39:06.389 --> 02:39:06.399 align:start position:0%
to retain it in in well
 
02:39:08.150 --> 02:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
in the sub if it's retained the
 
02:39:09.830 --> 02:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee will be appointed
 
02:39:11.510 --> 02:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
representatives i see you take an
 
02:39:12.389 --> 02:39:12.399 align:start position:0%
interest in
 
02:39:15.670 --> 02:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
such a minute uh yes that amendment
 
02:39:18.150 --> 02:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
would still exist and we could change
 
02:39:19.590 --> 02:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
one word in it it would have to be a new
 
02:39:21.429 --> 02:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
amendment but
 
02:39:24.070 --> 02:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't it would still be something
 
02:39:27.990 --> 02:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:31.349 --> 02:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
so let me ask is that if your
 
02:39:35.510 --> 02:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
intention is to retain the bill
 
02:39:37.270 --> 02:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
would you wish to withdraw your your
 
02:39:39.429 --> 02:39:39.439 align:start position:0%
motion for reconsideration
 
02:39:41.349 --> 02:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
and then be recognized for an emotion to
 
02:39:43.349 --> 02:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
retain yes
 
02:39:44.710 --> 02:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
and representative rose would you wish
 
02:39:47.429 --> 02:39:47.439 align:start position:0%

02:39:50.309 --> 02:39:50.319 align:start position:0%

02:39:53.990 --> 02:39:54.000 align:start position:0%

02:40:00.790 --> 02:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
great questions i just i just have a i
 
02:40:02.790 --> 02:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
just want to
 
02:40:04.950 --> 02:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
comment green query what what is the
 
02:40:06.070 --> 02:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
current status
 
02:40:08.790 --> 02:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
of the bill what was the current status
 
02:40:11.349 --> 02:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
of the bill before the motion was made
 
02:40:14.710 --> 02:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
did did we vote on that
 
02:40:18.230 --> 02:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
it failed it was the most
 
02:40:20.630 --> 02:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
was the most about the past and to offer
 
02:40:21.910 --> 02:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
02:40:30.550 --> 02:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:33.590 --> 02:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
but then the author passed as amended
 
02:40:37.910 --> 02:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
failed so now our option is
 
02:40:40.870 --> 02:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
we could retain it or maybe speed the
 
02:40:40.880 --> 02:40:41.910 align:start position:0%
we could retain it or maybe speed the
legislation

02:40:41.910 --> 02:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:40:46.830 --> 02:40:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:46.840 --> 02:40:49.190 align:start position:0%
 
clarification

02:40:49.190 --> 02:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
02:40:50.870 --> 02:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
so representative panduragus do you wish
 
02:40:52.469 --> 02:40:52.479 align:start position:0%
to be recognized
 
02:40:56.230 --> 02:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
for a motion to retain yes i would
 
02:41:01.030 --> 02:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
i make a motion retain house bill 92
 
02:41:04.870 --> 02:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
so it can be said
 
02:41:06.469 --> 02:41:06.479 align:start position:0%
and is there someone that remember which
 
02:41:08.150 --> 02:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
is second the most became represent
 
02:41:08.160 --> 02:41:09.269 align:start position:0%
is second the most became represent
popper

02:41:09.269 --> 02:41:09.279 align:start position:0%
popper
 
02:41:15.590 --> 02:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:17.190 --> 02:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
you senator pandemics you wish to speak
 
02:41:19.510 --> 02:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
to the motion
 
02:41:22.389 --> 02:41:22.399 align:start position:0%
well i just think that there needs to be
 
02:41:22.399 --> 02:41:23.670 align:start position:0%
well i just think that there needs to be
um

02:41:23.670 --> 02:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:27.510 --> 02:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
changes in the law now and i think if we
 
02:41:31.429 --> 02:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
committed together we could work on it
 
02:41:42.710 --> 02:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:45.510 --> 02:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
it's on the official note it says they
 
02:41:48.070 --> 02:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
have something there but
 
02:41:56.309 --> 02:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:01.630 --> 02:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:01.640 --> 02:42:13.990 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:42:13.990 --> 02:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:17.349 --> 02:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so before we go to the
 
02:42:19.750 --> 02:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
voting mode i just inquire a general
 
02:42:21.349 --> 02:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
question committee
 
02:42:28.469 --> 02:42:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:30.870 --> 02:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
oh all i'm asking is there's an update
 
02:42:32.309 --> 02:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
if there is an updated fiscal note
 
02:42:33.830 --> 02:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
because i'm looking at the one that's on
 
02:42:37.670 --> 02:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
one if there's an updated fiscal note
 
02:42:40.469 --> 02:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
is that something that's going to impact
 
02:42:41.429 --> 02:42:41.439 align:start position:0%
our consumers
 
02:42:43.510 --> 02:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
today i don't want to wait we don't have
 
02:42:45.110 --> 02:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
to wait for us having the impact
 
02:42:50.710 --> 02:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:57.150 --> 02:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:57.160 --> 02:43:03.670 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:43:03.670 --> 02:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:06.710 --> 02:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
my question was with anyone's mind
 
02:43:06.720 --> 02:43:07.110 align:start position:0%
my question was with anyone's mind
change

02:43:07.110 --> 02:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:43:09.110 --> 02:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
is it mind change or position change
 
02:43:10.790 --> 02:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
either way with an updated system
 
02:43:14.150 --> 02:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
right now it's indeterminate so
 
02:43:16.070 --> 02:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
if no one's mine's going to change then
 
02:43:17.910 --> 02:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not going to wait for a
 
02:43:19.750 --> 02:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
potential update
 
02:43:22.389 --> 02:43:22.399 align:start position:0%
the answer is no i think we can move the
 
02:43:22.399 --> 02:43:24.150 align:start position:0%
the answer is no i think we can move the
question

02:43:24.150 --> 02:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:43:29.429 --> 02:43:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:33.510 --> 02:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
it can't be emotional seeing no
 
02:43:37.030 --> 02:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
seeing no further
 
02:43:40.070 --> 02:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
seeing no further hand is raised uh i
 
02:43:42.309 --> 02:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
don't have the cameras on i hope so
 
02:43:44.950 --> 02:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
the matter will now be put to question
 
02:43:46.469 --> 02:43:46.479 align:start position:0%
if you're in support of the motion to
 
02:43:46.479 --> 02:43:47.190 align:start position:0%
if you're in support of the motion to
retain

02:43:47.190 --> 02:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
retain
 
02:43:53.160 --> 02:43:53.170 align:start position:0%

appropriate to hold a full committee
 
02:47:35.349 --> 02:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
session of some kind because it seems
 
02:47:36.550 --> 02:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
like there's a lot of interest
 
02:47:39.910 --> 02:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
and interest in getting it to a place we
 
02:47:40.630 --> 02:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
can support
 
02:47:43.110 --> 02:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
and i don't recall seeing this many
 
02:47:46.790 --> 02:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
hands for any subcommittees last week
 
02:47:48.870 --> 02:47:48.880 align:start position:0%

from where i'm sitting
 
02:47:58.070 --> 02:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
but uh just because you're not appointed
 
02:47:59.429 --> 02:47:59.439 align:start position:0%
to something doesn't mean you can't
 
02:48:01.190 --> 02:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
you can't participate in hearing the
 
02:48:02.550 --> 02:48:02.560 align:start position:0%

vote to uh
 
02:48:10.710 --> 02:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
for that member as a member of the
 
02:48:12.550 --> 02:48:12.560 align:start position:0%

research on it so
 
02:48:21.110 --> 02:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
when i'm putting numbers on it it's
 
02:48:23.190 --> 02:48:23.200 align:start position:0%

okay at this time we're going to close
 
02:50:33.190 --> 02:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
the executive session
 
02:50:37.349 --> 02:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 92
 
02:50:39.830 --> 02:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
there's been one so senate bill excuse
 
02:50:42.630 --> 02:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
me house bill 296
 
02:50:46.070 --> 02:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
passed this committee
 
02:50:49.190 --> 02:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
and amended in the senate they made a
 
02:50:51.429 --> 02:50:51.439 align:start position:0%
minor change to it
 
02:50:54.550 --> 02:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
however it had to do with
 
02:51:01.110 --> 02:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:03.750 --> 02:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
and what they what was changed was one
 
02:51:05.349 --> 02:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
line where
 
02:51:08.309 --> 02:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
the house building said either it was
 
02:51:09.850 --> 02:51:09.860 align:start position:0%
done with the intent to harass

02:51:18.950 --> 02:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
if you can hanoi me what line that works
 
02:51:20.790 --> 02:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
once you get it because i don't have my
 
02:51:45.269 --> 02:51:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:01.670 --> 02:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
i'm 14.
 
02:52:05.990 --> 02:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
so the this the senate amendment removes
 
02:52:09.190 --> 02:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
returns annoy from
 
02:52:26.389 --> 02:52:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:31.910 --> 02:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:34.950 --> 02:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh um two a
 
02:52:38.550 --> 02:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
is is the section uh i tell them
 
02:52:39.750 --> 02:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
i have to keep going back to the
 
02:52:39.760 --> 02:53:05.030 align:start position:0%
i have to keep going back to the
amendment

02:53:05.030 --> 02:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:07.269 --> 02:53:07.279 align:start position:0%
if they have the old one because i know
 
02:53:08.630 --> 02:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
we didn't bring out paperwork
 
02:53:21.110 --> 02:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:23.429 --> 02:53:23.439 align:start position:0%

he or she sends by electronic an

unsolicited
 
02:53:26.150 --> 02:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
intimate image depicting sexually
 
02:53:27.830 --> 02:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
explicit conduct
 
02:53:30.710 --> 02:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
the recipient with the intent to harass
 
02:53:31.429 --> 02:53:31.439 align:start position:0%
the noise
 
02:53:34.630 --> 02:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
or alarm the recipient
 
02:53:37.429 --> 02:53:37.439 align:start position:0%
so that part is what that's the language
 
02:53:39.510 --> 02:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
that's been passed in the house
 
02:53:43.190 --> 02:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
the word alarm or noise has been
 
02:53:46.630 --> 02:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh removed that's
 
02:53:52.150 --> 02:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
one part
 
02:53:57.160 --> 02:53:57.170 align:start position:0%

here

02:54:11.670 --> 02:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:14.870 --> 02:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
so there is some concern
 
02:54:16.950 --> 02:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
that's the only change that i i see in
 
02:54:22.790 --> 02:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:24.790 --> 02:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
there's some concern about that how
 
02:54:25.990 --> 02:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
impacted the
 
02:54:28.230 --> 02:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
sex offender registered depending on the
 
02:54:28.240 --> 02:54:29.510 align:start position:0%
sex offender registered depending on the

02:54:29.510 --> 02:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
effects
 
02:54:31.910 --> 02:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
so it's been this has been brought my
 
02:54:34.469 --> 02:54:34.479 align:start position:0%
attention by one of the staples
 
02:54:37.510 --> 02:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
by changing it undermines or reduces the
 
02:54:40.950 --> 02:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:43.030 --> 02:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
i i like the original language better
 
02:54:45.510 --> 02:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not clear why it was amended to
 
02:54:48.870 --> 02:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
not include annoy or alarm
 
02:54:49.990 --> 02:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
if you look at the definition of
 
02:54:52.150 --> 02:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
harassment under our rsas
 
02:54:54.070 --> 02:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
it includes annoying or alarming
 
02:54:54.080 --> 02:54:55.190 align:start position:0%
it includes annoying or alarming
behavior

02:54:55.190 --> 02:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
02:54:56.950 --> 02:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
but i suppose that being annoying or
 
02:54:58.630 --> 02:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
alarming doesn't necessarily necessarily
 
02:55:00.550 --> 02:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
have to rise harass
 
02:55:03.429 --> 02:55:03.439 align:start position:0%
so it seems to take it this is where i
 
02:55:07.190 --> 02:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
interpret it narrows the applications
 
02:55:08.950 --> 02:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
where the point being is that someone's
 
02:55:11.030 --> 02:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
sending an unsolicited
 
02:55:14.389 --> 02:55:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:16.150 --> 02:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
we all can be on the receiving end of
 
02:55:17.510 --> 02:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
that and some of us may be
 
02:55:20.230 --> 02:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
considered some of this may be alarmed
 
02:55:21.510 --> 02:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
by someone who do that
 
02:55:24.150 --> 02:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
they can be different levels from the
 
02:55:24.160 --> 02:55:25.110 align:start position:0%
they can be different levels from the
person

02:55:25.110 --> 02:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:55:28.630 --> 02:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
right i'm not clear why they
 
02:55:35.170 --> 02:55:35.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:35.180 --> 02:55:38.150 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:55:38.150 --> 02:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair in another world at a
 
02:55:42.950 --> 02:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
different time
 
02:55:45.750 --> 02:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
whenever goals like this came over in
 
02:55:48.309 --> 02:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
other committees
 
02:55:51.030 --> 02:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
we did a line-by-line change as
 
02:55:51.040 --> 02:55:51.590 align:start position:0%
we did a line-by-line change as
committee

02:55:51.590 --> 02:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:55:54.870 --> 02:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
researcher committee flight
 
02:55:58.870 --> 02:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying that you missed anything
 
02:56:01.349 --> 02:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
it's always nice to be able to see these
 
02:56:01.359 --> 02:56:02.870 align:start position:0%
it's always nice to be able to see these
bills

02:56:02.870 --> 02:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
bills
 
02:56:06.230 --> 02:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
side by side line by line
 
02:56:10.070 --> 02:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
so they show what the changes are
 
02:56:14.150 --> 02:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
in in fairness to our canadian assistant
 
02:56:18.070 --> 02:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
he did send that to me and i just
 
02:56:22.550 --> 02:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:24.389 --> 02:56:24.399 align:start position:0%
so in fairness the advance of brad
 
02:56:25.750 --> 02:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
agreement he did send that to the chair
 
02:56:26.469 --> 02:56:26.479 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
02:56:28.550 --> 02:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
okay and the chairs just located that in
 
02:56:30.070 --> 02:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
his email
 
02:56:33.429 --> 02:56:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:48.550 --> 02:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:51.910 --> 02:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
question of the chair alright guys
 
02:56:54.550 --> 02:56:54.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so they made the
 
02:56:57.110 --> 02:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
change to take it out
 
02:57:00.230 --> 02:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
in essence they're sending it back to us
 
02:57:04.230 --> 02:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:08.309 --> 02:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
well and a committee conference that's
 
02:57:10.870 --> 02:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
that's the challenge so the two the two
 
02:57:13.110 --> 02:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
notations i i'll just read this
 
02:57:15.910 --> 02:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
so the senate version replaced he or she
 
02:57:18.070 --> 02:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
with the person
 
02:57:20.150 --> 02:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
and the senate version also removes that
 
02:57:21.990 --> 02:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
the person sending the image may
 
02:57:23.750 --> 02:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
have the intent to annoy or alarm the
 
02:57:26.150 --> 02:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
recipient the senator would need to have
 
02:57:30.389 --> 02:57:30.399 align:start position:0%
the intent to harass the recipient so
 
02:57:33.110 --> 02:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
that narrows it but then also changes
 
02:57:34.630 --> 02:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
roman numeral three so the senate
 
02:57:36.630 --> 02:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
version keeps the penalty for
 
02:57:39.670 --> 02:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
the first offense and subsequent offense
 
02:57:40.950 --> 02:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
the same
 
02:57:43.110 --> 02:57:43.120 align:start position:0%
the senate version also adds the person
 
02:57:45.269 --> 02:57:45.279 align:start position:0%
must have been convicted at the time
 
02:57:50.550 --> 02:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
the subsequent attack or to be guilty
 
02:57:50.560 --> 02:57:53.590 align:start position:0%
the subsequent attack or to be guilty
so

02:57:53.590 --> 02:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:55.429 --> 02:57:55.439 align:start position:0%
in order to have it to be a subsequent
 
02:57:57.429 --> 02:57:57.439 align:start position:0%
fence you need a conviction that's
 
02:57:58.870 --> 02:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
standard you know in the wall already so
 
02:58:00.870 --> 02:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know that
 
02:58:03.030 --> 02:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
fixed anything that's not already wrong
 
02:58:04.070 --> 02:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
i mentioned before
 
02:58:05.190 --> 02:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
you have to get charged with drunk
 
02:58:07.510 --> 02:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
driving three times for three days
 
02:58:09.349 --> 02:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
they're all going to be first offenses
 
02:58:11.349 --> 02:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
if you don't have a prior position
 
02:58:11.359 --> 02:58:17.269 align:start position:0%
if you don't have a prior position
so

02:58:17.269 --> 02:58:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:19.910 --> 02:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
i believe the original bill that we
 
02:58:19.920 --> 02:58:20.389 align:start position:0%
i believe the original bill that we
passed

02:58:20.389 --> 02:58:20.399 align:start position:0%
passed
 
02:58:23.590 --> 02:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
it would be the penalty would go up
 
02:58:27.070 --> 02:58:27.080 align:start position:0%
for a second subsequent offense this is
 
02:58:28.389 --> 02:58:28.399 align:start position:0%
completely sent
 
02:58:31.750 --> 02:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
back to the committee so under our bill
 
02:58:33.830 --> 02:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
is the first offense is a violation i
 
02:58:37.830 --> 02:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:49.830 --> 02:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:49.840 --> 02:58:56.180 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:58:56.180 --> 02:58:56.190 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:56.190 --> 02:58:58.950 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:58:58.950 --> 02:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:59:02.309 --> 02:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
from the policy as much as it's uh
 
02:59:05.269 --> 02:59:05.279 align:start position:0%
clarifying that but you can't it's
 
02:59:06.070 --> 02:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
already the law
 
02:59:07.110 --> 02:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
you can't be charged with something
 
02:59:08.870 --> 02:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
defense about prior conditions you have
 
02:59:09.750 --> 02:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
to prove
 
02:59:13.990 --> 02:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
the prior conditions
 
02:59:16.469 --> 02:59:16.479 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure why that was done but that
 
02:59:17.510 --> 02:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
could be discussed in
 
02:59:21.990 --> 02:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
the media problems as well is that true
 
02:59:25.429 --> 02:59:25.439 align:start position:0%
do we have uh any uh bills coming back
 
02:59:26.469 --> 02:59:26.479 align:start position:0%
from the senate
 
02:59:30.309 --> 02:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:32.230 --> 02:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
the wise man once said you should always
 
02:59:34.150 --> 02:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
hold on to one committee
 
02:59:37.269 --> 02:59:37.279 align:start position:0%
bill okay we need to do massive changes
 
02:59:39.830 --> 02:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
on something else
 
02:59:43.030 --> 02:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
is this the one maybe we need well
 
02:59:50.070 --> 02:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:51.830 --> 02:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
it was there was another one that we had
 
02:59:53.590 --> 02:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
an issue with stash limitations and i'll
 
02:59:55.429 --> 02:59:55.439 align:start position:0%
tell you what that bill was
 
02:59:58.150 --> 02:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
we discussed that it was involving um
 
03:00:00.230 --> 03:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
crimes against a minor
 
03:00:03.510 --> 03:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
that one i believe we made six years
 
03:00:05.750 --> 03:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
the senate reduces to three i think the
 
03:00:07.590 --> 03:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
consensus of the committee was
 
03:00:09.269 --> 03:00:09.279 align:start position:0%
that we all wanted six so we would be
 
03:00:09.279 --> 03:00:11.429 align:start position:0%
that we all wanted six so we would be
having

03:00:11.429 --> 03:00:11.439 align:start position:0%
having
 
03:00:15.349 --> 03:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
at least i'm gonna ask that the
 
03:00:16.389 --> 03:00:16.399 align:start position:0%
committee of congress would be done on
 
03:00:17.510 --> 03:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
that a lot i just want to get you the
 
03:00:40.070 --> 03:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:48.309 --> 03:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:51.190 --> 03:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
so we passed this that's with the
 
03:00:53.750 --> 03:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
tolling of the stats limitations was six
 
03:00:55.429 --> 03:00:55.439 align:start position:0%
six years after the 18th birthday for
 
03:00:57.349 --> 03:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
the alleged
 
03:01:00.550 --> 03:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
victim the senate reduced that for three
 
03:01:00.560 --> 03:01:02.070 align:start position:0%
victim the senate reduced that for three
years

03:01:02.070 --> 03:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:01:04.790 --> 03:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
i like the six years better i i wouldn't
 
03:01:05.670 --> 03:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
want to build a
 
03:01:08.309 --> 03:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
lot i think three's better than nothing
 
03:01:09.910 --> 03:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
but i still
 
03:01:12.550 --> 03:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
i think six years is sufficient i mean
 
03:01:14.550 --> 03:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
you can't even buy cigarettes when we
 
03:01:31.670 --> 03:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:34.070 --> 03:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
i think the other sections is clarifying
 
03:01:34.950 --> 03:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
that is the law
 
03:01:37.590 --> 03:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
already yeah it's more clarification
 
03:01:37.600 --> 03:01:38.309 align:start position:0%
already yeah it's more clarification
purposes

03:01:38.309 --> 03:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
03:01:41.510 --> 03:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
but that's the major change i
 
03:01:43.670 --> 03:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
read from the definition of harassment
 
03:01:46.830 --> 03:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:46.840 --> 03:01:47.990 align:start position:0%
 
just

03:01:47.990 --> 03:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:01:49.590 --> 03:01:49.600 align:start position:0%
i was not convinced the change was
 
03:01:52.309 --> 03:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
necessary and so much as it's at least
 
03:01:54.230 --> 03:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
because i don't think that necessarily
 
03:01:55.830 --> 03:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
annoying or alarming amounts to
 
03:01:58.550 --> 03:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
harassment but
 
03:02:00.830 --> 03:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
it's part of the definition of
 
03:02:00.840 --> 03:02:02.950 align:start position:0%
it's part of the definition of
harassment

03:02:02.950 --> 03:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
harassment
 
03:02:04.790 --> 03:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
if you are harassing someone you're
 
03:02:06.790 --> 03:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
annoying or alarming that that's hard
 
03:02:10.630 --> 03:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
harassment is a little bit more
 
03:02:14.830 --> 03:02:14.840 align:start position:0%
all right again
 
03:02:14.840 --> 03:02:28.870 align:start position:0%
all right again
anthologists

03:02:28.870 --> 03:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:42.790 --> 03:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:44.790 --> 03:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
and uh why not on a positive note
 
03:02:48.630 --> 03:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:53.269 --> 03:02:53.279 align:start position:0%
congratulations on hospital 286.
 
03:02:56.150 --> 03:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
this was recently signed into law i
 
03:02:57.349 --> 03:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
believe that's the first bill out of the
 
03:02:58.550 --> 03:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
committee this year that's been signed
 
03:02:59.990 --> 03:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
the law so you get the price
 
03:03:02.469 --> 03:03:02.479 align:start position:0%
there's no official uh prize for that
 
03:03:03.510 --> 03:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
but whatever it is
 
03:03:07.110 --> 03:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
you got it i just um thank you chair
 
03:03:09.590 --> 03:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you members of the committee
 
03:03:11.190 --> 03:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
it was
 
03:03:13.750 --> 03:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
obviously a very bipartisan effort since
 
03:03:15.429 --> 03:03:15.439 align:start position:0%
we couldn't have gotten it that far
 
03:03:17.110 --> 03:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
without um working
 
03:03:20.309 --> 03:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
together on that so um
 
03:03:22.230 --> 03:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
i can't wait to see what comes out of
 
03:03:24.630 --> 03:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
that thanks for everyone's
 
03:03:28.150 --> 03:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
commitment to that thanks chair
 
03:03:31.510 --> 03:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative i just
 
03:03:35.349 --> 03:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask the question yes
 
03:03:39.510 --> 03:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
is it all right with you if i start
 
03:03:45.269 --> 03:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
send senate bill 92 after september
 
03:03:49.429 --> 03:03:49.439 align:start position:0%
uh say after 15th
 
03:03:52.710 --> 03:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
do you have the hearings well i'm not
 
03:03:54.150 --> 03:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure when the subcommittee is
 
03:03:56.150 --> 03:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
going to be able to meet
 
03:03:58.150 --> 03:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
again that's something i would have to
 
03:03:59.830 --> 03:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
consult with the speaker's office on i
 
03:04:02.630 --> 03:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:04.309 --> 03:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
while we're while every well people are
 
03:04:07.510 --> 03:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
participating members of disney remotely
 
03:04:09.830 --> 03:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
these only limited times so we're not
 
03:04:11.349 --> 03:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
going to meet this is the last meeting
 
03:04:12.870 --> 03:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to have
 
03:04:14.870 --> 03:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
we don't have we exact every bill that's
 
03:04:16.550 --> 03:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
been brought to us we're not holding
 
03:04:16.560 --> 03:04:17.830 align:start position:0%
been brought to us we're not holding
anything

03:04:17.830 --> 03:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
anything
 
03:04:19.269 --> 03:04:19.279 align:start position:0%
so it's up to the chairs of those
 
03:04:21.030 --> 03:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittees to figure out when they
 
03:04:21.040 --> 03:04:21.349 align:start position:0%
subcommittees to figure out when they
can

03:04:21.349 --> 03:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:04:24.309 --> 03:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
make the schedule so i just don't know
 
03:04:25.590 --> 03:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
when that that can be done
 
03:04:27.830 --> 03:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
if everyone meets in person would make
 
03:04:28.870 --> 03:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
it easier
 
03:04:31.910 --> 03:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
but i again i don't
 
03:04:34.070 --> 03:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what that's that's up to
 
03:04:35.269 --> 03:04:35.279 align:start position:0%
the members of the community
 
03:04:37.110 --> 03:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
something concerned generally we don't
 
03:04:40.070 --> 03:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
meet during july and august
 
03:04:44.630 --> 03:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
july and august so
 
03:04:44.640 --> 03:04:46.570 align:start position:0%
july and august so
too

03:04:46.570 --> 03:04:46.580 align:start position:0%
too
 
03:04:46.580 --> 03:04:48.550 align:start position:0%
too
[Music]

03:04:48.550 --> 03:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:04:50.550 --> 03:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so i i know everyone wants to was
 
03:04:52.469 --> 03:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
so eager to work on senate bill 92 so
 
03:04:52.479 --> 03:04:53.030 align:start position:0%
so eager to work on senate bill 92 so
i'm

03:04:53.030 --> 03:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
03:04:54.550 --> 03:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
appreciative of wanting to uh get
 
03:04:56.150 --> 03:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
started yeah i thought that usually
 
03:04:57.750 --> 03:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
comes from the speaker also
 
03:05:01.349 --> 03:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
but he tells people when they may stop
 
03:05:13.750 --> 03:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:16.309 --> 03:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
and he's 51 years old so i want you to
 
03:05:18.790 --> 03:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
know that if you read it online
 
03:05:21.110 --> 03:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
you know it's true it's the wrong
 
03:05:21.120 --> 03:05:25.190 align:start position:0%
you know it's true it's the wrong
demonstration

03:05:25.190 --> 03:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:26.870 --> 03:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
i i didn't get dennis anything would you
 
03:05:28.870 --> 03:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
like to swap
 
03:05:31.830 --> 03:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
before do any members have any other
 
03:05:33.110 --> 03:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
questions or comments
 
03:05:36.710 --> 03:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:52.150 --> 03:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:54.309 --> 03:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
can you read me one more time what the
 
03:06:01.269 --> 03:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
old one says
 
03:06:04.309 --> 03:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
the original version that passed in the
 
03:06:04.319 --> 03:06:05.030 align:start position:0%
the original version that passed in the
house

03:06:05.030 --> 03:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
house
 
03:06:06.870 --> 03:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
says any person who violates this
 
03:06:08.550 --> 03:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
provision of this sex shall be guilty of
 
03:06:10.950 --> 03:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
a violation for the first offense
 
03:06:12.870 --> 03:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
in a misdemeanor for a second or
 
03:06:12.880 --> 03:06:16.710 align:start position:0%
in a misdemeanor for a second or
subsequent

03:06:16.710 --> 03:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:18.469 --> 03:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
the senate version says any person who
 
03:06:20.150 --> 03:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
violates the provisions of this section
 
03:06:21.910 --> 03:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
shall be guilty of a violation for the
 
03:06:23.190 --> 03:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
first offense
 
03:06:26.309 --> 03:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
in the misdemeanor for the second
 
03:06:28.950 --> 03:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
or subsequent offense if the court finds
 
03:06:30.230 --> 03:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
that the person has previously been
 
03:06:30.240 --> 03:06:31.510 align:start position:0%
that the person has previously been
convicted

03:06:31.510 --> 03:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
convicted
 
03:06:34.309 --> 03:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
of a violation of this section at the
 
03:06:35.190 --> 03:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
time of
 
03:06:38.309 --> 03:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
of the subsequent advocates so the
 
03:06:38.319 --> 03:06:39.510 align:start position:0%
of the subsequent advocates so the
senate

03:06:39.510 --> 03:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
senate
 
03:06:41.429 --> 03:06:41.439 align:start position:0%
language is clarifying that in order to
 
03:06:43.910 --> 03:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
have a subsequent offense
 
03:06:45.349 --> 03:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
would be considered a second more
 
03:06:48.150 --> 03:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
subsequent offense you must have
 
03:06:50.870 --> 03:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
already been convicted of the act at the
 
03:06:50.880 --> 03:06:51.300 align:start position:0%
already been convicted of the act at the
time

03:06:51.300 --> 03:06:51.310 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:06:51.310 --> 03:06:52.389 align:start position:0%
time
[Music]

03:06:52.389 --> 03:06:52.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:06:54.630 --> 03:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
the second assumption events occurred
 
03:06:56.550 --> 03:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
that's my interesting way to live up
 
03:06:58.870 --> 03:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
not to rehash 90 senate bill 92 but i
 
03:07:00.630 --> 03:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
brought the trump driving situation
 
03:07:03.830 --> 03:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
because that five number one who charged
 
03:07:05.110 --> 03:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
five offenses were all
 
03:07:06.550 --> 03:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
into the first offenses that's because
 
03:07:08.150 --> 03:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
there's never been a conviction
 
03:07:10.870 --> 03:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
so i i understand a lot without the fire
 
03:07:12.469 --> 03:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
it could be written that way
 
03:07:15.510 --> 03:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change the operation of it
 
03:07:17.190 --> 03:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of substance without a prior
 
03:07:19.110 --> 03:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
conviction yeah
 
03:07:22.790 --> 03:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
but that's okay that's right the
 
03:07:22.800 --> 03:07:35.410 align:start position:0%
but that's okay that's right the
difference

03:07:35.410 --> 03:07:35.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:35.420 --> 03:07:36.950 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:07:36.950 --> 03:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:07:38.309 --> 03:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
can write it there it is it's going to
 
03:07:39.750 --> 03:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
be in the law and i don't know if you
 
03:07:43.030 --> 03:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:44.790 --> 03:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
every time we draft the provision as a
 
03:07:46.150 --> 03:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
subsequent offense or a second third
 
03:07:48.150 --> 03:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
fourth defense must be addressed
 
03:07:49.910 --> 03:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
you must have been already convicted i
 
03:07:53.429 --> 03:07:53.439 align:start position:0%
mean it sounds like a lot of
 
03:07:56.389 --> 03:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
i think you weren't going there anyway i
 
03:07:56.870 --> 03:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
will be
 
03:08:00.070 --> 03:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh moving for uh media conferences there
 
03:08:02.389 --> 03:08:02.399 align:start position:0%
i don't believe there's any other bills
 
03:08:04.230 --> 03:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
out there that we haven't discussed in
 
03:08:10.950 --> 03:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:12.550 --> 03:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you everyone that's it that
 
03:08:15.110 --> 03:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
finishes year one for us
