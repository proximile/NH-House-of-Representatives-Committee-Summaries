00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 align:start position:0%
public I am a product of the public
 
00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 align:start position:0%
school system as well as the private
 
00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 align:start position:0%
school system uh both religious and
 
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 align:start position:0%
non-religious private schools and I've
 
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
taught in the public school systems uh
 
00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 align:start position:0%
in both uh Massachusetts and New
 
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I did a long-term sub
 
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
assignment um in North Andover
 
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and I was a science
 
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 align:start position:0%
teacher at Hollis Brook line high school
 
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
for for several years I'm currently the
 
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
technical director for a company called
 
00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
Summit packaging system with
 
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
headquarters in in Manchester New
 
00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so House Bill 748 is relative
 
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 align:start position:0%
to public
 
00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
education and we should really we should
 
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
really understand what the what my
 
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
perspective what my view of of the
 
00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 align:start position:0%
definition of public
 
00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
education public education in New
 
00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire means that each local
 
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
community has an obligation to educate
 
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 align:start position:0%
the children in their Community inherent
 
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
in this responsibility is the Public
 
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
Funding for the education of all
 
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.830 align:start position:0%
Funding for the education of all
children

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 align:start position:0%
so so we we speak of public education
 
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
really what we're talking about is we're
 
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
talking about the the financing the the
 
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
funding public education does not
 
00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to take place in a
 
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 align:start position:0%
public school right public education can
 
00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
can take place in in a lot of different
 
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
locations and so that's what this bill
 
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
is is based on Modern thinking on
 
00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
education is to provide that which is in
 
00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 align:start position:0%
the the best interest of the student and
 
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 align:start position:0%
it's hard to imagine that requiring
 
00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 align:start position:0%
attendance to a particular School based
 
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
on a student's home address will provide
 
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 align:start position:0%
students with the education that is in
 
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
interest if we consider special
 
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
education children a special education
 
00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:22.759 align:start position:0%
system each receive an IEP an individual
 
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
education plan to ensure that the child
 
00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
receives an individualized education
 
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
that is in the best interest of the
 
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
student further those requiring the most
 
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
specialized individual education plan
 
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
are often sent to or tuition into
 
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
private schools most of which are out of
 
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
District that are capable of providing
 
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 align:start position:0%
for the needs that are in the child's
 
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
best interest so the concept and
 
00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
practice of using local taxpayer
 
00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
education Monies to send students to
 
00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
private institutions for public
 
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
education is already in common practice
 
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 align:start position:0%
in fact my hometown of of Deerfield we
 
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
we we only have a prek through eight
 
00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 align:start position:0%
school we have no high school so we we
 
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
have no other option but to tuition our
 
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 align:start position:0%
students to other schools uh currently
 
00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
we uh have the option of conquered High
 
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 align:start position:0%

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
deerfields SAU 53 coob Brown Northwood
 
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
Academy not in our not in our SA or
 
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
pemrick Academy which is in RS um
 
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
currently we have about a third of our
 
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
students attending Co Brown about 2third
 
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
attending conquer and only only a couple
 
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
of kids that that choose pem
 
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 align:start position:0%
Academy two years ago it was virtually
 
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
100% conquered high school because we
 
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 align:start position:0%
had an exclusive contract right it's
 
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
only in the last two years that
 
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
Deerfield um moved away from a one
 
00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:54.039 align:start position:0%
school high school option to a multiple
 
00:06:57.869 --> 00:06:57.879 align:start position:0%
High School option it is expected that
 
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
in the next school year I'm sorry the
 
00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
school year after the next school year
 
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 align:start position:0%
it'll be an even split between Co Brown
 
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
and conquered high school and the year
 
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
after that we expect two-thirds of the
 
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
students to be going to to coob Brown
 
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
Brown this bill is enabling
 
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
legislation so nobody is forced to do
 
00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:28.759 align:start position:0%
anything the bill has very low ballot
 
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
access very low threshold for ballot
 
00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:32.879 align:start position:0%
access so it only takes a a small number
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
of petitioners to place the question
 
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
onto the onto the onto the local
 
00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:41.919 align:start position:0%
ballot that's good because it's ease of
 
00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:45.759 align:start position:0%
access the threshold to enable a local
 
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account is relatively
 
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
high it's 60% right so it's a super
 
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
majority at The Ballot Box so it's easy
 
00:07:57.909 --> 00:07:57.919 align:start position:0%
to ask the question it's not so easy to
 
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
pass the question
 
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
if a district chooses to enable local
 
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
efas and after a year two years 5 years
 
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
10 years whatever whatever period of
 
00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:15.919 align:start position:0%
time if the district no longer believes
 
00:08:17.629 --> 00:08:17.639 align:start position:0%
that that program is in the best
 
00:08:21.149 --> 00:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
interest of their community of their
 
00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
students then the program can be
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
repealed the ballot access for the
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
repeal question is the same loow
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
threshold as the uh threshold to put it
 
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
on the ballot to to initiate the
 
00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
program and the threshold to repeal is
 
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
the same as the threshold to enable so
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
it requires a 60% vote to disable the
 
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
disable the program
 
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
okay it allows the voters it allows the
 
00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
voters of the the citizens of the
 
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
community to decide whether or not they
 
00:08:59.790 --> 00:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
want to make this program available to
 
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.790 align:start position:0%
want to make this program available to
their

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%

Bill
 
00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:12.519 align:start position:0%
counts EFA students so if you enable the
 
00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:15.399 align:start position:0%
program and a student avails themsel of
 
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
a local EFA because they don't have
 
00:09:22.069 --> 00:09:22.079 align:start position:0%
to then they are counted in the district
 
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
for the average daily
 
00:09:28.829 --> 00:09:28.839 align:start position:0%
membership that's important because
 
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:30.680 align:start position:0%
they're count as part of the average
 
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
daily membership the state adequacy
 
00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:36.200 align:start position:0%
funds as well as other funds special ed
 
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.430 align:start position:0%
funds as well as other funds special ed
monies

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
monies
 
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
Etc continue to flow from the state into
 
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.389 align:start position:0%
Etc continue to flow from the state into
the

00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
district the EFA amount is twice state
 
00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
adequacy so that is to say the state
 
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
adequacy Grant would basically be a pass
 
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
through from the state to the district
 
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:09:59.470 --> 00:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
EFA and the Local District would match
 
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.590 align:start position:0%
EFA and the Local District would match
those

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
funds so currently uh state adequacy
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
grants are a little less than
 
00:10:09.389 --> 00:10:09.399 align:start position:0%
$5,000 and so if a community chose to
 
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
enable this then that five that little
 
00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
less than 5,000 from the state would
 
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:16.959 align:start position:0%
flow into the EA and then the district
 
00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:19.519 align:start position:0%
would match that amount into the
 
00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:22.069 align:start position:0%
would match that amount into the
EFA

00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
EFA
 
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
okay there's certain Financial safety
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
nets for for everybody involved so for
 
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
first of all the firste
 
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
grant sets a minimum
 
00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
threshold so if I if I take an EFA this
 
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
year my grant is
 
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
X subsequent years going forward for
 
00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
that child for that student the grant
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
would never be less than that so that
 
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:50.680 align:start position:0%
way the family knows what their what
 
00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
their minimum threshold funding is going
 
00:10:53.399 --> 00:10:54.190 align:start position:0%
their minimum threshold funding is going
to

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:54.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
be the grant is recalculated
 
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
annually so if the adequacy the state
 
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
adequacy number moves then the local
 
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
number would move up or
 
00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
down but if it moves down it never goes
 
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
below the first year funding for that
 
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
student that's a family safety
 
00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
net if a child takes an EFA and they get
 
00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
to 20 they graduate high school
 
00:11:21.629 --> 00:11:21.639 align:start position:0%
whichever comes first if there's money
 
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
left over in the EFA account that money
 
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
reverts back to the local school
 
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:30.200 align:start position:0%
district so any unspent monies goes back
 
00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:32.519 align:start position:0%
uh to the general fund of the of the
 
00:11:38.829 --> 00:11:38.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
district special education in the bill
 
00:11:45.069 --> 00:11:45.079 align:start position:0%
is specifically called
 
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
out to be at the discretion of the local
 
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.949 align:start position:0%
out to be at the discretion of the local
school

00:11:49.949 --> 00:11:49.959 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
district so special education does not
 
00:11:57.629 --> 00:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
change for the district or for the
 
00:11:59.949 --> 00:11:59.959 align:start position:0%
student special ed
 
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
location of services from an IEP are at
 
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
the discretion of the school
 
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
district so let's say we have a student
 
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
that needs speech therapy or help in
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
math or you know whatever the case may
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
be if the school district says look we
 
00:12:18.189 --> 00:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
provide that service inhouse in this
 
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
school and and this is where the service
 
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
is available then then somebody taking a
 
00:12:25.189 --> 00:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
local EFA they have to agree to that
 
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
they have to agree that the local
 
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:29.240 align:start position:0%
district has a discretion of where the
 
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
special ed takes
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
place so that's important because what
 
00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
it does is it prevents um somebody from
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
from getting uh tuition into a school
 
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
that doesn't offer the surface right and
 
00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:44.519 align:start position:0%
then mandating that either that school
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
offer it or that the the the sending
 
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
District The Local District would have
 
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:51.160 align:start position:0%
to pay for it there right because that
 
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
that creates a a very high financial
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
burden on local school districts already
 
00:12:59.310 --> 00:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
financially um struggling for for
 
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
various reasons so the special ed stays
 
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
in place at the discretion of the The
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
Local District uh District the the IEP
 
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
process doesn't change right so the the
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
the development of an IEP is is is in
 
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
partnership with a local school district
 
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
uh the family and the student right so
 
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519 align:start position:0%
that that process Remains the Same and
 
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:23.720 align:start position:0%
intact you just you simply can't take a
 
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
local EFA and then demand special ed
 
00:13:28.189 --> 00:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
services wherever uh wherever you you
 
00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:30.519 align:start position:0%
want to go to go get
 
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
that uh so that that's an important
 
00:13:45.389 --> 00:13:45.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:49.839 align:start position:0%
bill the the other thing that's
 
00:13:52.949 --> 00:13:52.959 align:start position:0%
important is that we hear a lot of
 
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
complaints relative to the state EFA
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
program relative to accountability
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
right that that the the public school
 
00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:06.519 align:start position:0%
system has a level of accountability
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
that that some would say does not exist
 
00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
outside of the public school
 
00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
system and so uh to reach to reach
 
00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
across to try to bridge that Gap because
 
00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
I I'm not convinced that that's true but
 
00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
to bridge that Gap the this bill 748
 
00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:30.279 align:start position:0%
requires that local EFA particip ANS
 
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
take the New Hampshire Statewide
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
assessment system
 
00:14:37.389 --> 00:14:37.399 align:start position:0%
evaluations right assessments as
 
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
scheduled by the
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
state that's the same
 
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
accountability that we use for local
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
public schools right that's that's the
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
accountability method is the just it
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
used to be the the kneecap then it was
 
00:14:53.069 --> 00:14:53.079 align:start position:0%
smarter balance for a few years now it's
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire SAS
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
right the reason I'm not convinced about
 
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:01.160 align:start position:0%
the accountability um
 
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
claim is when we look at when we look at
 
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
assessment results even though New
 
00:15:08.749 --> 00:15:08.759 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is one of the best
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
academically best performing states in
 
00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
the nation we still struggle to get
 
00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:15.759 align:start position:0%
proficiency rates at at
 
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
50% and yet I don't hear anybody
 
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:21.160 align:start position:0%
clamoring to somehow remedy that right
 
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
that's a it's a local control
 
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
issue but that is the accountability
 
00:15:29.309 --> 00:15:29.319 align:start position:0%
vehicle and so um that remain means to
 
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
be the accountability uh vehicle in this
 
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
in this bill I don't I don't want to
 
00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
take I've already taken up 15 minutes of
 
00:15:36.509 --> 00:15:36.519 align:start position:0%
your time I I don't want to take up any
 
00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
more um I would certainly be willing to
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
answer any and all questions that uh
 
00:15:44.749 --> 00:15:44.759 align:start position:0%
members may have thank you I have one
 
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
question the local match doesn't they
 
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
don't match differentiated Aid
 
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
correct yeah thank you for the question
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
so um when I was looking at the fiscal
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
note on this bill um I believe the
 
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
department of Education um got it
 
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
incorrect right in their calculation the
 
00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:06.680 align:start position:0%
the the local EFA Grant is double State
 
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.430 align:start position:0%
the the local EFA Grant is double State
adequacy

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:08.440 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
period but uh the the other potential uh
 
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
funding sources and and let me just get
 
00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
to that that list so I don't misquote it
 
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
um free and reduced um meals special
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
education Aid English language earner um
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
none of that would be doubled that money
 
00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
would still flow to the child but not at
 
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
Double the rate it's it's only the the
 
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that's important to
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
note is there's no double dipping right
 
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
so the New Hampshire um scholarship
 
00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
which is by business tax donation uh you
 
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
can't take a local EFA and participate
 
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
in that and you cannot participate in a
 
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
local EFA and a state EFA because you
 
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:54.440 align:start position:0%
are counted as average daily membership
 
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
you you are technically a member of that
 
00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
school district even though you're
 
00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
you're you're going to get your
 
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
education somewhere else so you cannot
 
00:17:05.309 --> 00:17:05.319 align:start position:0%
get a local EFA and a state EFA right so
 
00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
it's it's one or the other if any thank
 
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the question any
 
00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:13.559 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:17:15.789 --> 00:17:15.799 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you manam chair good
 
00:17:18.909 --> 00:17:18.919 align:start position:0%
morning good morning uh just a couple if
 
00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
I may um going back to the special
 
00:17:24.909 --> 00:17:24.919 align:start position:0%
education funding uh qu professional
 
00:17:27.669 --> 00:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
education if a youngster was taking the
 
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
local EFA then why would the local
 
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
school system still be required to pay
 
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
for the special education program and
 
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:37.240 align:start position:0%
provide it they sort of opted out of the
 
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
local system but now you're saying the
 
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
the local system has to still provide
 
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
the special education training for yeah
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
representative it's it's always an
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
interesting um it's always an
 
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:51.640 align:start position:0%
interesting sort of debate as to how we
 
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
how we choose to handle special
 
00:17:57.549 --> 00:17:57.559 align:start position:0%
education right so my interest my
 
00:18:00.149 --> 00:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
motivation is to provide what is in the
 
00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
best interest of the child the best
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
interest of the student right the best
 
00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
interest of the student is to not offer
 
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
money to leave the district at the cost
 
00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:16.039 align:start position:0%
of having special ed Stripped Away but I
 
00:18:18.149 --> 00:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
also believe that it's an unreasonable
 
00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
burden to say if you choose to go
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
elsewhere then the the the special ed
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
has to follow you right so because that
 
00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
that becomes financially very burdensome
 
00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:31.640 align:start position:0%
with transportation and other issues
 
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
interestingly locala you you lose the
 
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:37.720 align:start position:0%
the the transportation and so it's it's
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
to try to find um a happy medium a place
 
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
in the middle that works for everybody
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
so because the special ed is still in
 
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
the Local District at their discretion
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
there really should be no change to cost
 
00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:54.200 align:start position:0%
to the district for that right because
 
00:18:56.149 --> 00:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
it's the same services in the same place
 
00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
that would otherwise be offered and it's
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
up to the the student or the student's
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
family to get them to and from that
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
location so to me um that seems like a a
 
00:19:08.029 --> 00:19:08.039 align:start position:0%
happy medium to to best meet everybody's
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
needs I follow up thank you um a
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
different question but I want to go back
 
00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
to the special ed piece again if if the
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
if the youngster is going to uh Play
 
00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
Somewhere Else EFA and you're under your
 
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
program and they come back to the school
 
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
district I think did I hear you say
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
initially that the
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
additional revenue for free reduced
 
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
special dispensation uh ESL uh those
 
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
three or four different differentiated
 
00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
increases in uh the money for would flow
 
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
through the student I think I heard you
 
00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:46.919 align:start position:0%
say that that that's that's the way the
 
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
bills R okay so if they flow through
 
00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
then the then the local community would
 
00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
not be getting any of the special ed
 
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
funding to help support that youngster
 
00:19:59.549 --> 00:19:59.559 align:start position:0%
um but you're they're coming back and
 
00:20:02.909 --> 00:20:02.919 align:start position:0%
stff to take special in the in the
 
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
community you see what I mean oh I I I
 
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
fully connect the dots and and I'm not
 
00:20:09.549 --> 00:20:09.559 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly not going to to disagree
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
with you um the the amount of money
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
that's flowing from the state is
 
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
relatively small right one of the
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
biggest challenges with special ed and
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons special ed is
 
00:20:24.669 --> 00:20:24.679 align:start position:0%
swamping so many school districts local
 
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
budgets is because special ed really is
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
a federal mandate is and the state law
 
00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
mirrors the federal requirements but
 
00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
it's not really a state requirement it's
 
00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
a federal requirement and unfortunately
 
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
the federal government refuses to fully
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
fund the special ed mandates that it
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
puts on States and local school
 
00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:46.919 align:start position:0%
districts and so well I don't disagree
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
that you you could have you could have
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
that right the question is how many how
 
00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
many special ed students will take a
 
00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:55.720 align:start position:0%
local EFA but come back for special ed
 
00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
you know that that's hard to predict um
 
00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:00.440 align:start position:0%
I I would say that that we could come
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
back and and fix that in the future if
 
00:21:06.909 --> 00:21:06.919 align:start position:0%
it became if it became an issue um I
 
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
don't I don't want to let the perfect
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
become the enemy of the good
 
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:13.480 align:start position:0%
respectfully thank you m CH sure
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
represent Murray thank you madam chair
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question if I'm
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
understanding you correctly with regard
 
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.039 align:start position:0%
to special ed Transportation you're
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
stating that it would be 100% the
 
00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:25.240 align:start position:0%
parents fiscal responsibility to find a
 
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle a transportation modality to um
 
00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
transport a child to a location of
 
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:31.990 align:start position:0%
transport a child to a location of
they're

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
choosing yeah thank you for the question
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
so it's actually transportation is
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
actually you know universally the
 
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the the student or the
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
student's family right they are excuse
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
me they are counted as for uh average
 
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
daily membership so that the state funds
 
00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
still flow into the district but just
 
00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
like any child that that leaves a school
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
district thing the burden of
 
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
Transportation now is on that student or
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
that student's family so so if I choose
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
to let's say I chose to do what my
 
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
parents chose to do right and send my
 
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
kids to Bishop Brady High School and
 
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
then I'm on the hook for that for that
 
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
well it's a bad I'm sorry that's a bad
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
example because there's no legal
 
00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:20.360 align:start position:0%
requirement to provide High School
 
00:22:22.269 --> 00:22:22.279 align:start position:0%
transportation so let me back up a
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
little bit so let's say that um I chose
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
to be more proactive than my parents and
 
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
send my uh children to say St John's
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
here in conquer right which is uh
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
through grade 8 last I
 
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
knew if I make that choice then I have
 
00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:38.919 align:start position:0%
to provide the transportation to and
 
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
from that school that becomes my that
 
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
becomes my
 
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility um if I may ask even
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
though the IEP May specifically
 
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:51.320 align:start position:0%
enumerate services that are included and
 
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
transportation is included in that so in
 
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
the plan for example how the child is
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
transported on and off the bus or
 
00:22:59.710 --> 00:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
anything like that that might be
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
specified in the child's IEP how can
 
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
that how how can you be recognizing the
 
00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:08.200 align:start position:0%
IEP and then in one in one instance and
 
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
then for transportation purposes related
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
to that not recogniz yeah I yeah I
 
00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:13.720 align:start position:0%
better understand your question now I
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
apologize for not not seeing forward
 
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
enough so there's there's two different
 
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
worlds that we're talking about right
 
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
there is there is one where um little
 
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
Kevin needs uh needs help with
 
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.070 align:start position:0%
Kevin needs uh needs help with
articulation

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
articulation
 
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
of the spoken word right and so that's a
 
00:23:34.029 --> 00:23:34.039 align:start position:0%
service that I that I get my local
 
00:23:34.039 --> 00:23:35.029 align:start position:0%
service that I that I get my local
District

00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
District
 
00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:37.799 align:start position:0%
school but now I'm choosing a local EFA
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
so I'm not there anymore if I still want
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
to Avail myself of the articulation
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
assistance right then it's it's the
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
burden on me or my family to get me to
 
00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
and from there once it is once
 
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
transportation is placed into an IEP
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
right so we can we can imagine um a
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
student that is in some certain
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
condition that requires special
 
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
Transportation then then it would be my
 
00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
understanding that that that would that
 
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
would still flow as it does
 
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
today right because it's specified in
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
the IP so you can't you can't if it's in
 
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
the IEP you cannot say
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
no okay follow up sure don't be sorry
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
it's all fun so then if a service
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
provider for example comes into the
 
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
district uh initially or travels to a
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
school like often happens to provide
 
00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
services for a child they're also then
 
00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:39.320 align:start position:0%
coming to provide services and then may
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
leave at once they're done providing
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
services to a student or multiple
 
00:24:44.669 --> 00:24:44.679 align:start position:0%
students throughout the day and head to
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
their next placement um to address other
 
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
students so how are you how are
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
you stating that those services or are
 
00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
you're you're forgoing those with regard
 
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
to to local I'm having a hard time
 
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
understanding where those where that
 
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
wall ends sure I think I understand the
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
question so a local EFA is a choice it
 
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
is a choice it is a choice that a
 
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
student makes it is a choice that the
 
00:25:18.029 --> 00:25:18.039 align:start position:0%
student's family makes right to
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
determine for themselves what is in the
 
00:25:22.909 --> 00:25:22.919 align:start position:0%
best interest of the
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
child and so if if my special service is
 
00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.870 align:start position:0%
child and so if if my special service is
speech

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
speech
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
articulation and it is offered Tuesday
 
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
at 9:00 a.m. at the Deerfield community
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
school because that's where I live is in
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
Deerfield then if I want to continue to
 
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919 align:start position:0%
Avail myself of that it is the burden on
 
00:25:45.149 --> 00:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
me or my family to get me to that school
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
for 9:00 speech therapy that's
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
articulation that that's that's the
 
00:25:53.789 --> 00:25:53.799 align:start position:0%
challenge right with with Choice it's
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
not it's not hey I get to take the money
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
and I get to have everything that I want
 
00:25:59.789 --> 00:25:59.799 align:start position:0%
there's there's pluses and minuses
 
00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
there's tradeoffs and and if you if you
 
00:26:03.789 --> 00:26:03.799 align:start position:0%
can't make that
 
00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:06.200 align:start position:0%
work right if you can't make that work
 
00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:08.440 align:start position:0%
and you believe that that's critical to
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the child then you
 
00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
have to make a different decision right
 
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
there's there's no it it all goes back
 
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
to there is no one size fits
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
all okay so I have twin
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
daughters one wants to go into Musical
 
00:26:33.389 --> 00:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
theater the other I would qualify as an
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
academic right just a little
 
00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
Brainiac conquered High School in crtc
 
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
has probably hands down the best theater
 
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:45.640 align:start position:0%
program in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:26:47.789 --> 00:26:47.799 align:start position:0%
and at the time my children entered high
 
00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
school that was our school of
 
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
record and she was excited she was over
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
the moon to be able to attend that
 
00:26:58.750 --> 00:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
program right that's great
 
00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.190 align:start position:0%
program right that's great
that's

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:00.200 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
awesome my other daughter looked at the
 
00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
academic program at conquer high school
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
and with all due respect in in her
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
assessment and in our assessment we
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
found it to be uh lacking not not up to
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
what would be in the best interest of
 
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.510 align:start position:0%
what would be in the best interest of
our

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:27:19.789 --> 00:27:19.799 align:start position:0%
child and for that reason we sent one of
 
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
our daughters to coob Brown Northwood
 
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
Academy before it was a choice for
 
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
Deerfield because we believe that was in
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the child
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
right so no we we had we had a boss to
 
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
conquer it so transportation's there
 
00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
there's no transportation to to co Brown
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
you know we we made it work was it easy
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
no but it was a choice it was a choice
 
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
we made this this bill simply opens up
 
00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
choices since I'm on the since I'm on
 
00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.230 align:start position:0%
choices since I'm on the since I'm on
the

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:52.919 align:start position:0%
theme the current EFA
 
00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:56.200 align:start position:0%
program allows enough money so that some
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
families where other options in the
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
Local District
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
school are Out Of Reach they it can it
 
00:28:05.509 --> 00:28:05.519 align:start position:0%
can help them bridge that
 
00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
Gap if you double that amount if you
 
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
double that amount you make other
 
00:28:15.549 --> 00:28:15.559 align:start position:0%
opportunities fairly close to Universal
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
will everybody be able to afford
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
wherever they want to go no but this
 
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
amount of money would put a lot of
 
00:28:24.029 --> 00:28:24.039 align:start position:0%
options into the reach of a lot of
 
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
families a lot of
 
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
students one of the things that that
 
00:28:30.269 --> 00:28:30.279 align:start position:0%
people say is well you know if you have
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
this you're going to you're going to
 
00:28:33.509 --> 00:28:33.519 align:start position:0%
decimate the local public school you're
 
00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
going to decimate it I don't believe
 
00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:38.039 align:start position:0%
that because the only way you decimate
 
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
it is if kids leave right if your local
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
public school is not attracting local
 
00:28:47.669 --> 00:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
students right if if if people start
 
00:28:49.789 --> 00:28:49.799 align:start position:0%
taking efas and going other places that
 
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
should tell your local school they are
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
not providing the goods and services
 
00:28:56.269 --> 00:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
that their customers
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
want think about the vantages of a local
 
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
public school one is transportation is
 
00:29:03.509 --> 00:29:03.519 align:start position:0%
guaranteed through grade eight although
 
00:29:06.389 --> 00:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
not required After High School most
 
00:29:09.149 --> 00:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
people want their children to be raised
 
00:29:11.509 --> 00:29:11.519 align:start position:0%
in the local community they want them to
 
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
have a sense of place right that I grew
 
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
up here I grew up in Penbrook I am proud
 
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
I grew up in Penbrook most of us are
 
00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
proud of where we grew up right oh I
 
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
grew up here great place loved it not
 
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:25.720 align:start position:0%
everybody most people most people want
 
00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:29.799 align:start position:0%
that right most people want their their
 
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
kids to be raised with their friends and
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
neighbors kids that live in their
 
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
Community it's a short commute for the
 
00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
for the most part local schools are are
 
00:29:42.029 --> 00:29:42.039 align:start position:0%
the are the closest option right with
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
Transportation there's a lot of
 
00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:46.840 align:start position:0%
advantages there a lot of advantages but
 
00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:49.559 align:start position:0%
there is no one school that fits every
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
kid that fits every every opportunity
 
00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:55.039 align:start position:0%
and all I'm trying to do is to find a
 
00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
mechanism to allow communities to open
 
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
up uh opportunities to to
 
00:30:04.029 --> 00:30:04.039 align:start position:0%
students representative Cornell thank
 
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
you mam chair thank you for taking my
 
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
question I couldn't see an income
 
00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
eligibility on this cap for so I have a
 
00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:14.039 align:start position:0%
question if if I make
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
$750,000 a year and I want to send my
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
child to St Paul's and they'll get um
 
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
the money from the local taxpayer the
 
00:30:28.029 --> 00:30:28.039 align:start position:0%
property taxes but my neighbor makes
 
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
$65,000 a year their property taxes are
 
00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
going to be paying to send my child to
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
St Paul's when I make
 
00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
$750,000 a year can can I ask a personal
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
question yes what what community did you
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
raise your children in I I don't want to
 
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
answer pick pick one pick a pick a town
 
00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
at random Manchester and when you when
 
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
you so you're making
 
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
$750,000 which is awesome good for you
 
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you're successful this is this
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
is an example this isn't me I I
 
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
understand so we're just in the
 
00:31:02.509 --> 00:31:02.519 align:start position:0%
hypothetical all right and so when when
 
00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:04.919 align:start position:0%
you brought your children to the
 
00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:07.799 align:start position:0%
Manchester School District did they ask
 
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
you how much you earn to determine what
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
access to local public education you
 
00:31:16.269 --> 00:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
would get for
 
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
free I don't that's not answering the
 
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
question public education is available
 
00:31:22.629 --> 00:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
to everybody St Paul's is not available
 
00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
to everybody okay thank you so so public
 
00:31:27.549 --> 00:31:27.559 align:start position:0%
education is available to everybody we
 
00:31:31.269 --> 00:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
do not means test public education in
 
00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire right except for local
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
except for State efas hold on allow me
 
00:31:37.789 --> 00:31:37.799 align:start position:0%
to to answer the question please we do
 
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
not means test public education in New
 
00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in fact I would say it is
 
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
antithetical to the New Hampshire
 
00:31:47.789 --> 00:31:47.799 align:start position:0%
tradition to means test for access to
 
00:31:47.799 --> 00:31:48.830 align:start position:0%
tradition to means test for access to
public

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
education this is a local
 
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
EFA for me local public education is the
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
funding of a child's educ ation using
 
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:01.720 align:start position:0%
public monies it is not about the school
 
00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
that the child attends or where they get
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
the education so if if so when I brought
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
my kids to the dfield community
 
00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
school at young age they did that say Mr
 
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
Mrs verbel how much do you make oh you
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
make that much you can have English and
 
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
math for free if you want anything
 
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
beyond that you have to chip in we do
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
not means test public educ not answering
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
my question my question was I don't
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
think do you think it's fair that the
 
00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
person making $65,000 a year and paying
 
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
property taxes is contributing to your
 
00:32:35.789 --> 00:32:35.799 align:start position:0%
child to go to St Paul's when you make
 
00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:38.519 align:start position:0%
$750,000 a year and that's a choice you
 
00:32:40.629 --> 00:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
were talking about choices it's a choice
 
00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
to go to St Paul's if you make that
 
00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:45.320 align:start position:0%
choice you pay for it
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
correct thank you now allow me to answer
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
the question if if if I may you ask the
 
00:32:52.629 --> 00:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
question allow me the the the
 
00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:55.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to answer it so the local
 
00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
EFA is going to generate less than
 
00:32:59.629 --> 00:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
$10,000 I have to admit I have not
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
pinged uh St Paul's School for what
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
their tuition rate is I'm going to
 
00:33:05.789 --> 00:33:05.799 align:start position:0%
assume it's significantly higher than
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
that right and so you are still going to
 
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
pay because the local EFA is not going
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
to pay all of that tuition right it's
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
probably going to it's probably going to
 
00:33:19.389 --> 00:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
help yes what about what about the
 
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
families that don't have
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
children is it fair for them to pay for
 
00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
your child's education yes okay so so
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
then it's then it's fair for them to if
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
I may finish the answer back do we have
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
rules here with resp colloques yes we've
 
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
already had enough questions uh we're
 
00:33:41.789 --> 00:33:41.799 align:start position:0%
not doing it back and forth It's not a
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
debate thank you m
 
00:33:43.519 --> 00:33:45.350 align:start position:0%
debate thank you m
chair

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
representative thank you uh in your
 
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
extended remarks you actually kind of
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
brushed uh past or began to delve into
 
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
the question that I was going to ask
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
earlier but I'm still going to ask it
 
00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
but a little bit differently and that is
 
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
um I I I I see from the 40,000 F foot
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
level we've gone into quite a lot of
 
00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:08.919 align:start position:0%
detail here from the 40,000 foot level
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
um there there seems to be an objection
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
to a program such as this one and and
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
efas in general um that is expressed and
 
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
has been expressed by candidates in the
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
last election at the very least that if
 
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
programs such as this one were to be
 
00:34:28.589 --> 00:34:28.599 align:start position:0%
implemented that this would d destroy
 
00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:31.960 align:start position:0%
the public schools um are you aware of
 
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
that argument and which it appears that
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
you are and what do you believes the
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
rational and realistic basis for
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
believing that providing an alternative
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
such as this one to parents who are
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in with in their districts to
 
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
make a choice such as this one um what
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
what's the rational and realistic fear a
 
00:34:55.629 --> 00:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
basis for that fear do you believe thank
 
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question you agree
 
00:34:58.109 --> 00:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
with that thank you for question
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative I I I appreciate it so so
 
00:35:04.829 --> 00:35:04.839 align:start position:0%
certainly um one of the things that that
 
00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
we constantly hear is that school choice
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
will destroy um local public education
 
00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire or any
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
place that it's that it's
 
00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
introduced I do not believe
 
00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:19.400 align:start position:0%
that in
 
00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:24.280 align:start position:0%
fact if if you do believe that right
 
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
then then the burden should be on you to
 
00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.430 align:start position:0%
then then the burden should be on you to
explain

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
explain
 
00:35:32.349 --> 00:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
why now I can I can
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
hypothesize a potential
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
scenario where perhaps that might
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
begin so you can
 
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
imagine that I live in a
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
district where my local public
 
00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
school is
 
00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
failing and let's define failing right
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
so since the since the the the means of
 
00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
fig figuring out the accountability of a
 
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
school we're looking at proficiency
 
00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
rates on the state
 
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
assessment and there are
 
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
districts that year after
 
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
year struggle to hit 25% of their
 
00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:13.710 align:start position:0%
year struggle to hit 25% of their
students

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:13.720 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
proficient it's tragic it's absolutely
 
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:19.480 align:start position:0%
tragic and and it's not about teaching
 
00:36:22.109 --> 00:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
to the test right we're talking about
 
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
English language arts mathematics basic
 
00:36:28.589 --> 00:36:28.599 align:start position:0%
science at at grade four through eight
 
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
and as junior in high school so we're
 
00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
not we're not talking about doctoral
 
00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:36.440 align:start position:0%
dissertations so imagine imagine we have
 
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
this this failing local public
 
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
school and all of a sudden the people
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
that live in that District have access
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
to enough money that allows them another
 
00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
choice to a school that they believe
 
00:36:52.829 --> 00:36:52.839 align:start position:0%
will provide a better educational
 
00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity I can imagine a lot of
 
00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
people wanting to Avail themselves of
 
00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:00.839 align:start position:0%
that opportunity to get their children
 
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
out of that failing
 
00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
school and I wouldn't blame them a
 
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
bit what I would
 
00:37:12.309 --> 00:37:12.319 align:start position:0%
say is that none of this can shift
 
00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
quickly fact of the matter is there's no
 
00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:19.640 align:start position:0%
seats there's no available seats there
 
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
aren't enough open seats in private
 
00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
schools and other settings in this new
 
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
in this state for a mass exitus out of
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
the public school
 
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:33.640 align:start position:0%
system now if we enable the
 
00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
program and all the available seats what
 
00:37:38.309 --> 00:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
few there are get
 
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
filled my gut tells me the market will
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
respond and that private schools will
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
try to increase their capacity to to to
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
do what's in their best interest as a
 
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
school and then as those seats become
 
00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
available you can imagine more children
 
00:37:59.910 --> 00:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
moving out of that District but we're
 
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
talking about processes that take uh
 
00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.790 align:start position:0%
talking about processes that take uh
several

00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
several
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
years and I would hope that the local
 
00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
school district when they see this trend
 
00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
retool what they're doing to reattach
 
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
their customers their local students to
 
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
school follow up and we're going to take
 
00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:25.640 align:start position:0%
one more question after this followup is
 
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
is what you've just described not at the
 
00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
very heart of competition as opposed to
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
Monopoly thank you for the question so
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
so that is one of the challenges with um
 
00:38:38.309 --> 00:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
local public schools is they are a
 
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
monopoly right and the only way out of
 
00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
the Monopoly is to have enough money
 
00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
after you pay for the local school and
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
your local property tax to have enough
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
money left over for another opportunity
 
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
and and so yes it when we look at
 
00:38:54.589 --> 00:38:54.599 align:start position:0%
schools that are failing year after year
 
00:38:57.069 --> 00:38:57.079 align:start position:0%
after year less than 25% proficient
 
00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
English language arts mathematics and
 
00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
science I would agree that interjecting
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
some competition for those students
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
would be the way to entice those schools
 
00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
to improve the product and services
 
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
they're offering their local customers
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
thank you one more question
 
00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
chair um this might be a little bit
 
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
clunky but on page six uh line 30 um
 
00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:21.640 align:start position:0%
section 4 I think this is regarding the
 
00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:23.079 align:start position:0%
superintendent of the Local District
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
notifying students of their
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
determination and eligibility
 
00:39:30.309 --> 00:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
no later than July so I'm sorry so I'm
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
on page six the lines please four um
 
00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
line 30
 
00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
please it's uh sub paragraph 4 yes um
 
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
talking about eligibility determination
 
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
by July
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
14th um so my question to you would be
 
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
um a couple of things with regard to the
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization um being
 
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
responsible for the initial receipt of
 
00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
funds correct you describ this as a pass
 
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
through from the scholarship
 
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
organization then to the state and then
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
local level correct so if the question
 
00:39:59.710 --> 00:39:59.720 align:start position:0%
is the mechanism I'm not I'm not fully
 
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
to the question hold on one second no no
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
that but the initial question is is
 
00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
what's what's the what's the flow of the
 
00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
money right and so this that's not my
 
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
question just one second please okay so
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
you don't have a question I got continue
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
the question that I do have is in the
 
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
event that a student enrolls later um in
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
the year after July 14th how is
 
00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
eligibility then determined is that a is
 
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
that something that um the district will
 
00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
communicate with a scholarship
 
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
organization to determine if there are
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
funds available and then um in addition
 
00:40:32.589 --> 00:40:32.599 align:start position:0%
to that how do you then notify folks
 
00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
after the July 14th deadline because
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
oftentimes people move throughout the
 
00:40:39.069 --> 00:40:39.079 align:start position:0%
year yeah that's an that's an excellent
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
question so first of all the the way the
 
00:40:44.829 --> 00:40:44.839 align:start position:0%
money moves is the same as the state EFA
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh but instead of coming from um the the
 
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
State Treasury Department it comes from
 
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
the the local school district right and
 
00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
the the timing of those payments uh is
 
00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
set up to to go along with the timing of
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:04.839 align:start position:0%
um this there there is no um there's no
 
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:07.480 align:start position:0%
pration currently in this in this bill
 
00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
so it is my understanding that basically
 
00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
you would start at the beginning of the
 
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
year um if you um if you come out of it
 
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
early then uh the money would go back to
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
the to the Local
 
00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
District thank you thank you
 
00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.190 align:start position:0%
District thank you thank you
representative

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
verbil could you fill out a pink card
 
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
apologies thank
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to do a uh three minute time
 
00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
limit well I said on five minutes and
 
00:42:05.309 --> 00:42:05.319 align:start position:0%
what I have to say he took a lot of time
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
so yeah we always give preference to the
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor to legis but actually one
 
00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
of the things that he pointed out was in
 
00:42:17.109 --> 00:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
my um testimony and he had clarified
 
00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
that so maybe I feel like what I have to
 
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
say it's going to be five minutes I'll
 
00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:24.200 align:start position:0%
try to make it shorter so um Madame
 
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
chair and uh Vice chair and the members
 
00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
of the education policy Administration
 
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
committee I would like to um introduce
 
00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:37.640 align:start position:0%
myself my name is Patty long and I from
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
Peterboro and I'm a retired public
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
school teacher I'm also a parent of two
 
00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
daughters who attended Catholic
 
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
school and I am a parent of a son who
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
went through the public
 
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
school I am here today in strong
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
opposition uh to HB 748 establishing a
 
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
local education Freedom account program
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
LFA we all know that New Hampshire
 
00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:14.920 align:start position:0%
schools are primarily funded by our
 
00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:16.470 align:start position:0%
schools are primarily funded by our
property

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
taxpayers the proposed
 
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
legislation will be double the current
 
00:43:26.069 --> 00:43:26.079 align:start position:0%
cost of the education Freedom account
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
now do I understand understand that
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
correctly I hope I do because it seems
 
00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:32.079 align:start position:0%
like the numbers didn't add up but I'm
 
00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
going to go on the expense for the
 
00:43:36.549 --> 00:43:36.559 align:start position:0%
student toes an
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
$853 and
 
00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:49.640 align:start position:0%
28 this is double the current cost of an
 
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
EFA so they said that they were going to
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
double according to the bill the way it
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
was presented everything was being d
 
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
doubled so I was understanding that if
 
00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
you received reduced aid for Meal
 
00:44:04.549 --> 00:44:04.559 align:start position:0%
special education and an English
 
00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
language learner would receive a total
 
00:44:06.839 --> 00:44:08.430 align:start position:0%
language learner would receive a total
over

00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:08.440 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
$119,000 which is actually income
 
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
taxfree to their family which would be
 
00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
deposited into the class Wallet account
 
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
however the person that presented the
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
bill said that that was incorrect so
 
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
thankfully that is because otherwise if
 
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
you're a family of four it would have
 
00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
cost 77,000
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
to educate those four children so I'm
 
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
going to go on to my next point in the
 
00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
bill it propo the proposed legislation
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
Grant they want it to be administered by
 
00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
the local school district and a
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization right now the
 
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
EFA funds are currently administered by
 
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
the children's scholarship fund this PL
 
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
this organization is located in New York
 
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
City and they presently receive
 
00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
10% of the total value of every
 
00:45:04.549 --> 00:45:04.559 align:start position:0%
EFA for the year 2024 the children's
 
00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization received over
 
00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
$1.8 million just to administer the fund
 
00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
which was paid using New Hampshire tax
 
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
dollars these administrators of costs
 
00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
include large salaries for one or more
 
00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:25.880 align:start position:0%
administrators and these administrative
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
costs do not deliver direct academic
 
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
support and educational programs for our
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
students I want to talk to the bill
 
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
where it talks about that there
 
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
accessing the program there still would
 
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
be the ability to use um qualifying
 
00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
expenditures lefas would be available to
 
00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
families who wish to educate their
 
00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:52.280 align:start position:0%
children outside of the state public
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
school system and would allow to buy
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
educational programs and services
 
00:46:00.589 --> 00:46:00.599 align:start position:0%
presently the EFA funds are accessible
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
to parents with their class wallet
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
accounts which are used for private
 
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:09.160 align:start position:0%

00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
horseback riding ballet classes as well
 
00:46:17.589 --> 00:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
as the purchase of non returnable items
 
00:46:20.549 --> 00:46:20.559 align:start position:0%
such as school uniforms ski equipment
 
00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
and even posos why would taxpayers agree
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
to having the children's scholarship
 
00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.710 align:start position:0%
to having the children's scholarship
organization

00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
oversee these unchecked expenditures
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
from their local school property tax
 
00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:37.640 align:start position:0%
excuse me we we've hit the time limit
 
00:46:40.589 --> 00:46:40.599 align:start position:0%
can you just make your last point I'm
 
00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
going we all have my I hope you read so
 
00:46:45.309 --> 00:46:45.319 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give my last point the
 
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
bottom line is this if this legislation
 
00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
passes then someday Little Johnny being
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
a beneficiary of the local education
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
Freedom account expansion will no longer
 
00:47:01.069 --> 00:47:01.079 align:start position:0%
be in public school while little Susie
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
who once sat beside him her education
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
funding is now worth half of what
 
00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:11.800 align:start position:0%
Johnny's is is that what we taxpayers
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
and citizens really want for the future
 
00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:17.839 align:start position:0%
of our children I hope during your
 
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
executive session I ask you to consider
 
00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
the negative financial implications to
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
TA to the New Hampshire taxpayers and
 
00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
more important importantly the adverse
 
00:47:31.589 --> 00:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
education opportunities it will impose
 
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
on children in our Public Schools if
 
00:47:37.829 --> 00:47:37.839 align:start position:0%
this legislation is to pass I thank you
 
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
very much for your time thank you any
 
00:47:42.549 --> 00:47:42.559 align:start position:0%
questions representative McDonald thank
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you Miss Lan
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
for being here and for your extensive
 
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
testimony just taking a look at this it
 
00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:51.800 align:start position:0%
appears to be the list of vendors that
 
00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:53.720 align:start position:0%
efas have been used for and it came
 
00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:55.480 align:start position:0%
directly from the children's scholarship
 
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
fund website that is correct okay and
 
00:47:59.950 --> 00:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
there's a number of highlights and notes
 
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
written in the margins particularly
 
00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
every time that Amazon was used as a
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
vendor it's highlighted is there a
 
00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
reason for that I believe it's the
 
00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
second largest vendor on here if not the
 
00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:14.200 align:start position:0%
first why every expense is highlighted
 
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
was there something to note from that
 
00:48:19.069 --> 00:48:19.079 align:start position:0%
yes because there was actually spent
 
00:48:19.079 --> 00:48:20.589 align:start position:0%
yes because there was actually spent
$1.4

00:48:20.589 --> 00:48:20.599 align:start position:0%
$1.4
 
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:23.240 align:start position:0%
million went through the children's
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund to purchase items that
 
00:48:30.309 --> 00:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
fell in the category so I'm hoping that
 
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
the children's scholarship fund is
 
00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.079 align:start position:0%
looking carefully at what is being
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
purchased because you really can buy
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
anything from Amazon I'm hoping it's
 
00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:43.720 align:start position:0%
educational and if I may have a followup
 
00:48:46.109 --> 00:48:46.119 align:start position:0%
Madam chair are you aware of the
 
00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund using an application
 
00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:49.720 align:start position:0%
called class wallet to verify these
 
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
purchases from Amazon in particular and
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
that that yes I'm very aware of it and
 
00:48:57.549 --> 00:48:57.559 align:start position:0%
actually I've done extensive research on
 
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
the qualifying expenditures and I also
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
went to the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
Ed website to see if those expenditures
 
00:49:09.789 --> 00:49:09.799 align:start position:0%
were on the list from the Department of
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
Ed and many of them didn't even appear
 
00:49:15.069 --> 00:49:15.079 align:start position:0%
and that's why many of them are
 
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:17.480 align:start position:0%
highlighted all right thank you any
 
00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:18.710 align:start position:0%
highlighted all right thank you any
other

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%

00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank

Ted Wells and I'm uh again HB
 
00:50:02.349 --> 00:50:02.359 align:start position:0%
428 um I'm against vouchers and local

school vouchers um I'm the product of K
 
00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
through 12 public schools in New
 
00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:14.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I'm um a parent a taxpayer
 
00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
and a public school teacher um I have a
 
00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
unique perspective I taught private
 
00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:21.160 align:start position:0%
school for 15 years in Massachusetts I
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
moved back home I'm now teaching public
 
00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:25.160 align:start position:0%
school it's been eight years in the
 
00:50:27.069 --> 00:50:27.079 align:start position:0%
Hopkin School District where I grew up
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
and went to school um why am I not at
 
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
school today our water M broke um
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
outside the Maple Street School um where
 
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
I teach sixth grade it's a 456 school um
 
00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
got a text at 511
 
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
a.m. um was sleeping in the bottom bunk
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
with my daughter who was having trouble
 
00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
sleeping last night and I got the text
 
00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
and I thought oh um a day off I can try
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
to catch up on some things but I also um
 
00:50:57.069 --> 00:50:57.079 align:start position:0%
knew from a friend about about this
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
meeting so I I chose to be here um today
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
I don't teach I advocate and I'm sad
 
00:51:07.829 --> 00:51:07.839 align:start position:0%
that I have to do that I'm sad that
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
um there are a lot of teachers there are
 
00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:11.240 align:start position:0%
thousands of teachers who would probably
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
want to be here to advocate for their
 
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
schools it feels like public schools in
 
00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and in this country are
 
00:51:20.589 --> 00:51:20.599 align:start position:0%
under attack taking away our funding
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
um uh obviously hurts schools the
 
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
teachers and the kids um so
 
00:51:29.309 --> 00:51:29.319 align:start position:0%
sorry I can't teach today but I am glad
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
I can be here um so how do vouchers hurt
 
00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire schools um just a few
 
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
quick ideas but I think they undermine
 
00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
public schools by diverting funding
 
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
um are vouchers for you know vouchers
 
00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:51.160 align:start position:0%
for anyone no um uh income eligib
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
eligibility limits and this is sort of a
 
00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:55.240 align:start position:0%
point representative Cornell was
 
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
bringing up I was going to say
 
00:51:59.710 --> 00:51:59.720 align:start position:0%
you know if if someone you know there
 
00:52:01.549 --> 00:52:01.559 align:start position:0%
are lots of people in my district
 
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
probably already going to derfield or St
 
00:52:05.069 --> 00:52:05.079 align:start position:0%
Paul's or conquer Christian um some of
 
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
them are
 
00:52:08.789 --> 00:52:08.799 align:start position:0%
millionaires why should they get $88,000
 
00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:11.839 align:start position:0%
or whatever that number is um at the
 
00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
expense of friends of mine who are
 
00:52:15.789 --> 00:52:15.799 align:start position:0%
really struggling to make ends meet
 
00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:18.200 align:start position:0%
taking more property taxes out is going
 
00:52:20.349 --> 00:52:20.359 align:start position:0%
to make things a lot harder for those
 
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
with fixed incomes uh it's going to make
 
00:52:24.589 --> 00:52:24.599 align:start position:0%
harder it harder for teachers um it
 
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
really feels like a bad idea to continue
 
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
to hurt um public schools and to to
 
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
divert funding um I feel the as a
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
private school teacher I know special
 
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
education students students with IPS
 
00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
that were moved into my private school
 
00:52:41.789 --> 00:52:41.799 align:start position:0%
they're they were we were not meeting
 
00:52:44.349 --> 00:52:44.359 align:start position:0%
their needs we didn't have the Personnel
 
00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:47.480 align:start position:0%
um I feel like there and I don't know
 
00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:49.160 align:start position:0%
the details of a lot of this but I do
 
00:52:52.109 --> 00:52:52.119 align:start position:0%
know um some of the things about
 
00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:53.960 align:start position:0%
students with IEPs moving into special
 
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
ed might not happen um
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
and the accountability piece um I feel
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
like is is also missing transparency you
 
00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
every penny of what goes into public
 
00:53:08.589 --> 00:53:08.599 align:start position:0%
schools seems to be accounted for but
 
00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
the Pats Pete SK ski passes horse riding
 
00:53:14.829 --> 00:53:14.839 align:start position:0%
lessons Costco Amazon I'm very curious
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
how that is tracked and I doubt that
 
00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
it's tracked with detail you your time
 
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
limit yeah I'll wrap up I'll wrap up um
 
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:25.240 align:start position:0%
it's a hard time for schools um our the
 
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
state funding in New Hampshire is very
 
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
low the $200,000 my school lost this
 
00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
year because of special education
 
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
funding being trimmed back is really
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
hard um so I'm was curious that you know
 
00:53:41.789 --> 00:53:41.799 align:start position:0%
as a taxpayer as a parent and as a a
 
00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:43.880 align:start position:0%
public school teacher um how can we do
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
better how can we do better to support
 
00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:46.750 align:start position:0%
better how can we do better to support
public

00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:48.680 align:start position:0%
education at the time it feels like
 
00:53:51.549 --> 00:53:51.559 align:start position:0%
we're trying we're not trying to do
 
00:53:52.789 --> 00:53:52.799 align:start position:0%
better it feels like things are going in

you um I am
 
00:55:21.029 --> 00:55:21.039 align:start position:0%
here basically because I'm I'm fairly
 
00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
shocked that this bill HB 748 is before
 
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
you um I did neglect I'd like to start
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
off by just introducing myself I'm Peggy
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
van valkenberg I have um been a proud
 
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
educator for over 35 years I'm also very
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
proud I'm retired now for seven years
 
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
and that is a joy to me um I'm from
 
00:55:47.309 --> 00:55:47.319 align:start position:0%
Peterboro New Hampshire the majority of
 
00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
my years of teaching actually were in
 
00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
the conval middle school district and I
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
there so I am in shock about the the
 
00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
fact that this bill is before you um
 
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
this EFA program feels very unethical to
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
me be it is taking my tax dollars that
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
were raised for our public schools and
 
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
then we're passing them to families that
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
are opting to homeschool or tuition at a
 
00:56:25.789 --> 00:56:25.799 align:start position:0%
private even perhaps a religious school
 
00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
that may or may not practice
 
00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:30.430 align:start position:0%
that may or may not practice
discriminatory

00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:30.440 align:start position:0%
discriminatory
 
00:56:35.109 --> 00:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
practices I do not want war nor will I
 
00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:37.880 align:start position:0%
subsidize schools that discriminate
 
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
against the majority of New Hampshire
 
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
children the majority of New Hampshire
 
00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
children are educated in our Public
 
00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:49.640 align:start position:0%
Schools this voucher will do exactly
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
that this EFA program so yes I was a
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
proud educator in the new hampsh
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school system I um
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
was believe me believe me there was any
 
00:57:07.309 --> 00:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
money that we needed to expend in New
 
00:57:10.789 --> 00:57:10.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was always incredibly tight
 
00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
yeah if I determined that um we needed
 
00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
to purchase a new set of microscopes for
 
00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:18.589 align:start position:0%
to purchase a new set of microscopes for
my

00:57:18.589 --> 00:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
classroom I could do that but I had to
 
00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
do inordinate amount of work making sure
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
that the the lesson that I was going to
 
00:57:34.270 --> 00:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
prepare for the students was aligned to
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
standards common core standards uh goals
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
for that age level in that child the
 
00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
group this was a huge part of my job and
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
a job part of my job I took very
 
00:57:49.789 --> 00:57:49.799 align:start position:0%
seriously is to identify exactly which
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
lessons are going to align with those
 
00:57:54.069 --> 00:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
standards and if purchases needed to be
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
made that's when you could fill up the
 
00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
the request but more
 
00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
importantly more importantly once that
 
00:58:08.589 --> 00:58:08.599 align:start position:0%
expenditure was made I had to make sure
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
that learning had occurred so our
 
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
students in the New Hampshire public
 
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
schools are um their progress is
 
00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
measured in great
 
00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
specificity I was always held
 
00:58:27.309 --> 00:58:27.319 align:start position:0%
accountable for that learning hm how did
 
00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
they do on the last assessment did that
 
00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
assessment teach tell us that in fact
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
that the students had
 
00:58:41.109 --> 00:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
learned this voucher program or EFA or
 
00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
LFA has not been tasked they have not
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
tasked any of the parents to do any of
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
the above parents are expending my tax
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
dollars on ski passes pianos gymnast
 
00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:01.720 align:start position:0%
nastics classes Sports clinics religious
 
00:59:04.109 --> 00:59:04.119 align:start position:0%
curriculums and they have not been asked
 
00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
to justify those
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
expenditures I want to know has learning
 
00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:13.240 align:start position:0%
occurred do you have proof for that your
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
your time is up I know here's the last
 
00:59:17.309 --> 00:59:17.319 align:start position:0%
point I'm going to make this is the
 
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
clinker the vouchers the efas are going
 
00:59:24.549 --> 00:59:24.559 align:start position:0%
to be twice as large as the adequate
 
00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
educational amount this again is a
 
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
discriminatory measure against the New
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public School
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
student again thanks for listening to me
 
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
and my thoughts if you have a question
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer thank you
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:04.990 --> 01:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Janet Ward I
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
live in kukuk New
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and given the testimony of
 
01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
the Prime sponsor representative
 
01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:16.039 align:start position:0%
verville I want to state that I served
 
01:00:19.109 --> 01:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
as an aid to a handicapped uh student in
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
my school district he was one of the
 
01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
first to be mainstreamed and I also want
 
01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:27.400 align:start position:0%
to respond to uh something that was said
 
01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:31.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of calling the public schools
 
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
businesses in competition with one
 
01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:37.640 align:start position:0%
another um local schools are not
 
01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
monopolies they're not businesses they
 
01:00:42.309 --> 01:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
are human
 
01:00:45.789 --> 01:00:45.799 align:start position:0%
institutions sometimes imperfect and if
 
01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:48.280 align:start position:0%
local schools are not providing all that
 
01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
is necessary and appropriate then all of
 
01:00:54.589 --> 01:00:54.599 align:start position:0%
you here should be focusing on working
 
01:00:58.710 --> 01:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
to improve those schools rather than to
 
01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
establish uh School
 
01:01:05.069 --> 01:01:05.079 align:start position:0%
vouches uh so having said that I'll get
 
01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
to the testimony I prepared for
 
01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
today I believe it is critically
 
01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:13.240 align:start position:0%
important to begin our discussion of
 
01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill 748 at the beginning it was
 
01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
Thomas Jefferson who initially offered
 
01:01:22.029 --> 01:01:22.039 align:start position:0%
the idea of public schools paid for by
 
01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
local taxes to the Virginia
 
01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
legislature why why why did he do this
 
01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:30.200 align:start position:0%
because Jefferson and other founding
 
01:01:33.069 --> 01:01:33.079 align:start position:0%
fathers realized that in a Democratic
 
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
Republic it was essential that citizens
 
01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:38.200 align:start position:0%
be able to read about understand and
 
01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:41.240 align:start position:0%
discuss common concerns and to frame and
 
01:01:44.549 --> 01:01:44.559 align:start position:0%
support wise legislation regarding their
 
01:01:44.559 --> 01:01:46.230 align:start position:0%
support wise legislation regarding their
shared

01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
shared
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
concerns the founders were always most
 
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
concerned with what they called
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
factions factions were decide defined by
 
01:01:58.029 --> 01:01:58.039 align:start position:0%
James Madison in The Federalist Papers
 
01:01:58.039 --> 01:01:59.029 align:start position:0%
James Madison in The Federalist Papers
number

01:01:59.029 --> 01:01:59.039 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
10 I quote by a faction I understand a
 
01:02:06.269 --> 01:02:06.279 align:start position:0%
number of citizens who are united and
 
01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
actuated by some common impulse impulse
 
01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:13.240 align:start position:0%
of passion or interest adverse to the
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
rights of other citizens or to the
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
permanent and aggregate interests of the
 
01:02:20.549 --> 01:02:20.559 align:start position:0%
community end of
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
quotation those who support House Bill
 
01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:32.269 --> 01:02:32.279 align:start position:0%
why because House Bill 748 would force
 
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire taxpayers to provide tax
 
01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
dollars to parents or Guardians who wish
 
01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
to use those dollars in private
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
religious or homeschooling situations
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
and this is the key over which the
 
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayers have little
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
oversight House Bill
 
01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:54.440 align:start position:0%
748 would force taxpayers to pay for a
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
private good not a public good all
 
01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:00.200 align:start position:0%
School vouchers
 
01:03:03.549 --> 01:03:03.559 align:start position:0%
represent taxation without
 
01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:07.240 align:start position:0%

prime sponsor started out by saying that
 
01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
a private education is a public
 
01:03:39.789 --> 01:03:39.799 align:start position:0%
education yes or no no thank you no and
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
if I may I went to public schools and
 
01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:45.039 align:start position:0%
then because I had an older cousin who I
 
01:03:49.549 --> 01:03:49.559 align:start position:0%
adored um who was going to a a high
 
01:03:51.029 --> 01:03:51.039 align:start position:0%

please please send me where Coro went
 
01:03:58.109 --> 01:03:58.119 align:start position:0%
so they couldn't afford it but my
 
01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
grandmother seeing how desperate I was
 
01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
said of course you know I'll I'll help
 
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
and so I did go to that high school got
 
01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:09.880 align:start position:0%
a good education but it was a good deal
 
01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
of of it was religious and
 
01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
um I must be very clear I
 
01:04:23.589 --> 01:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
support and admire um religious beliefs
 
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
and thankfully we live in a nation where
 
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
everyone is free to have the religious
 
01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
beliefs um they they wish to have but um
 
01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:37.799 align:start position:0%
Randall Balmer a professor of religion
 
01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth College has written a book
 
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
called solemn reverence the separation
 
01:04:45.069 --> 01:04:45.079 align:start position:0%
of church and state and American life
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
and um this public dollars being given
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
to parents or Guardians and then being
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
spent on religious schools is is
 
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional so I thank you for
 
01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
listening thank you representative
 
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair um thanks
 
01:05:05.789 --> 01:05:05.799 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and this sort of
 
01:05:08.069 --> 01:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
goes along I I'm curious to know um
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
whether or not you share any concerns um
 
01:05:13.549 --> 01:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
around um the scholarship organization
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
itself on line one on page six is noted
 
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
to be able to accept gifts and grants
 
01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:21.640 align:start position:0%
from any source to cover administrative
 
01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:23.720 align:start position:0%
costs to inform the public about EFA
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
programs or to fund additional efas so
 
01:05:29.309 --> 01:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
my question to you is um given that uh
 
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
your recent conversation of separation
 
01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
of church and state and any other sort
 
01:05:35.549 --> 01:05:35.559 align:start position:0%
of Grant uh uh givers do you share any
 
01:05:37.549 --> 01:05:37.559 align:start position:0%
concerns that there could it doesn't say
 
01:05:40.029 --> 01:05:40.039 align:start position:0%
how much uh information or how much
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
money could be spent on Administration
 
01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
cost versus um um public uh EFA sort of
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
public information campaigns versus the
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
actual education of students so do you
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
share any concerns around that yes I do
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
and I had a private conversation
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
with um commissioner edelblute in
 
01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:03.640 align:start position:0%
2019 and after an hour of conversation
 
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh Frank and I
 
01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh had you know discussed many things
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
and he stood up to Signal the end of the
 
01:06:15.029 --> 01:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
conversation and he said Janet you and I
 
01:06:18.109 --> 01:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
agree on a lot of things but one thing
 
01:06:20.670 --> 01:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
you you and I do not agree on is I
 
01:06:23.589 --> 01:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
believe public money should pay for
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
private education and you don't
 
01:06:29.309 --> 01:06:29.319 align:start position:0%
and that's absolutely clear I don't
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
understand why I uh a
 
01:06:38.309 --> 01:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayer um should be required to pay
 
01:06:41.549 --> 01:06:41.559 align:start position:0%
for private educational situations over
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
which I have virtually no control um
 
01:06:48.829 --> 01:06:48.839 align:start position:0%
this to me uh as Randall balber uh made
 
01:06:52.349 --> 01:06:52.359 align:start position:0%
clear in in his book and uh it is made
 
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
very clear in a book called The
 
01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:55.789 align:start position:0%
very clear in a book called The
privateers

01:06:55.789 --> 01:06:55.799 align:start position:0%
privateers
 
01:06:59.589 --> 01:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:01.480 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional any other questions
 
01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:03.880 align:start position:0%
representative Freeman thank you madam
 
01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you Miss wood for coming
 
01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
in front of us so I have a question um
 
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
about you stating as a taxpayer you
 
01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:12.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to pay for it um are
 
01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
parents not also taxpayers parents who
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
utilize thefa program of course they are
 
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
yes and
 
01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
um I repeat I respect the right of
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
parents to um have the religious beliefs
 
01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
they do to you know educate their
 
01:07:39.069 --> 01:07:39.079 align:start position:0%
children in the way they think is best
 
01:07:42.670 --> 01:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
but in public schools I can attend and I
 
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
do um the school board
 
01:07:48.910 --> 01:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
meetings and I can call the school and
 
01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
ask the principal or even visit the
 
01:07:54.589 --> 01:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
superintendent which I have done so that
 
01:07:56.910 --> 01:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
I can walk into a classroom with
 
01:07:59.630 --> 01:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
permission and without disturbing the
 
01:08:02.269 --> 01:08:02.279 align:start position:0%
teacher of the class and see what is
 
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
happening see what is being taught I can
 
01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:07.640 align:start position:0%
read the textbooks I know what I'm
 
01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
paying for but the school voucher money
 
01:08:16.349 --> 01:08:16.359 align:start position:0%
yeah I do not know what I'm paying
 
01:08:19.789 --> 01:08:19.799 align:start position:0%
for representative drive thank you and
 
01:08:22.510 --> 01:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for Ching my question I'm
 
01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
confused about your term voucher because
 
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
do not know that the voucher program was
 
01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
1988 clarify what you're telling me
 
01:08:37.470 --> 01:08:37.480 align:start position:0%
please um there is no Voucher Program
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
specifically that uses the word voucher
 
01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
it is you telling me that because they
 
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
call it an education Freedom account
 
01:08:45.789 --> 01:08:45.799 align:start position:0%
it's not a
 
01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
voucher I guess I would ask you what
 
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
your definition of a voucher is uh money
 
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
given to a parent or a guardian for
 
01:08:57.070 --> 01:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
follow follow up okay I I guess we
 
01:09:01.590 --> 01:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
differ in our definition of a voucher
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
because I would consider it much more
 
01:09:06.349 --> 01:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
specific to a a service or something
 
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
that it would provide rather than
 
01:09:10.110 --> 01:09:10.120 align:start position:0%
educational is that not your
 
01:09:12.309 --> 01:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
understanding I have no idea what you're
 
01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
describing to me I'm I'm working hard to
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
understand could you could you clarify
 
01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
it yeah sure thank you all right I'm I'm
 
01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:25.400 align:start position:0%
defining a voucher as a specific item to
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
give to someone for a specific item to
 
01:09:31.269 --> 01:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
purchase or use and I I don't consider
 
01:09:33.709 --> 01:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
for an educational program a specific
 
01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
thing there are lots of specificities
 
01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
involved in that but it's not a specific
 
01:09:40.349 --> 01:09:40.359 align:start position:0%
voucher for a specific thing you're
 
01:09:42.189 --> 01:09:42.199 align:start position:0%
giving money in an educational Freedom
 
01:09:45.149 --> 01:09:45.159 align:start position:0%
account to an account for the people who
 
01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:47.560 align:start position:0%
are are getting that money to spend as
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
they wish within the guidelines that
 
01:09:51.749 --> 01:09:51.759 align:start position:0%
they're given so I'm just asking do you
 
01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
think that you're giving us a voucher
 
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
for a specific thing when you say is a
 
01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:57.510 align:start position:0%
for a specific thing when you say is a
voucher

01:09:57.510 --> 01:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
voucher
 
01:09:59.430 --> 01:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
program well certainly it's for
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
educational purposes is that are we both
 
01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
agreed on
 
01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
that yes but ites and a voucher are both
 
01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
as I understand it and as you understand
 
01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:13.719 align:start position:0%
it money given from public
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
taxes to parents or Guardians for
 
01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
educational purposes is that
 
01:10:21.790 --> 01:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
correct I would say that that was my
 
01:10:23.790 --> 01:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
definition of Education Freedom account
 
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to get into it but
 
01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
we can I would love to discuss this with
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
I would very much like to talk to you
 
01:10:33.550 --> 01:10:33.560 align:start position:0%
represent and um I also strongly
 
01:10:36.669 --> 01:10:36.679 align:start position:0%

you willing to take another question yes
 
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:43.790 align:start position:0%
you willing to take another question yes
of

01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
course thank you I appreciate you taking
 
01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
my question your closing statement was
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
about taxation without representation
 
01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
and that point is well taking my
 
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
question to you is is the opposite also
 
01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
true if there is a parent with their
 
01:10:59.470 --> 01:10:59.480 align:start position:0%
student in a private District if they're
 
01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
still paying taxes to the public
 
01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
District I you also mentioned that you
 
01:11:06.030 --> 01:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
were able to go into the school to see
 
01:11:07.470 --> 01:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
what is taught in the classroom I
 
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
imagine a parent who pays taxes in that
 
01:11:11.669 --> 01:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
District doesn't have students in that
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
District probably wouldn't be giving the
 
01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
same ability and probably for good
 
01:11:18.430 --> 01:11:18.440 align:start position:0%
reason so wouldn't that also be taxation
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
without representation into that school
 
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
district I would be very surprised if a
 
01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
parent from any District wanted to visit
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
a school in a different district and
 
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
made a respectful request that they
 
01:11:32.350 --> 01:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:36.520 align:start position:0%
denied also um a few years back I had uh
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
an experience at a State Board of
 
01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
Education meeting where a parent was
 
01:11:44.350 --> 01:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
very very upset that their school
 
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
district did not offer swimming uh a
 
01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
swimming program for their son um and
 
01:11:53.229 --> 01:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
this parent said that their son had a
 
01:11:58.669 --> 01:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
special talent etc etc and um you she
 
01:12:00.430 --> 01:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
she felt that she should be allowed to
 
01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
have money to go into a private
 
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
situation and the recommendation was
 
01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
made that perhaps the child could be
 
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
taken to with permission to another
 
01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
school that had a swimming program um so
 
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
what I'm suggesting
 
01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
is are the public schools perfect no no
 
01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
Human Institution is perfect our New
 
01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire schools pretty dar good yes
 
01:12:30.030 --> 01:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
yes I think they are and I think there
 
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
are lots of opportunities for a body
 
01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
like this to identify areas in specific
 
01:12:38.350 --> 01:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
schools or maybe generally where
 
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
improvements could be made and the
 
01:12:43.629 --> 01:12:43.639 align:start position:0%
amount of time that this body has been
 
01:12:46.910 --> 01:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
spending on the voucher program uh or
 
01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
the EA program taking their attention
 
01:12:53.310 --> 01:12:53.320 align:start position:0%
away from improving Public Schools makes
 
01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
me very sad thank you representative
 
01:12:57.629 --> 01:12:57.639 align:start position:0%
Murray this will be our last question
 
01:12:59.470 --> 01:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um would you not
 
01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
say that there is representation at the
 
01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
local um Public School level for any
 
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayer who wants to walk into a public
 
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
school board meeting during the public
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
hearing and public comment opportunity
 
01:13:12.510 --> 01:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
to present questions to the duly elected
 
01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
board that is there before them it
 
01:13:17.590 --> 01:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
happens all the time I was just there
 
01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
and um there were lots of how shall I
 
01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
put this um there was a lot of variety
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
in the comments
 
01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
made and there was a wonderful
 
01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:31.229 align:start position:0%
made and there was a wonderful
respectful

01:13:31.229 --> 01:13:31.239 align:start position:0%
respectful
 
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
atmosphere and um although not everyone
 
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
in the room agreed with everything um
 
01:13:41.470 --> 01:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
there was a sense that we were all being
 
01:13:44.229 --> 01:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
respectfully heard and that's what I'm
 
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
feeling right now here and that's a very
 
01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:01.840 align:start position:0%

came at the total last minute when a
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
friend called me but I'm sitting here
 
01:14:25.629 --> 01:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
and I'm sitting here as a taxpayer
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
and a citizen of our great state and my
 
01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
great town and also Pittsfield which is
 
01:14:34.149 --> 01:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
part of our
 
01:14:37.470 --> 01:14:37.480 align:start position:0%

meeting I will be facilitating that
 
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
meeting and in that role I have attended
 
01:14:56.189 --> 01:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
many School Board board meetings this
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
fall and listening to the budget and
 
01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out where the cuts come
 
01:15:04.149 --> 01:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
from and how many teachers we have to
 
01:15:07.709 --> 01:15:07.719 align:start position:0%
cut what programs we need to combine
 
01:15:09.629 --> 01:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
what extracurricular do we need to get
 
01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
rid of and I'm sitting here listening to
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
this in a state where we all know we
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
rank number 50 in the United States for
 
01:15:23.149 --> 01:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of how much our state funds our
 
01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
public education and now we're adding
 
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
more cost onto the town I understand
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's enabling but why are we even
 
01:15:34.590 --> 01:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
talking about it we need to be talking
 
01:15:37.229 --> 01:15:37.239 align:start position:0%
about how to better fund our Public
 
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
Schools not take additional money away
 
01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and I think I made it under
 
01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:44.760 align:start position:0%

David

01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:23.229 --> 01:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
Trumble thank you madam chairwoman and
 
01:16:25.629 --> 01:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is
 
01:16:27.310 --> 01:16:27.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me my name is David Trumble I'm
 
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
from the town of where I oppose this
 
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
bill for two reasons first I think that
 
01:16:32.629 --> 01:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:16:34.510 --> 01:16:34.520 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional I'll go back to the
 
01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor's first words she said
 
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
each local community has an obligation
 
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
to educate all children that's not
 
01:16:44.110 --> 01:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
correct in New Hampshire it is the
 
01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
state's obligation to provide education
 
01:16:49.149 --> 01:16:49.159 align:start position:0%
for all the children first of all in the
 
01:16:52.229 --> 01:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
Claremont one case they said we hold
 
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
article 83 imposes a duty on the state
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
to provide a constitutionally adequate
 
01:16:59.629 --> 01:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
education to every child and they cited
 
01:17:01.470 --> 01:17:01.480 align:start position:0%
all the way back to Governor Wentworth
 
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
in 1771 who said that it was the duty to
 
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
educate remained with the state he they
 
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
cited this the house and the senate in
 
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
1795 for the same point it's the state's
 
01:17:15.550 --> 01:17:15.560 align:start position:0%
job this bill is based on a completely
 
01:17:18.270 --> 01:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
false premise that it's the local Town's
 
01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
job to educate children it is the
 
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
state's job and that's under our
 
01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution and our Supreme Court the
 
01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
second thing that the prime sponsor said
 
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
is that public education can play take
 
01:17:30.990 --> 01:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
place in a lot of different locations
 
01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
that also goes against New Hampshire
 
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution Article 83 in its own
 
01:17:38.189 --> 01:17:38.199 align:start position:0%
language specifically says public
 
01:17:40.590 --> 01:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
schools in the Claremont case it said
 
01:17:43.149 --> 01:17:43.159 align:start position:0%
that duty to educate every educable
 
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
child in the public schools it's the
 
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
Constitutional duty of the state to fund
 
01:17:52.229 --> 01:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
the public schools this is kind of
 
01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
fanfiction version of New Hampshire
 
01:17:56.470 --> 01:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
history this bill it's not the town's
 
01:17:58.950 --> 01:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
job to educate and it's not our job as a
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
state to educate in the private schools
 
01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
that's an optional idea it is not
 
01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:05.560 align:start position:0%
required the other reason I object to
 
01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is I think it would hurt the
 
01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
local schools and the question was well
 
01:18:09.870 --> 01:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
how will it hurt them where's going to
 
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
be the loss of money if it's only
 
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
$88,500 per
 
01:18:16.030 --> 01:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
student there's a few ways it'll drain
 
01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
funds from the local schools first is
 
01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:20.440 align:start position:0%
the 50% that they that is paid for by
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
the state that's the 80 the four first
 
01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
$4,200 the bill assumes in the financial
 
01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
statement that the money will be
 
01:18:30.430 --> 01:18:30.440 align:start position:0%
reimbursed by the state that is based on
 
01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
the myth that the town will save funds
 
01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
from students who switch from public
 
01:18:36.629 --> 01:18:36.639 align:start position:0%
schools to private schools as of
 
01:18:38.629 --> 01:18:38.639 align:start position:0%
November of 2024 according to the
 
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Education there's only
 
01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
493 switchers from public to private
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
schools under the EFA program with 500
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
public schools in New Hampshire that's
 
01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
less than one switcher per School how
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
can a public school save any money if
 
01:18:56.110 --> 01:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
they're only having one child switch
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
you're not going to fire any teachers
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
any pairs none of your expenses go down
 
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
the second way you're going to lose
 
01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
money at the town is you have to match
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
that 4,200 with your own 50% that will
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
be a complete loss coming out of the
 
01:19:10.629 --> 01:19:10.639 align:start position:0%
local District's money the bill
 
01:19:12.510 --> 01:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
essentially uses the money in the public
 
01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
schools as an ATM machine to finance the
 
01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:17.320 align:start position:0%
non-public schools third families who
 
01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
are planning to send their child to a
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
private school anyway can still get
 
01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
$10,000 per 8,000 to 10,000 depending on
 
01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
how the bill actually is interpreted
 
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
that money will be lost to the town I'd
 
01:19:29.790 --> 01:19:29.800 align:start position:0%
like to just finish up brief May uh the
 
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
town is also liable even if they resend
 
01:19:34.669 --> 01:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
this to pay for that child all the way
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
through till they graduate so that child
 
01:19:39.390 --> 01:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
will cost them 8 to 10,000 year one by
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
12 years it's $100,000 per child if you
 
01:19:45.229 --> 01:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
have 10 children doing it in a town
 
01:19:47.790 --> 01:19:47.800 align:start position:0%
that's a million dollars that town loses
 
01:19:49.229 --> 01:19:49.239 align:start position:0%
the last thing is that the town will
 
01:19:51.149 --> 01:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
have to Def find endless lawsuits over
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
whether funds are available the bill
 
01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
does not give the superintendent the
 
01:19:57.229 --> 01:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
power to determine the potential
 
01:19:59.350 --> 01:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
long-term costs as part of whether or
 
01:20:00.910 --> 01:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
not there's any money available now so
 
01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
in other words if the town says oh we
 
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
have $10,000 will do one EFA if they
 
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
then resend it they're still on the hook
 
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
for 10 more years that's $100,000
 
01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
expense the bill does it's got eight
 
01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
pages it doesn't even address the
 
01:20:15.709 --> 01:20:15.719 align:start position:0%
question of what superintendent can use
 
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
in making that determination long-term
 
01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
expenses will be hurt that means fired
 
01:20:22.030 --> 01:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
teachers less peras less reading
 
01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
Specialists it's going to hurt your
 
01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
local schools that's how it's going to
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
hurt your local school thank you thank
 
01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
you um representative Murray thank you
 
01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair thanks for taking my
 
01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
question one of the questions that I am
 
01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
curious about is whether or not you see
 
01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
there being any potential confusion for
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
um you talked about funding being
 
01:20:43.310 --> 01:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
available or not in the event that the
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization claw back
 
01:20:48.189 --> 01:20:48.199 align:start position:0%
funding after giving it um then uh who's
 
01:20:49.790 --> 01:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
on the hook for that is that the state
 
01:20:51.669 --> 01:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
or is that the Local District if the
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
money was there and then is maybe taken
 
01:20:56.709 --> 01:20:56.719 align:start position:0%
back and said oh we act we this is not a
 
01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
qualified expense and they claw the
 
01:20:58.159 --> 01:20:58.950 align:start position:0%
qualified expense and they claw the
money

01:20:58.950 --> 01:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:21:01.149 --> 01:21:01.159 align:start position:0%
back that that's that's another good
 
01:21:02.350 --> 01:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
question I don't know how it would work
 
01:21:05.790 --> 01:21:05.800 align:start position:0%
in that regard um my my I agree with
 
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
that and my initial concern is just how
 
01:21:10.229 --> 01:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
does the superintendent set a number on
 
01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
July 14th do they say well we have
 
01:21:14.629 --> 01:21:14.639 align:start position:0%
$10,000 extra dollar how many schools
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
have $10,000 extra dollars but if they
 
01:21:19.189 --> 01:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
say we have 10,000 we'll do one EFA but
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
if then this the school the town the
 
01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
next year votes they say oh we're losing
 
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
money here they've shut it off they're
 
01:21:27.870 --> 01:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
still on the hook for every child they
 
01:21:30.750 --> 01:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
put up in year one for 10 more years so
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
can the superintendent look at that
 
01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
long-term expense and say I'm not going
 
01:21:36.430 --> 01:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
to say yes to one this year because I'm
 
01:21:39.189 --> 01:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
really saying yes to one for 10 years
 
01:21:41.550 --> 01:21:41.560 align:start position:0%
and therefore the superintendent says no
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't clarify there's going
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
to be lawsuits in every single town as
 
01:21:47.790 --> 01:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
to how this is determined that's an
 
01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
expense the towns will have to to pay
 
01:21:52.910 --> 01:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
because of a bill that doesn't explain
 
01:21:56.910 --> 01:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.910 --> 01:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:04.350 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:22:04.350 --> 01:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:06.669 align:start position:0%
 
Jack

01:22:06.669 --> 01:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
Jack
 
01:22:25.390 --> 01:22:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:49.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
good hi I'm a resident of marac and uh
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
just a
 
01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
person that works for a living and took
 
01:23:00.910 --> 01:23:00.920 align:start position:0%
some vacation time
 
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
to to speak on something important to
 
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
me so I support school choice the
 
01:23:10.189 --> 01:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
existing EFA laws and the other proposed
 
01:23:13.550 --> 01:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
legislation to expand them I actually
 
01:23:16.750 --> 01:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
believe the best approach is local efas
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
because it's a natural place to fund
 
01:23:21.149 --> 01:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
education and this bill could replace
 
01:23:22.510 --> 01:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
all the
 
01:23:24.910 --> 01:23:24.920 align:start position:0%
others the problem with the current
 
01:23:26.950 --> 01:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
situation is that it's not full
 
01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:28.149 align:start position:0%
situation is that it's not full
replacement

01:23:28.149 --> 01:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
cost so the the parents have to come up
 
01:23:33.950 --> 01:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
with when they're already taxed they
 
01:23:35.550 --> 01:23:35.560 align:start position:0%
have to come up with some of the money
 
01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
to make the choice to go to a private
 
01:23:41.229 --> 01:23:41.239 align:start position:0%
school and the secondary problem is that
 
01:23:43.709 --> 01:23:43.719 align:start position:0%
the state needs to raise revenue to fund
 
01:23:43.719 --> 01:23:44.550 align:start position:0%
the state needs to raise revenue to fund
these

01:23:44.550 --> 01:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:23:48.870 --> 01:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
efas uh the solution is local efas cuz
 
01:23:50.510 --> 01:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
the funding is already available the
 
01:23:52.669 --> 01:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
cities and the towns are already
 
01:23:55.149 --> 01:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
collecting the property taxes for the
 
01:23:57.470 --> 01:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
schools and if I use the numbers from
 
01:23:59.950 --> 01:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
the town of marac we have a school
 
01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
budget of 93 million under 3600 students
 
01:24:06.510 --> 01:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
and the round numbers are that that's
 
01:24:10.350 --> 01:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
over 25,000 per student so we have
 
01:24:13.669 --> 01:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
plenty of money to fund our
 
01:24:17.870 --> 01:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
schools now I look at just a few this is
 
01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely not an endorsement of these
 
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
schools just three that I found from the
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh from the State website list Dairy
 
01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
Field in uh Manchester is grade 6 to 12
 
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
that's about 26,000 that would be break
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
even with the cost of the public school
 
01:24:35.229 --> 01:24:35.239 align:start position:0%
you have Trinity High School in
 
01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester under
 
01:24:39.550 --> 01:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
15,000 you have Bedford Academy A K
 
01:24:43.109 --> 01:24:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
14,000 so we have the problem that town
 
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
budgets and and Marx Town budget the
 
01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
schools the public schools are 2third of
 
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
the Town budget uh we have an
 
01:24:57.470 --> 01:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to significantly reduce
 
01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:58.830 align:start position:0%
opportunity to significantly reduce
property

01:24:58.830 --> 01:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:25:01.709 --> 01:25:01.719 align:start position:0%
taxes um the
 
01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
town's uh decreased payments to school
 
01:25:07.950 --> 01:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
districts uh I mean I I'm I'm actually
 
01:25:10.149 --> 01:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
talking more to the ideal here than to
 
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
the specifics of this bill because I
 
01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
think the specifics of the bill are
 
01:25:17.109 --> 01:25:17.119 align:start position:0%
still with its hands tied behind it back
 
01:25:18.990 --> 01:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
of what it could
 
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
be essentially you've got
 
01:25:24.430 --> 01:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
$26,000 you could hand everyone of a
 
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
flat fee of 20,000 and not check who
 
01:25:30.950 --> 01:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
paid on Amazon for what or whether it
 
01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
was Pat's Peak or not and the taxpayers
 
01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
are winning if those parents are happy
 
01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
that their child's getting educated and
 
01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:41.480 align:start position:0%
they got $20,000 and no one ever looked
 
01:25:45.149 --> 01:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
at that that would be fine um it could
 
01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
include homeschooling uh the state
 
01:25:50.910 --> 01:25:50.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for the FAS can stay to
 
01:25:53.709 --> 01:25:53.719 align:start position:0%
to manage all of this and just the
 
01:25:56.350 --> 01:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
closing points are your property taxes
 
01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
too high do you support school choice
 
01:26:01.229 --> 01:26:01.239 align:start position:0%
solve both problems at once support
 
01:26:01.239 --> 01:26:03.270 align:start position:0%

01:26:31.870 --> 01:26:31.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and members of the
 
01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Mary wilky I'm a
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
retired public school teacher and I live
 
01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
in conquered um I um have many reasons
 
01:26:43.629 --> 01:26:43.639 align:start position:0%
to dislike vouchers altogether the whole
 
01:26:45.229 --> 01:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
idea of vouchers I'm not going to talk
 
01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
about those today because uh I've talked
 
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
about them many other times but um I
 
01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
would like to address flaws in this
 
01:26:55.470 --> 01:26:55.480 align:start position:0%
specific uh proposal legislation first
 
01:26:57.709 --> 01:26:57.719 align:start position:0%
of all I I know it's an opt-in program
 
01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
but if you look at the required language
 
01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
in the warrant article it's uh it
 
01:27:04.270 --> 01:27:04.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't help the average person
 
01:27:06.070 --> 01:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on here it says
 
01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
you know you have to um say shall we
 
01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
adopt the provisions of this bill to
 
01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
allow establishment of a local education
 
01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
Freedom account program in our district
 
01:27:16.510 --> 01:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
well it doesn't say anything about who's
 
01:27:17.830 --> 01:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
paying for it it doesn't say that your
 
01:27:20.109 --> 01:27:20.119 align:start position:0%
taxes might go up um I think it needs to
 
01:27:22.430 --> 01:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
be a lot more clear than that I I
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
believe it would be misleading and
 
01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:24.709 align:start position:0%
believe it would be misleading and
meanwhile

01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
meanwhile
 
01:27:28.629 --> 01:27:28.639 align:start position:0%
we can foresee that um well-healed Pro
 
01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
voucher out ofate lobbyists will be
 
01:27:32.229 --> 01:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
there sending their cards putting their
 
01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
flyers in people's mailboxes Etc and um
 
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
people may vote for this not realizing
 
01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:40.719 align:start position:0%
how it will affect them um oversight of
 
01:27:42.430 --> 01:27:42.440 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization in this
 
01:27:46.350 --> 01:27:46.360 align:start position:0%
bill is even less uh credible than in
 
01:27:49.870 --> 01:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
the current EFA program uh at least
 
01:27:51.070 --> 01:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
under the current program there's a
 
01:27:52.830 --> 01:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee that
 
01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
meets and can ask the uh commissioner
 
01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
and the head of the scholarship
 
01:27:58.430 --> 01:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
organization to come and answer
 
01:28:01.709 --> 01:28:01.719 align:start position:0%
questions not in this one nobody that I
 
01:28:05.550 --> 01:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
can see has any um oversight and in fact
 
01:28:07.109 --> 01:28:07.119 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note it says that the
 
01:28:09.070 --> 01:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
department has not identified any state
 
01:28:11.310 --> 01:28:11.320 align:start position:0%
administrative cost Dev to this program
 
01:28:13.030 --> 01:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm assuming they're not planning to
 
01:28:15.629 --> 01:28:15.639 align:start position:0%
spend much time overseeing this either
 
01:28:16.750 --> 01:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
uh meanwhile the scholarship
 
01:28:18.990 --> 01:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
organization is given total immunity
 
01:28:21.390 --> 01:28:21.400 align:start position:0%
total immunity from liability in
 
01:28:23.189 --> 01:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
handling these funds which means they're
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
not required
 
01:28:27.629 --> 01:28:27.639 align:start position:0%
which means they're not required to use
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
even um reasonable care which is the
 
01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
legal standard we don't we're not going
 
01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
to ask them to use reasonable care as
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
they handle millions of dollars
 
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
potentially of taxpayer funds um as
 
01:28:41.830 --> 01:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
others have mentioned there's no
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
transparency the school district me
 
01:28:45.870 --> 01:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
property tax rers will know nothing
 
01:28:47.950 --> 01:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
about what's going on in the schools and
 
01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
the programs with these uh funded here
 
01:28:52.109 --> 01:28:52.119 align:start position:0%
um there's no prohibitions on
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
self-dealing parents could pay their
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
relatives to tutor their kids no cap on
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
how what the hourly rate might be
 
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
employees of the scholarship
 
01:29:03.229 --> 01:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
organization could set up their own
 
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
little Learning Centers and maybe funnel
 
01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
people in that direction there's no
 
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
prohibitions on those um the language on
 
01:29:12.950 --> 01:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
special ed services is very insufficient
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
other people have mentioned that I mean
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
far as I could tell it says it says um
 
01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
that uh that the scholarship
 
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
organization has to tell EFA parents
 
01:29:25.550 --> 01:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
that the student students can receive
 
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
special ed services in their District
 
01:29:29.709 --> 01:29:29.719 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't ever say that students
 
01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
can receive special ed services in their
 
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
District I it should be spelled out
 
01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
clearly people recognized a lot of
 
01:29:38.830 --> 01:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
confusion around that and um one more
 
01:29:41.189 --> 01:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
thing um the scholarship organization
 
01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
gets 10 up to 10% as they do in the
 
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
current program the current program has
 
01:29:50.270 --> 01:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
an average EFA that's half the EFA of
 
01:29:52.229 --> 01:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
this new proposed program meaning
 
01:29:53.709 --> 01:29:53.719 align:start position:0%
they're going to get twice as much money
 
01:29:56.229 --> 01:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
if they get 10% twice as much money for
 
01:30:00.510 --> 01:30:00.520 align:start position:0%
doing the same work and um that seems
 
01:30:03.070 --> 01:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to me as a taxpayer I have
 
01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
prepared for you a line by line because
 
01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
there are so many flaws and
 
01:30:11.229 --> 01:30:11.239 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies and gaps in this bill
 
01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
it's four pages of line by line going
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
through the bill and I'm sorry that
 
01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
you're exing on it today when the online
 
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
portal won't even be closed yet but um
 
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
and you probably won't have time to look
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
at my line by line but I'm submitting it
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
for the record and would like you to
 
01:30:29.310 --> 01:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
know that more than 2600 2600 people
 
01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
have already signed in opposed 244 and
 
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
the number would continue to rise except
 
01:30:35.550 --> 01:30:35.560 align:start position:0%
it won't make any sense once you've
 
01:30:38.149 --> 01:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
already exacted at 1:00 thank you thank
 
01:30:39.629 --> 01:30:39.639 align:start position:0%
you any
 
01:30:42.830 --> 01:30:42.840 align:start position:0%

and members of the education policy
 
01:32:03.189 --> 01:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for taking the time
 
01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
to listen to My Testimony today I live
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
in marac and am here today in opposition
 
01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
of HB
 
01:32:15.629 --> 01:32:15.639 align:start position:0%
748 I am here as a parent of two
 
01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
students uh that are in our public
 
01:32:21.510 --> 01:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
education and also as a member of our
 
01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
School District budget committee um so I
 
01:32:28.229 --> 01:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
have spent a lot of time looking at a
 
01:32:32.229 --> 01:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
lot of numbers and I can tell you that
 
01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
it would have a big impact on us um so
 
01:32:38.030 --> 01:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
first uh as I was listening to the uh
 
01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor I kind of wrote down a
 
01:32:41.950 --> 01:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
couple other things um I wanted to
 
01:32:45.109 --> 01:32:45.119 align:start position:0%
address where um he had spoken about how
 
01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
it wasn't double dipping um but it would
 
01:32:50.790 --> 01:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
be double dipping in that you requesting
 
01:32:53.229 --> 01:32:53.239 align:start position:0%
the services special ed services still
 
01:32:57.149 --> 01:32:57.159 align:start position:0%
be provided Ed in the school or provided
 
01:32:59.550 --> 01:32:59.560 align:start position:0%
for the student which is a cost to the
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
school district um we already aren't
 
01:33:05.750 --> 01:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
getting the amount of money back from
 
01:33:08.669 --> 01:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
the state for special education that we
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
are supposed to get we got
 
01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
67% um and um that is going to take more
 
01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
money um away from us uh now you want to
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
add local EFA cost on top of that the
 
01:33:27.750 --> 01:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
Statewide EFA uh still exists and we're
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
taking funds from the education trust
 
01:33:32.470 --> 01:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
fund that could be used to meet the
 
01:33:35.550 --> 01:33:35.560 align:start position:0%
state's special education reimbursement
 
01:33:37.830 --> 01:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
obligations um and instead they're being
 
01:33:40.350 --> 01:33:40.360 align:start position:0%
used for the efas so we're already not
 
01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
getting the money that we're supposed to
 
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
get for special education and now we're
 
01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
going to be asking for more money to be
 
01:33:51.070 --> 01:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
taken out of that budget
 
01:33:55.550 --> 01:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
for local EFA which which could include
 
01:33:58.669 --> 01:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
special education which we are going to
 
01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
still have to have that person in place
 
01:34:03.629 --> 01:34:03.639 align:start position:0%
at the school even if you don't have um
 
01:34:05.709 --> 01:34:05.719 align:start position:0%
the student in the school all the time
 
01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
um my local public school would love to
 
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
have a great theater program or a gifted
 
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
and talented courses but we can't fund
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
it at all can't even get the budgets to
 
01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
pass we're we're stuck with default
 
01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
budget which means that you remove all
 
01:34:22.750 --> 01:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
those extra things that you would like
 
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
to have a swimming pool would be great a
 
01:34:27.270 --> 01:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
swim team all those things would be
 
01:34:29.870 --> 01:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
awesome we can't fund it public
 
01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
education means that you have to provide
 
01:34:34.350 --> 01:34:34.360 align:start position:0%
education for everybody and that costs a
 
01:34:38.910 --> 01:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
lot of money um so uh local efas would
 
01:34:42.030 --> 01:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
have a negative lasting impact on a
 
01:34:44.750 --> 01:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
community even if they repealed the
 
01:34:47.830 --> 01:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
local efas if you look at page 8
 
01:34:53.229 --> 01:34:53.239 align:start position:0%
starting on line uh 36 it says there
 
01:34:57.310 --> 01:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
that um you would still have to uh pay
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
well I think it's 37 it starts talking
 
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
about it but that you would still have
 
01:35:05.229 --> 01:35:05.239 align:start position:0%
to pay for the student to be there until
 
01:35:09.109 --> 01:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
they are um graduate or 20 years of age
 
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
so if in marac right now we have 36
 
01:35:16.030 --> 01:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
homeschool students um that would be a
 
01:35:20.750 --> 01:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
minimum of a uh cost that our operating
 
01:35:22.830 --> 01:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
budget would have to so this would
 
01:35:26.350 --> 01:35:26.360 align:start position:0%
subtract from our budget a minimum of
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
288,000 and up to
 
01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
468,000 just for the students that are
 
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
currently homeschooled would have to be
 
01:35:37.950 --> 01:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
removed from our operating budget which
 
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
is already really struggling I know I
 
01:35:42.590 --> 01:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
got to wrap up sorry I just want to get
 
01:35:44.669 --> 01:35:44.679 align:start position:0%
to one more Point um where it talked
 
01:35:47.709 --> 01:35:47.719 align:start position:0%
about on page four line 13 that the
 
01:35:50.189 --> 01:35:50.199 align:start position:0%
states that the EFA organization would
 
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:54.159 align:start position:0%
get to keep 10% annually for who knows
 
01:35:57.229 --> 01:35:57.239 align:start position:0%
what um school districts can only keep
 
01:35:59.629 --> 01:35:59.639 align:start position:0%
5% and we have to have public hearings
 
01:36:01.229 --> 01:36:01.239 align:start position:0%
that tell you exactly what we're using
 
01:36:05.070 --> 01:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
our money for so it is that is sneaky
 
01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:07.679 align:start position:0%
suspect and I am not a fan wrapping it
 
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
up in marac our town has been working
 
01:36:12.030 --> 01:36:12.040 align:start position:0%
really hard to improve our school our
 
01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
students reading and math proficiency
 
01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:16.239 align:start position:0%
and that costs money money this bill
 
01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:18.159 align:start position:0%
would take away from our Public Schools
 
01:36:20.189 --> 01:36:20.199 align:start position:0%
this builds a divide instead of making
 
01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
the focus on giving our children the
 
01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
best education that they could have our
 
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
school district and Community currently
 
01:36:29.310 --> 01:36:29.320 align:start position:0%
cannot take on the increased cost that
 
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
this bill would place on us I realize
 
01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
this bill would be a choice local
 
01:36:35.910 --> 01:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
communities have but it be feels very
 
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
sneaky and has a lasting impact a
 
01:36:41.189 --> 01:36:41.199 align:start position:0%
negative lasting negative Financial
 
01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
impact on them when the community
 
01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
realized it's been duped I am in strong
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill and the negative
 
01:36:49.390 --> 01:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
Financial impacts it would cause our
 
01:36:51.550 --> 01:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
community thank you thank you any
 
01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:53.629 align:start position:0%
community thank you thank you any
questions

01:36:53.629 --> 01:36:53.639 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:36:56.910 --> 01:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
rep representative McDonald okay thank
 
01:36:58.229 --> 01:36:58.239 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for your
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
testimony you mentioned you're a member
 
01:37:03.070 --> 01:37:03.080 align:start position:0%
of the budget committee if this is a
 
01:37:05.189 --> 01:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
enabling Bill based on a Citizens
 
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
warrant petition Would It Go in front of
 
01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
the budget committee for a
 
01:37:09.390 --> 01:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation and would your
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation be on the ballot so if
 
01:37:13.870 --> 01:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
this was a warrant article it would be
 
01:37:16.189 --> 01:37:16.199 align:start position:0%
at our deliberative session and they
 
01:37:17.950 --> 01:37:17.960 align:start position:0%
would have to have it says on their 20
 
01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
signatures which is five less than you
 
01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
have to have to have anything else on
 
01:37:25.229 --> 01:37:25.239 align:start position:0%
our um do a warrant article and the
 
01:37:26.470 --> 01:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
warrant article would go to the
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
deliberative session and there somebody
 
01:37:32.109 --> 01:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
could speak to it hopefully amend it and
 
01:37:34.950 --> 01:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
then they would be able to put it on the
 
01:37:36.750 --> 01:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
ballot and then people would be able to
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
vote from there but the the fact that
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
you would be putting it on it's not
 
01:37:44.189 --> 01:37:44.199 align:start position:0%
you're not staying in here they're going
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
to keep 10% and it's going to cost your
 
01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
community almost
 
01:37:52.589 --> 01:37:52.599 align:start position:0%
$500,000 out of your operating budget
 
01:37:54.709 --> 01:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
just for the students that are on it now
 
01:37:56.990 --> 01:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
so I mean yes it would be there you
 
01:37:58.910 --> 01:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
could put it on and say that this is
 
01:38:04.030 --> 01:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
just local efas but I would be remiss if
 
01:38:06.629 --> 01:38:06.639 align:start position:0%
I didn't in inform my community what
 
01:38:08.430 --> 01:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
this would really mean because it
 
01:38:11.950 --> 01:38:11.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't just be helping local students
 
01:38:13.950 --> 01:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
get what they need it would be
 
01:38:17.950 --> 01:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
negatively impacting their taxes and
 
01:38:21.390 --> 01:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
increasing their tax burden that they
 
01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
have because we still have to publicly
 
01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
educate everybody so you can still have
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
your money for this and then we still it
 
01:38:31.629 --> 01:38:31.639 align:start position:0%
still costs the amount of money that it
 
01:38:34.229 --> 01:38:34.239 align:start position:0%
costs to have the buildings if you had
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
won 20 what did I say 36 students is not
 
01:38:39.550 --> 01:38:39.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of students you can't like close
 
01:38:41.350 --> 01:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
down a building because 36 students
 
01:38:43.390 --> 01:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
aren't there so you still have to make
 
01:38:46.750 --> 01:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
up the cost of the other I don't
 
01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
remember how many students are in our
 
01:38:50.270 --> 01:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
building our buildings but other lots of
 
01:38:52.149 --> 01:38:52.159 align:start position:0%
students that are going to have to be
 
01:38:55.589 --> 01:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
there so it it's a cost to us if I may
 
01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
just for clarification I appreciate your
 
01:39:00.030 --> 01:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
comments if I understand you correctly
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
so the budget committee's recommendation
 
01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
would or would not appear under the
 
01:39:06.669 --> 01:39:06.679 align:start position:0%
warrant article um it would not unless
 
01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
it was brought to us and it was
 
01:39:13.270 --> 01:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
something that was uh given to us before
 
01:39:16.270 --> 01:39:16.280 align:start position:0%
the school board had their meeting um
 
01:39:18.589 --> 01:39:18.599 align:start position:0%
and they present to us the warn articles
 
01:39:21.070 --> 01:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
from there so it goes Schoolboard
 
01:39:23.550 --> 01:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
meeting and then our meeting and then if
 
01:39:25.550 --> 01:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
it has a financial impact we would speak
 
01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
about it and vote on it and then our
 
01:39:31.470 --> 01:39:31.480 align:start position:0%
vote would be on the ballot for you to
 
01:39:34.109 --> 01:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
see so it would say like the committee
 
01:39:38.270 --> 01:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
members 13 of us voted zero or yes and z
 
01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
z for the other or 10 11 one you know
 
01:39:42.950 --> 01:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
some whatever the numbers are kind thank
 
01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
you very much yes thank you
 
01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:45.589 align:start position:0%
you very much yes thank you
representative

01:39:45.589 --> 01:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:39:47.629 --> 01:39:47.639 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I wanted to
 
01:39:51.870 --> 01:39:51.880 align:start position:0%
clarify you testified to the fact that
 
01:39:53.910 --> 01:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
you said that the school at the local
 
01:39:56.310 --> 01:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
public school level administrative fees
 
01:40:00.030 --> 01:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
you can only um administer or keep 5% of
 
01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:01.679 align:start position:0%
an administrative fee did I hear you
 
01:40:04.430 --> 01:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
correctly so we can keep uh the school
 
01:40:09.669 --> 01:40:09.679 align:start position:0%
district can keep a 5% of like um if you
 
01:40:12.990 --> 01:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
are well over so say you had a surplus
 
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
of money you can keep a percent of that
 
01:40:19.310 --> 01:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
Surplus after um the budget so you give
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
all the things to all the people and
 
01:40:22.109 --> 01:40:22.119 align:start position:0%
then if at the end you're like we have
 
01:40:25.350 --> 01:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
this extra money you can keep 5% of it
 
01:40:28.709 --> 01:40:28.719 align:start position:0%
for your uh town and then you have to
 
01:40:30.149 --> 01:40:30.159 align:start position:0%
have a public hearing about what you're
 
01:40:32.229 --> 01:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
going to use it on and in our town they
 
01:40:34.390 --> 01:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
used it on wit and wisdom recently which
 
01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
is really awesome helping our students
 
01:40:39.149 --> 01:40:39.159 align:start position:0%
with their comprehension and it cost a
 
01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
lot of money but that was what they had
 
01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
to speak about when they're going to um
 
01:40:48.629 --> 01:40:48.639 align:start position:0%
have that money thank you yes any other
 
01:40:52.229 --> 01:40:52.239 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you thank
 
01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:04.629 --> 01:41:04.639 align:start position:0%

school boards Association uh we are
 
01:41:12.229 --> 01:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill however um I'm
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
going to offer some hopefully
 
01:41:17.470 --> 01:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
clarification or maybe more confusion uh
 
01:41:20.109 --> 01:41:20.119 align:start position:0%
regarding regarding some of the concerns
 
01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
that we have and the problematic um
 
01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
language in this bill
 
01:41:25.550 --> 01:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
uh in regards to special ed as many of
 
01:41:27.470 --> 01:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
you know from my previous testimony
 
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
previously I served as a special
 
01:41:30.990 --> 01:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
education director uh here in the state
 
01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:33.679 align:start position:0%
for a number of years so um some
 
01:41:35.310 --> 01:41:35.320 align:start position:0%
clarification in terms of some of the
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
questions that have been brought up or
 
01:41:39.950 --> 01:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
asked um there are currently already
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
options now for families or students who
 
01:41:44.229 --> 01:41:44.239 align:start position:0%
are unhappy with the special education
 
01:41:45.709 --> 01:41:45.719 align:start position:0%
services that they are getting at their
 
01:41:48.390 --> 01:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
local District um students or families
 
01:41:50.910 --> 01:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
could take or apply for the current EFA
 
01:41:52.589 --> 01:41:52.599 align:start position:0%
program where parents do have to sign
 
01:41:56.189 --> 01:41:56.199 align:start position:0%
off um and give up their idea rights um
 
01:41:57.790 --> 01:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
they can send their student to a public
 
01:41:59.470 --> 01:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
charter school a parent can place their
 
01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
child there um there is unilateral
 
01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
parental placement so outside of both of
 
01:42:06.870 --> 01:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
those options where parents can place
 
01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
their children somewhere and then
 
01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:10.719 align:start position:0%
retroactively try to negotiate some sort
 
01:42:12.790 --> 01:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
of um appropriate agreement with the
 
01:42:14.709 --> 01:42:14.719 align:start position:0%
school district regarding that or go to
 
01:42:17.270 --> 01:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution uh this bill is a
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
little confusing because it seems like
 
01:42:20.709 --> 01:42:20.719 align:start position:0%
the school district is going to retain
 
01:42:22.669 --> 01:42:22.679 align:start position:0%
the cost of the provision of the special
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
EDR program full-time for all the
 
01:42:27.189 --> 01:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
students that are attending there uh one
 
01:42:28.830 --> 01:42:28.840 align:start position:0%
or two students as I think we've already
 
01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
heard is not going to save the district
 
01:42:32.830 --> 01:42:32.840 align:start position:0%
any cost there's no cost savings with
 
01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
that um in addition um these additional
 
01:42:39.149 --> 01:42:39.159 align:start position:0%
Services of providing uh services for
 
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
students who leave to take this EFA
 
01:42:43.030 --> 01:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
potentially and are coming back to the
 
01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
school district uh it's a little similar
 
01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
to the what we currently see with our
 
01:42:49.589 --> 01:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
Charter School provision of services
 
01:42:51.910 --> 01:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
where the resident district is retaining
 
01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
the obligation to provide those services
 
01:42:55.310 --> 01:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
and I think this committee has heard
 
01:42:58.189 --> 01:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
numbers of times that that system is not
 
01:43:00.070 --> 01:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
definitely does not save districts any
 
01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:02.639 align:start position:0%
money uh if anything it adds costs
 
01:43:05.669 --> 01:43:05.679 align:start position:0%
because you are uh pulling out sort of
 
01:43:07.629 --> 01:43:07.639 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for students to get
 
01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
those services within the context of
 
01:43:13.709 --> 01:43:13.719 align:start position:0%
their school day currently um so I'm not
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know why the district would
 
01:43:18.270 --> 01:43:18.280 align:start position:0%
agree to or the voters will agree to
 
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
this then students are going to
 
01:43:21.950 --> 01:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
potentially leave but come back to the
 
01:43:24.510 --> 01:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
district for services that the parent
 
01:43:28.350 --> 01:43:28.360 align:start position:0%
has taken the funds away to provide um
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make too much sense to me
 
01:43:31.550 --> 01:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
in the regards to how this bill is
 
01:43:32.990 --> 01:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
currently written and I think we've
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
already seen those challenges this bill
 
01:43:37.709 --> 01:43:37.719 align:start position:0%
is also written um it seems to be based
 
01:43:39.229 --> 01:43:39.239 align:start position:0%
on a belief that there is a big
 
01:43:41.470 --> 01:43:41.480 align:start position:0%
separation between special education
 
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
program services and regular Education
 
01:43:47.149 --> 01:43:47.159 align:start position:0%
Services uh special education and idea
 
01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
as you all know um is built on the
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
premise that students require special
 
01:43:54.149 --> 01:43:54.159 align:start position:0%
education in order to access their reg
 
01:43:56.109 --> 01:43:56.119 align:start position:0%
regular education program so if they're
 
01:43:57.910 --> 01:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
not getting their regular education
 
01:44:00.510 --> 01:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
program in the school district I'm not
 
01:44:03.189 --> 01:44:03.199 align:start position:0%
sure how the services are benefiting the
 
01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
child to access the General Ed program
 
01:44:06.709 --> 01:44:06.719 align:start position:0%
especially when the district has no
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
oversight potentially of the General Ed
 
01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
program because the students won't be
 
01:44:15.149 --> 01:44:15.159 align:start position:0%
there for that um sorry I'll wrap it up
 
01:44:17.070 --> 01:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
modifications accommodations in a
 
01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
students IEP this bill seems to state
 
01:44:21.589 --> 01:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
that the district require is required to
 
01:44:24.589 --> 01:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
still provide all the IEP team meeting
 
01:44:27.750 --> 01:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
Services decision making Etc most of the
 
01:44:29.149 --> 01:44:29.159 align:start position:0%
things a lot of the things in a
 
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
student's IEP are on the backs of the
 
01:44:33.189 --> 01:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
General Ed
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
teachers accommodations modifications
 
01:44:39.070 --> 01:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
Etc who's providing those that would be
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
in the child's IEP and the district
 
01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
would be responsible for making sure
 
01:44:44.149 --> 01:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
those things are done but if the
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
district is not in charge of the child's
 
01:44:49.310 --> 01:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
General Ed program I'm not sure how you
 
01:44:51.870 --> 01:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
manage that um there are also some
 
01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
challenges on the first first page with
 
01:44:55.830 --> 01:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
the definitions they don't match current
 
01:44:58.950 --> 01:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
definitions for special education 50% of
 
01:45:00.510 --> 01:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
the time is considered a full-time
 
01:45:02.790 --> 01:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
student uh what if the parent enrolls a
 
01:45:05.229 --> 01:45:05.239 align:start position:0%
child in another Public School who's
 
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
responsible for special ed in that
 
01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
situation um and I know the sponsor of
 
01:45:10.709 --> 01:45:10.719 align:start position:0%
the bill said it doesn't include the
 
01:45:13.030 --> 01:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid but but on page six
 
01:45:14.910 --> 01:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
line 22 it does say that it includes
 
01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid so is it twice the
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid um anyway I'm happy
 
01:45:22.669 --> 01:45:22.679 align:start position:0%
to take any questions sorry for the
 
01:45:24.830 --> 01:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
confusion thank you any questions
 
01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you um
 
01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question when we
 
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
talk about cost um we're not just
 
01:45:32.229 --> 01:45:32.239 align:start position:0%
talking about monetary costs either when
 
01:45:33.910 --> 01:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
we talk about taking a child out of
 
01:45:35.669 --> 01:45:35.679 align:start position:0%
their learning day and transporting them
 
01:45:38.629 --> 01:45:38.639 align:start position:0%
potentially back to a homeschool or a
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
sending school if you will um to receive
 
01:45:42.629 --> 01:45:42.639 align:start position:0%
services and then transporting them back
 
01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:44.719 align:start position:0%
to their other school that's a cost to
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
the learner as well so I I I I'm
 
01:45:50.310 --> 01:45:50.320 align:start position:0%
wondering how we um quantify that or do
 
01:45:52.950 --> 01:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
you share any concerns around that the
 
01:45:55.109 --> 01:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
memic day loss for the student thank you
 
01:45:57.189 --> 01:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
for the question representative um I
 
01:45:58.750 --> 01:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
think this committee has heard recently
 
01:46:00.430 --> 01:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
on a number of bills a concern that
 
01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
students are being pulled out of the
 
01:46:04.030 --> 01:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
General Ed setting or being placed in
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
some sort of separate setting to get
 
01:46:07.990 --> 01:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
their special education services um and
 
01:46:11.589 --> 01:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
the the very um real impact of a lack of
 
01:46:14.030 --> 01:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
belonging that those students feel um
 
01:46:16.030 --> 01:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
and that their families are searching
 
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
for higher levels of inclusion not less
 
01:46:23.070 --> 01:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
uh certainly if students are required to
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
come back to the district to get
 
01:46:27.510 --> 01:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
services this bill is not written in a
 
01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
way that helps me understand how an IEP
 
01:46:32.669 --> 01:46:32.679 align:start position:0%
team would mitigate that situation um I
 
01:46:34.629 --> 01:46:34.639 align:start position:0%
think we've seen with Charter Schools uh
 
01:46:36.350 --> 01:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
busing students back and forth for
 
01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
services not only is it costly
 
01:46:41.229 --> 01:46:41.239 align:start position:0%
financially from a fiscal standpoint but
 
01:46:44.709 --> 01:46:44.719 align:start position:0%
the day is very much interrupted um I
 
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
don't know how you would bring a student
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
back and forth for really highly
 
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
inclusive Services if the student the
 
01:46:52.990 --> 01:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
whole point of that is that they are
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
included so you would have to segregate
 
01:46:57.870 --> 01:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
those services to some extent uh
 
01:47:00.550 --> 01:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
certainly that would be a concern um and
 
01:47:02.870 --> 01:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of you know having access to
 
01:47:04.669 --> 01:47:04.679 align:start position:0%
the least restrictive environment with
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
your peers I'm not sure how that gets
 
01:47:09.550 --> 01:47:09.560 align:start position:0%
vetted out in the context of this
 
01:47:13.149 --> 01:47:13.159 align:start position:0%
bill follow upk you madam chair and then
 
01:47:15.229 --> 01:47:15.239 align:start position:0%
with regard to um it being the parents
 
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal responsibility to transport the
 
01:47:20.030 --> 01:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
child whether it's a you know a special
 
01:47:22.310 --> 01:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
modality of a bus or something like that
 
01:47:24.070 --> 01:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
my question then is do you do you share
 
01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
any concern that they might not even
 
01:47:28.990 --> 01:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
pursue the services if that is an undue
 
01:47:31.510 --> 01:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
burden to them that they
 
01:47:34.229 --> 01:47:34.239 align:start position:0%
cannot figure out thank you for the
 
01:47:36.709 --> 01:47:36.719 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
um to to answer your question that's
 
01:47:41.310 --> 01:47:41.320 align:start position:0%
always a concern however the way this
 
01:47:43.149 --> 01:47:43.159 align:start position:0%
bill is written I believe if specialized
 
01:47:45.550 --> 01:47:45.560 align:start position:0%
transportation is in the child's IEP to
 
01:47:47.109 --> 01:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
access their services the district would
 
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
have to provide it so even though the
 
01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill says it doesn't
 
01:47:51.990 --> 01:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
include Transportation I think the
 
01:47:53.350 --> 01:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
district would be on the the hook to
 
01:47:55.390 --> 01:47:55.400 align:start position:0%
provide it same with par professional
 
01:47:57.270 --> 01:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
support I'm not sure if a par
 
01:47:58.830 --> 01:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
professional was in a child's IEP
 
01:48:00.990 --> 01:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
because they need that to access their
 
01:48:02.750 --> 01:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
educational environment even if the
 
01:48:04.709 --> 01:48:04.719 align:start position:0%
parent enrolls the child in a private
 
01:48:06.669 --> 01:48:06.679 align:start position:0%
school for example if the par
 
01:48:08.830 --> 01:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
professional is in the students IEP I
 
01:48:10.189 --> 01:48:10.199 align:start position:0%
think the district at some level there
 
01:48:12.030 --> 01:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
would need to be a some sort of
 
01:48:13.629 --> 01:48:13.639 align:start position:0%
mitigation of how you're going to handle
 
01:48:16.270 --> 01:48:16.280 align:start position:0%
that situation um who's overseeing the
 
01:48:17.709 --> 01:48:17.719 align:start position:0%
pair professional is it the private
 
01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
school are they hiring them and
 
01:48:22.030 --> 01:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursing the district is reimbursing
 
01:48:24.030 --> 01:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of questions and concerns
 
01:48:25.990 --> 01:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
about that um and I think again we've
 
01:48:28.629 --> 01:48:28.639 align:start position:0%
heard that there are private schools for
 
01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
students who are in the current EFA
 
01:48:31.790 --> 01:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
program where students and families have
 
01:48:33.990 --> 01:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
given up their idea rights but who
 
01:48:36.149 --> 01:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
choose not to take students based on the
 
01:48:39.310 --> 01:48:39.320 align:start position:0%
intensity of their needs um would this
 
01:48:41.669 --> 01:48:41.679 align:start position:0%
bill the way that it's written sort of
 
01:48:43.709 --> 01:48:43.719 align:start position:0%
give private schools the idea that a
 
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
student could sort of be enrolled in a
 
01:48:46.950 --> 01:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
private school and should of shut off
 
01:48:48.790 --> 01:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
their needs so to speak during the
 
01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
school day but then have to be going
 
01:48:51.790 --> 01:48:51.800 align:start position:0%
back to get Services that's not
 
01:48:53.589 --> 01:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
typically how disability work to be
 
01:48:55.550 --> 01:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
perfectly honest um and I think I would
 
01:48:57.350 --> 01:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
have some concerns about the perception
 
01:49:00.430 --> 01:49:00.440 align:start position:0%
that you can separate out a child's
 
01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
needs for certain hours of the school
 
01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
day that if you're really doing a good
 
01:49:06.510 --> 01:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
job finding students eligible for
 
01:49:08.229 --> 01:49:08.239 align:start position:0%
special ed it's because they need it
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
throughout their school day thank you
 
01:49:13.390 --> 01:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
you're welcome representative wock thank
 
01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
you madam chair uh thank you for taking
 
01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
my question U I've been very impressed
 
01:49:20.109 --> 01:49:20.119 align:start position:0%
with the the so far with your dialogue
 
01:49:22.709 --> 01:49:22.719 align:start position:0%
regarding some of the issues that
 
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
generated uh from your research what
 
01:49:28.430 --> 01:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
concerns me is believe it or not we're
 
01:49:29.910 --> 01:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
supposedly supposed to exec this bill
 
01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
this afternoon so I so uh which is
 
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
almost clearly
 
01:49:38.430 --> 01:49:38.440 align:start position:0%
unconscionable uh that being said if I
 
01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
may are there any other modifications
 
01:49:44.350 --> 01:49:44.360 align:start position:0%
that you have there that we need to hear
 
01:49:46.350 --> 01:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
now because we now we're going to be
 
01:49:47.709 --> 01:49:47.719 align:start position:0%
trying to make a decision on this I'd
 
01:49:50.070 --> 01:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate that input uh thank you for
 
01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
the question representative Woodcock
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
there I mean again I think you could go
 
01:49:57.750 --> 01:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
line by line in this bill it's very
 
01:50:00.669 --> 01:50:00.679 align:start position:0%
lengthy it doesn't necessarily I I
 
01:50:02.189 --> 01:50:02.199 align:start position:0%
haven't done a side by side with the
 
01:50:04.030 --> 01:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
current EFA program to see where there
 
01:50:05.870 --> 01:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
are substantial differences but there
 
01:50:08.030 --> 01:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
are substantial differences it doesn't
 
01:50:09.589 --> 01:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
necessarily line up with our charter
 
01:50:12.270 --> 01:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
school rules or statutes in terms of how
 
01:50:14.589 --> 01:50:14.599 align:start position:0%
things are provided um there are
 
01:50:16.870 --> 01:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
problems with both already I think it
 
01:50:18.669 --> 01:50:18.679 align:start position:0%
would take some time to kind of go
 
01:50:20.270 --> 01:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
through this and figure out really what
 
01:50:21.390 --> 01:50:21.400 align:start position:0%
are the
 
01:50:23.629 --> 01:50:23.639 align:start position:0%
impacts the other couple of things that
 
01:50:27.189 --> 01:50:27.199 align:start position:0%
are just very obvious um the current EFA
 
01:50:29.790 --> 01:50:29.800 align:start position:0%
program says that if ever that program
 
01:50:32.510 --> 01:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
is discontinued that students who are in
 
01:50:34.510 --> 01:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
it now will be eligible until they
 
01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
graduate high school or until they age
 
01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
out of special education which for some
 
01:50:40.870 --> 01:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
students is at age 22 I don't know what
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
happens in this bill with that um this
 
01:50:45.669 --> 01:50:45.679 align:start position:0%
says that you're only eligible up to age
 
01:50:47.550 --> 01:50:47.560 align:start position:0%
20 but specialed students could be
 
01:50:49.629 --> 01:50:49.639 align:start position:0%
eligible till age 22 so this doesn't
 
01:50:51.910 --> 01:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
really line up with that um it doesn't
 
01:50:54.069 --> 01:50:54.079 align:start position:0%
is it just when they get a regular
 
01:50:56.229 --> 01:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
education diploma that's concerning to
 
01:51:02.189 --> 01:51:02.199 align:start position:0%
me um I don't know how an IEP team is
 
01:51:02.199 --> 01:51:03.149 align:start position:0%
me um I don't know how an IEP team is
going

01:51:03.149 --> 01:51:03.159 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:51:06.950 --> 01:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
to do that their work with Fidelity
 
01:51:09.629 --> 01:51:09.639 align:start position:0%
given the fact that the the parent to no
 
01:51:10.990 --> 01:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
no you
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
know conflict with the parent but the
 
01:51:14.669 --> 01:51:14.679 align:start position:0%
parent is going to make what decisions
 
01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
they think are best for their child's
 
01:51:18.430 --> 01:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
education experience the district has no
 
01:51:21.589 --> 01:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
oversight of that so to try it just is
 
01:51:23.470 --> 01:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
very confusing about how that's going to
 
01:51:25.229 --> 01:51:25.239 align:start position:0%
work who's responsible for making sure
 
01:51:27.229 --> 01:51:27.239 align:start position:0%
the child's making progress on their IEP
 
01:51:29.350 --> 01:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
goals if their IEP goals are tied to the
 
01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
curriculum and you don't have any
 
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
oversight of the curriculum um you know
 
01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
and and again I I understand that the
 
01:51:38.910 --> 01:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
intention is to try to provide families
 
01:51:41.109 --> 01:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
with additional funding to go do these
 
01:51:43.350 --> 01:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
things but it's not it's going to cost
 
01:51:45.069 --> 01:51:45.079 align:start position:0%
the district more money the district is
 
01:51:47.910 --> 01:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
going to have to run that program plus
 
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools plus this other program
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
and while I certainly respect the voter
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
will um as a Schoolboard
 
01:51:58.229 --> 01:51:58.239 align:start position:0%
Association not every unless you have
 
01:52:00.109 --> 01:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
some really in-depth knowledge or you
 
01:52:01.510 --> 01:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
are a parent of a student with a
 
01:52:03.550 --> 01:52:03.560 align:start position:0%
disability I'm not sure that you really
 
01:52:06.189 --> 01:52:06.199 align:start position:0%
understand exactly what you are offering
 
01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
with this program and sort of the
 
01:52:10.149 --> 01:52:10.159 align:start position:0%
unintentional cost that could come along
 
01:52:11.950 --> 01:52:11.960 align:start position:0%
with that thank you you're welcome thank
 
01:52:13.990 --> 01:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
you madam chair any other
 
01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you thank you
 
01:52:16.239 --> 01:52:17.589 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you thank you
madam

01:52:17.589 --> 01:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
madam
 
01:52:32.310 --> 01:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:38.750 --> 01:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:41.709 --> 01:52:41.719 align:start position:0%
my uh good morning chairman noo and
 
01:52:43.470 --> 01:52:43.480 align:start position:0%
members of the House Education policy
 
01:52:46.189 --> 01:52:46.199 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Deborah H I am
 
01:52:47.629 --> 01:52:47.639 align:start position:0%
president of the American Federation of
 
01:52:49.830 --> 01:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
teachers New Hampshire and I am here on
 
01:52:52.229 --> 01:52:52.239 align:start position:0%
behalf of our 3500 members across the
 
01:52:57.229 --> 01:52:57.239 align:start position:0%
state to oppose HB 748 um every student
 
01:52:59.069 --> 01:52:59.079 align:start position:0%
in the grand state has a constitutional
 
01:53:01.550 --> 01:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
right to a robust public education that
 
01:53:04.830 --> 01:53:04.840 align:start position:0%
means an education with um well- Tred
 
01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
teachers and Par Educators who can give
 
01:53:08.950 --> 01:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
them support in the classroom and make
 
01:53:11.589 --> 01:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
sure that they are learning and having
 
01:53:15.149 --> 01:53:15.159 align:start position:0%
their academic needs Meed met sorry and
 
01:53:18.109 --> 01:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
um this bill if passed would make that
 
01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
so much harder because state is not
 
01:53:22.109 --> 01:53:22.119 align:start position:0%
meaning its obligation to make sure that
 
01:53:24.750 --> 01:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
every district is funded so that they
 
01:53:28.870 --> 01:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
can um provide this opportunity for a
 
01:53:31.069 --> 01:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
robust public education many of our
 
01:53:33.550 --> 01:53:33.560 align:start position:0%
districts are already struggling with
 
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
their budgets and placing a huge burden
 
01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
on local property taxpayers to the point
 
01:53:41.629 --> 01:53:41.639 align:start position:0%
where they have already cut back on
 
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
Services they have High um student to
 
01:53:47.390 --> 01:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
teer ratios not a lot of support staff
 
01:53:49.830 --> 01:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
already if you pass this you're are
 
01:53:52.950 --> 01:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
going to have situations where you're
 
01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:54.510 align:start position:0%
going to have situations where you're
setting

01:53:54.510 --> 01:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
setting
 
01:53:56.709 --> 01:53:56.719 align:start position:0%
up in a
 
01:53:59.149 --> 01:53:59.159 align:start position:0%
district an expectation that you will
 
01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
have local school
 
01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
vouchers and that money has to come from
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
somewhere and that's the
 
01:54:11.910 --> 01:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
problem you will have a cost of between
 
01:54:14.310 --> 01:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
$836 and
 
01:54:17.109 --> 01:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
$3,668 per student that has to come out
 
01:54:18.830 --> 01:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
of the local budget I understand some of
 
01:54:21.310 --> 01:54:21.320 align:start position:0%
it comes back from the state eventually
 
01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
somehow it's a little bit clear uh on
 
01:54:25.950 --> 01:54:25.960 align:start position:0%
whether it's you know paid forward or
 
01:54:28.430 --> 01:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
has to be paid out front by the local uh
 
01:54:30.709 --> 01:54:30.719 align:start position:0%
and gets reimbursed from the state but
 
01:54:32.310 --> 01:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
that money has to be available it has to
 
01:54:36.430 --> 01:54:36.440 align:start position:0%
be in the budget and um local taxpayers
 
01:54:37.830 --> 01:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
might not know that when they're voting
 
01:54:39.790 --> 01:54:39.800 align:start position:0%
on this because the warrant article
 
01:54:42.109 --> 01:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't make the consequences
 
01:54:44.069 --> 01:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
clear it just says oh we're going to
 
01:54:45.870 --> 01:54:45.880 align:start position:0%
help kids so that you know parents can
 
01:54:47.189 --> 01:54:47.199 align:start position:0%
make the choice that they think is best
 
01:54:49.870 --> 01:54:49.880 align:start position:0%
for their their student great that would
 
01:54:52.750 --> 01:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
be nice but most parents want students
 
01:54:54.629 --> 01:54:54.639 align:start position:0%
in a well-funded
 
01:54:56.990 --> 01:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
robust public education in their local
 
01:55:01.270 --> 01:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
public school we know that um so the
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
consequences you're going to be forcing
 
01:55:05.470 --> 01:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
local districts to either raise local
 
01:55:07.510 --> 01:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
property taxes or make deep Cuts in
 
01:55:09.149 --> 01:55:09.159 align:start position:0%
their public schools because we know
 
01:55:11.550 --> 01:55:11.560 align:start position:0%
most of the students using vouchers on
 
01:55:14.550 --> 01:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
the state level already are students who
 
01:55:16.069 --> 01:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
were not in the public schools you're
 
01:55:17.310 --> 01:55:17.320 align:start position:0%
not going to have many students leaving
 
01:55:20.790 --> 01:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:24.350 --> 01:55:24.360 align:start position:0%

01:55:27.030 --> 01:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
students eligible will be charter school
 
01:55:28.270 --> 01:55:28.280 align:start position:0%

01:55:45.470 --> 01:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
the State website for some of the places
 
01:55:48.069 --> 01:55:48.079 align:start position:0%

top end if it has all the different you
 
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
have to have this built into your School
 
01:56:41.830 --> 01:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
District budget so you're ready to fund
 
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
those vouchers and when or if the state
 
01:56:49.069 --> 01:56:49.079 align:start position:0%
reimburses you for that base pupil Aid
 
01:56:50.229 --> 01:56:50.239 align:start position:0%
and how much you're going to get are you
 
01:56:51.629 --> 01:56:51.639 align:start position:0%
sure you're going to get it again
 
01:56:52.990 --> 01:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit on un clear so you
 
01:56:55.629 --> 01:56:55.639 align:start position:0%
have to be ready to have that all to
 
01:56:59.470 --> 01:56:59.480 align:start position:0%
go wrapping up okay so wrapping up um we
 
01:57:02.229 --> 01:57:02.239 align:start position:0%
know that most Granite State families
 
01:57:05.069 --> 01:57:05.079 align:start position:0%
want their kids in a well-resourced

and have their voice heard and have a

find HP 748 in expedient to legislate
 
01:57:32.350 --> 01:57:32.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and I do have this
 
01:57:35.149 --> 01:57:35.159 align:start position:0%
to hand around okay representative
 
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair um thank
 
01:57:40.589 --> 01:57:40.599 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question on page four
 
01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
starting on line 18 where it's like sub
 
01:57:47.229 --> 01:57:47.239 align:start position:0%
5A yep it says the scholarship
 
01:57:48.990 --> 01:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
organization shall not Adopt A system
 
01:57:50.430 --> 01:57:50.440 align:start position:0%
that relies this is enumerating

Authority and responsibilities of
 
01:57:53.669 --> 01:57:53.679 align:start position:0%
scholarship organizations says the
 
01:57:55.510 --> 01:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization shall not Adopt
 
01:57:57.350 --> 01:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
A system that relies exclusively on
 
01:57:59.109 --> 01:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
requiring parents to be reimbursed for
 
01:58:01.390 --> 01:58:01.400 align:start position:0%
out of pocket expenses but rather shall
 
01:58:03.310 --> 01:58:03.320 align:start position:0%
provide maximum flexibility to parents
 
01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
by facilitating quote direct payments to
 
01:58:08.149 --> 01:58:08.159 align:start position:0%
Education Service Providers uh my
 
01:58:10.390 --> 01:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
question to you is whether or not um
 
01:58:12.669 --> 01:58:12.679 align:start position:0%
there could be confusion in in in the
 
01:58:14.990 --> 01:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
EFA wallet dispersement and then also
 
01:58:18.750 --> 01:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
funds provided uh direct to provider um
 
01:58:21.470 --> 01:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
services that may uh you might end up
 
01:58:23.350 --> 01:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
potentially over overpaying the account
 
01:58:24.910 --> 01:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
because you have a certain amount in the
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
my class wallet and then you're the way
 
01:58:28.589 --> 01:58:28.599 align:start position:0%
I'm reading this uh sending direct
 
01:58:30.030 --> 01:58:30.040 align:start position:0%
payments to
 
01:58:32.550 --> 01:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
providers that does sound unclear it
 
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
sounds like perhaps you could end up
 
01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
with double payments
 
01:58:40.350 --> 01:58:40.360 align:start position:0%
um and that would definitely be
 
01:58:41.669 --> 01:58:41.679 align:start position:0%
something that you would want to make
 
01:58:44.669 --> 01:58:44.679 align:start position:0%
sure there was strict oversight because
 
01:58:46.830 --> 01:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
this is after all taxpayer money and
 
01:58:47.910 --> 01:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
again you're going to have to go back to
 
01:58:50.270 --> 01:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
your local property taxpayers and ask
 
01:58:53.109 --> 01:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
for more money cu you
 
01:58:55.750 --> 01:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
those let me find my numbers again those
 
01:58:58.069 --> 01:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
223 resident homeschooled students in
 
01:59:00.709 --> 01:59:00.719 align:start position:0%
the mic Regional School District you
 
01:59:03.270 --> 01:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
hadn't budgeted anything for and now
 
01:59:05.149 --> 01:59:05.159 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to have a line item
 
01:59:08.270 --> 01:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
in your school budget to fund the
 
01:59:10.950 --> 01:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
potential of having a local vure for
 
01:59:11.830 --> 01:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
each of
 
01:59:13.950 --> 01:59:13.960 align:start position:0%
them so you either going to have to
 
01:59:16.069 --> 01:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
raise taxes or find the place to cut
 
01:59:18.189 --> 01:59:18.199 align:start position:0%
that out of your budget that's a lot of
 
01:59:20.830 --> 01:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
classroom teachers or Paris or you don't
 
01:59:22.510 --> 01:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
have that much of materials you can get
 
01:59:25.750 --> 01:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
rid of represent and your kids in your
 
01:59:27.510 --> 01:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
school are going to have to do with
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
less representative dry thank you and
 
01:59:33.030 --> 01:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:36.910 --> 01:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
question why are you putting in a line
 
01:59:39.390 --> 01:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
for every home schooler assuming that
 
01:59:42.310 --> 01:59:42.320 align:start position:0%
they would be students of
 
01:59:46.229 --> 01:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
lefas that is The Prudent way to budget
 
01:59:49.189 --> 01:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
when you do your household bills and you
 
01:59:52.350 --> 01:59:52.360 align:start position:0%
write 10 checks do you assume seven of
 
01:59:53.669 --> 01:59:53.679 align:start position:0%
them won't be
 
01:59:56.750 --> 01:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
cashed you you'd have your account you
 
01:59:59.629 --> 01:59:59.639 align:start position:0%
know in the in the red follow up thank
 
02:00:07.069 --> 02:00:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:09.709 --> 02:00:09.719 align:start position:0%
now do you budget for all homeschoolers
 
02:00:12.990 --> 02:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
coming back to school now whether
 
02:00:14.109 --> 02:00:14.119 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether they have you have
 
02:00:17.270 --> 02:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:20.629 --> 02:00:20.639 align:start position:0%
not you're creating a program that says
 
02:00:23.069 --> 02:00:23.079 align:start position:0%
sign up for
 
02:00:29.310 --> 02:00:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:34.270 --> 02:00:34.280 align:start position:0%
expenses doesn't it make prudent sense
 
02:00:38.870 --> 02:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
to plan for a large number of people to
 
02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
take advantage of
 
02:00:44.990 --> 02:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't you be irresponsible not
 
02:00:47.669 --> 02:00:47.679 align:start position:0%
to shortsightedness is why our schools
 
02:00:54.030 --> 02:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:55.149 --> 02:00:55.159 align:start position:0%
any other
 
02:01:00.990 --> 02:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:09.750 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:01:09.750 --> 02:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:15.629 --> 02:01:15.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
okay good morning my name is Heather
 
02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
Barker and I work with nhsaa here in
 
02:01:23.310 --> 02:01:23.320 align:start position:0%
conquered I am the student service
 
02:01:25.790 --> 02:01:25.800 align:start position:0%
director there and like Miss Wilson I
 
02:01:29.350 --> 02:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
was a district specialed director in
 
02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:30.870 align:start position:0%
was a district specialed director in
marac

02:01:30.870 --> 02:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
marac
 
02:01:33.030 --> 02:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
actually I actually am not going to
 
02:01:34.510 --> 02:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
repeat any of the things that other
 
02:01:36.069 --> 02:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
folks said here this
 
02:01:38.990 --> 02:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
morning I do believe in school choice
 
02:01:41.470 --> 02:01:41.480 align:start position:0%
I've said that before here it is not
 
02:01:44.109 --> 02:01:44.119 align:start position:0%
prudent though for local communities to
 
02:01:47.189 --> 02:01:47.199 align:start position:0%
Bear the brunt of paying for the public
 
02:01:48.629 --> 02:01:48.639 align:start position:0%
education in New Hampshire and the
 
02:01:50.350 --> 02:01:50.360 align:start position:0%
special education of New Hampshire and
 
02:01:53.950 --> 02:01:53.960 align:start position:0%
in addition to that Charter education
 
02:01:56.790 --> 02:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
EFA education and now local EFA
 
02:02:00.709 --> 02:02:00.719 align:start position:0%
education until the state assumes the
 
02:02:04.149 --> 02:02:04.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility to actually fund the
 
02:02:06.990 --> 02:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
public education and special education
 
02:02:09.990 --> 02:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
once we do that and we take on that
 
02:02:13.709 --> 02:02:13.719 align:start position:0%
obligation as a state we can have these
 
02:02:16.390 --> 02:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
things that we should be able to think
 
02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
about each child and what is in the best
 
02:02:21.510 --> 02:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
interest of them it's an honorable it's
 
02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
an thing you guys are trying to do at
 
02:02:27.149 --> 02:02:27.159 align:start position:0%
the same time we're breaking it over the
 
02:02:30.390 --> 02:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
backs of the local towns who are now
 
02:02:33.790 --> 02:02:33.800 align:start position:0%
rising up against their schools because
 
02:02:37.030 --> 02:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
it costs so much to educate the children
 
02:02:39.229 --> 02:02:39.239 align:start position:0%
to pay for the special
 
02:02:44.030 --> 02:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
education just the line in here okay on
 
02:02:50.950 --> 02:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
page eight there's line 13 and 14 is it
 
02:02:53.830 --> 02:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
for special educ ation we've now put it
 
02:02:56.790 --> 02:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
in here and again it's honorable that he
 
02:02:58.470 --> 02:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
brought this idea forward that you know
 
02:02:59.629 --> 02:02:59.639 align:start position:0%
and that you know people should be able
 
02:03:01.870 --> 02:03:01.880 align:start position:0%
to send their kids where they want to
 
02:03:06.030 --> 02:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
yes I I hear that and to state that we
 
02:03:07.990 --> 02:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
already do it in special education kids
 
02:03:10.589 --> 02:03:10.599 align:start position:0%
go to private schools hey that's Along
 
02:03:13.750 --> 02:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
by law the Continuum of special ed
 
02:03:15.870 --> 02:03:15.880 align:start position:0%
services and those are decisions that
 
02:03:17.669 --> 02:03:17.679 align:start position:0%
are difficult to make as we move
 
02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
children further and further away from
 
02:03:23.109 --> 02:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
their local community SCH school right
 
02:03:25.189 --> 02:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
their T their peers their typical peers
 
02:03:27.270 --> 02:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
in those settings that's done through
 
02:03:29.189 --> 02:03:29.199 align:start position:0%
the special ed process those are not
 
02:03:31.870 --> 02:03:31.880 align:start position:0%
private schools for Choice okay that's
 
02:03:34.390 --> 02:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
the special ed process the idea that we
 
02:03:35.870 --> 02:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
aren't going to be obligated as
 
02:03:39.109 --> 02:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
communities to provide fape the town
 
02:03:41.950 --> 02:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
will have to do that if the IEP says
 
02:03:44.069 --> 02:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
Transportation we're
 
02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
transporting if it says I mean there's
 
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
nothing here that says the parents
 
02:03:50.549 --> 02:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
signing off that they're not going to
 
02:03:52.950 --> 02:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
receive that what it says is and I I get
 
02:03:56.030 --> 02:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
it that was honorable that his the the
 
02:03:57.510 --> 02:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill that spoke this
 
02:03:59.510 --> 02:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
morning talked about the idea that he
 
02:04:02.549 --> 02:04:02.559 align:start position:0%
does understand the cost that's going to
 
02:04:04.990 --> 02:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
the local community when we put the
 
02:04:07.790 --> 02:04:07.800 align:start position:0%
obligation on the public school to fund
 
02:04:09.830 --> 02:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
what's happening in a charter school or
 
02:04:12.830 --> 02:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
any other place and again I believe in
 
02:04:15.430 --> 02:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
having those options absolutely but
 
02:04:17.510 --> 02:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
until the state of New Hampshire funds
 
02:04:19.750 --> 02:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
the general education and special
 
02:04:22.510 --> 02:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
education so that not all of of this
 
02:04:25.470 --> 02:04:25.480 align:start position:0%
like so much of it sits in your local
 
02:04:28.270 --> 02:04:28.280 align:start position:0%
towns which is why there is no so much
 
02:04:31.950 --> 02:04:31.960 align:start position:0%
dissent at this point and that's too bad
 
02:04:35.310 --> 02:04:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:38.629 --> 02:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
got thank you very much
 
02:04:42.270 --> 02:04:42.280 align:start position:0%
questions great s thank

you is there anybody else who wishes to
 
02:04:46.589 --> 02:04:46.599 align:start position:0%
speak on the
 
02:04:48.750 --> 02:04:48.760 align:start position:0%

the beautiful Lakes Region and uh this
 
02:13:33.470 --> 02:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
bill is a result of conversation with
 
02:13:34.910 --> 02:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
the Department of
 
02:13:38.589 --> 02:13:38.599 align:start position:0%
Education um there is uh an existing
 
02:13:42.549 --> 02:13:42.559 align:start position:0%
statute um relative to Charter
 
02:13:44.109 --> 02:13:44.119 align:start position:0%
revocation and
 
02:13:48.189 --> 02:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
probation um there have been um a a
 
02:13:50.750 --> 02:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
couple of instances in the past few
 
02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:52.030 align:start position:0%
couple of instances in the past few
years

02:13:52.030 --> 02:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:13:56.189 --> 02:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
when um the department thought that they
 
02:13:58.870 --> 02:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
um if they had additional tools
 
02:14:02.149 --> 02:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
available to them it might help them in
 
02:14:05.350 --> 02:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
remedying the situation one way or the
 
02:14:08.549 --> 02:14:08.559 align:start position:0%
other um in relation to a charter school
 
02:14:10.149 --> 02:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
um that was having
 
02:14:14.990 --> 02:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
problems so this is the result of that
 
02:14:18.310 --> 02:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
um and you can see uh I'll just go
 
02:14:20.870 --> 02:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
through a few of the highlights on this
 
02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:21.589 align:start position:0%
through a few of the highlights on this
um

02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:23.750 --> 02:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
in the first section starting on lines
 
02:14:27.870 --> 02:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
four and five it outlines um eight or
 
02:14:31.149 --> 02:14:31.159 align:start position:0%
nine um uh Provisions
 
02:14:34.950 --> 02:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances where the uh state board
 
02:14:40.470 --> 02:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
could revoke a charter prior to the
 
02:14:44.350 --> 02:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
expiration um and you'll see those there
 
02:14:47.109 --> 02:14:47.119 align:start position:0%
um you know one of the most common would
 
02:14:50.310 --> 02:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
be uh the school is uh financially
 
02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:52.629 align:start position:0%
be uh the school is uh financially
unstable

02:14:52.629 --> 02:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
unstable
 
02:14:56.669 --> 02:14:56.679 align:start position:0%
um then down on Roman 2 line
 
02:15:00.270 --> 02:15:00.280 align:start position:0%
19 uh the uh state
 
02:15:04.950 --> 02:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
board um could accept um petitions from
 
02:15:09.910 --> 02:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
parents of current students or by the um
 
02:15:16.069 --> 02:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
uh Board of u a district uh to uh have
 
02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
the uh Charter
 
02:15:22.510 --> 02:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
revoked uh and then on Roman 3 following
 
02:15:26.069 --> 02:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
that the State Board before acting on
 
02:15:28.709 --> 02:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
that petition would have to check with
 
02:15:31.669 --> 02:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
the uh Board of Trustees of that charter
 
02:15:36.310 --> 02:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
school and see about a um remediation
 
02:15:39.470 --> 02:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
plan for the
 
02:15:42.109 --> 02:15:42.119 align:start position:0%
situation um that is carried on in in
 
02:15:45.069 --> 02:15:45.079 align:start position:0%
Roman 4 at the bottom of the
 
02:15:45.079 --> 02:15:47.390 align:start position:0%
Roman 4 at the bottom of the
page

02:15:47.390 --> 02:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
page
 
02:15:50.350 --> 02:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
um then importantly on the next page in
 
02:15:51.470 --> 02:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
Roman 5
 
02:15:56.549 --> 02:15:56.559 align:start position:0%
five um the State Board is given
 
02:16:00.510 --> 02:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
explicit uh provision to immediately
 
02:16:05.709 --> 02:16:05.719 align:start position:0%
revoke a charter school um Charter uh if
 
02:16:10.709 --> 02:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
there are uh situations which U would uh
 
02:16:13.950 --> 02:16:13.960 align:start position:0%
risk the harm of students so that's an
 
02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:14.990 align:start position:0%
risk the harm of students so that's an
important

02:16:14.990 --> 02:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:16:18.629 --> 02:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
provision um the there is a second
 
02:16:22.350 --> 02:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
section of this bill um which is uh
 
02:16:25.910 --> 02:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
Midway down on line 20 on page two and
 
02:16:28.870 --> 02:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
that's um the uh what happens to the
 
02:16:31.750 --> 02:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
records of a closed Charter School um
 
02:16:34.790 --> 02:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
we've dealt with records for um you know
 
02:16:37.950 --> 02:16:37.960 align:start position:0%
closing uh universities uh Etc in the
 
02:16:42.629 --> 02:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
past few years um this outlines uh the
 
02:16:45.790 --> 02:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
process for uh the records for a closed
 
02:16:48.870 --> 02:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
charter school and for the Department of

information available on how someone can

request those
 
02:17:12.309 --> 02:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
records so um that is the bill in a
 
02:17:16.910 --> 02:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
nutshell and uh also the intent to give
 
02:17:20.230 --> 02:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh the department uh tools uh that they
 
02:17:24.309 --> 02:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
feel are necessary for them to uh you
 
02:17:27.709 --> 02:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
know oversee and monitor uh Charter
 
02:17:32.270 --> 02:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
Schools who uh might be in uh bad
 
02:17:35.469 --> 02:17:35.479 align:start position:0%
circumstances thank you thank you any
 
02:17:37.070 --> 02:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:17:39.629 --> 02:17:39.639 align:start position:0%
wock thank you madam chair thank you
 
02:17:39.639 --> 02:17:41.230 align:start position:0%
wock thank you madam chair thank you
representative

02:17:41.230 --> 02:17:41.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:17:44.709 --> 02:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
Celli on line 20 on the you about the
 
02:17:48.509 --> 02:17:48.519 align:start position:0%
records Rec what happens if I we're
 
02:17:51.030 --> 02:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
talking um
 
02:17:53.709 --> 02:17:53.719 align:start position:0%
insolvency basically with the child with
 
02:17:55.150 --> 02:17:55.160 align:start position:0%
when these child schools
 
02:17:57.750 --> 02:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
fold if they don't have the money at
 
02:17:59.589 --> 02:17:59.599 align:start position:0%
that point and some of their records
 
02:17:59.599 --> 02:18:00.669 align:start position:0%
that point and some of their records
aren't

02:18:00.669 --> 02:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
aren't
 
02:18:02.509 --> 02:18:02.519 align:start position:0%
electronic and this is requiring
 
02:18:05.469 --> 02:18:05.479 align:start position:0%
electron all electronic Records who does
 
02:18:06.990 --> 02:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
that who transposes the written records
 
02:18:08.389 --> 02:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
in electronic but where did that cost
 
02:18:10.950 --> 02:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
come from because I'm sure there
 
02:18:12.230 --> 02:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
application pieces that I'm sure
 
02:18:14.150 --> 02:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
everything's not all
 
02:18:17.870 --> 02:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
electronic um yeah it's my understanding
 
02:18:19.950 --> 02:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
that a lot of these specific type of
 
02:18:23.309 --> 02:18:23.319 align:start position:0%
Records um would Pro most likely be in
 
02:18:25.349 --> 02:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
electronic format some of the other
 
02:18:29.750 --> 02:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
records might not but um the ones that
 
02:18:32.709 --> 02:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
um we're talking about here uh probably
 
02:18:35.910 --> 02:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
would be in electronic format okay you
 
02:18:38.429 --> 02:18:38.439 align:start position:0%
follow me follow okay I I agree with
 
02:18:40.429 --> 02:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
most of them are but I'm looking at
 
02:18:41.790 --> 02:18:41.800 align:start position:0%
things like some of the health records
 
02:18:43.910 --> 02:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
Health notations some dis actions may
 
02:18:46.910 --> 02:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
not be in a person and student file
 
02:18:49.629 --> 02:18:49.639 align:start position:0%
um those types of things and they just
 
02:18:52.389 --> 02:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
right the following few lines there 26
 
02:18:54.830 --> 02:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
27 I'm not I'm not arguing about the the
 
02:18:56.509 --> 02:18:56.519 align:start position:0%
bill I'm just saying I'm thinking about
 
02:18:58.349 --> 02:18:58.359 align:start position:0%
if the school's going under already
 
02:19:01.349 --> 02:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
who's going to and typically when the we
 
02:19:02.830 --> 02:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
surprisedly typically when the
 
02:19:04.629 --> 02:19:04.639 align:start position:0%
department send the bill in they have a
 
02:19:07.230 --> 02:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
huge physical note for some reason uh so
 
02:19:09.589 --> 02:19:09.599 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking in this case there' be a
 
02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
cost somewhere to transcribe get there
 
02:19:13.629 --> 02:19:13.639 align:start position:0%
that's my only question that I didn't
 
02:19:15.549 --> 02:19:15.559 align:start position:0%
see anywhere any of the handwritten
 
02:19:16.870 --> 02:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
records particularly those that that
 
02:19:19.429 --> 02:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
dealt with maybe health information it
 
02:19:23.230 --> 02:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
isn't elect I think that if there are um
 
02:19:25.110 --> 02:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
these types of records that aren't
 
02:19:27.230 --> 02:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
electronically I think that the uh
 
02:19:29.750 --> 02:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
Department would take them um and store
 
02:19:33.549 --> 02:19:33.559 align:start position:0%
them as well um and have them um if
 
02:19:36.629 --> 02:19:36.639 align:start position:0%
needed by by a student or prior
 
02:19:41.030 --> 02:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
student okay thank you thank you m chair
 
02:19:43.110 --> 02:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
representative muray thank you madam
 
02:19:44.669 --> 02:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you for taking my
 
02:19:48.270 --> 02:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
question um Mr chairman um one question
 
02:19:50.429 --> 02:19:50.439 align:start position:0%
that I did have um was with regard to I
 
02:19:52.190 --> 02:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
think last week we heard a bill similar
 
02:19:55.230 --> 02:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
on records retention okay and so I was
 
02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
curious that if if in it like the two
 
02:19:59.750 --> 02:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
were to proceed forward like um would
 
02:20:01.790 --> 02:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
they stand in in contradiction to one
 
02:20:04.870 --> 02:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
another uh or what would we do
 
02:20:06.750 --> 02:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
potentially because this one seems to
 
02:20:09.150 --> 02:20:09.160 align:start position:0%
have another caveat to it which is the
 
02:20:12.110 --> 02:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
actual closure piece um and petitioning
 
02:20:16.270 --> 02:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
so I'm just curious right um uh my
 
02:20:20.190 --> 02:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it's the um uh
 
02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
last in
 
02:20:25.270 --> 02:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
rules basically um I know that applies
 
02:20:29.870 --> 02:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
to uh um statutes um because sometimes
 
02:20:32.429 --> 02:20:32.439 align:start position:0%
we have statutes that are in conflict
 
02:20:35.230 --> 02:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
and so when that arises it's the last
 
02:20:38.710 --> 02:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
statute um that takes uh president over
 
02:20:38.720 --> 02:20:41.230 align:start position:0%
statute um that takes uh president over
the

02:20:41.230 --> 02:20:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:43.309 --> 02:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
other any other
 
02:20:46.790 --> 02:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
questions represent bbon thank you madam
 
02:20:48.110 --> 02:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:20:50.270 --> 02:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
question if if I could just answer that
 
02:20:53.469 --> 02:20:53.479 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry right um I think that also is
 
02:20:57.150 --> 02:20:57.160 align:start position:0%
a situation that might be clarified over
 
02:21:00.030 --> 02:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
um in the uh on the other side of the
 
02:21:05.309 --> 02:21:05.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:08.830 --> 02:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
house um my question is uh I I can see
 
02:21:11.389 --> 02:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
that the the bill actually uh repeals
 
02:21:15.270 --> 02:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
the whole 184 B16 but as I'm looking at
 
02:21:18.590 --> 02:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
it uh it looks like a lot of the uh
 
02:21:21.830 --> 02:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
what's in the current one is AED and and
 
02:21:25.270 --> 02:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious if there are specific
 
02:21:26.830 --> 02:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
things that you can point to or if
 
02:21:28.710 --> 02:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
there's a side by side you see what what
 
02:21:30.950 --> 02:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
is actually being changed by the repeal
 
02:21:34.510 --> 02:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
and what's being added I I do not have
 
02:21:39.469 --> 02:21:39.479 align:start position:0%
have a rep um any kind of side by side
 
02:21:42.150 --> 02:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
um can take a look at doing something
 
02:21:45.030 --> 02:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
like that yeah I I'm just curious
 
02:21:46.870 --> 02:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
because it does go into a lot of detail
 
02:21:48.910 --> 02:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
in the current law so I'm I'm just
 
02:21:51.469 --> 02:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what's Chang in so
 
02:21:53.110 --> 02:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
it's not that I'm opposed to anything
 
02:21:54.910 --> 02:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
I'm I just try to get the specifics on
 
02:21:56.990 --> 02:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
that so thank you thank
 
02:21:59.910 --> 02:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
02:22:13.870 --> 02:22:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:16.150 --> 02:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone who would want to
 
02:22:18.070 --> 02:22:18.080 align:start position:0%

752 okay we're going to close the
hearing

02:22:23.910 --> 02:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:23.920 --> 02:22:25.910 align:start position:0%
 
is

02:22:25.910 --> 02:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:28.670 align:start position:0%
is
um

02:22:28.670 --> 02:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:51.640 --> 02:22:51.650 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:51.650 --> 02:23:10.790 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:23:10.790 --> 02:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:13.270 --> 02:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
um we're just about ready to start with
 
02:23:20.750 --> 02:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:23.190 --> 02:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
7 uh house B 763 I just wanted to

mention that um you see rep the
 
02:23:28.990 --> 02:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
representative changing a sign on the
 
02:23:33.070 --> 02:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
desk um where the witness sits um that
 
02:23:38.150 --> 02:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
is so that the camera will pick up what
 
02:23:41.670 --> 02:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
bill is in progress so someone watching
 
02:23:44.469 --> 02:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
online um wanting to look for a specific
 
02:23:47.070 --> 02:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
bill or coming into the middle of things
 
02:23:48.469 --> 02:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
um they can see what Bill we're
 
02:23:50.150 --> 02:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
testifying on and if they're looking for
 
02:23:50.160 --> 02:23:51.269 align:start position:0%
testifying on and if they're looking for
something

02:23:51.269 --> 02:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:23:54.269 --> 02:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
um another bill they can always uh fast
 
02:23:58.150 --> 02:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
forward a little bit so um yeah that's a
 
02:24:02.190 --> 02:24:02.200 align:start position:0%
uh I think a very good um new process
 
02:24:05.429 --> 02:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
that we have in place so with that um

02:24:49.670 --> 02:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
volunteer in New Hampshire there are
 
02:24:51.110 --> 02:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
about 100
 
02:24:54.590 --> 02:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
200 outof Hospital cardiac arrests every
 
02:24:57.110 --> 02:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
month according to our own Department of
 
02:24:59.510 --> 02:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
Safety uh across the United States about
 
02:25:02.590 --> 02:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
3% of those people who go uh into

cardiac arrest out of Hospital
 
02:25:08.429 --> 02:25:08.439 align:start position:0%
survive uh in New Hampshire it's
 
02:25:11.230 --> 02:25:11.240 align:start position:0%
133% and that's largely due to a lot of
 
02:25:13.469 --> 02:25:13.479 align:start position:0%
the training and CPR and the access to
 
02:25:15.670 --> 02:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
aeds that we have in the
 
02:25:18.990 --> 02:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
state next year it will be uh 50 years
 
02:25:21.990 --> 02:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
since I started teaching C CPR uh I've
 
02:25:24.349 --> 02:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
seen a lot of changes since then but the
 
02:25:26.670 --> 02:25:26.680 align:start position:0%
game Cher has been the automatic
 
02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:27.830 align:start position:0%
game Cher has been the automatic
external

02:25:27.830 --> 02:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
external
 
02:25:30.870 --> 02:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
defibrillator uh CPR circulates
 
02:25:32.910 --> 02:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
oxygenated blood and keeps brain cells
 
02:25:35.950 --> 02:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
from dying but the AED in in the right
 
02:25:38.750 --> 02:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances can start a heart again
 
02:25:40.429 --> 02:25:40.439 align:start position:0%
and that's the game
 
02:25:44.269 --> 02:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
Cher uh House Bill 763 might look
 
02:25:48.510 --> 02:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
familiar it was SE Senate Bill 379 last
 
02:25:50.750 --> 02:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
year that talked about plac
 
02:25:53.550 --> 02:25:53.560 align:start position:0%
aeds especially in accessible places
 
02:25:56.309 --> 02:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
around schools but it didn't give any
 
02:25:58.030 --> 02:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
funding for that
 
02:26:01.030 --> 02:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
mandate this bill starts by answering
 
02:26:02.790 --> 02:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
some of the questions from last year's
 
02:26:05.309 --> 02:26:05.319 align:start position:0%
hearings um and then also makes an
 
02:26:07.590 --> 02:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation so just go over the bill
 
02:26:11.990 --> 02:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
one there are italicized versions that
 
02:26:17.349 --> 02:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
talk about following evidence-based
 
02:26:20.550 --> 02:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
guidelines um and we listed not just
 
02:26:22.150 --> 02:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
American Heart Association but any
 
02:26:24.670 --> 02:26:24.680 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized organization that
 
02:26:27.550 --> 02:26:27.560 align:start position:0%
focuses on emergency cardiovascular care
 
02:26:29.710 --> 02:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
just so that there is a National
 
02:26:33.150 --> 02:26:33.160 align:start position:0%
Standard to to adhere to uh a little bit
 
02:26:35.510 --> 02:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
later on it talks about not just having
 
02:26:38.030 --> 02:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
aeds around but somebody trained in
 
02:26:41.070 --> 02:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
cardiopulmonary solicitation CPR because
 
02:26:43.870 --> 02:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
that's what really keeps the the person
 
02:26:46.910 --> 02:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
in a state where an AED might be able to
 
02:26:50.429 --> 02:26:50.439 align:start position:0%
be effective and um we had a question
 
02:26:52.710 --> 02:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
last year about if you're using an
 
02:26:54.750 --> 02:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
athletic field but are not associated
 
02:26:55.830 --> 02:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
with the school are you still
 
02:26:57.230 --> 02:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
responsible for that are they
 
02:26:59.870 --> 02:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
responsible for having a c trained
 
02:27:02.309 --> 02:27:02.319 align:start position:0%
person or an AED and that's what the
 
02:27:04.670 --> 02:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
part that says uh on fields or in
 
02:27:06.590 --> 02:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
competitions in which pupils of the
 
02:27:09.269 --> 02:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
school are participating so we thought
 
02:27:11.070 --> 02:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
that that cleared up the questions that
 
02:27:12.670 --> 02:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
we saw last
 
02:27:16.349 --> 02:27:16.359 align:start position:0%
year um the appropriation uh it followed
 
02:27:19.150 --> 02:27:19.160 align:start position:0%
kind of a a a a formula and I'm going to
 
02:27:21.630 --> 02:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
have somebody else come testify um as
 
02:27:24.389 --> 02:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
how they arrived at that number and I
 
02:27:25.910 --> 02:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
just finally want to bring up that
 
02:27:28.389 --> 02:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
representative George Sykes who I've
 
02:27:30.190 --> 02:27:30.200 align:start position:0%
worked with in emergency medicine for
 
02:27:33.070 --> 02:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
decades who was also a co-sponsor uh had
 
02:27:35.110 --> 02:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
to work today otherwise he would be in
 
02:27:37.389 --> 02:27:37.399 align:start position:0%
here um voicing his support for this
 
02:27:40.150 --> 02:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
bill just like I am with that I want to
 
02:27:41.630 --> 02:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'll be happy to answer
 
02:27:44.750 --> 02:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
any questions I do have a handout that
 
02:27:47.269 --> 02:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
shows the department of safety's um
 
02:27:49.469 --> 02:27:49.479 align:start position:0%
contract that they have with AED
 
02:27:52.110 --> 02:27:52.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturer that allows citizens and
 
02:27:54.190 --> 02:27:54.200 align:start position:0%
groups in the in state of New Hampshire
 
02:27:57.510 --> 02:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
to get reduced prices on aeds so um as
 
02:27:59.309 --> 02:27:59.319 align:start position:0%
we talk about money this is might be
 
02:28:01.389 --> 02:28:01.399 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you very much any
 
02:28:02.710 --> 02:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
02:28:04.670 --> 02:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
representative seeing none thank you
 
02:28:04.680 --> 02:28:07.990 align:start position:0%
representative seeing none thank you
very

02:28:07.990 --> 02:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:20.309 --> 02:28:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you very much um for
 
02:28:25.110 --> 02:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
um having this hearing today for the
 
02:28:26.750 --> 02:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
record I am Nancy vaugh government
 
02:28:28.349 --> 02:28:28.359 align:start position:0%
relations director for the American
 
02:28:31.710 --> 02:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
Heart Association in New Hampshire um
 
02:28:34.269 --> 02:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
and uh I know that uh we want to be able
 
02:28:36.070 --> 02:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
to get you out for some lunch before you
 
02:28:38.590 --> 02:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
come back here at 1:00 again to discuss
 
02:28:40.750 --> 02:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
this bill and some others as well um but
 
02:28:42.389 --> 02:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
again the American Heart Association as
 
02:28:45.309 --> 02:28:45.319 align:start position:0%
you can tell is um very much in support
 
02:28:48.030 --> 02:28:48.040 align:start position:0%
of this policy piece um it is part of
 
02:28:52.389 --> 02:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
our goal um that by the year 2030 that
 
02:28:54.550 --> 02:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
we actually double the survival rate
 
02:28:56.630 --> 02:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
from cardiac arrests um as
 
02:28:59.630 --> 02:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
representative dry had mentioned um we
 
02:29:01.990 --> 02:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
have um you know over 200 cardiac
 
02:29:06.469 --> 02:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
arrests a month um called through 911 so
 
02:29:09.190 --> 02:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
there there may be more than that um and
 
02:29:10.990 --> 02:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
uh and the survival rate you know at
 
02:29:13.469 --> 02:29:13.479 align:start position:0%
about 13% is actually pretty good
 
02:29:17.230 --> 02:29:17.240 align:start position:0%
nationally it's 100 it's 10% um only 10
 
02:29:20.510 --> 02:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
that that survive um and for children
 
02:29:22.910 --> 02:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
which is what this bill is really you
 
02:29:26.269 --> 02:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
know directed at um it is about a 15%
 
02:29:28.870 --> 02:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
survival rate across um the country for
 
02:29:31.950 --> 02:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
cardiac arrest which is still really low
 
02:29:33.630 --> 02:29:33.640 align:start position:0%
for young people who still have their
 
02:29:35.790 --> 02:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
lives ahead of them um I am not going to
 
02:29:39.550 --> 02:29:39.560 align:start position:0%
read you my entire testimony um uh which
 
02:29:42.429 --> 02:29:42.439 align:start position:0%
um my uh colleague has passed out to you
 
02:29:44.230 --> 02:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
attached to my testimony though there
 
02:29:47.070 --> 02:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
are also three letters from advocates
 
02:29:49.590 --> 02:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
for this policy change um who are also
 
02:29:52.990 --> 02:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
Healthcare providers and um mothers of
 
02:29:55.990 --> 02:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
um children who um are in sports and at
 
02:29:58.349 --> 02:29:58.359 align:start position:0%
least one of them that um has a
 
02:30:00.750 --> 02:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular um condition from from
 
02:30:06.349 --> 02:30:06.359 align:start position:0%
birth um so again what I wanted to um to
 
02:30:09.990 --> 02:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
address was um whatever uh questions
 
02:30:11.830 --> 02:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
that there may be around the fiscal note
 
02:30:15.670 --> 02:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
for this um the bill um formula is
 
02:30:18.389 --> 02:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
really based on a nationwide formula
 
02:30:20.910 --> 02:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
that um our organ ganization believes
 
02:30:22.670 --> 02:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
would be about
 
02:30:26.030 --> 02:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
$3,000 um per school um really
 
02:30:28.389 --> 02:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
prioritizing first High need schools the
 
02:30:31.070 --> 02:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
ones who are more financially strapped
 
02:30:34.150 --> 02:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
um but as again representative dry
 
02:30:36.750 --> 02:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
alluded to within New Hampshire's
 
02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
Department of um safety where EMS is
 
02:30:42.190 --> 02:30:42.200 align:start position:0%
there's a direct purchasing program
 
02:30:46.269 --> 02:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
where um anyone including schools um can
 
02:30:49.230 --> 02:30:49.240 align:start position:0%
um obtain an AED for about a third of
 
02:30:53.030 --> 02:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
the cost what we see nationally um so um
 
02:30:55.830 --> 02:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
there is is wiggle room um in in the
 
02:30:59.510 --> 02:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
budget um on this um and again you know
 
02:31:01.550 --> 02:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
we have um this this is directed at
 
02:31:04.910 --> 02:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
school schools that have school sports
 
02:31:07.670 --> 02:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
and um from what I understand um all of
 
02:31:09.590 --> 02:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
those schools have at least one AED if
 
02:31:12.269 --> 02:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
not multiple aeds um so we would be
 
02:31:14.349 --> 02:31:14.359 align:start position:0%
looking at um at helping out those
 
02:31:17.070 --> 02:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
school districts that um that are again
 
02:31:19.510 --> 02:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
don't have that many aeds for every
 
02:31:21.790 --> 02:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
sport event that may be going on
 
02:31:23.750 --> 02:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
concurrently within their their school
 
02:31:27.510 --> 02:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
district um so um uh any any amount of
 
02:31:29.349 --> 02:31:29.359 align:start position:0%
money that we can get for that this year
 
02:31:33.110 --> 02:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
would be terrific um and again if you uh
 
02:31:35.469 --> 02:31:35.479 align:start position:0%
do have any any questions I'm more than
 
02:31:38.230 --> 02:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
happy to to try to give that an answer
 
02:31:40.230 --> 02:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
um and again you know for this bill the
 
02:31:42.030 --> 02:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
policy piece is really to make sure that
 
02:31:46.710 --> 02:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
we emphasize that um a national standard
 
02:31:49.510 --> 02:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
for using an AED and where to place an
 
02:31:49.520 --> 02:31:50.469 align:start position:0%
for using an AED and where to place an
AED

02:31:50.469 --> 02:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
AED
 
02:31:52.790 --> 02:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
but also the CPR training one does not
 
02:31:54.790 --> 02:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
need to go through a full-fledged
 
02:31:57.389 --> 02:31:57.399 align:start position:0%
certified um CPR Course in order to
 
02:32:00.070 --> 02:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
provide effective CPR but it needs to be
 
02:32:02.870 --> 02:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
effective to save lives so thank you
 
02:32:06.670 --> 02:32:06.680 align:start position:0%
very much sure thank you very much any
 
02:32:09.710 --> 02:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent Cornell Thank
 
02:32:12.309 --> 02:32:12.319 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um thank you for taking my
 
02:32:13.670 --> 02:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
question my question is you say there's
 
02:32:16.150 --> 02:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
a 15% survival rate for children how
 
02:32:18.510 --> 02:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
many calls are there for children
 
02:32:21.269 --> 02:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
fortunately there are not that many um
 
02:32:23.150 --> 02:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
particularly in New Hampshire so um
 
02:32:24.870 --> 02:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
again my testimony will will mention
 
02:32:28.190 --> 02:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
this but of the um 350,000 cardiac
 
02:32:30.389 --> 02:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
arrests that occur across the country in
 
02:32:32.309 --> 02:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
young people we're we're looking at
 
02:32:32.319 --> 02:32:33.349 align:start position:0%
young people we're we're looking at
about

02:32:33.349 --> 02:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:32:36.349 --> 02:32:36.359 align:start position:0%
23,000 um so it is it is a a lower
 
02:32:38.950 --> 02:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
number but again it is really something
 
02:32:40.950 --> 02:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
that strikes suddenly and can be
 
02:32:43.870 --> 02:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
devastating for for families if that
 
02:32:47.110 --> 02:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
child doesn't survive yeah thank you
 
02:32:50.309 --> 02:32:50.319 align:start position:0%
very thank you good afternoon good
 
02:32:52.510 --> 02:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank thank you for yes Mar
 
02:32:54.870 --> 02:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
after thank you for taking my question
 
02:32:57.389 --> 02:32:57.399 align:start position:0%
just just Logistics um I know about last
 
02:32:59.230 --> 02:32:59.240 align:start position:0%
session on the session before some of us
 
02:33:01.309 --> 02:33:01.319 align:start position:0%
remember we talked about the 60 seconds
 
02:33:02.990 --> 02:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
getting there on the back of the little
 
02:33:04.910 --> 02:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
mobile C and those types of things but
 
02:33:07.750 --> 02:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at uh specifically on uh
 
02:33:12.070 --> 02:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
line 19 or actually 24 and through 30
 
02:33:15.510 --> 02:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
what is what is on page uh one but what
 
02:33:18.510 --> 02:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
it's talking about is the issue of
 
02:33:21.510 --> 02:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
having these in every practice ITI venue
 
02:33:24.510 --> 02:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
uh in sight I'm looking at schools that
 
02:33:27.590 --> 02:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
have multiple practice venues multiple
 
02:33:30.590 --> 02:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
fields and the way it's identified now
 
02:33:33.150 --> 02:33:33.160 align:start position:0%
it it appears to me as I read this that
 
02:33:35.830 --> 02:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
each site each practice site should have
 
02:33:35.840 --> 02:33:36.510 align:start position:0%
each site each practice site should have
an

02:33:36.510 --> 02:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
an
 
02:33:40.190 --> 02:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
AED um and which which seems
 
02:33:42.030 --> 02:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
significally different before than we
 
02:33:43.870 --> 02:33:43.880 align:start position:0%
were talking about the access time to an
 
02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
ad because if you're in a a grade six
 
02:33:50.630 --> 02:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
field 6 to 10 middle school high school
 
02:33:52.550 --> 02:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
there may be seven or eight nine Fields
 
02:33:55.670 --> 02:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
there so each practice site clearly is
 
02:33:57.870 --> 02:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
not going to have I don't I don't like
 
02:34:00.030 --> 02:34:00.040 align:start position:0%
it's yeah let me let me try to address
 
02:34:02.190 --> 02:34:02.200 align:start position:0%
this so the guidelines that the American
 
02:34:04.389 --> 02:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
Heart Association you know comes up with
 
02:34:06.389 --> 02:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
we do this every five years reviewing it
 
02:34:09.190 --> 02:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
you know looking at the the best case
 
02:34:11.510 --> 02:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
scenario to get the best outcomes from
 
02:34:13.870 --> 02:34:13.880 align:start position:0%
cardiac arrests they are looking at that
 
02:34:16.670 --> 02:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
that AED to be by the side of the person
 
02:34:19.429 --> 02:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
in Cardiac Arrest within a few minutes
 
02:34:21.030 --> 02:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
so last year we talked about one to
 
02:34:22.870 --> 02:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
three minutes which seemed really
 
02:34:25.389 --> 02:34:25.399 align:start position:0%
regimented um again it is it is within
 
02:34:27.750 --> 02:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
minutes because every minute that goes
 
02:34:30.870 --> 02:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
by without having an AED there is less
 
02:34:33.429 --> 02:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
of a chance of that person being able to
 
02:34:36.070 --> 02:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
survive so again following the
 
02:34:38.030 --> 02:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines that the American Heart
 
02:34:39.990 --> 02:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
Association develops and that many
 
02:34:41.510 --> 02:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
organizations use as part of their
 
02:34:43.870 --> 02:34:43.880 align:start position:0%
training this is discussed and gone over
 
02:34:46.710 --> 02:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
with people who are obtaining
 
02:34:50.910 --> 02:34:50.920 align:start position:0%
aeds so follow up thank you so the
 
02:34:53.870 --> 02:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
so the specificity in the bill which
 
02:34:55.750 --> 02:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
talks about at each site you though
 
02:34:57.230 --> 02:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
mention the
 
02:34:58.990 --> 02:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines just seems to be kind of
 
02:35:00.230 --> 02:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
conflicting that's all I understand the
 
02:35:02.150 --> 02:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
guidelines in the transport but I'm also
 
02:35:04.190 --> 02:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
looking at which say each each single
 
02:35:07.510 --> 02:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
site um you have multiple sites in in
 
02:35:09.269 --> 02:35:09.279 align:start position:0%
you know in the middle schools don't
 
02:35:10.550 --> 02:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
have a trainer typically they're going
 
02:35:12.309 --> 02:35:12.319 align:start position:0%
have a radio or every coach have radio
 
02:35:14.469 --> 02:35:14.479 align:start position:0%
and call back right that's that's it's a
 
02:35:17.110 --> 02:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
concern and if if the fields are are
 
02:35:20.309 --> 02:35:20.319 align:start position:0%
situated you know next to one another
 
02:35:22.630 --> 02:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
that might be one device might be all
 
02:35:24.830 --> 02:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
that they need in order to get that um
 
02:35:27.190 --> 02:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
device to this the person if it's a
 
02:35:28.750 --> 02:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
school district where there's fields
 
02:35:31.030 --> 02:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
that are in multiple locations yes well
 
02:35:33.510 --> 02:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
that would be a drive in order to get to
 
02:35:35.550 --> 02:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
get that Eed to the person so that that
 
02:35:38.150 --> 02:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
would be the recommendation for for that
 
02:35:41.950 --> 02:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
scenario would be for an AED to be
 
02:35:44.910 --> 02:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
there so but this p and exactly it's
 
02:35:46.309 --> 02:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
exactly what I'm talking about we have
 
02:35:49.030 --> 02:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
multiple sites over a school area or off
 
02:35:51.150 --> 02:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
campus yeah that's that's exactly what
 
02:35:52.990 --> 02:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about this said there must
 
02:35:57.070 --> 02:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
be an a there because that's um in 25
 
02:35:58.990 --> 02:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
each each practice I will have them
 
02:36:00.349 --> 02:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
that's all just look at the logistics of
 
02:36:03.150 --> 02:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
it I have no problem with the concept
 
02:36:05.190 --> 02:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
that's all because it's y now you're
 
02:36:07.510 --> 02:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
looking at a local a local soccer field
 
02:36:09.750 --> 02:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
five miles away from the school and then
 
02:36:12.510 --> 02:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
the school has the main things so it
 
02:36:15.070 --> 02:36:15.080 align:start position:0%
what happens that's y but again this is
 
02:36:16.790 --> 02:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
really in order to Save a Life you would
 
02:36:18.990 --> 02:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
need to have an AED within you know
 
02:36:21.510 --> 02:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
moments of being able to get to that
 
02:36:24.269 --> 02:36:24.279 align:start position:0%
person okay and it doesn't mean you
 
02:36:26.110 --> 02:36:26.120 align:start position:0%
can't save the life but I'm just saying
 
02:36:29.190 --> 02:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
that that yeah that yeah and I may not
 
02:36:30.990 --> 02:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
understand your question but um but it
 
02:36:33.750 --> 02:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
is okay thank you R
 
02:36:35.870 --> 02:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:36:37.750 --> 02:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
for coming in front of us in the event
 
02:36:40.870 --> 02:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
of a kiac event and an AED is two to
 
02:36:44.269 --> 02:36:44.279 align:start position:0%
three minutes away can CPI be administ
 
02:36:45.670 --> 02:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
well this is also part of that
 
02:36:47.309 --> 02:36:47.319 align:start position:0%
evidence-based training thank you very
 
02:36:50.030 --> 02:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
much for that question um when
 
02:36:53.110 --> 02:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
CPR is given without an AED that chance
 
02:36:56.230 --> 02:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
of survival goes up it should be
 
02:36:58.230 --> 02:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
effective CPR and so that's where you
 
02:37:00.590 --> 02:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
may have heard about the you know um the
 
02:37:03.150 --> 02:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
100 beats per minute that's 100 pushes
 
02:37:05.550 --> 02:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
on the chest per minute um so this is
 
02:37:08.150 --> 02:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
where a training or an orientation to
 
02:37:10.990 --> 02:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
CPR that's not a certified training um
 
02:37:13.990 --> 02:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
would get to but when you add the AED to
 
02:37:16.469 --> 02:37:16.479 align:start position:0%
it then you really raise um that that
 
02:37:18.349 --> 02:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
survival more like doubling the chance
 
02:37:20.110 --> 02:37:20.120 align:start position:0%
of survival yeah
 
02:37:21.710 --> 02:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank
 
02:37:25.230 --> 02:37:25.240 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative U
 
02:37:27.309 --> 02:37:27.319 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
02:37:28.710 --> 02:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question and this is just more
 
02:37:31.389 --> 02:37:31.399 align:start position:0%
of an education piece on my end are
 
02:37:34.349 --> 02:37:34.359 align:start position:0%
there pediatric AED devices versus adult
 
02:37:36.230 --> 02:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
ones or are they all programm the same
 
02:37:39.750 --> 02:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
to to read the heart rhythms yes that
 
02:37:42.070 --> 02:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
you don't need to have a special a they
 
02:37:45.070 --> 02:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
they actually do the diagnosing on
 
02:37:47.070 --> 02:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
whoever the person is in cardiac arrest
 
02:37:50.070 --> 02:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
and would know what you know yeah great
 
02:37:52.950 --> 02:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you represent bony thank
 
02:37:54.429 --> 02:37:54.439 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:37:57.710 --> 02:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
question I'm just curious it does say um
 
02:37:59.070 --> 02:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
right at the beginning that it applies
 
02:38:01.670 --> 02:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
to school districts the governing and
 
02:38:03.190 --> 02:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
non-public schools but there's nothing
 
02:38:05.590 --> 02:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
in it in terms of public charter schools
 
02:38:07.389 --> 02:38:07.399 align:start position:0%
and we've been told oftentimes that if
 
02:38:09.670 --> 02:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say that it applies to public
 
02:38:11.910 --> 02:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
charter schools that it should would you
 
02:38:15.070 --> 02:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
have any objection to including public
 
02:38:18.389 --> 02:38:18.399 align:start position:0%
we have yeah I'm sorry um yes no we
 
02:38:20.630 --> 02:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
would have no objection to adding that
 
02:38:22.510 --> 02:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
my my thinking by saying public would
 
02:38:23.910 --> 02:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
include Charter Schools but if you're
 
02:38:25.830 --> 02:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
saying it needs to be more specific
 
02:38:28.830 --> 02:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
that's not a problem yes thank you so
 
02:38:31.309 --> 02:38:31.319 align:start position:0%
much see no further questions thank you
 
02:38:33.150 --> 02:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
very much for being here this morning
 
02:38:35.630 --> 02:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
and for your uh
 
02:38:38.469 --> 02:38:38.479 align:start position:0%
testimony and with that we'll close the
 
02:38:41.990 --> 02:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
session the hearing on House Bill
 
02:38:45.510 --> 02:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
763 and um we'll break for lunch and
 
02:38:52.230 --> 02:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:53.950 --> 02:38:53.960 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we're
 
02:38:56.469 --> 02:38:56.479 align:start position:0%
going to CAU some more at lunchtime
 
02:38:56.479 --> 02:38:57.950 align:start position:0%
going to CAU some more at lunchtime
ourselves

02:38:57.950 --> 02:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
02:39:08.190 --> 02:39:08.200 align:start position:0%

paperwork um glitch um and it never made
 
04:47:32.470 --> 04:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
it over to the um to the uh clerk's
 
04:47:37.310 --> 04:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
office so we need to um re

04:47:46.350 --> 04:47:46.360 align:start position:0%
representative Noble for a motion this
 
04:47:49.990 --> 04:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
is a bill to prohibit bullying in
 
04:47:52.548 --> 04:47:52.558 align:start position:0%
schools I move
 
04:47:56.070 --> 04:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:59.030 --> 04:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
second oh I'm sorry yes you're right no
 
04:48:02.990 --> 04:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
no no it no no this is this is just a
 
04:48:05.788 --> 04:48:05.798 align:start position:0%
straight revote because it um
 
04:48:10.190 --> 04:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
never never had y right no we got
 
04:48:11.670 --> 04:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
confused in another bill where we do
 
04:48:12.430 --> 04:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
want to
 
04:48:17.470 --> 04:48:17.480 align:start position:0%
reconsider um so um so the motion is to
 
04:48:20.270 --> 04:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
itl and is there a second second second
 
04:48:22.150 --> 04:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
from representative
 
04:48:25.510 --> 04:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
Woodcock um any further
 
04:48:27.750 --> 04:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
discussion um
 
04:48:32.470 --> 04:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
sure so I think we all agreed that um
 
04:48:34.830 --> 04:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
the section on um child in need of
 
04:48:37.548 --> 04:48:37.558 align:start position:0%
services maybe went a little bit too far
 
04:48:40.830 --> 04:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
and that the um bullying officer wasn't
 
04:48:42.150 --> 04:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
very well
 
04:48:42.160 --> 04:48:43.868 align:start position:0%
very well
defined

04:48:43.868 --> 04:48:43.878 align:start position:0%
defined
 
04:48:46.750 --> 04:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
um and it's it is possible that we could
 
04:48:50.030 --> 04:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
use um some other sections in this bill
 
04:48:52.070 --> 04:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
to bring into another bullying bill that
 
04:48:53.510 --> 04:48:53.520 align:start position:0%

discussion representa
 
04:51:01.270 --> 04:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
lville I just simply feel that this is
 
04:51:03.910 --> 04:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
an anti-liberty bill um as it is now
 
04:51:05.910 --> 04:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
it's an elected position and I feel that
 
04:51:08.350 --> 04:51:08.360 align:start position:0%
it should continue to be that
 
04:51:11.230 --> 04:51:11.240 align:start position:0%
way represent Freeman
 
04:51:13.590 --> 04:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I feel these
 
04:51:15.628 --> 04:51:15.638 align:start position:0%
decisions are better left to the um the
 
04:51:18.990 --> 04:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
local governments and um it's never a
 
04:51:21.510 --> 04:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
good idea when the state begins to push
 
04:51:24.350 --> 04:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
down um these types of edicts so I'd
 
04:51:25.948 --> 04:51:25.958 align:start position:0%
rather leave it up to the local
 
04:51:28.070 --> 04:51:28.080 align:start position:0%

chairman cordelli may I ask you a
 
04:58:16.670 --> 04:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
question yes learning moment if there if

it's on consent Can it have a majority
 
04:58:21.070 --> 04:58:21.080 align:start position:0%
and a Minority Report so that's what's
 
04:58:23.510 --> 04:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
driving it not being on
 
04:58:25.350 --> 04:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
consent right and I think there's a
 
04:58:28.788 --> 04:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
question about three being on consent
 
04:58:32.948 --> 04:58:32.958 align:start position:0%
three in in opposition we
 
04:58:36.230 --> 04:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
had yeah
 
04:58:39.190 --> 04:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
okay yes clarification so if there was
 
04:58:41.190 --> 04:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
two it could go
 
04:58:45.670 --> 04:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:51.310 --> 04:58:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:54.868 --> 04:58:54.878 align:start position:0%
yeah yes it has to
 
04:59:00.150 --> 04:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:00.160 --> 04:59:01.788 align:start position:0%
 
right

with the original uh original bill in
 
05:10:08.788 --> 05:10:08.798 align:start position:0%

05:10:20.120 --> 05:10:21.270 align:start position:0%

being

05:10:21.270 --> 05:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:10:24.788 --> 05:10:24.798 align:start position:0%
involved um this
 
05:10:28.788 --> 05:10:28.798 align:start position:0%
simplifies things by repeating much of
 
05:10:32.070 --> 05:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
what is in uh statute and rules related
 
05:10:34.430 --> 05:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
to the health curriculum and in the
 
05:10:37.110 --> 05:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
standards uh that the curriculum shall
 
05:10:38.910 --> 05:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
be age appropriate and medically
 
05:10:38.920 --> 05:10:39.750 align:start position:0%
be age appropriate and medically
accurate

05:10:39.750 --> 05:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
05:10:42.470 --> 05:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
it um it should
 
05:10:44.948 --> 05:10:44.958 align:start position:0%
provide information on abstinence
 
05:10:47.590 --> 05:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
adoption healthy relationships and human
 
05:10:50.230 --> 05:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
growth and development and include a
 
05:10:53.230 --> 05:10:53.240 align:start position:0%
high include a presentation of high
 
05:10:56.230 --> 05:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
quality computer generated animation or
 
05:10:57.868 --> 05:10:57.878 align:start position:0%
ultrasound video that shows the
 
05:10:59.628 --> 05:10:59.638 align:start position:0%
development of the heart brain and other
 
05:11:02.070 --> 05:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
vital organs in the early fetal
 
05:11:06.830 --> 05:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
development um I think it's important um
 
05:11:10.350 --> 05:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of health and uh sexual
 
05:11:14.230 --> 05:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
education uh to see the development of
 
05:11:20.830 --> 05:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:20.840 --> 05:11:22.788 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:11:22.788 --> 05:11:22.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:29.788 --> 05:11:29.798 align:start position:0%
uh with uh um my uh grandson um born
 
05:11:33.628 --> 05:11:33.638 align:start position:0%
missing part of his heart it was um very
 
05:11:37.070 --> 05:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
interesting to talk with the surgeons
 
05:11:40.270 --> 05:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
and all about um development and the
 
05:11:42.948 --> 05:11:42.958 align:start position:0%
development of the heart and look and
 
05:11:47.868 --> 05:11:47.878 align:start position:0%
see um why um one chamber of his heart
 
05:11:49.150 --> 05:11:49.160 align:start position:0%
uh never
 
05:11:49.160 --> 05:11:50.830 align:start position:0%
uh never
developed

05:11:50.830 --> 05:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
developed
 
05:11:54.230 --> 05:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
um so I I think that
 
05:11:59.910 --> 05:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
um it's important uh to see this um but
 
05:12:03.270 --> 05:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
I also feel it inappropriate to specify
 
05:12:06.990 --> 05:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
the name of any one particular
 
05:12:15.110 --> 05:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:16.310 --> 05:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
I can agree with pretty much everything
 
05:12:19.230 --> 05:12:19.240 align:start position:0%
that chairman cordelli mentioned um my
 
05:12:21.548 --> 05:12:21.558 align:start position:0%
only disagreement would be the single
 
05:12:23.788 --> 05:12:23.798 align:start position:0%
comment of a fetus for instance because
 
05:12:26.150 --> 05:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
to me it's a human life so seeing the
 
05:12:27.990 --> 05:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
development of a baby developing within
 
05:12:29.430 --> 05:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
a womb
 
05:12:32.350 --> 05:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
is to me
 
05:12:34.788 --> 05:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
important any other discussion
 
05:12:34.798 --> 05:12:35.910 align:start position:0%

wock thank you madam chair I um

I appreciate the the amendment um by
 
05:12:46.708 --> 05:12:46.718 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli in trying to make a
 
05:12:50.270 --> 05:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
bad Bill less bad but I I I I am con I
 
05:12:53.510 --> 05:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
am concerned that uh we are dictating to
 
05:12:55.990 --> 05:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
Local Schools exactly what they already
 
05:12:59.030 --> 05:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
know now which is they have a health uh
 
05:13:00.590 --> 05:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
curriculum that's taught by professional
 
05:13:02.430 --> 05:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
trained people they make up the
 
05:13:04.350 --> 05:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
curriculum these parts are covered
 
05:13:06.350 --> 05:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
between biology and the health education
 
05:13:08.270 --> 05:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
program who are the professionals and
 
05:13:11.590 --> 05:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
for us to start speculate and spec me
 
05:13:14.390 --> 05:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
specify uh videos even though we didn't
 
05:13:17.390 --> 05:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
identify um a particular
 
05:13:19.910 --> 05:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
video the other part of this I
 
05:13:21.470 --> 05:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
understand we went into the the
 
05:13:24.548 --> 05:13:24.558 align:start position:0%
automated U characteristic recording but
 
05:13:26.110 --> 05:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
there still allows for the video
 
05:13:29.830 --> 05:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
recording uh which was beyond that so I
 
05:13:32.350 --> 05:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
I just think this pill is is um Way
 
05:13:35.070 --> 05:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
Beyond way beyond our scope of of
 
05:13:37.190 --> 05:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
authority uh and we shouldn't be
 
05:13:40.230 --> 05:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
dictating local curricula
 
05:13:48.070 --> 05:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:51.070 --> 05:13:51.080 align:start position:0%

chair um I I want to pass that well I

don't want to but um I I think this is
 
05:18:40.190 --> 05:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
really one of those really Common Sense
 
05:18:41.350 --> 05:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
pieces of
 
05:18:44.030 --> 05:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
legislation um that will definitely put
 
05:18:45.910 --> 05:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
some parameters and some rules around
 
05:18:48.430 --> 05:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
procedures for closing of a chat school
 
05:18:51.350 --> 05:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
and increasing um transparency as well
 
05:18:53.190 --> 05:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
as accountability to anything that does
 
05:18:56.150 --> 05:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
occur around that
 
05:18:59.430 --> 05:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
closing represent Harry I have nothing
 
05:19:01.270 --> 05:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
to add I'm in complete agreement with uh
 
05:19:04.948 --> 05:19:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:07.590 --> 05:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
advocacy uh is there any further
 
05:19:10.350 --> 05:19:10.360 align:start position:0%
discussion representative wood
 
05:19:12.070 --> 05:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just want to
 
05:19:14.430 --> 05:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
reiterate what I did this morning during
 
05:19:16.030 --> 05:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
the the dialogue uh when it was
 
05:19:18.590 --> 05:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
presented I have concerns I I appreciate
 
05:19:19.910 --> 05:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
the fact it's much clearer than it was
 
05:19:21.510 --> 05:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
before but I do have concerns about the
 
05:19:23.868 --> 05:19:23.878 align:start position:0%
electronic transport of information when
 
05:19:25.470 --> 05:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
some of these documents are written by
 
05:19:27.150 --> 05:19:27.160 align:start position:0%
hand it's not clear how they're going to
 
05:19:32.030 --> 05:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
get there thank you represent
 
05:19:35.390 --> 05:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
B thank you um just
 
05:19:38.270 --> 05:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
clarifications there seems to be typo in
 
05:19:41.788 --> 05:19:41.798 align:start position:0%
here and I don't think it matters um
 
05:19:43.470 --> 05:19:43.480 align:start position:0%
actually that's my question it's very
 
05:19:47.910 --> 05:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
minor if you look on uh page two uh 28
 
05:19:49.590 --> 05:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
it says the department shall provide
 
05:19:52.390 --> 05:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
information on its website about how the
 
05:19:54.788 --> 05:19:54.798 align:start position:0%
request student or personal records I
 
05:19:59.270 --> 05:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:01.788 --> 05:20:01.798 align:start position:0%
two and the other question would be it
 
05:20:03.548 --> 05:20:03.558 align:start position:0%
references the department so I'm
 
05:20:06.628 --> 05:20:06.638 align:start position:0%
assuming that um somewhere in a prior
 
05:20:09.070 --> 05:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
paragraph it says that's the Department
 
05:20:09.080 --> 05:20:10.788 align:start position:0%
paragraph it says that's the Department
of

05:20:10.788 --> 05:20:10.798 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:20:13.910 --> 05:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
Education um yes I I think probably the
 
05:20:16.548 --> 05:20:16.558 align:start position:0%
um enrollment process can change the
 
05:20:18.750 --> 05:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
word the to
 
05:20:22.510 --> 05:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
two um and uh yeah generally in the
 
05:20:25.030 --> 05:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
education statutes um department is
 
05:20:31.070 --> 05:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:35.390 --> 05:20:35.400 align:start position:0%

Amendment with very little notice to
 
05:25:23.670 --> 05:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
really take a deep dive into it there's
 
05:25:25.470 --> 05:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
several legal references that have been
 
05:25:28.750 --> 05:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
changed in the document and I don't see
 
05:25:30.430 --> 05:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
anybody from me that the department of
 
05:25:33.830 --> 05:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
the special education's advocate here to
 
05:25:36.708 --> 05:25:36.718 align:start position:0%
ask questions of so I'm wondering if um
 
05:25:39.310 --> 05:25:39.320 align:start position:0%
the committee would consider holding it
 
05:25:41.390 --> 05:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
so we could get some of those answers
 
05:25:50.948 --> 05:25:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:53.430 --> 05:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
changes um if if you want to continue on
 
05:25:56.230 --> 05:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
discussion I believe I had an email from
 
05:25:58.910 --> 05:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
the special ed director I'll see if I
 
05:26:02.190 --> 05:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:05.270 --> 05:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
that so can we hold it and maybe put it
 
05:26:08.590 --> 05:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
on um another like Wednesday or just to
 
05:26:11.070 --> 05:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
give a little bit more time so that um
 
05:26:14.390 --> 05:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
somebody could answer those questions in
 
05:26:16.948 --> 05:26:16.958 align:start position:0%
person I I don't know if they would be
 
05:26:20.270 --> 05:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
available in person um but I can uh try
 
05:26:22.830 --> 05:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
and give you copies of the document the
 
05:26:25.190 --> 05:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
email from the
 
05:26:27.350 --> 05:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
director that would be helpful would it
 
05:26:30.430 --> 05:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
be also okay if we could ask U Becky
 
05:26:32.548 --> 05:26:32.558 align:start position:0%

05:26:35.590 --> 05:26:35.600 align:start position:0%

the add to this is is that um the school
 
05:38:16.548 --> 05:38:16.558 align:start position:0%
district shall adopt a policy
 
05:38:18.548 --> 05:38:18.558 align:start position:0%
prohibiting a school district Personnel
 
05:38:20.230 --> 05:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
from transporting a mining or
 
05:38:22.868 --> 05:38:22.878 align:start position:0%
accompanying a miner during transport
 
05:38:25.470 --> 05:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
except emergency transport for a medical
 
05:38:28.390 --> 05:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
appointment mental uh mental health
 
05:38:30.590 --> 05:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
appointment or a visit that includes any
 
05:38:32.270 --> 05:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
type of mental health evaluation
 
05:38:34.830 --> 05:38:34.840 align:start position:0%
treatment or counseling or any other
 
05:38:36.750 --> 05:38:36.760 align:start position:0%
health related appointment or visit
 
05:38:38.590 --> 05:38:38.600 align:start position:0%
without the know know and approval of
 
05:38:41.468 --> 05:38:41.478 align:start position:0%
the Minor's parent or gly unless he or
 
05:38:44.468 --> 05:38:44.478 align:start position:0%
she is following a published School
 
05:38:47.390 --> 05:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
District emergency health or medical
 
05:38:51.830 --> 05:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
emergency protocol or policy um so it is
 
05:38:54.270 --> 05:38:54.280 align:start position:0%
designed to protect both the minor and
 
05:38:57.430 --> 05:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
the school Personnel um first we need to
 
05:38:59.390 --> 05:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
make sure that districts have in place a
 
05:39:02.590 --> 05:39:02.600 align:start position:0%
policy for emergent situation I'm a
 
05:39:05.990 --> 05:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
retired intensive care nurse um so I
 
05:39:08.110 --> 05:39:08.120 align:start position:0%
went to two different school districts
 
05:39:10.910 --> 05:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
and ask for their policies for emergent
 
05:39:13.390 --> 05:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
things because this is separating
 
05:39:17.548 --> 05:39:17.558 align:start position:0%
emergent from other things so um and I
 
05:39:20.270 --> 05:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
did find that neither of them had
 
05:39:24.468 --> 05:39:24.478 align:start position:0%
policies um on emergent by emerging I
 
05:39:27.788 --> 05:39:27.798 align:start position:0%
mean the kid that falls off the off the
 
05:39:30.708 --> 05:39:30.718 align:start position:0%
swing and it's it falls and its head is
 
05:39:34.030 --> 05:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
uh bleeding and they're unconscious or
 
05:39:37.350 --> 05:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
um that type of emergent thing so in
 
05:39:40.430 --> 05:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
speaking to the business office at um my
 
05:39:43.110 --> 05:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
SAU they said well we have a policy for
 
05:39:45.948 --> 05:39:45.958 align:start position:0%
transport that that uh you know you call
 
05:39:47.548 --> 05:39:47.558 align:start position:0%
the nurse and if the nurse isn't
 
05:39:49.190 --> 05:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
available you get in touch with the
 
05:39:52.230 --> 05:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
administrator so you know I did explain
 
05:39:54.230 --> 05:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
that what I meant was you know Well
 
05:39:56.468 --> 05:39:56.478 align:start position:0%
everybody's trained in that and I said
 
05:39:58.070 --> 05:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
well trained in that is different than
 
05:40:00.830 --> 05:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
having a policy so I did get the policy
 
05:40:02.830 --> 05:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
from my district and another the one
 
05:40:05.868 --> 05:40:05.878 align:start position:0%
from my district is date it's under um
 
05:40:07.628 --> 05:40:07.638 align:start position:0%
the care the role of the school nurse
 
05:40:10.990 --> 05:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
and it's B dated 2008 so they will be
 
05:40:14.150 --> 05:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
updating that but first we need to make
 
05:40:16.468 --> 05:40:16.478 align:start position:0%
sure that they have some type of policy
 
05:40:19.030 --> 05:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
in effect for that not just training but
 
05:40:24.628 --> 05:40:24.638 align:start position:0%
a policy um so um I found and as I say I
 
05:40:26.468 --> 05:40:26.478 align:start position:0%
found that their only requirements were
 
05:40:29.110 --> 05:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
under health and Define the school nurse
 
05:40:31.390 --> 05:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
and it was dated uh times have changed
 
05:40:34.670 --> 05:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
since 2008 um this bill would expand an
 
05:40:36.830 --> 05:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
injury or illness policy to make it
 
05:40:36.840 --> 05:40:37.910 align:start position:0%
injury or illness policy to make it
clear

05:40:37.910 --> 05:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
clear
 
05:40:40.190 --> 05:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
that the responsibility for transport is
 
05:40:42.070 --> 05:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
in the hands of the parent or the
 
05:40:44.788 --> 05:40:44.798 align:start position:0%
guardian and not the responsibility of
 
05:40:47.510 --> 05:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
school Personnel it also puts into place
 
05:40:49.910 --> 05:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
the need for the school district to have
 
05:40:53.750 --> 05:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
a strong policy defining the emergent uh
 
05:40:55.750 --> 05:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
health or mental health incident
 
05:40:58.788 --> 05:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
protocol so that the state staff are all
 
05:41:01.270 --> 05:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
clear on what their expectations are in
 
05:41:04.990 --> 05:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
those cases and I think that's very very
 
05:41:08.070 --> 05:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
clear because um you need to know what
 
05:41:10.548 --> 05:41:10.558 align:start position:0%
your expectations are and what your
 
05:41:13.868 --> 05:41:13.878 align:start position:0%
limitations are so as I say this is to
 
05:41:17.990 --> 05:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
protect the children as well as um to uh
 
05:41:20.430 --> 05:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
protect the staff from being put into a
 
05:41:23.270 --> 05:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
situation where they really don't know
 
05:41:26.310 --> 05:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
um what their responsibility is or what
 
05:41:29.430 --> 05:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
they should do so with that I I'm
 
05:41:32.628 --> 05:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:35.910 --> 05:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for presenting your
 
05:41:40.310 --> 05:41:40.320 align:start position:0%

05:41:44.590 --> 05:41:44.600 align:start position:0%

um no
 
05:41:58.548 --> 05:41:58.558 align:start position:0%
cards there there's no other uh cards
 
05:42:01.110 --> 05:42:01.120 align:start position:0%

represent Bon uh thank you um in our
 
06:04:15.590 --> 06:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
discussion it was we we notice that it
 
06:04:17.590 --> 06:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
requires school districts to adopt a
 
06:04:19.230 --> 06:04:19.240 align:start position:0%
policy but it doesn't have anything
 
06:04:22.310 --> 06:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
about applying to public charter schools
 
06:04:23.948 --> 06:04:23.958 align:start position:0%
and I bring this up because we've been
 
06:04:26.230 --> 06:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
told that if there is a policy that we
 
06:04:28.548 --> 06:04:28.558 align:start position:0%
want to be applied to public charter
 
06:04:31.150 --> 06:04:31.160 align:start position:0%

06:07:58.628 --> 06:07:58.638 align:start position:0%
which is House Bill
 
06:08:01.948 --> 06:08:01.958 align:start position:0%
555 relative to the required Holocaust
 
06:08:04.390 --> 06:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
and genocide study requirements for an
 
06:08:06.548 --> 06:08:06.558 align:start position:0%
adequate public educ
 
06:08:08.788 --> 06:08:08.798 align:start position:0%
and representative Reed is all ready to
 
06:08:10.990 --> 06:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
go thank you representative thank you Mr
 
06:08:12.830 --> 06:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you honorable members of
 
06:08:14.788 --> 06:08:14.798 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
06:08:17.468 --> 06:08:17.478 align:start position:0%
Ellen Reed I represent Rockingham 10
 
06:08:20.230 --> 06:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
which is New Market and new fields and
 
06:08:23.070 --> 06:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
before I begin my testimony I did email
 
06:08:25.910 --> 06:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
the committee um I've also passed out
 
06:08:30.230 --> 06:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
the uh Amendment before you and while
 
06:08:32.830 --> 06:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
all of my testimony will in fact be on
 
06:08:35.750 --> 06:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
the bill the the intent of the the bill
 
06:08:37.350 --> 06:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
and the intent of the amendment are the
 
06:08:38.910 --> 06:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
same so it's it's largely the same
 
06:08:42.948 --> 06:08:42.958 align:start position:0%
testimony anyway I wanted um to
 
06:08:45.430 --> 06:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
circumvent this hearing becoming a
 
06:08:48.150 --> 06:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
4-Hour heated debate about which
 
06:08:50.750 --> 06:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
historical incident does or does not
 
06:08:53.350 --> 06:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
constitute genocide and so the the
 
06:08:55.110 --> 06:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
primary change in the amendment before
 
06:08:58.230 --> 06:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
you is look I'm just a representative
 
06:09:01.030 --> 06:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
from New Market I have a master's degree
 
06:09:03.468 --> 06:09:03.478 align:start position:0%
and and what have you and and um I've
 
06:09:06.628 --> 06:09:06.638 align:start position:0%
researched um this issue sadly
 
06:09:09.110 --> 06:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
extensively but there are people in the
 
06:09:12.510 --> 06:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
world who have um studied and argued
 
06:09:14.948 --> 06:09:14.958 align:start position:0%
over this topic more hours than we could
 
06:09:16.948 --> 06:09:16.958 align:start position:0%
possibly dedicate and have more
 
06:09:18.350 --> 06:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
expertise than all the people in this
 
06:09:21.468 --> 06:09:21.478 align:start position:0%
room combined um and those people are
 
06:09:24.788 --> 06:09:24.798 align:start position:0%
primarily uh members of of the United
 
06:09:27.190 --> 06:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
Nations International court of justice
 
06:09:29.830 --> 06:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
and international criminal court and
 
06:09:31.990 --> 06:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
they are the ones that adjudicate what
 
06:09:33.750 --> 06:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
is what Constitution gen aside and what
 
06:09:36.270 --> 06:09:36.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't and so the amendment for
 
06:09:39.468 --> 06:09:39.478 align:start position:0%
you takes out of my hands the idea of
 
06:09:41.230 --> 06:09:41.240 align:start position:0%
what is a genocide and what isn't and
 
06:09:43.830 --> 06:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
and puts it where it
 
06:09:43.840 --> 06:09:45.390 align:start position:0%
and puts it where it
belongs

06:09:45.390 --> 06:09:45.400 align:start position:0%
belongs
 
06:09:48.150 --> 06:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
so the reason I don't want that to be
 
06:09:50.390 --> 06:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
this hearing arguing about the specifics
 
06:09:52.468 --> 06:09:52.478 align:start position:0%
of any particular historical incident or
 
06:09:55.310 --> 06:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
conflict is because that's not the point
 
06:09:57.628 --> 06:09:57.638 align:start position:0%
and while we can all disagree very
 
06:10:00.788 --> 06:10:00.798 align:start position:0%
vehemently on particulars of of specific
 
06:10:03.750 --> 06:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
incidents I I would be hardpressed to
 
06:10:05.548 --> 06:10:05.558 align:start position:0%
imagine anyone in this room really
 
06:10:07.468 --> 06:10:07.478 align:start position:0%
anywhere disagreeing with the intent of
 
06:10:07.478 --> 06:10:09.628 align:start position:0%
anywhere disagreeing with the intent of
the

06:10:09.628 --> 06:10:09.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:10:13.310 --> 06:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
bill this the Genesis of this
 
06:10:16.628 --> 06:10:16.638 align:start position:0%
bill is as you know the word genocide
 
06:10:18.110 --> 06:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
has become more popular in the last
 
06:10:21.070 --> 06:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
couple of years and upon first hearing
 
06:10:24.110 --> 06:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
it it's kind of shocking and rightfully
 
06:10:27.230 --> 06:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
so right it's the mother of all evils
 
06:10:28.628 --> 06:10:28.638 align:start position:0%
it's the worst of the worst that
 
06:10:30.350 --> 06:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
Humanity has to
 
06:10:34.110 --> 06:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
offer and it raised the question well
 
06:10:35.990 --> 06:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
what is a genocide
 
06:10:37.548 --> 06:10:37.558 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you I'm one of the most
 
06:10:42.070 --> 06:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
prolific legislators here I put in 14 16
 
06:10:44.830 --> 06:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
roughly bills a gear and I research all
 
06:10:46.750 --> 06:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
of those bills extensively and I have
 
06:10:49.510 --> 06:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
never had such a hard time researching a
 
06:10:52.190 --> 06:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
topic as I have had researching this
 
06:10:53.948 --> 06:10:53.958 align:start position:0%
because as much as I thought well of
 
06:10:56.510 --> 06:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
course we know what genocide is when you
 
06:10:58.868 --> 06:10:58.878 align:start position:0%
actually look into it and the things
 
06:11:00.670 --> 06:11:00.680 align:start position:0%
that comprise
 
06:11:03.110 --> 06:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
genocide I had to take breaks every few
 
06:11:04.468 --> 06:11:04.478 align:start position:0%
minutes if I was reading about
 
06:11:06.948 --> 06:11:06.958 align:start position:0%
particular practice is because it is
 
06:11:09.110 --> 06:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely gut-wrenching You're Not a
 
06:11:12.670 --> 06:11:12.680 align:start position:0%
Human Being if you don't react strongly
 
06:11:15.990 --> 06:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
to researching this topic so I did start
 
06:11:18.510 --> 06:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
researching it because when I was in
 
06:11:20.230 --> 06:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
school the reason it was I think so
 
06:11:22.270 --> 06:11:22.280 align:start position:0%
shocking to hear the word being used
 
06:11:24.070 --> 06:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
again when I was in
 
06:11:26.350 --> 06:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
school I was I had Holocaust and
 
06:11:28.948 --> 06:11:28.958 align:start position:0%
genocide studies and genocide was almost
 
06:11:31.510 --> 06:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
synonomous with the Jewish Holocaust
 
06:11:33.590 --> 06:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
perpetrated upon the Jewish people by
 
06:11:36.830 --> 06:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
the Nazis in in World War II and that
 
06:11:41.110 --> 06:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
was it and I think I mean it was awful
 
06:11:43.270 --> 06:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
we saw the worst of the worst we saw
 
06:11:46.390 --> 06:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
videos and images that made you want to
 
06:11:49.750 --> 06:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
vomit but when I was learning about this
 
06:11:51.910 --> 06:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
this is genocide there was definitely a
 
06:11:54.030 --> 06:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
sense of wow Humanity really messed up
 
06:11:57.350 --> 06:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
that time we really screwed that one up
 
06:11:59.750 --> 06:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
good thing we've evolved good thing
 
06:12:01.670 --> 06:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
we've learned our lesson and we're not
 
06:12:02.910 --> 06:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
going to do that
 
06:12:05.830 --> 06:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
anymore the danger of teaching it just
 
06:12:08.030 --> 06:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
as a single historical
 
06:12:11.750 --> 06:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
incident is that you feel in the clear
 
06:12:14.270 --> 06:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
you feel like there's no way it's a done
 
06:12:16.948 --> 06:12:16.958 align:start position:0%
deal we don't have to worry about that
 
06:12:19.548 --> 06:12:19.558 align:start position:0%
it's in the history books
 
06:12:23.910 --> 06:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:27.350 --> 06:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
that the problem is it is definitely not
 
06:12:29.868 --> 06:12:29.878 align:start position:0%
over this is a lesson that Humanity does
 
06:12:31.548 --> 06:12:31.558 align:start position:0%
not seem to
 
06:12:33.868 --> 06:12:33.878 align:start position:0%
learn because whether or not you want to
 
06:12:36.670 --> 06:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
argue over one specific incident or not
 
06:12:38.910 --> 06:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
there are at least a handful of
 
06:12:41.628 --> 06:12:41.638 align:start position:0%
incidents happening right now that are
 
06:12:43.190 --> 06:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
questions very strong questions of
 
06:12:45.510 --> 06:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not they are genocide we
 
06:12:47.430 --> 06:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
aren't learning this lesson this is a
 
06:12:49.548 --> 06:12:49.558 align:start position:0%
thing we keep doing to each
 
06:12:52.230 --> 06:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
other and if there's nothing else we
 
06:12:54.830 --> 06:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
teach it should be how to be good human
 
06:12:57.510 --> 06:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
beings and live on this planet
 
06:13:00.190 --> 06:13:00.200 align:start position:0%
together and so I think it's extremely
 
06:13:01.788 --> 06:13:01.798 align:start position:0%
exceedingly important and I know that
 
06:13:03.670 --> 06:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
you had a very very unpopular Bill
 
06:13:05.910 --> 06:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
trying to remove Holocaust and genocide
 
06:13:07.788 --> 06:13:07.798 align:start position:0%
studies as a requirement entirely and
 
06:13:10.390 --> 06:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sitting here doing the opposite if
 
06:13:12.788 --> 06:13:12.798 align:start position:0%
there's I I'm sorry it's more important
 
06:13:14.548 --> 06:13:14.558 align:start position:0%
than reading and writing in arithmetic
 
06:13:17.190 --> 06:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
it really is because if we can't learn
 
06:13:19.350 --> 06:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
how to not murder and Slaughter and
 
06:13:21.230 --> 06:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
torture each other then what the heck
 
06:13:28.868 --> 06:13:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:31.430 --> 06:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
here by the way in researching this
 
06:13:33.070 --> 06:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
there's a whole bunch of organizations I
 
06:13:35.628 --> 06:13:35.638 align:start position:0%
will be deferring to the UN repeatedly
 
06:13:37.070 --> 06:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
over and over again but there are a
 
06:13:38.548 --> 06:13:38.558 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of organizations that study
 
06:13:40.350 --> 06:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
this and it turns out and I didn't know
 
06:13:42.670 --> 06:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
this but maybe you do Keen State our
 
06:13:45.030 --> 06:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
very own Kee state has a holocaust and
 
06:13:49.590 --> 06:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
genocide studies um and and are in and
 
06:13:53.150 --> 06:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
of themselves experts um I did look to
 
06:13:55.750 --> 06:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
them as a potential Source I don't think
 
06:13:58.468 --> 06:13:58.478 align:start position:0%
as far as I could tell I could not find
 
06:14:01.230 --> 06:14:01.240 align:start position:0%
them having listed a specific list of
 
06:14:04.548 --> 06:14:04.558 align:start position:0%
genocides I will say just for the sake
 
06:14:08.350 --> 06:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
of the amendment by uh kicking it over
 
06:14:10.270 --> 06:14:10.280 align:start position:0%
to the list of genocides that have been
 
06:14:11.868 --> 06:14:11.878 align:start position:0%
adjudicated by the international court
 
06:14:15.150 --> 06:14:15.160 align:start position:0%
of justice um those are three those are
 
06:14:17.270 --> 06:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
only three if you look at the list of
 
06:14:18.788 --> 06:14:18.798 align:start position:0%
things that depending on the definition
 
06:14:20.230 --> 06:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
have been considered genocide it's
 
06:14:22.830 --> 06:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
dozens and dozens but only three and
 
06:14:26.230 --> 06:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
that is the genocide perpetrated upon
 
06:14:28.150 --> 06:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
the Jewish people by the Nazis which
 
06:14:30.270 --> 06:14:30.280 align:start position:0%
killed approximately 7 million Jewish
 
06:14:33.190 --> 06:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
people the Bosnian genocide which killed
 
06:14:35.590 --> 06:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
approximately 60,000 people
 
06:14:37.708 --> 06:14:37.718 align:start position:0%
and the Rwanda genocide which killed
 
06:14:40.628 --> 06:14:40.638 align:start position:0%
approximately 800,000 people there are
 
06:14:42.590 --> 06:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
other incidents like Cambodia in The
 
06:14:45.230 --> 06:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
Killing Fields where Millions have died
 
06:14:47.948 --> 06:14:47.958 align:start position:0%
but those are not included in that list
 
06:14:50.590 --> 06:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
so when I defer to icj it is the most
 
06:14:54.948 --> 06:14:54.958 align:start position:0%
narrow most conservative list that
 
06:14:58.270 --> 06:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
exists so history it's the end of World
 
06:14:58.280 --> 06:14:59.150 align:start position:0%
exists so history it's the end of World
War

06:14:59.150 --> 06:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
War
 
06:15:01.468 --> 06:15:01.478 align:start position:0%
II the world is coming to the
 
06:15:04.548 --> 06:15:04.558 align:start position:0%
realization that uh 7 million Jewish
 
06:15:06.468 --> 06:15:06.478 align:start position:0%
people have have been killed and not
 
06:15:07.910 --> 06:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
just killed but killed in the worst
 
06:15:10.830 --> 06:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
possible way with attempts to eradicate
 
06:15:13.510 --> 06:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
3 million non-jewish Polish people have
 
06:15:15.670 --> 06:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
been targeted and killed 1 and a half
 
06:15:21.030 --> 06:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
million Ro uh Ro excuse me we have used
 
06:15:25.910 --> 06:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
the slur gypsies but um I I don't is it
 
06:15:28.548 --> 06:15:28.558 align:start position:0%
the Romas the the people who we have
 
06:15:30.590 --> 06:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
historically called gypsies were
 
06:15:33.990 --> 06:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
killed and so um the League of Nations
 
06:15:35.750 --> 06:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
existed after World War one here's World
 
06:15:38.468 --> 06:15:38.478 align:start position:0%
War II this is just unfathomably
 
06:15:41.788 --> 06:15:41.798 align:start position:0%
terrible and so the UN is formed to try
 
06:15:44.708 --> 06:15:44.718 align:start position:0%
to stop anything like this from
 
06:15:46.750 --> 06:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
happening both the the war itself and
 
06:15:48.788 --> 06:15:48.798 align:start position:0%
the atrocities that occurred during the
 
06:15:52.190 --> 06:15:52.200 align:start position:0%
war from happening again to help um
 
06:15:55.390 --> 06:15:55.400 align:start position:0%
preserve International Peace there is a
 
06:15:59.310 --> 06:15:59.320 align:start position:0%
Polish lawyer by the name of rapael Lyin
 
06:16:01.350 --> 06:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
who would later uh be very active in the
 
06:16:04.390 --> 06:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
nurg trials who is the one who coined
 
06:16:07.750 --> 06:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
the term genocide genocide coming from
 
06:16:10.510 --> 06:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
the Latin um same atmology where we get
 
06:16:13.910 --> 06:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
the word Gene uh a tribe or family a
 
06:16:17.350 --> 06:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
clan and side meaning to
 
06:16:20.990 --> 06:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
kill uh he would later push for through
 
06:16:22.990 --> 06:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
his studies push through for the
 
06:16:25.750 --> 06:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
adoption by the UN of what would become
 
06:16:27.590 --> 06:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
the genocide convention where we have
 
06:16:30.230 --> 06:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
our standardized definition of
 
06:16:32.390 --> 06:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
genocide um and that convention is
 
06:16:35.868 --> 06:16:35.878 align:start position:0%
mostly based on liyin's uh research and
 
06:16:39.270 --> 06:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
work also um this was adopted the
 
06:16:41.230 --> 06:16:41.240 align:start position:0%
genocide convention was adopted in 1948
 
06:16:42.628 --> 06:16:42.638 align:start position:0%
which contains the definition of
 
06:16:45.350 --> 06:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
genocide which I have in the bill and
 
06:16:47.070 --> 06:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment as something that needs to
 
06:16:50.750 --> 06:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
be taught the definition um also adopted
 
06:16:53.468 --> 06:16:53.478 align:start position:0%
in 1948 for the same reasons is the UN
 
06:16:56.030 --> 06:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
Universal Declaration on human
 
06:16:59.468 --> 06:16:59.478 align:start position:0%
rights so the UN definition from liyin
 
06:17:02.230 --> 06:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
it's any of the following acts that have
 
06:17:06.110 --> 06:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
with the intent to destroy in or in part
 
06:17:08.390 --> 06:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
and Destroy later through studies has
 
06:17:11.390 --> 06:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
been qualified as as such meaning even
 
06:17:13.070 --> 06:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
if it's not intended to destroy them
 
06:17:15.190 --> 06:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
physically if it's destroying who they
 
06:17:19.548 --> 06:17:19.558 align:start position:0%
are as an identity um then that counts
 
06:17:21.628 --> 06:17:21.638 align:start position:0%
uh so with the inent to destroy and
 
06:17:23.230 --> 06:17:23.240 align:start position:0%
whole or in part a national ethnic
 
06:17:26.230 --> 06:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
racial or religious group either
 
06:17:29.070 --> 06:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
killing the serious bodily or mental
 
06:17:31.548 --> 06:17:31.558 align:start position:0%
harm to the group deliberately
 
06:17:33.430 --> 06:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
inflicting upon the group conditions of
 
06:17:35.270 --> 06:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
life that are calculated to bring about
 
06:17:37.150 --> 06:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
their destruction in whole or in part
 
06:17:39.030 --> 06:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
these are things like man-made forced
 
06:17:42.350 --> 06:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
famine or this intentional spread of
 
06:17:44.910 --> 06:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
disease uh the the force prevention of
 
06:17:47.670 --> 06:17:47.680 align:start position:0%
births of the group and forcibly
 
06:17:50.110 --> 06:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
transferring the group any one of these
 
06:17:52.430 --> 06:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
elements constitutes his genocide if it
 
06:17:55.190 --> 06:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
has the intent to destroy that group
 
06:17:58.270 --> 06:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
many of those that long list of of
 
06:18:01.910 --> 06:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
potential genocides um have almost all
 
06:18:03.310 --> 06:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
of those
 
06:18:05.830 --> 06:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
elements so interestingly this
 
06:18:08.270 --> 06:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
definition the words not the citation
 
06:18:10.070 --> 06:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
back to the UN genocide convention but
 
06:18:12.468 --> 06:18:12.478 align:start position:0%
the words already exist in our RSA but
 
06:18:14.350 --> 06:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
they do not exist as an instruction to
 
06:18:16.310 --> 06:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
teach they exist because we say
 
06:18:18.270 --> 06:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
Holocaust and genocide studies and then
 
06:18:20.390 --> 06:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
in RSA we Define genocide and we
 
06:18:22.830 --> 06:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
conveniently use by and large the UN
 
06:18:24.390 --> 06:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
definition of genocide but then we don't
 
06:18:27.548 --> 06:18:27.558 align:start position:0%
tell teachers to teach that definition I
 
06:18:29.948 --> 06:18:29.958 align:start position:0%
think the definition is very important
 
06:18:31.708 --> 06:18:31.718 align:start position:0%
in addition all of those groups that
 
06:18:35.030 --> 06:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
have studied this like Keen state um
 
06:18:36.390 --> 06:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
have studied this extensively and
 
06:18:37.788 --> 06:18:37.798 align:start position:0%
they've come up with several things
 
06:18:39.190 --> 06:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
these are not part of the genocide
 
06:18:41.310 --> 06:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
convention but these are widely agreed
 
06:18:44.830 --> 06:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
upon uh characteristics of genocide uh
 
06:18:47.110 --> 06:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
one is the 10 stages and another one is
 
06:18:50.510 --> 06:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
six common tools of genocide um in the
 
06:18:53.150 --> 06:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
amendment I specifically point out that
 
06:18:54.830 --> 06:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
the common stages and the tools of
 
06:18:56.670 --> 06:18:56.680 align:start position:0%
genocide should be
 
06:18:59.670 --> 06:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
taught the 10 stages really fast
 
06:19:01.830 --> 06:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
basically it's an overarching picture of
 
06:19:05.190 --> 06:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
otherizing a group and and creating that
 
06:19:07.030 --> 06:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
separation more and more extreme so that
 
06:19:08.750 --> 06:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
you can eventually have an excuse to
 
06:19:10.150 --> 06:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
violate their rights and eventually
 
06:19:12.070 --> 06:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
destroy them that's classification
 
06:19:13.990 --> 06:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
symbolization discrimination
 
06:19:16.468 --> 06:19:16.478 align:start position:0%
dehumanization organization polarization
 
06:19:18.868 --> 06:19:18.878 align:start position:0%
preparation persecution extermination
 
06:19:21.708 --> 06:19:21.718 align:start position:0%
and finally denial denial that the
 
06:19:24.750 --> 06:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
genocide ever happened the six tools and
 
06:19:27.310 --> 06:19:27.320 align:start position:0%
I think this is potentially even more
 
06:19:28.990 --> 06:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
important to
 
06:19:31.868 --> 06:19:31.878 align:start position:0%
teach violent massacres or mass killing
 
06:19:34.190 --> 06:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
by things like those Force conditions
 
06:19:37.990 --> 06:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
famine um disease systematic rape
 
06:19:40.230 --> 06:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
including the potentially rape camps
 
06:19:42.548 --> 06:19:42.558 align:start position:0%
which have happened uh and other sexual
 
06:19:44.510 --> 06:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
violence the this is used as
 
06:19:47.948 --> 06:19:47.958 align:start position:0%
psychological Terror as well as a way to
 
06:19:50.670 --> 06:19:50.680 align:start position:0%
change the uh the group and prevent the
 
06:19:53.628 --> 06:19:53.638 align:start position:0%
births of that group but basically put
 
06:19:55.830 --> 06:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
the preferred group have those births
 
06:19:55.840 --> 06:19:57.510 align:start position:0%
the preferred group have those births
happen

06:19:57.510 --> 06:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
happen
 
06:20:00.190 --> 06:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
instead um other Force birth prevention
 
06:20:01.910 --> 06:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
such as Force sterilization forced
 
06:20:03.590 --> 06:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
abortion and the transferring of
 
06:20:03.600 --> 06:20:05.510 align:start position:0%
abortion and the transferring of
children

06:20:05.510 --> 06:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
children
 
06:20:07.948 --> 06:20:07.958 align:start position:0%
forc deportations or ethnic cleansing of
 
06:20:10.110 --> 06:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
a region including things like death
 
06:20:13.310 --> 06:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
marches the use of
 
06:20:15.990 --> 06:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
trains concentration camps detention
 
06:20:19.070 --> 06:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
sensors en forced labor and finally
 
06:20:21.670 --> 06:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
cultural eraser and the reason I think
 
06:20:23.350 --> 06:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
these tools are extremely important is
 
06:20:24.948 --> 06:20:24.958 align:start position:0%
because we need students who understand
 
06:20:27.830 --> 06:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
that when they see any of these things
 
06:20:29.390 --> 06:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
when they see those things a red flag
 
06:20:31.670 --> 06:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
should go up for them anywhere in the
 
06:20:31.680 --> 06:20:34.868 align:start position:0%
should go up for them anywhere in the
world

06:20:34.868 --> 06:20:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:37.548 --> 06:20:37.558 align:start position:0%
so I told you about my
 
06:20:39.910 --> 06:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
experience that genocide was just this
 
06:20:41.468 --> 06:20:41.478 align:start position:0%
one thing this one thing that happened
 
06:20:43.190 --> 06:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
historically and it's over and thank God
 
06:20:45.830 --> 06:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
is isn't it good it's over as I'm
 
06:20:48.110 --> 06:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
studying this I had never in my life
 
06:20:49.910 --> 06:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
considered for
 
06:20:52.628 --> 06:20:52.638 align:start position:0%
example that the treatment of the
 
06:20:55.110 --> 06:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
indigenous people of North America was a
 
06:20:58.350 --> 06:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
genocide having studied this it's
 
06:21:00.948 --> 06:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
unquestionable to me personally that
 
06:21:04.110 --> 06:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what it was that my
 
06:21:06.468 --> 06:21:06.478 align:start position:0%
country which I love has engaged in
 
06:21:08.430 --> 06:21:08.440 align:start position:0%
atrocities and one of those atrocities
 
06:21:11.510 --> 06:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
is the genocide of indigenous people who
 
06:21:11.520 --> 06:21:12.868 align:start position:0%
is the genocide of indigenous people who
were

06:21:12.868 --> 06:21:12.878 align:start position:0%
were
 
06:21:16.390 --> 06:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
here I can say that about my own country
 
06:21:18.670 --> 06:21:18.680 align:start position:0%
and that is why it's important to teach
 
06:21:20.390 --> 06:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
because I would have never
 
06:21:22.590 --> 06:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
thought I would have never thought the
 
06:21:24.390 --> 06:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
danger of having this limited
 
06:21:26.270 --> 06:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
instruction as we currently have in RSA
 
06:21:28.070 --> 06:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
where it's just Holocaust and genocide
 
06:21:30.430 --> 06:21:30.440 align:start position:0%
studies that's a bad stuff y'all like
 
06:21:31.990 --> 06:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
that's basically all our current RSA
 
06:21:34.628 --> 06:21:34.638 align:start position:0%
says it doesn't even have a minimum of
 
06:21:38.670 --> 06:21:38.680 align:start position:0%
instruction and no real like historic
 
06:21:41.270 --> 06:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
widespread historic instruction on what
 
06:21:43.510 --> 06:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
is actually happening when we talk about
 
06:21:45.948 --> 06:21:45.958 align:start position:0%
genocide so no minimum no instruction
 
06:21:50.070 --> 06:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
and the danger of that is
 
06:21:52.750 --> 06:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
that you're we have generations of
 
06:21:55.310 --> 06:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
people who don't think it can happen
 
06:21:59.350 --> 06:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
here who don't see those flags and go oh
 
06:22:01.350 --> 06:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
maybe we're the bad guy or maybe our
 
06:22:03.670 --> 06:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
friends are the bad guy they don't it
 
06:22:06.030 --> 06:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't it doesn't generate for them an
 
06:22:09.548 --> 06:22:09.558 align:start position:0%
alarm system and it really
 
06:22:12.948 --> 06:22:12.958 align:start position:0%
should so I do understand that um you've
 
06:22:14.670 --> 06:22:14.680 align:start position:0%
had lots of opposition emails and
 
06:22:16.670 --> 06:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
opposition in the room my understanding
 
06:22:18.510 --> 06:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
is most of that opposition is in
 
06:22:20.788 --> 06:22:20.798 align:start position:0%
reference to one conflict and whether or
 
06:22:22.270 --> 06:22:22.280 align:start position:0%
not that conflict should be included in
 
06:22:24.788 --> 06:22:24.798 align:start position:0%
the definition of genocide I do hope
 
06:22:28.708 --> 06:22:28.718 align:start position:0%
that my um a proposed amendment here
 
06:22:31.910 --> 06:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
which rightly puts the list of genocides
 
06:22:34.548 --> 06:22:34.558 align:start position:0%
to be taught in the hands of the highest
 
06:22:37.590 --> 06:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
Authority in the world on the topic um
 
06:22:39.910 --> 06:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
can bring everybody together around this
 
06:22:42.350 --> 06:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
purpose because the intent is extremely
 
06:22:45.708 --> 06:22:45.718 align:start position:0%
important we are not doing enough to
 
06:22:48.110 --> 06:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
make citizens who are going to be aware
 
06:22:50.468 --> 06:22:50.478 align:start position:0%
when they see the world and see terrible
 
06:22:52.070 --> 06:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
things happening in the
 
06:22:54.990 --> 06:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
world um so I hope this brings us all
 
06:22:57.190 --> 06:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
together in the room and elsewhere and I
 
06:22:59.670 --> 06:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
hope we can all agree that um we don't
 
06:23:02.750 --> 06:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
ever want to see genocide ever again
 
06:23:05.110 --> 06:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
with that I will take questions
 
06:23:05.120 --> 06:23:05.990 align:start position:0%
with that I will take questions
thank

06:23:05.990 --> 06:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank
 
06:23:10.030 --> 06:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
you do have questions for the
 
06:23:12.510 --> 06:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
representative uh I just I had one you
 
06:23:15.150 --> 06:23:15.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned um something about a
 
06:23:18.750 --> 06:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
flag a flag a red flags as mental red
 
06:23:22.548 --> 06:23:22.558 align:start position:0%
flags as in something should ping in our
 
06:23:26.150 --> 06:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
heads when we see these types of um
 
06:23:30.310 --> 06:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
tactics being used you see people like
 
06:23:32.230 --> 06:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
if you were to see four sterilizations
 
06:23:34.110 --> 06:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
that should ping in your head oh this is
 
06:23:36.310 --> 06:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
one of those tools of genocide you see
 
06:23:38.070 --> 06:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
people loaded up on trains or forced
 
06:23:41.030 --> 06:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
into death marches forced famine that
 
06:23:43.788 --> 06:23:43.798 align:start position:0%
should pay in your head tool of genocide
 
06:23:46.910 --> 06:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
so I didn't mean a literal flag thank
 
06:23:50.670 --> 06:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
you represent Freeman thank you Mr chair
 
06:23:52.070 --> 06:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
um representative Reed do you have a
 
06:23:53.670 --> 06:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation for an age group that
 
06:23:58.150 --> 06:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:02.070 --> 06:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
school not in the bill it's in the RSA
 
06:24:06.670 --> 06:24:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:08.548 --> 06:24:08.558 align:start position:0%
further questions the RSA that currently
 
06:24:10.270 --> 06:24:10.280 align:start position:0%
has Holocaust and genocide studies but
 
06:24:12.670 --> 06:24:12.680 align:start position:0%
it's a very vague and very brief mention
 
06:24:15.910 --> 06:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:19.590 --> 06:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
school R Cornell Thank you Mr chair
 
06:24:21.628 --> 06:24:21.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for this testimony I just
 
06:24:23.468 --> 06:24:23.478 align:start position:0%
wondering if you talked at all or worked
 
06:24:26.590 --> 06:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
at all with the commission that is I am
 
06:24:28.030 --> 06:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
aware that there is a commission I did
 
06:24:31.750 --> 06:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
not this I I'm not going to lie this is
 
06:24:34.868 --> 06:24:34.878 align:start position:0%
um I've been very deeply personally
 
06:24:37.868 --> 06:24:37.878 align:start position:0%
impacted um by this topic not I don't
 
06:24:39.948 --> 06:24:39.958 align:start position:0%
mean to say that I've been personally
 
06:24:42.468 --> 06:24:42.478 align:start position:0%
impacted by genocide I have not but
 
06:24:44.468 --> 06:24:44.478 align:start position:0%
studying this and and and the
 
06:24:46.230 --> 06:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
conversations around this topic have
 
06:24:49.590 --> 06:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
been ex exceedingly emotional for me so
 
06:24:52.270 --> 06:24:52.280 align:start position:0%
um it's just something I felt like I had
 
06:24:56.510 --> 06:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
a a moral obligation to
 
06:25:00.270 --> 06:25:00.280 align:start position:0%
do thank you for the questions see none
 
06:25:02.190 --> 06:25:02.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
06:25:11.990 --> 06:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:14.270 --> 06:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
I thank you Mr chair members of the
 
06:25:16.990 --> 06:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
committee I appear in opposition uh to
 
06:25:20.110 --> 06:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
this bill I I I don't think first of all
 
06:25:22.830 --> 06:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
I don't think you're that it's necessary
 
06:25:23.910 --> 06:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
but more
 
06:25:26.270 --> 06:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
importantly I I hope that the committee
 
06:25:30.110 --> 06:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
will take a moment to sort of reflect on
 
06:25:34.948 --> 06:25:34.958 align:start position:0%
do we want to be instructing our schools
 
06:25:37.910 --> 06:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
that what they ought to be relying on is
 
06:25:39.430 --> 06:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
the United
 
06:25:43.708 --> 06:25:43.718 align:start position:0%
Nations uh view of the world uh for the
 
06:25:47.708 --> 06:25:47.718 align:start position:0%
studying of uh of what constitutes
 
06:25:50.708 --> 06:25:50.718 align:start position:0%
genocide uh and and related things the
 
06:25:50.718 --> 06:25:51.708 align:start position:0%
genocide uh and and related things the
United

06:25:51.708 --> 06:25:51.718 align:start position:0%
United
 
06:25:55.270 --> 06:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
Nations the United Nations organizations
 
06:25:57.110 --> 06:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
I whether it's is it the international
 
06:25:58.390 --> 06:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
criminal court I think it was the
 
06:26:00.948 --> 06:26:00.958 align:start position:0%
international criminal court that has um
 
06:26:02.628 --> 06:26:02.638 align:start position:0%
issued an arrest warrant for prime
 
06:26:05.030 --> 06:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
minister Netanyahu that that's the
 
06:26:09.030 --> 06:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
that's the uh um that's how responsible
 
06:26:12.868 --> 06:26:12.878 align:start position:0%
the international criminal court um uh
 
06:26:16.430 --> 06:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh is um that that will will issue an
 
06:26:18.430 --> 06:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
arrest warrant for the prime minister of
 
06:26:21.910 --> 06:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
a country uh that was you know viciously
 
06:26:25.868 --> 06:26:25.878 align:start position:0%
attacked in in October of 2023 and
 
06:26:31.030 --> 06:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
responded um I I I can't help thinking
 
06:26:33.110 --> 06:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
that particularly when you consider the
 
06:26:37.548 --> 06:26:37.558 align:start position:0%
original bill and although the the um
 
06:26:40.310 --> 06:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment purports to take out you
 
06:26:42.468 --> 06:26:42.478 align:start position:0%
know the specific reference for example
 
06:26:44.788 --> 06:26:44.798 align:start position:0%
to the Palestinian genocide I have to
 
06:26:48.510 --> 06:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
say that I must have missed that um uh
 
06:26:52.990 --> 06:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
where the Palestinian genocide was um uh
 
06:26:56.150 --> 06:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
but it it strikes me that what this is
 
06:27:01.110 --> 06:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
an attempt to do is to kind of draw an
 
06:27:03.430 --> 06:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
equivalency um you know it's well as
 
06:27:06.548 --> 06:27:06.558 align:start position:0%
this this was a but so is this um that
 
06:27:10.990 --> 06:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
kind of thing and um and frankly um
 
06:27:12.868 --> 06:27:12.878 align:start position:0%
there is no equivalency here there's
 
06:27:14.868 --> 06:27:14.878 align:start position:0%
there's there's
 
06:27:17.910 --> 06:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
one what happened on October in October
 
06:27:21.190 --> 06:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
of 2023 there's one right side and one
 
06:27:24.150 --> 06:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
wrong side there's no equivalency um in
 
06:27:25.910 --> 06:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
terms of what happened or in terms of
 
06:27:30.708 --> 06:27:30.718 align:start position:0%
Israel's response to it um and I think
 
06:27:32.948 --> 06:27:32.958 align:start position:0%
that uh to the extent that the
 
06:27:36.548 --> 06:27:36.558 align:start position:0%
suggestion is that we should rely on the
 
06:27:41.150 --> 06:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
United Nations and its view of the world
 
06:27:43.270 --> 06:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh in light of all that we have seen
 
06:27:45.070 --> 06:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
happen with the United Nations in so
 
06:27:48.270 --> 06:27:48.280 align:start position:0%
many contexts over you know the last 10
 
06:27:50.350 --> 06:27:50.360 align:start position:0%
years or whatever think it seems to me
 
06:27:53.910 --> 06:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
is a very very bad idea so for all of
 
06:27:56.468 --> 06:27:56.478 align:start position:0%
those reasons I would urge you I think
 
06:27:59.110 --> 06:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
the I think the current Statute in terms
 
06:28:00.990 --> 06:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
of what it what it requires to be
 
06:28:04.468 --> 06:28:04.478 align:start position:0%
studied is is uh is entirely adequate
 
06:28:08.350 --> 06:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
the fact that the that the uh that uh
 
06:28:10.868 --> 06:28:10.878 align:start position:0%
the sponsor indicated that well the def
 
06:28:12.230 --> 06:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
there is a definition of what
 
06:28:13.990 --> 06:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
constitutes a genocide in the statute
 
06:28:17.190 --> 06:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
already but it doesn't require that that
 
06:28:19.190 --> 06:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh uh students be taught that it doesn't
 
06:28:20.990 --> 06:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
prohibit that either I mean is there if
 
06:28:23.430 --> 06:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
if uh if if teachers think that that's
 
06:28:25.390 --> 06:28:25.400 align:start position:0%
something that's important that's you
 
06:28:27.190 --> 06:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
know that students should be taught
 
06:28:28.350 --> 06:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that's prevents them
 
06:28:31.670 --> 06:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
from doing that um so I just don't see
 
06:28:33.590 --> 06:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
why you know to the extent that that's
 
06:28:35.270 --> 06:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
the argument why this is why this is
 
06:28:38.150 --> 06:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
necessary at any rate I again it seems
 
06:28:40.548 --> 06:28:40.558 align:start position:0%
to me I don't think that this
 
06:28:42.670 --> 06:28:42.680 align:start position:0%
legislature or this state wants to be
 
06:28:47.110 --> 06:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
relying on um the United Nations view uh
 
06:28:49.788 --> 06:28:49.798 align:start position:0%
and these and the various organization
 
06:28:51.990 --> 06:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
remember what isn't isn't what's the
 
06:28:56.030 --> 06:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
unus isn't that the um the the uh the
 
06:28:59.390 --> 06:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
group that uh is United Nations funded
 
06:29:02.670 --> 06:29:02.680 align:start position:0%
that was uh uh providing quote unquote
 
06:29:05.948 --> 06:29:05.958 align:start position:0%
relief to the uh to the Palestinians and
 
06:29:08.430 --> 06:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
many many of their members were part of
 
06:29:12.070 --> 06:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
the uh of the of the Invaders on October
 
06:29:16.390 --> 06:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
7th so the idea that um we should be uh
 
06:29:18.628 --> 06:29:18.638 align:start position:0%
placing faith and trust in the United
 
06:29:20.628 --> 06:29:20.638 align:start position:0%
Nations is something I think is not a
 
06:29:24.430 --> 06:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
very good idea um with that I I I hope
 
06:29:28.190 --> 06:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
you'll decide to itl this Bill thank you
 
06:29:30.310 --> 06:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
very much representative yes
 
06:29:33.310 --> 06:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
representative hard yes so you you
 
06:29:34.868 --> 06:29:34.878 align:start position:0%
mentioned um
 
06:29:34.878 --> 06:29:36.430 align:start position:0%
mentioned um
equivalency

06:29:36.430 --> 06:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
equivalency
 
06:29:39.750 --> 06:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering uh what your thought
 
06:29:44.750 --> 06:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
is in terms of um the Holocaust
 
06:29:48.150 --> 06:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
which the numbers that she read off were
 
06:29:52.590 --> 06:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
definitely horrifying um if this bill
 
06:29:52.600 --> 06:29:54.110 align:start position:0%
definitely horrifying um if this bill
would

06:29:54.110 --> 06:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:29:56.868 --> 06:29:56.878 align:start position:0%
then cause an equivalency that would
 
06:30:01.310 --> 06:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
diminish the Holocaust and water it down
 
06:30:04.270 --> 06:30:04.280 align:start position:0%
um so that everything can be equal well
 
06:30:05.670 --> 06:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
well no I mean that's I think that's a
 
06:30:08.750 --> 06:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
very valid point because it seems to me
 
06:30:10.628 --> 06:30:10.638 align:start position:0%
you know I'm I'm certainly not
 
06:30:13.708 --> 06:30:13.718 align:start position:0%
suggesting that the only you know
 
06:30:17.230 --> 06:30:17.240 align:start position:0%
atrocity that in history has been um has
 
06:30:19.150 --> 06:30:19.160 align:start position:0%
been the Holocaust I'm not suggesting
 
06:30:21.990 --> 06:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
that but I do think that it's that it's
 
06:30:24.990 --> 06:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
a fair thing to say that that was you
 
06:30:28.468 --> 06:30:28.478 align:start position:0%
know by far the the worst
 
06:30:31.230 --> 06:30:31.240 align:start position:0%
situation um of of some kind of a
 
06:30:33.708 --> 06:30:33.718 align:start position:0%
genocide that we've seen I mean it was
 
06:30:37.030 --> 06:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
it is Way Beyond anything else it seems
 
06:30:39.628 --> 06:30:39.638 align:start position:0%
to me that that we've seen and you know
 
06:30:41.948 --> 06:30:41.958 align:start position:0%
I I mean I know the original bill I
 
06:30:44.230 --> 06:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
talked about you know the the uh
 
06:30:46.910 --> 06:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
treatment of of Native Americans I don't
 
06:30:49.468 --> 06:30:49.478 align:start position:0%
for a moment suggest that we you know
 
06:30:51.910 --> 06:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
that there was any that that Native
 
06:30:55.310 --> 06:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
Americans uh you know uh in history were
 
06:30:59.070 --> 06:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
true that there was anything um uh but
 
06:31:01.548 --> 06:31:01.558 align:start position:0%
deplorable treatment of of Native
 
06:31:05.548 --> 06:31:05.558 align:start position:0%
Americans um but I don't think that that
 
06:31:08.150 --> 06:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
that it it rises to the level of what
 
06:31:10.468 --> 06:31:10.478 align:start position:0%
happened during the Holocaust as bad as
 
06:31:13.350 --> 06:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
it may have been and I think that um you
 
06:31:15.510 --> 06:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
know that to particular I mean the thing
 
06:31:18.190 --> 06:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
I found particularly offensive about the
 
06:31:20.990 --> 06:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
about the original bill was the the the
 
06:31:23.830 --> 06:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
the the suggestion that somehow there's
 
06:31:26.430 --> 06:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
a there was a Palestinian genocide that
 
06:31:30.310 --> 06:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
was you know that was somehow we should
 
06:31:31.670 --> 06:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
be taking that into account and
 
06:31:34.590 --> 06:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
considering that uh Visa the Holocaust
 
06:31:36.750 --> 06:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
it's just it's completely apples and
 
06:31:38.708 --> 06:31:38.718 align:start position:0%
oranges as far as I'm
 
06:31:42.510 --> 06:31:42.520 align:start position:0%
concerned thank you yes represent

opportunity to speak in opposition to HB

555 FN I'm not much of a public speaker
 
06:32:46.110 --> 06:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
so I hope you'll bear with me I
 
06:32:48.510 --> 06:32:48.520 align:start position:0%
submitted a letter in January that
 
06:32:51.270 --> 06:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
outlined some of my thoughts about why
 
06:32:53.990 --> 06:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
Israel's military action in Gaza after
 
06:32:57.150 --> 06:32:57.160 align:start position:0%
an unprovoked invasion into its borders
 
06:32:59.030 --> 06:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
the massacre of
 
06:33:01.788 --> 06:33:01.798 align:start position:0%
1,200 innocent lives and the Abduction
 
06:33:05.190 --> 06:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
of over 200 others does not constitute a
 
06:33:08.230 --> 06:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
genocide genocide is a very specific
 
06:33:11.388 --> 06:33:11.398 align:start position:0%
crime requiring intent and Israel's
 
06:33:13.708 --> 06:33:13.718 align:start position:0%
attempts to rescue the hostages and
 
06:33:16.670 --> 06:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
locate the leaders of the attack do not
 
06:33:18.830 --> 06:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
despite the unfortunate deaths of
 
06:33:21.150 --> 06:33:21.160 align:start position:0%
civilians constitute an attempt to
 
06:33:24.628 --> 06:33:24.638 align:start position:0%
exterminate the Palestinian people but I
 
06:33:26.430 --> 06:33:26.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to repeat everything I said
 
06:33:28.990 --> 06:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
in the letter here instead I want to
 
06:33:30.990 --> 06:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
concentrate today on two other reasons
 
06:33:34.868 --> 06:33:34.878 align:start position:0%
to reject this proposed bill first it's
 
06:33:37.030 --> 06:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
unassailable that there's a rise in
 
06:33:39.628 --> 06:33:39.638 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism in this country around the
 
06:33:42.270 --> 06:33:42.280 align:start position:0%
world and New Hampshire unfortunately is
 
06:33:44.910 --> 06:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
no exception as someone who has worked
 
06:33:47.548 --> 06:33:47.558 align:start position:0%
in public schools around the state both
 
06:33:49.388 --> 06:33:49.398 align:start position:0%
as the former chair of the Jewish
 
06:33:52.788 --> 06:33:52.798 align:start position:0%
federations anti-Semitism committee and
 
06:33:55.830 --> 06:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
as the administrator of Civic 603 in New
 
06:33:58.590 --> 06:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Civics program I am personally
 
06:34:00.788 --> 06:34:00.798 align:start position:0%
aware of some of the incidents occurring
 
06:34:03.788 --> 06:34:03.798 align:start position:0%
in our state in schools elementary
 
06:34:06.510 --> 06:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
middle and high schools I've spoken to
 
06:34:09.230 --> 06:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
teachers parents and students there are
 
06:34:12.590 --> 06:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
the usual swas on desks at bathrooms and
 
06:34:14.948 --> 06:34:14.958 align:start position:0%
school bus windows and there have been
 
06:34:17.948 --> 06:34:17.958 align:start position:0%
Nazi salutes and comments like kill the
 
06:34:21.190 --> 06:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
Jew you stupid Jew what do you expect
 
06:34:23.310 --> 06:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
from a dumb Jew and I've headed up to
 
06:34:26.708 --> 06:34:26.718 align:start position:0%
hear Jew whatever your particular views
 
06:34:30.230 --> 06:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
are on Israel's response to October 7th
 
06:34:33.030 --> 06:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
it cannot be seriously gain said that
 
06:34:35.350 --> 06:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
adding a mandatory discussion about the
 
06:34:37.750 --> 06:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
ongoing situation in the Middle East
 
06:34:41.430 --> 06:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
will F more Discord in
 
06:34:43.590 --> 06:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism second although I am
 
06:34:45.868 --> 06:34:45.878 align:start position:0%
speaking completely in my personal
 
06:34:48.510 --> 06:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
capacity and not as a representative of
 
06:34:50.430 --> 06:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
the state's Holocaust and genocide
 
06:34:53.110 --> 06:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
education commission I am aware from our
 
06:34:55.070 --> 06:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
meetings that schools are having a
 
06:34:57.590 --> 06:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
difficult time implementing the existing
 
06:35:00.190 --> 06:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
statute the rules implemented to
 
06:35:03.788 --> 06:35:03.798 align:start position:0%
effectuate the statute and by the way uh
 
06:35:06.150 --> 06:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
in response to representative Reed's
 
06:35:09.110 --> 06:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
comments There are rules that were
 
06:35:11.830 --> 06:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
promulgated by the Board of
 
06:35:15.670 --> 06:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
Education outlining what should be
 
06:35:19.190 --> 06:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
taught um pursuant to this statute the
 
06:35:22.910 --> 06:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
rules did not go into effect until 2022
 
06:35:26.948 --> 06:35:26.958 align:start position:0%
and 2023 Academic Year and teachers are
 
06:35:28.948 --> 06:35:28.958 align:start position:0%
themselves still learning about the
 
06:35:32.270 --> 06:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
topic adding the Middle East situation
 
06:35:34.708 --> 06:35:34.718 align:start position:0%
one that has sparked so much controversy
 
06:35:37.270 --> 06:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
around the country where events change
 
06:35:39.868 --> 06:35:39.878 align:start position:0%
from day to day where we have not yet
 
06:35:42.310 --> 06:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
benefited from the lens of history and
 
06:35:45.070 --> 06:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
where a person could spend literally the
 
06:35:47.708 --> 06:35:47.718 align:start position:0%
entire four years of high school trying
 
06:35:50.230 --> 06:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
to understand the geopolitics of Middle
 
06:35:54.750 --> 06:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
East of the Middle East is imprudent and
 
06:35:57.270 --> 06:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
impractical as a Jewish person whose
 
06:35:59.628 --> 06:35:59.638 align:start position:0%
relatives suffered during pilgrims and
 
06:36:02.070 --> 06:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
during the Holocaust and Who as a
 
06:36:04.230 --> 06:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
consequence understands the importance
 
06:36:07.150 --> 06:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
of Israel and believes as Martin Luther
 
06:36:09.830 --> 06:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
King Jr said that peace in Israel
 
06:36:12.708 --> 06:36:12.718 align:start position:0%
requires the security and territorial
 
06:36:16.270 --> 06:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
Integrity of Israel I am deeply saddened
 
06:36:19.910 --> 06:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
and offended by the original proposal
 
06:36:21.910 --> 06:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
and as someone who has been involved in
 
06:36:23.548 --> 06:36:23.558 align:start position:0%
education in New Hampshire Public
 
06:36:26.030 --> 06:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
Schools since my retirement from the
 
06:36:28.788 --> 06:36:28.798 align:start position:0%
practice of law I am simply astonished
 
06:36:30.230 --> 06:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
that anyone would think that the
 
06:36:32.670 --> 06:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
proposed requirement would not wreak
 
06:36:35.310 --> 06:36:35.320 align:start position:0%
havoc in school if it were Incorporated
 
06:36:38.150 --> 06:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
on a mandatory basis into the
 
06:36:40.548 --> 06:36:40.558 align:start position:0%
curriculum finally although I'm not
 
06:36:43.510 --> 06:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
prepared to speak um with respect to the
 
06:36:45.310 --> 06:36:45.320 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment that's before you
 
06:36:48.910 --> 06:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
today I will not that has a number of
 
06:36:51.510 --> 06:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
significant problems the United States
 
06:36:55.388 --> 06:36:55.398 align:start position:0%
is not a member of the icj or the ICC
 
06:36:57.750 --> 06:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
and has not adopted the universal
 
06:37:00.030 --> 06:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Human
 
06:37:03.830 --> 06:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
Rights I wonder whether the amendment is
 
06:37:08.310 --> 06:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
an attempt to uh to backdoor the
 
06:37:11.548 --> 06:37:11.558 align:start position:0%
existing proposal um
 
06:37:16.350 --> 06:37:16.360 align:start position:0%
through through by using much broader
 
06:37:19.788 --> 06:37:19.798 align:start position:0%
language thank you and um if you have
 
06:37:22.868 --> 06:37:22.878 align:start position:0%
any questions I'll try to answer
 
06:37:26.150 --> 06:37:26.160 align:start position:0%

06:37:44.270 --> 06:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:47.830 --> 06:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
GT good afternoon chairman and members
 
06:37:50.110 --> 06:37:50.120 align:start position:0%
of the committee thank you for the
 
06:37:52.070 --> 06:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak today my name is
 
06:37:54.270 --> 06:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
Allison gerton I serve as the executive
 
06:37:55.708 --> 06:37:55.718 align:start position:0%
director for the Jewish Federation of
 
06:37:58.190 --> 06:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um you have already
 
06:37:59.788 --> 06:37:59.798 align:start position:0%
received the letter that we sent
 
06:38:01.868 --> 06:38:01.878 align:start position:0%
outlining our concerns with the proposed
 
06:38:04.910 --> 06:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
amendment so I will f Fus my time today
 
06:38:07.948 --> 06:38:07.958 align:start position:0%
on what we feel is most critical in the
 
06:38:10.230 --> 06:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
past 15 months the Jewish Federation of
 
06:38:12.708 --> 06:38:12.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has received reports of
 
06:38:14.868 --> 06:38:14.878 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitic incidents in three
 
06:38:17.990 --> 06:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
different schools across our state this
 
06:38:20.670 --> 06:38:20.680 align:start position:0%
is not abstract this is happening here
 
06:38:22.990 --> 06:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
in our communities and we must be
 
06:38:26.070 --> 06:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
mindful of the impact our laws and our
 
06:38:28.990 --> 06:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
policies have on fostering either
 
06:38:31.788 --> 06:38:31.798 align:start position:0%
understanding or division the amendment
 
06:38:33.430 --> 06:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
before you inserting the term
 
06:38:35.670 --> 06:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
Palestinian genocide into the Holocaust
 
06:38:39.310 --> 06:38:39.320 align:start position:0%
and genocide education statute does not
 
06:38:42.070 --> 06:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
Advance historical education it advances
 
06:38:44.468 --> 06:38:44.478 align:start position:0%
a divisive political agenda the
 
06:38:46.628 --> 06:38:46.638 align:start position:0%
Holocaust and genocide education law was
 
06:38:49.310 --> 06:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
created to teach students about well
 
06:38:52.070 --> 06:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
documented universally recognized
 
06:38:54.230 --> 06:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
genocides ensuring that we learn from
 
06:38:56.868 --> 06:38:56.878 align:start position:0%
the past to prevent future
 
06:39:00.030 --> 06:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
atrocities adding a term that is highly
 
06:39:03.468 --> 06:39:03.478 align:start position:0%
politicized and deeply disputed not only
 
06:39:06.430 --> 06:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
weakens the Integrity of this law but it
 
06:39:08.150 --> 06:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
risks turning classrooms into
 
06:39:10.750 --> 06:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
Battlegrounds for political narratives
 
06:39:13.590 --> 06:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
rather than spaces for factual learning
 
06:39:16.150 --> 06:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
this proposal has real consequences
 
06:39:18.910 --> 06:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
regardless of intent framing Israel's
 
06:39:21.270 --> 06:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
actions as genocide promotes a
 
06:39:23.990 --> 06:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
misleading and inflammatory narrative
 
06:39:26.388 --> 06:39:26.398 align:start position:0%
that contributes to anti-Semitism it
 
06:39:28.310 --> 06:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
introduces bias into educational
 
06:39:30.750 --> 06:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
standards it risks fostering hostility
 
06:39:33.030 --> 06:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
towards Jewish students and the broader
 
06:39:35.310 --> 06:39:35.320 align:start position:0%
Jewish Community the international
 
06:39:36.830 --> 06:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
Holocaust remembrance alliance
 
06:39:39.230 --> 06:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
definition of anti-semitism which New
 
06:39:41.788 --> 06:39:41.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire adopted into law last year
 
06:39:44.070 --> 06:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
provides clear guidance on how
 
06:39:46.990 --> 06:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
anti-semitic rhetoric can manifest
 
06:39:49.110 --> 06:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
including in ways that distort or
 
06:39:52.190 --> 06:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
demonize Jewish identity and the Jewish
 
06:39:54.548 --> 06:39:54.558 align:start position:0%
State we must be cautious not to
 
06:39:56.350 --> 06:39:56.360 align:start position:0%
introduce language into our education
 
06:39:59.510 --> 06:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
system that could fuel div division or
 
06:40:02.388 --> 06:40:02.398 align:start position:0%
hatred for these reasons I urge this
 
06:40:04.590 --> 06:40:04.600 align:start position:0%
committee to reject the amendment the
 
06:40:06.788 --> 06:40:06.798 align:start position:0%
original Law serves a vital purpose
 
06:40:08.788 --> 06:40:08.798 align:start position:0%
ensuring students understand the
 
06:40:11.590 --> 06:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
catastrophic consequences of true
 
06:40:13.990 --> 06:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
genocide this amendment to distorts that
 
06:40:15.948 --> 06:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
mission let's keep Holocaust and
 
06:40:18.150 --> 06:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
genocide education focused on history
 
06:40:21.230 --> 06:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
and not on politics thank you thank you
 
06:40:22.990 --> 06:40:23.000 align:start position:0%

questions see none thank you for being
 
06:40:40.830 --> 06:40:40.840 align:start position:0%

good afternoon everybody Mr chairman
 
06:40:45.590 --> 06:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
committee members thank you for having
 
06:40:46.548 --> 06:40:46.558 align:start position:0%
me here
 
06:40:50.270 --> 06:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
today um as uh I'm Terry Ock
 
06:40:53.190 --> 06:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
representative ter o rock from Keane a
 
06:40:54.948 --> 06:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
few years ago I began working on a
 
06:40:56.948 --> 06:40:56.958 align:start position:0%
project highlighting what I have since
 
06:40:59.670 --> 06:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
termed crimes against humanity in the
 
06:40:59.680 --> 06:41:00.830 align:start position:0%
termed crimes against humanity in the
United

06:41:00.830 --> 06:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
United
 
06:41:03.830 --> 06:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
States what brought that Curiosity about
 
06:41:06.388 --> 06:41:06.398 align:start position:0%
was the daily death totals occurring due
 
06:41:06.398 --> 06:41:07.750 align:start position:0%
was the daily death totals occurring due
to

06:41:07.750 --> 06:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:41:10.868 --> 06:41:10.878 align:start position:0%
covid-19 my initial thought was could
 
06:41:13.230 --> 06:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
this be a genocide in the making and has
 
06:41:16.310 --> 06:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
there ever been a genocide in this
 
06:41:19.030 --> 06:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
country that would be yes what my
 
06:41:21.590 --> 06:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
research did turn up was the woolful
 
06:41:24.590 --> 06:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
lack of American History taught in our
 
06:41:27.468 --> 06:41:27.478 align:start position:0%
schools time and time again I would find
 
06:41:29.510 --> 06:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
some historical event and think to
 
06:41:32.628 --> 06:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
myself I never knew that why weren't we
 
06:41:33.910 --> 06:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
taught that in
 
06:41:36.628 --> 06:41:36.638 align:start position:0%
School the events that I am referring to
 
06:41:38.990 --> 06:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
would be inhumane treatment and crimes
 
06:41:41.750 --> 06:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
against Native Americans and at the
 
06:41:44.310 --> 06:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
beginning of this country's history
 
06:41:48.350 --> 06:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
Africans now known as black and brown
 
06:41:50.670 --> 06:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
Americans we were never taught about the
 
06:41:53.468 --> 06:41:53.478 align:start position:0%
Trail of Tears the forced removal of
 
06:41:56.190 --> 06:41:56.200 align:start position:0%
Native Americans from their lands to
 
06:41:59.910 --> 06:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma thousands died while on route
 
06:42:02.150 --> 06:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
or the many wars that occurred such as
 
06:42:05.948 --> 06:42:05.958 align:start position:0%
the Sand Creek Massacre the Pico War the
 
06:42:08.110 --> 06:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
creek Wars to name a
 
06:42:12.430 --> 06:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
few human bondage or slavery was allowed
 
06:42:15.310 --> 06:42:15.320 align:start position:0%
until it wasn't but in the meantime
 
06:42:17.430 --> 06:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
there were many rebellions and massacres
 
06:42:20.910 --> 06:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
that took place and were never Tau about
 
06:42:23.350 --> 06:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
one example is the Tulsa Race massacre
 
06:42:26.548 --> 06:42:26.558 align:start position:0%
in Tulsa Oklahoma in
 
06:42:29.468 --> 06:42:29.478 align:start position:0%
1921 I had never heard of that event
 
06:42:32.190 --> 06:42:32.200 align:start position:0%
until I happened upon a nation a copy of
 
06:42:33.628 --> 06:42:33.638 align:start position:0%
National Geographic
 
06:42:36.548 --> 06:42:36.558 align:start position:0%
who had a piece on the 100th anniversary
 
06:42:36.558 --> 06:42:37.868 align:start position:0%
who had a piece on the 100th anniversary
in

06:42:37.868 --> 06:42:37.878 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:42:41.030 --> 06:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
2021 events like these and so many more
 
06:42:43.270 --> 06:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
like the unlawful incarceration of
 
06:42:46.350 --> 06:42:46.360 align:start position:0%
Japanese American citizens during World
 
06:42:49.670 --> 06:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
War II are a part of American history
 
06:42:52.430 --> 06:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
and need to be acknowledged learned
 
06:42:55.990 --> 06:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
about and hopefully learn lessons
 
06:42:59.070 --> 06:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
from I ask that you seriously and
 
06:43:01.510 --> 06:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully consider adding more
 
06:43:04.070 --> 06:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
accurate past americ ameran history to
 
06:43:06.708 --> 06:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
school curriculum so students can have
 
06:43:08.868 --> 06:43:08.878 align:start position:0%
full knowledge of our nation's
 
06:43:11.670 --> 06:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
Beginnings that would include The Good
 
06:43:15.150 --> 06:43:15.160 align:start position:0%
the Bad and the Ugly and I thank you for
 
06:43:15.160 --> 06:43:16.670 align:start position:0%
the Bad and the Ugly and I thank you for
your

06:43:16.670 --> 06:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
your
 
06:43:18.708 --> 06:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
time thank
 
06:43:21.110 --> 06:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
you yes
 
06:43:23.030 --> 06:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative uh thank thank you very
 
06:43:24.548 --> 06:43:24.558 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair and thank you for taking
 
06:43:27.070 --> 06:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
my question so um I've heard from a
 
06:43:29.468 --> 06:43:29.478 align:start position:0%
number of speakers today that you know
 
06:43:33.388 --> 06:43:33.398 align:start position:0%
um a number of events um were not taught
 
06:43:34.830 --> 06:43:34.840 align:start position:0%
in their school and they they' never
 
06:43:37.468 --> 06:43:37.478 align:start position:0%
heard of that I grew up in in a public
 
06:43:39.628 --> 06:43:39.638 align:start position:0%
school setting and so forth and a lot of
 
06:43:41.110 --> 06:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
those events in fact most of the ones
 
06:43:44.110 --> 06:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
that I've mentioned I I did hear about
 
06:43:46.948 --> 06:43:46.958 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering if um if you
 
06:43:50.110 --> 06:43:50.120 align:start position:0%
could speak a little bit on
 
06:43:50.120 --> 06:43:52.190 align:start position:0%
could speak a little bit on
um

06:43:52.190 --> 06:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:43:57.590 --> 06:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe these things are um taught
 
06:44:00.990 --> 06:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
and we don't remember them or maybe um
 
06:44:04.510 --> 06:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
it's inequality in our schools or
 
06:44:07.948 --> 06:44:07.958 align:start position:0%
um something that that or maybe we don't
 
06:44:09.510 --> 06:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
actually know what's being taught in our
 
06:44:11.548 --> 06:44:11.558 align:start position:0%
schools just
 
06:44:15.868 --> 06:44:15.878 align:start position:0%
because I'm confused in that I I did
 
06:44:18.510 --> 06:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
know about the Trail of Tears and the
 
06:44:20.430 --> 06:44:20.440 align:start position:0%
Japanese detention centers could you
 
06:44:22.670 --> 06:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
speak on that please thank you okay to
 
06:44:25.788 --> 06:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
the best of my ability I will I really
 
06:44:29.910 --> 06:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
never heard of the the Trail of Tears um
 
06:44:32.628 --> 06:44:32.638 align:start position:0%
the the only thing I remember ever
 
06:44:35.190 --> 06:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
learning learning about in in school
 
06:44:38.788 --> 06:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
whether it was high school or I don't
 
06:44:43.948 --> 06:44:43.958 align:start position:0%
know midd Junior High whatever was
 
06:44:47.468 --> 06:44:47.478 align:start position:0%
um yeah the the Indians they were here
 
06:44:49.830 --> 06:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
first we they were referred to as
 
06:44:52.310 --> 06:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
Indians at the time they were here first
 
06:44:53.948 --> 06:44:53.958 align:start position:0%
and then you
 
06:44:57.430 --> 06:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
know the the white white people came and
 
06:44:58.788 --> 06:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
we just took I mean it was kind of
 
06:45:02.230 --> 06:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
glossed over I guess is what I'm saying
 
06:45:04.430 --> 06:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
so so no I had never ever heard of the
 
06:45:07.948 --> 06:45:07.958 align:start position:0%
Trail of Tears um
 
06:45:13.190 --> 06:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
slavery uh yes how um um the black and
 
06:45:16.628 --> 06:45:16.638 align:start position:0%
brown people were brought to America
 
06:45:19.670 --> 06:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
again we learned about it but it was
 
06:45:21.468 --> 06:45:21.478 align:start position:0%
kind of glossed
 
06:45:25.070 --> 06:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
over and I think what I I what I was
 
06:45:28.510 --> 06:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
trying to um bring about in in in what I
 
06:45:30.868 --> 06:45:30.878 align:start position:0%
was talking about was that maybe more of
 
06:45:34.190 --> 06:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
the meat of our history needs to be
 
06:45:37.430 --> 06:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
taught um to students of an appropriate
 
06:45:40.948 --> 06:45:40.958 align:start position:0%
age which would be high school um and so
 
06:45:44.868 --> 06:45:44.878 align:start position:0%
that they know exactly the background of
 
06:45:47.708 --> 06:45:47.718 align:start position:0%
our history um which is why I ended off
 
06:45:50.990 --> 06:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
with The Good the Bad and the Ugly and
 
06:45:54.350 --> 06:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully um lessons can be learned from
 
06:45:56.270 --> 06:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
06:45:58.548 --> 06:45:58.558 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
06:46:00.708 --> 06:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:46:03.030 --> 06:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question representative so
 
06:46:04.868 --> 06:46:04.878 align:start position:0%
you all these things you didn't hear
 
06:46:06.990 --> 06:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
about when you were in high school or
 
06:46:08.990 --> 06:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
Junior High I do remember actually there
 
06:46:11.310 --> 06:46:11.320 align:start position:0%
was a book that I read when I was in
 
06:46:13.230 --> 06:46:13.240 align:start position:0%
school about the trailer tier so I I
 
06:46:14.750 --> 06:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
guess I was fortunate enough to have a
 
06:46:16.468 --> 06:46:16.478 align:start position:0%
teacher who did that I actually have a
 
06:46:18.990 --> 06:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
two-part question okay um how do you
 
06:46:21.030 --> 06:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
feel about local control or curriculum
 
06:46:23.150 --> 06:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
and I think that's important because we
 
06:46:26.430 --> 06:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
do have a long run the books and I
 
06:46:27.948 --> 06:46:27.958 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of times that I think we
 
06:46:30.430 --> 06:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
should defer to the teacher on what they
 
06:46:33.030 --> 06:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
should teach um just because they know
 
06:46:34.628 --> 06:46:34.638 align:start position:0%
Their audience how do you feel about the
 
06:46:36.750 --> 06:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
local controler
 
06:46:41.190 --> 06:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
curriculum oh wow um I'm sorry I wasn't
 
06:46:43.708 --> 06:46:43.718 align:start position:0%
expecting that question I'm really not
 
06:46:45.788 --> 06:46:45.798 align:start position:0%
prepared for that and that that's my
 
06:46:49.430 --> 06:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
honest that's my honest answer yes you
 
06:46:52.548 --> 06:46:52.558 align:start position:0%
know if I had a week to think about it I
 
06:46:54.910 --> 06:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
could come back and say got you know
 
06:46:58.948 --> 06:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
where to find you find me in reps Hall I
 
06:47:02.548 --> 06:47:02.558 align:start position:0%

yeah okay thank did you have a two-part
 
06:47:09.190 --> 06:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
I did but that's okay that's okay okay
 
06:47:11.830 --> 06:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
okay further questions see none thank
 
06:47:14.430 --> 06:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
06:47:29.350 --> 06:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:34.548 --> 06:47:34.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:36.430 --> 06:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for caring so much about
 
06:47:39.110 --> 06:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
education and talking about all of this
 
06:47:42.948 --> 06:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
my name is D Cohen I am a resident of
 
06:47:47.110 --> 06:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I'm opposed to HB 555
 
06:47:48.910 --> 06:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
I'm a mother of four
 
06:47:52.270 --> 06:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
children and I'm extremely worried when
 
06:47:55.990 --> 06:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
facts are taken over by deliberate false
 
06:47:58.070 --> 06:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
narratives HP
 
06:48:01.430 --> 06:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
555 would mandate the inclusion of the
 
06:48:04.468 --> 06:48:04.478 align:start position:0%
fabricated pal in genocide alongside
 
06:48:07.430 --> 06:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
Holocaust Education I come from a family
 
06:48:10.868 --> 06:48:10.878 align:start position:0%
of Holocaust Survivors and to me this is
 
06:48:15.468 --> 06:48:15.478 align:start position:0%
not equivalent in any possible way and
 
06:48:18.270 --> 06:48:18.280 align:start position:0%
taking the UN report as an
 
06:48:22.510 --> 06:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
example it is not the fact there are
 
06:48:25.548 --> 06:48:25.558 align:start position:0%
other sides to this and I don't think
 
06:48:28.670 --> 06:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
that it should be decided here what is
 
06:48:30.590 --> 06:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
factual and what is not it is what we
 
06:48:33.788 --> 06:48:33.798 align:start position:0%
want to give our kids the values
 
06:48:33.798 --> 06:48:36.590 align:start position:0%
want to give our kids the values
um

06:48:36.590 --> 06:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:48:39.948 --> 06:48:39.958 align:start position:0%
and there has not been any Palestinian
 
06:48:41.788 --> 06:48:41.798 align:start position:0%
genocide and in fact the population of
 
06:48:43.990 --> 06:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
the Palestinians grew tenfolds since
 
06:48:47.070 --> 06:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
1948 they're 14 million now so it's the
 
06:48:50.510 --> 06:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
opposite of what is defined as genocide
 
06:48:53.190 --> 06:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
this false narrative however if taught
 
06:48:55.990 --> 06:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
to kids basically follows the Hamas
 
06:48:58.030 --> 06:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
propaganda and will lead to teaching
 
06:49:00.150 --> 06:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
kids fake history and what's called
 
06:49:03.830 --> 06:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
Holocaust inversion it is wrong it will
 
06:49:06.948 --> 06:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
radicalize children in New Hampshire it
 
06:49:10.030 --> 06:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
will cause demonizing of
 
06:49:13.590 --> 06:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
Israel and anti-Semitism it is offensive
 
06:49:13.600 --> 06:49:14.910 align:start position:0%
Israel and anti-Semitism it is offensive
and

06:49:14.910 --> 06:49:14.920 align:start position:0%

deeply concerned and and
 
06:50:28.948 --> 06:50:28.958 align:start position:0%
petrified about the indoctrination that
 
06:50:31.030 --> 06:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
we're seeing in schools over the past
 
06:50:33.510 --> 06:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
couple years
 
06:50:36.788 --> 06:50:36.798 align:start position:0%
we've been witnessing the moral decay of
 
06:50:40.110 --> 06:50:40.120 align:start position:0%
our education system in what seems like
 
06:50:43.830 --> 06:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
a posttruth era activists are using
 
06:50:47.110 --> 06:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
classrooms to push false narratives that
 
06:50:49.628 --> 06:50:49.638 align:start position:0%
are indoctrinating our children and
 
06:50:52.270 --> 06:50:52.280 align:start position:0%
contributing to hate and divisiveness in
 
06:50:52.280 --> 06:50:53.468 align:start position:0%
contributing to hate and divisiveness in
our

06:50:53.468 --> 06:50:53.478 align:start position:0%
our
 
06:50:55.750 --> 06:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
communities the importance of Holocaust
 
06:50:58.110 --> 06:50:58.120 align:start position:0%
and genocide studies is
 
06:51:00.548 --> 06:51:00.558 align:start position:0%
indisputable one must understand the
 
06:51:03.070 --> 06:51:03.080 align:start position:0%
past in order to ensure that these
 
06:51:06.110 --> 06:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
horrific events do not repeat themselves
 
06:51:07.750 --> 06:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
not today and not in the
 
06:51:11.150 --> 06:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
future but allowing toxicity and
 
06:51:13.868 --> 06:51:13.878 align:start position:0%
indoctrination such as relying on the UN
 
06:51:17.230 --> 06:51:17.240 align:start position:0%
narrative that we know pushes the
 
06:51:19.510 --> 06:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
fabricated Narrative of the Palestinian
 
06:51:22.670 --> 06:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
genocide does nothing but promote
 
06:51:25.868 --> 06:51:25.878 align:start position:0%
hate war is a horrific thing but we need
 
06:51:29.708 --> 06:51:29.718 align:start position:0%
to be clear we need to teach the truth
 
06:51:31.510 --> 06:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
there has never been a Palestinian
 
06:51:34.190 --> 06:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
genocide if anything the population of
 
06:51:39.230 --> 06:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
the Palestinians has just grown um since
 
06:51:41.830 --> 06:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
1948 and that's not what genocide looks
 
06:51:44.750 --> 06:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
like rep Reed spoke eloquently and
 
06:51:47.388 --> 06:51:47.398 align:start position:0%
almost convincingly about in arguing for
 
06:51:49.910 --> 06:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
her new version of the bill which uh
 
06:51:52.070 --> 06:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
does not specify the Palestinian
 
06:51:54.430 --> 06:51:54.440 align:start position:0%
genocide as it did in the original but
 
06:51:56.788 --> 06:51:56.798 align:start position:0%
does bring the narratives of the UN the
 
06:52:00.830 --> 06:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
ICC the icj which those who have been
 
06:52:02.510 --> 06:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
here sat here before me Express
 
06:52:04.548 --> 06:52:04.558 align:start position:0%
addressed exactly the issues with them
 
06:52:07.868 --> 06:52:07.878 align:start position:0%
including unra who we all know had
 
06:52:11.150 --> 06:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
participants in the atrocities of
 
06:52:15.270 --> 06:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
October 7th and many other things that
 
06:52:17.310 --> 06:52:17.320 align:start position:0%
the UN has been pushing for that have
 
06:52:20.590 --> 06:52:20.600 align:start position:0%
been anti-semitic to say the
 
06:52:23.150 --> 06:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
least teaching the narrative plays into
 
06:52:26.190 --> 06:52:26.200 align:start position:0%
the same propaganda that Hamas a
 
06:52:29.230 --> 06:52:29.240 align:start position:0%
terrorist organization is using to
 
06:52:32.670 --> 06:52:32.680 align:start position:0%
justify the atrocities of October 7th
 
06:52:36.230 --> 06:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
the largest Massacre of Jews since the
 
06:52:40.310 --> 06:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
Holocaust and they're using it to turn
 
06:52:42.468 --> 06:52:42.478 align:start position:0%
this into an uprise against Jewish
 
06:52:44.910 --> 06:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
people worldwide we are seeing the state
 
06:52:47.670 --> 06:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
of anti-Semitism in the United States
 
06:52:51.150 --> 06:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
and it is appalling and
 
06:52:53.990 --> 06:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
terrifying more so this is a classic
 
06:52:56.030 --> 06:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
example of Holocaust
 
06:52:58.548 --> 06:52:58.558 align:start position:0%
inversion which uses this biggest
 
06:53:00.948 --> 06:53:00.958 align:start position:0%
tragedy to happen to the Jews against us
 
06:53:03.750 --> 06:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
and is one of the C lists for modern
 
06:53:06.230 --> 06:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism that we're seeing
 
06:53:10.590 --> 06:53:10.600 align:start position:0%
today to summarize HB 555 promotes the
 
06:53:13.590 --> 06:53:13.600 align:start position:0%
trend of using our classrooms to teach
 
06:53:16.030 --> 06:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
false narratives leading to increased
 
06:53:18.750 --> 06:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
intolerance and radical radicalization
 
06:53:23.150 --> 06:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
of children across the state I beg you
 
06:53:26.990 --> 06:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
stand for the truth stand against
 
06:53:30.708 --> 06:53:30.718 align:start position:0%
indoctrination stand against hate vote
 
06:53:32.990 --> 06:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
against this bill the thank you so much
 
06:53:34.910 --> 06:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
for your time if anyone has questions
 
06:53:37.590 --> 06:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer them thank you very
 
06:53:38.990 --> 06:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
very much for being here yes
 
06:53:41.310 --> 06:53:41.320 align:start position:0%
representative your turn thank you Mr
 
06:53:42.548 --> 06:53:42.558 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
06:53:45.350 --> 06:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
question so um we've heard a a lot uh
 
06:53:51.070 --> 06:53:51.080 align:start position:0%
today about um how this bill would be um
 
06:53:54.548 --> 06:53:54.558 align:start position:0%
teaching false truths in our schools um
 
06:53:56.788 --> 06:53:56.798 align:start position:0%
is it your belief that what is being
 
06:54:01.030 --> 06:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
taught in our schools now is truthful in
 
06:54:02.990 --> 06:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
which case I'm wondering why the purpose
 
06:54:04.030 --> 06:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
of the
 
06:54:06.430 --> 06:54:06.440 align:start position:0%
bill there are many different things
 
06:54:08.548 --> 06:54:08.558 align:start position:0%
that are being taught in schools um I
 
06:54:10.468 --> 06:54:10.478 align:start position:0%
think that there is definitely an issue
 
06:54:13.468 --> 06:54:13.478 align:start position:0%
in education today and indoctrination
 
06:54:15.350 --> 06:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
and the reason that I'm here is to
 
06:54:17.750 --> 06:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
oppose this specific bill that I think
 
06:54:22.310 --> 06:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
only would add to that um indoctrination
 
06:54:24.708 --> 06:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
and changing of the facts but by all
 
06:54:26.350 --> 06:54:26.360 align:start position:0%
means there are many issues with
 
06:54:28.830 --> 06:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
education and I wish that I could be on
 
06:54:31.910 --> 06:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
every single issue um unfortunately in
 
06:54:33.708 --> 06:54:33.718 align:start position:0%
the past couple of years I've been
 
06:54:35.590 --> 06:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism
 
06:54:37.910 --> 06:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
within school systems and one of the
 
06:54:40.510 --> 06:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
things that we're seeing is an increase
 
06:54:43.230 --> 06:54:43.240 align:start position:0%
of anti-Semitism that is tied directly
 
06:54:44.910 --> 06:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
to things that are being taught in
 
06:54:47.030 --> 06:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
schools and we're then seeing it on
 
06:54:49.388 --> 06:54:49.398 align:start position:0%
campus it doesn't start on campus it
 
06:54:51.708 --> 06:54:51.718 align:start position:0%
starts in their
 
06:54:54.830 --> 06:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
schools any further questions see none
 
06:54:56.510 --> 06:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and best of luck
 
06:54:58.350 --> 06:54:58.360 align:start position:0%
with your pregnancy thank
 
06:55:02.990 --> 06:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:08.388 --> 06:55:08.398 align:start position:0%
um cental Emory emmer I'm sorry for the
 
06:55:17.430 --> 06:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:20.590 --> 06:55:20.600 align:start position:0%
okay you can hear me all
 
06:55:26.750 --> 06:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
right uh I am an Turkish immigrant of 23
 
06:55:29.788 --> 06:55:29.798 align:start position:0%
years uh this bill this proposed Bill
 
06:55:32.510 --> 06:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
I've seen different versions of it in in
 
06:55:34.670 --> 06:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
different states Rhode Island
 
06:55:37.910 --> 06:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts a variety of places the
 
06:55:43.110 --> 06:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
reason I am involv and deeply care about
 
06:55:45.430 --> 06:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
um education Bill proposals such as this
 
06:55:48.708 --> 06:55:48.718 align:start position:0%
one is I work very closely with the
 
06:55:52.350 --> 06:55:52.360 align:start position:0%
Immigrant communities in our area
 
06:55:54.388 --> 06:55:54.398 align:start position:0%
primarily Turkish but a lot of
 
06:55:57.948 --> 06:55:57.958 align:start position:0%
immigrants and not necessarily just from
 
06:55:59.948 --> 06:55:59.958 align:start position:0%
uh Middle Eastern
 
06:56:02.388 --> 06:56:02.398 align:start position:0%
countries what I have seen in the past
 
06:56:05.388 --> 06:56:05.398 align:start position:0%
as then there's conversations education
 
06:56:08.110 --> 06:56:08.120 align:start position:0%
Bill conversations that involve claims
 
06:56:10.590 --> 06:56:10.600 align:start position:0%
of genocide Holocaust and
 
06:56:15.230 --> 06:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
Etc these bills ended up creating a
 
06:56:18.110 --> 06:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
negative environment at our in our
 
06:56:22.430 --> 06:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
schools our children um who come from uh
 
06:56:26.270 --> 06:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
countries or societies um where such
 
06:56:28.910 --> 06:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
such claims have been made from have
 
06:56:31.750 --> 06:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
seen a lot of Oppression there have been
 
06:56:33.510 --> 06:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
hate crimes crimes documented hate
 
06:56:35.388 --> 06:56:35.398 align:start position:0%
crimes even that took
 
06:56:38.468 --> 06:56:38.478 align:start position:0%
place just in the last 5 years or so
 
06:56:41.388 --> 06:56:41.398 align:start position:0%
there has been a half a dozen or perhaps
 
06:56:46.070 --> 06:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
more documented cases of um uh verbal
 
06:56:48.350 --> 06:56:48.360 align:start position:0%
abuses and various attacks in in our
 
06:56:51.910 --> 06:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
school systems just because there are
 
06:56:54.350 --> 06:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
children uh who come from those
 
06:56:57.628 --> 06:56:57.638 align:start position:0%
backgrounds in my case it has been
 
06:57:00.830 --> 06:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
Turkish versus Armenian in another case
 
06:57:04.270 --> 06:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
it could be Jewish versus Arab doesn't
 
06:57:06.750 --> 06:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
matter I understand all the
 
06:57:10.150 --> 06:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
sensitivities of the situation I really
 
06:57:12.548 --> 06:57:12.558 align:start position:0%
Commander representative read about the
 
06:57:15.708 --> 06:57:15.718 align:start position:0%
fact that there is an amended language
 
06:57:18.990 --> 06:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
in the bill that takes away specific
 
06:57:21.910 --> 06:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
verb verbage for uh specific societies
 
06:57:25.430 --> 06:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
countries heritages I really appreciate
 
06:57:29.150 --> 06:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
that however I find find that um many
 
06:57:33.310 --> 06:57:33.320 align:start position:0%
members have spoken today are against uh
 
06:57:35.270 --> 06:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
this bill completely because there's a
 
06:57:38.350 --> 06:57:38.360 align:start position:0%
reference to United Nations just want to
 
06:57:39.910 --> 06:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
clarify one
 
06:57:44.110 --> 06:57:44.120 align:start position:0%
thing uh United Nations across so many
 
06:57:48.030 --> 06:57:48.040 align:start position:0%
other bodies internationally is one that
 
06:57:51.590 --> 06:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
has still the most globally accepted
 
06:57:54.150 --> 06:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
body probably I'm not an expert of the
 
06:57:56.750 --> 06:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
topic but the reason United Nations is
 
06:57:59.868 --> 06:57:59.878 align:start position:0%
in here is they are the global body that
 
06:58:01.708 --> 06:58:01.718 align:start position:0%
have studied this topic in the most
 
06:58:04.990 --> 06:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
compreh prehensive way without that we
 
06:58:08.030 --> 06:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
will be left to our own devices and
 
06:58:10.070 --> 06:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
there will be a lot of fighting and
 
06:58:13.468 --> 06:58:13.478 align:start position:0%
arguments and never a peaceful
 
06:58:16.030 --> 06:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
resolution maybe there's a better option
 
06:58:18.230 --> 06:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a better outcome that is
 
06:58:21.270 --> 06:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
more inclusive and less discriminating
 
06:58:23.590 --> 06:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
to different members of our
 
06:58:26.070 --> 06:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
society I just wanted to let you know
 
06:58:29.150 --> 06:58:29.160 align:start position:0%

06:58:31.310 --> 06:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
with this very sensitive very delicate
 
06:58:34.430 --> 06:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
topic I would like to see less
 
06:58:36.750 --> 06:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
discrimination and More inclusivity in
 
06:58:39.230 --> 06:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
our societies doesn't matter what
 
06:58:42.468 --> 06:58:42.478 align:start position:0%
background we really come from I do deal

uh I see what happens to immigrants on
 
06:58:51.788 --> 06:58:51.798 align:start position:0%

and um different types of hate or
 
06:58:58.990 --> 06:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
historical um historically sensitive
 
06:59:02.468 --> 06:59:02.478 align:start position:0%
topics are shared with our children we
 
06:59:05.990 --> 06:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
do have documented cases that end up
 
06:59:08.990 --> 06:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
creating sad sad outcomes thank you so

06:59:57.750 --> 06:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
to this amendment to the law HB 555 from
 
07:00:00.070 --> 07:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
happening thank you chairman cordelli
 
07:00:01.990 --> 07:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
and to this committee for the
 
07:00:03.510 --> 07:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak with you
 
07:00:05.430 --> 07:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
today if I
 
07:00:09.670 --> 07:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
may with all due respect why has any New
 
07:00:11.230 --> 07:00:11.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire House of Representative
 
07:00:14.150 --> 07:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
decided there is a Palestinian
 
07:00:16.590 --> 07:00:16.600 align:start position:0%
genocide while I know with 100%
 
07:00:18.948 --> 07:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
certainty it is not true Israel is
 
07:00:20.868 --> 07:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
simply defending itself our
 
07:00:22.868 --> 07:00:22.878 align:start position:0%
representative should not be stating it
 
07:00:25.750 --> 07:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
as a fact this is not only hugely
 
07:00:25.760 --> 07:00:27.070 align:start position:0%
as a fact this is not only hugely
inacurate

07:00:27.070 --> 07:00:27.080 align:start position:0%
inacurate
 
07:00:30.708 --> 07:00:30.718 align:start position:0%
inaccurate but it is massively
 
07:00:32.990 --> 07:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
Dangerous by including this term are
 
07:00:35.948 --> 07:00:35.958 align:start position:0%
just Sentiments of it in any way in any
 
07:00:38.590 --> 07:00:38.600 align:start position:0%
leg legislation does just
 
07:00:41.190 --> 07:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
this the danger to Jewish Americans is
 
07:00:43.510 --> 07:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
making this declaration in making this
 
07:00:45.468 --> 07:00:45.478 align:start position:0%
declaration declaration cannot be
 
07:00:49.230 --> 07:00:49.240 align:start position:0%
underscored enough anti-Semitism was bad
 
07:00:52.150 --> 07:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
enough before October 7th
 
07:00:54.628 --> 07:00:54.638 align:start position:0%
2023 no one can refute the fact that it
 
07:00:57.708 --> 07:00:57.718 align:start position:0%
is Raging with physical security at risk
 
07:01:00.070 --> 07:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
as a result
 
07:01:02.510 --> 07:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
now if this bill were to to pass New
 
07:01:04.510 --> 07:01:04.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is clearly stating Israel does
 
07:01:05.990 --> 07:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
not have a right to
 
07:01:08.230 --> 07:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
exist that is not what the majority of
 
07:01:10.590 --> 07:01:10.600 align:start position:0%
Americans believe or how they vote I do
 
07:01:11.910 --> 07:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
not think anyone here wants to be
 
07:01:14.230 --> 07:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
responsible for even suggesting
 
07:01:16.590 --> 07:01:16.600 align:start position:0%
this even considering the term
 
07:01:18.230 --> 07:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
Palestinian genocide and whatever
 
07:01:21.590 --> 07:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
fashion will incite either even further
 
07:01:25.110 --> 07:01:25.120 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism as I stated I am American
 
07:01:27.830 --> 07:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
and I am Jewish I have very sadly lived
 
07:01:31.990 --> 07:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
with anti-Semitism my whole life without
 
07:01:34.510 --> 07:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
out I feel even less safe in my own
 
07:01:38.270 --> 07:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
country now than I have ever felt Israel
 
07:01:39.910 --> 07:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
made the grave mistake of letting its
 
07:01:43.110 --> 07:01:43.120 align:start position:0%
guard down on October 7th 2023 by not
 
07:01:45.948 --> 07:01:45.958 align:start position:0%
protecting its citizens from Pure
 
07:01:48.788 --> 07:01:48.798 align:start position:0%
Evil My Country the United States of
 
07:01:52.030 --> 07:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
America must not follow suit my country
 
07:01:53.948 --> 07:01:53.958 align:start position:0%
has the absolute responsibility to
 
07:01:56.590 --> 07:01:56.600 align:start position:0%
protect me by passing this law I would
 
07:01:59.510 --> 07:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
most definitively be dramatically left
 
07:02:03.110 --> 07:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
safe what we all know anti-Semitism is a
 
07:02:06.388 --> 07:02:06.398 align:start position:0%
disease that spreads like wildfire we
 
07:02:08.708 --> 07:02:08.718 align:start position:0%
see how it's ripped at the core of our
 
07:02:11.230 --> 07:02:11.240 align:start position:0%
universities with this law what this law
 
07:02:14.030 --> 07:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
would do is start this process much
 
07:02:16.190 --> 07:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
earlier in our young people's
 
07:02:19.430 --> 07:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
lives let us be clear we own we all know
 
07:02:21.190 --> 07:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
that even babies are being indoctrinated
 
07:02:23.708 --> 07:02:23.718 align:start position:0%
to hate Jewish people from babies being
 
07:02:25.868 --> 07:02:25.878 align:start position:0%
at the in quotes ceremony where the
 
07:02:27.788 --> 07:02:27.798 align:start position:0%
murdered BS mother and children were
 
07:02:29.468 --> 07:02:29.478 align:start position:0%
finally released to their Insidious
 
07:02:31.990 --> 07:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
school studies damning Jews New
 
07:02:33.430 --> 07:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is at Great risk of
 
07:02:36.110 --> 07:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
systematically doing exactly the same by
 
07:02:38.310 --> 07:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
bringing this term or any sentiment of
 
07:02:40.070 --> 07:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
it to our children in our
 
07:02:42.510 --> 07:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
schools in good conscience we cannot
 
07:02:45.430 --> 07:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
update any any law that suggests such a
 
07:02:47.910 --> 07:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
thing the lies of your fellow Americans
 
07:02:49.910 --> 07:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
are at Major risk here and the minds of
 
07:02:52.430 --> 07:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
Young Americans must not be inaccurately
 
07:02:55.350 --> 07:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
and Mal maliciously indoctrinated as we
 
07:02:57.190 --> 07:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
are witnessing in other places we are
 
07:02:59.468 --> 07:02:59.478 align:start position:0%

the commission but a couple of us are
 
07:04:34.270 --> 07:04:34.280 align:start position:0%
here um I do want to recommend to
 
07:04:36.670 --> 07:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
everyone the uh both the the minutes of
 
07:04:38.468 --> 07:04:38.478 align:start position:0%
the commission which met just a few
 
07:04:41.230 --> 07:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
weeks ago and the regulations uh I think
 
07:04:43.110 --> 07:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
Dana referred to that that actually
 
07:04:45.310 --> 07:04:45.320 align:start position:0%
implementing regulations which was a
 
07:04:47.628 --> 07:04:47.638 align:start position:0%
painstaking process that that I don't
 
07:04:49.670 --> 07:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
understand by which the State Board of
 
07:04:51.628 --> 07:04:51.638 align:start position:0%
Education is that right um takes the
 
07:04:54.070 --> 07:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
intents and um and actually many of the
 
07:04:55.708 --> 07:04:55.718 align:start position:0%
things including many of the specifics
 
07:04:57.830 --> 07:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
that were in the original proposal were
 
07:04:59.628 --> 07:04:59.638 align:start position:0%
you know were considered and and kind of
 
07:05:02.708 --> 07:05:02.718 align:start position:0%
worked in and um and uh the committee
 
07:05:04.948 --> 07:05:04.958 align:start position:0%
certainly should should look at those
 
07:05:06.868 --> 07:05:06.878 align:start position:0%
and and I do want so B to be reassuring
 
07:05:09.110 --> 07:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
to everybody that we we take this very
 
07:05:12.070 --> 07:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
seriously as a uh as a democracy
 
07:05:14.628 --> 07:05:14.638 align:start position:0%
education for the present it's Holocaust
 
07:05:17.670 --> 07:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
and genocide studies and and I will and
 
07:05:19.070 --> 07:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
because it's really a dimension of
 
07:05:21.750 --> 07:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
democracy studies and civic education
 
07:05:23.868 --> 07:05:23.878 align:start position:0%
and as a member of the Jewish Community
 
07:05:25.670 --> 07:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
with my own set of experiences and
 
07:05:28.190 --> 07:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
experiences of my group but also as a as
 
07:05:30.468 --> 07:05:30.478 align:start position:0%
a as a patriot I think and a Civic
 
07:05:32.868 --> 07:05:32.878 align:start position:0%
leader in my community I see this as not
 
07:05:34.830 --> 07:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
just about the past but very much about
 
07:05:37.430 --> 07:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
the the present and uh and uh and the
 
07:05:40.070 --> 07:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
future and see the strength of New
 
07:05:41.590 --> 07:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire trying to be brought to bear
 
07:05:42.830 --> 07:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
and making sure these things don't
 
07:05:44.830 --> 07:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
happen and seeing them where they do um
 
07:05:46.150 --> 07:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
and I've been before this committee
 
07:05:47.830 --> 07:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
before in different iterations talking
 
07:05:50.350 --> 07:05:50.360 align:start position:0%
about how to do other things to invest
 
07:05:52.868 --> 07:05:52.878 align:start position:0%
better in our social studies education
 
07:05:55.230 --> 07:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
um to deal with the divisive Concepts
 
07:05:57.510 --> 07:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
framework which is preventing uh many
 
07:05:59.150 --> 07:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
teachers from even delving into this
 
07:06:01.190 --> 07:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
area at all and feeling uh confused and
 
07:06:03.030 --> 07:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
one of the the things you can do is to
 
07:06:06.430 --> 07:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
kind of resolve uh resolve those things
 
07:06:08.310 --> 07:06:08.320 align:start position:0%
um I certainly would be grateful if the
 
07:06:09.990 --> 07:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
attention to this bill and the
 
07:06:11.070 --> 07:06:11.080 align:start position:0%
commission and the Mandate would
 
07:06:12.910 --> 07:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
increase knowledge about it and urgency
 
07:06:15.310 --> 07:06:15.320 align:start position:0%
about teaching um Holocaust and genocide
 
07:06:17.628 --> 07:06:17.638 align:start position:0%
studies generally and uh and kind of
 
07:06:20.388 --> 07:06:20.398 align:start position:0%
democracy and Civics um even more even
 
07:06:20.398 --> 07:06:21.150 align:start position:0%
democracy and Civics um even more even
more

07:06:21.150 --> 07:06:21.160 align:start position:0%
more
 
07:06:24.310 --> 07:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
generally um I do want to say that um I
 
07:06:26.670 --> 07:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
came in originally to to oppose the bill
 
07:06:28.388 --> 07:06:28.398 align:start position:0%
as formulated because of the the
 
07:06:31.830 --> 07:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
Palestine proposition as someone who is
 
07:06:35.270 --> 07:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
um an American Jew and a Zionist who has
 
07:06:37.310 --> 07:06:37.320 align:start position:0%
been a supporter and still is of
 
07:06:40.430 --> 07:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
Palestinian national rights uh for 37
 
07:06:42.910 --> 07:06:42.920 align:start position:0%
years since I was a student in Jerusalem
 
07:06:45.070 --> 07:06:45.080 align:start position:0%
um taught to me by my by my rabbis in
 
07:06:47.070 --> 07:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
Jerusalem actually as a matter of Jewish
 
07:06:49.868 --> 07:06:49.878 align:start position:0%
principle of Torah as we say and of and
 
07:06:53.830 --> 07:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
of Zionism and um and that designating
 
07:06:55.910 --> 07:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
one particular uh the experience of
 
07:06:57.990 --> 07:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
Palestinians as a genocide or the
 
07:07:00.190 --> 07:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
genocide taking place in the Middle East
 
07:07:02.230 --> 07:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
um is not in support of peace and I
 
07:07:04.548 --> 07:07:04.558 align:start position:0%
could talk about the ways and I I don't
 
07:07:06.510 --> 07:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's a field of the bill
 
07:07:07.948 --> 07:07:07.958 align:start position:0%
but I think you should know that there
 
07:07:09.510 --> 07:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
are people in New Hampshire and people
 
07:07:11.910 --> 07:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
that that we are connected to the Jewish
 
07:07:13.830 --> 07:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
Community the Israeli American Community
 
07:07:15.708 --> 07:07:15.718 align:start position:0%
who are involved in Jewish Arab
 
07:07:18.190 --> 07:07:18.200 align:start position:0%
coexistence um in every kind of sphere
 
07:07:20.230 --> 07:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
that you can imagine and uh wh some of
 
07:07:22.628 --> 07:07:22.638 align:start position:0%
whom grew up here and uh or some of whom
 
07:07:24.430 --> 07:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
are are very uh closely connected to
 
07:07:26.230 --> 07:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
families here and they are uh
 
07:07:27.590 --> 07:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
connections that we should be proud of
 
07:07:28.990 --> 07:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
about and they continue their work even
 
07:07:32.070 --> 07:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
after the atrocities of of October 7th
 
07:07:35.270 --> 07:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
2023 and um they and and the people who
 
07:07:37.190 --> 07:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
know them here and I you know are
 
07:07:39.750 --> 07:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
resources to try to not only head off
 
07:07:41.670 --> 07:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
something which is a kind of Insidious
 
07:07:43.070 --> 07:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
version of interpretation of the
 
07:07:45.110 --> 07:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
conflict but with something more
 
07:07:47.350 --> 07:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
hopeful um I think that the other thing
 
07:07:49.628 --> 07:07:49.638 align:start position:0%
that I want to say is that uh well I
 
07:07:51.110 --> 07:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
think I'll say two other things one is
 
07:07:52.868 --> 07:07:52.878 align:start position:0%
so I'm the parent of a of a college
 
07:07:55.670 --> 07:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
student on on I'll say one of the the
 
07:07:58.868 --> 07:07:58.878 align:start position:0%
more terrible campuses where um where
 
07:08:00.830 --> 07:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
the where the the matter of Israel
 
07:08:04.350 --> 07:08:04.360 align:start position:0%
Palestine has been happening and um and
 
07:08:05.388 --> 07:08:05.398 align:start position:0%
unfortunately some of what's been
 
07:08:06.788 --> 07:08:06.798 align:start position:0%
happening in education particularly as
 
07:08:09.190 --> 07:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
it's trickled down into um into high
 
07:08:10.990 --> 07:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
school education is that some of the
 
07:08:12.750 --> 07:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
materials that are being generated about
 
07:08:14.830 --> 07:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
this are are are built on such
 
07:08:16.948 --> 07:08:16.958 align:start position:0%
falsehoods about what is going on and
 
07:08:18.548 --> 07:08:18.558 align:start position:0%
and as much as anything else my fear is
 
07:08:20.430 --> 07:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
not that we talk about it or that the
 
07:08:21.868 --> 07:08:21.878 align:start position:0%
student couldn't raise the question of
 
07:08:23.670 --> 07:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
Palestine but that the materials that
 
07:08:25.548 --> 07:08:25.558 align:start position:0%
are most accessible to our teachers are
 
07:08:27.468 --> 07:08:27.478 align:start position:0%
are terrible materials and I think
 
07:08:29.270 --> 07:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
that's been been referenced before and
 
07:08:31.990 --> 07:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know can can be happy to to add to
 
07:08:34.270 --> 07:08:34.280 align:start position:0%
that um and at the same time and with
 
07:08:36.150 --> 07:08:36.160 align:start position:0%
you know sort of quivering in myself and
 
07:08:38.868 --> 07:08:38.878 align:start position:0%
my own emotion um I also want to be
 
07:08:40.388 --> 07:08:40.398 align:start position:0%
clear something that I think I said in
 
07:08:42.190 --> 07:08:42.200 align:start position:0%
my if not in my initial testimony when
 
07:08:44.270 --> 07:08:44.280 align:start position:0%
we were talking about establishing this
 
07:08:46.628 --> 07:08:46.638 align:start position:0%
mandate that certainly in other forums
 
07:08:49.590 --> 07:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
and uh uh and uh and at the commission
 
07:08:52.468 --> 07:08:52.478 align:start position:0%
is that uh if a student wants to take
 
07:08:54.070 --> 07:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
what they've learned in the holoc
 
07:08:56.070 --> 07:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
Holocaust and genocide education that
 
07:08:57.628 --> 07:08:57.638 align:start position:0%
they've experienced and ask and say I've
 
07:08:59.388 --> 07:08:59.398 align:start position:0%
heard something about Palestine or
 
07:09:01.150 --> 07:09:01.160 align:start position:0%
Israel Palestine how do I learn more
 
07:09:02.830 --> 07:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
about about that then then it's
 
07:09:04.468 --> 07:09:04.478 align:start position:0%
education and it should be real
 
07:09:06.510 --> 07:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
education based on real sources and
 
07:09:08.468 --> 07:09:08.478 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and all of that so that
 
07:09:10.388 --> 07:09:10.398 align:start position:0%
they can take the concepts that they are
 
07:09:13.468 --> 07:09:13.478 align:start position:0%
learning and uh and apply them um and I
 
07:09:15.948 --> 07:09:15.958 align:start position:0%
want to be there as a Jewish Resource as
 
07:09:18.270 --> 07:09:18.280 align:start position:0%
someone who's knowledgeable and academic
 
07:09:19.750 --> 07:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
um for them as I'm sure there are other
 
07:09:22.430 --> 07:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
resources here I offer that to you to to
 
07:09:24.990 --> 07:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
Educators to members of the public um I
 
07:09:26.230 --> 07:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
do this kind of teaching in the
 
07:09:28.510 --> 07:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
community um I'm not afraid of that
 
07:09:30.990 --> 07:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
conversation and um but there are better
 
07:09:32.948 --> 07:09:32.958 align:start position:0%
and worse ways and and some of the worst
 
07:09:35.270 --> 07:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
ways we've been experiencing um in
 
07:09:36.788 --> 07:09:36.798 align:start position:0%
education and I don't want them to come
 
07:09:41.388 --> 07:09:41.398 align:start position:0%
to to New Hampshire um so um I think
 
07:09:43.548 --> 07:09:43.558 align:start position:0%
that that is uh is what I'll say about
 
07:09:45.350 --> 07:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
that and um if you have questions
 
07:09:47.430 --> 07:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
otherwise thank you thank you very much
 
07:09:49.990 --> 07:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
