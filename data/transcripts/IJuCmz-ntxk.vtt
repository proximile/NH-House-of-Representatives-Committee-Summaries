00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:22.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440 align:start position:0%

00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
composed of 19 members 10 of which will
 
00:08:27.599 --> 00:08:28.869 align:start position:0%
composed of 19 members 10 of which will
be

00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
republican and 9 democratic which i
 
00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
guess is in proportion to the number
 
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
of seats in the full house
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
and as i indicated earlier i've been
 
00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
appointed as chairman
 
00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
but mark mclean is serving as our vice
 
00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:46.630 align:start position:0%
but mark mclean is serving as our vice
chair

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
and uh kurt wolper has graciously agreed
 
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:54.090 align:start position:0%
to serve as our clerk again
 
00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.550 align:start position:0%
to serve as our clerk again
[Music]

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
we did a fine job last year and
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh representative smith who was our
 
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
chair last year will be the ranking
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
minority member and with her deputy her
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
second command being
 
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
charlotte representative d lorenzo
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
i can only hope that i could do half a
 
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
good a job as uh
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
as representative smith did last year
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
last turn
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
you're here it's kind of you to say ned
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
but i
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
assume you're going to do twice as good
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
a job
 
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
well i will i will do my i'll do my best
 
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
to uh that's what i mean i rest my case
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
so i i guess the maybe the best way to
 
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
start is and i think this is the way we
 
00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:43.990 align:start position:0%
start is and i think this is the way we
started

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
started
 
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
two years ago with you representative
 
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
smith and that was just
 
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
having everybody go around and do a
 
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
brief introduction
 
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
particularly for the benefit of any new
 
00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.470 align:start position:0%
particularly for the benefit of any new
members

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.480 align:start position:0%

specifically a passion for housing

policies so
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%

just started my my seventh term so i'm
 
00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:35.839 align:start position:0%
just starting to learn how this place
 
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
works so i've been on
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
this is my fifth term on judiciary um
 
00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:41.839 align:start position:0%
before that
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
um i was on a something called the
 
00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
petitions and redress committee which
 
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
speaker bill o'brien
 
00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
tried for a year and it was not a
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
terribly successful experiment but it
 
00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
was kind of funny and i was also on a
 
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
election law for a term and um
 
00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
ironically before i was state rep one of
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
the things i was working on as a private
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
citizen was like
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
legacy rep my father served in the late
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
1970s and early 1980s and i
 
00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
and when we're back in the state house i
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
often seems like my name tag
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
looked a little bit older than the
 
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0%
others so i've often
 
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
wondered if maybe they put his in the
 
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
they put his in the storage room and
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
then pulled it out again when another
 
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
rep with the same name
 
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
came along but i don't know that for
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
sure but
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
so that that's basically that's
 
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
basically who i am and you'll
 
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
i guess you'll get to know me uh more
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia
 
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh it's a uh i think it'll be a great
 
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
committee and
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
a good committee to uh to work with and
 
00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
to accomplish things i think that's
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh certainly my focus or my objective
 
00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.350 align:start position:0%
uh certainly my focus or my objective
and

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
that's i'm frankly not very partisan
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
my focus is on getting things done and i
 
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
hope it appears to me that this is the
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
type of committee that will do that
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
but you do have 47 bills that have been
 
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:55.750 align:start position:0%
but you do have 47 bills that have been
signed

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
signed
 
00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
assigned to the committee so far
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
stratford county district 18 which is
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
somersworth in rollinsford
 
00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
and my family has been traced back to
 
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
living in new hampshire since the late
 
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
1700s so i'm a true native
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
a true native i just wanted to say where
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
i was
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
who i represented thank you no you're
 
00:28:13.679 --> 00:28:14.389 align:start position:0%
who i represented thank you no you're
you're

00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
you're welcome the uh
 
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
we do have 47 bills that have been
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
and uh i think lots of the questions
 
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
that would ordinarily be addressed at an
 
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
orientation meeting we're not going to
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:36.559 align:start position:0%
and we do anticipate that there will be
 
00:28:36.559 --> 00:28:37.029 align:start position:0%
and we do anticipate that there will be
long

00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:37.039 align:start position:0%
long
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
hearings and that's one thing that you
 
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
a couple of things one is uh
 
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
they hope to outfit the
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
legislative office building so that we
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
can hold hearings there
 
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
in double wide rooms to open up the
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
rooms to have double rooms
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
and to allow people to attend in person
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
but i think it's also their plan for
 
00:29:04.799 --> 00:29:05.269 align:start position:0%
but i think it's also their plan for
both

00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:08.799 align:start position:0%
at this point in time for both hearings
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
on bills and also for executive sessions
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
to allow
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
and so if you are feeling uncomfortable
 
00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:21.909 align:start position:0%
and so if you are feeling uncomfortable
about

00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:21.919 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
actually attending hearings that you may
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
be able to participate
 
00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:30.310 align:start position:0%
be able to participate
remotely

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
the i know there's been a question as to
 
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
whether or not mass would be required i
 
00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:35.669 align:start position:0%
whether or not mass would be required i
certainly

00:29:35.669 --> 00:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
would prefer that people wear masks
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
particularly given
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
my own health concerns and would
 
00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:42.470 align:start position:0%
my own health concerns and would
encourage

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
encourage
 
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
wearing masks if in fact people are
 
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
going to participate in the hearing
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
although i'm not sure that they can be
 
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
we certainly the rooms will be set up so
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
that we can socially distance
 
00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
and i understand that there are air
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
treatment systems that have been ordered
 
00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
and were supposed to be delivered this
 
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
week for the rooms so
 
00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:07.039 align:start position:0%
to make to address
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
those particular issues with regard to
 
00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
they're looking as they're looking
 
00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:21.919 align:start position:0%
for long hearing so they're there
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
they feel that they only would be able
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
to run
 
00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
four hearings perhaps at a time at most
 
00:30:30.389 --> 00:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
five hearings at a time
 
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
in the legislative office building
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
and given the number of committees that
 
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.269 align:start position:0%
and given the number of committees that
means

00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
means
 
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
that in order to make that work
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
there needs to be two things happen one
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
is we probably will have to have
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
committee meetings five days a week
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
uh or aveda that the committee hearing
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
rooms will be available five days a week
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
so there maybe have to be committee
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
hearings on fridays
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
and mondays and not just the tuesdays
 
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
wednesdays and thursdays
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
that we've been accustomed to and
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
and if we do have hearings that may be
 
00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:12.799 align:start position:0%
full day hearing days
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
and as i indicated earlier before we
 
00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.310 align:start position:0%
and as i indicated earlier before we
started

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
started
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
you know he with 47 bills that means
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
that we'd
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
at least have to have five full days
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
it's anticipated that testimony will be
 
00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.630 align:start position:0%
it's anticipated that testimony will be
given

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
given
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
remotely that people will not be
 
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
appearing to testify
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
for the committees all testimony will be
 
00:31:35.279 --> 00:31:38.149 align:start position:0%
for the committees all testimony will be
remote

00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
at this point in time with regard to
 
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.149 align:start position:0%
at this point in time with regard to
what

00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
traditionally are known as the blue
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
sheets and the pink cards
 
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
i don't believe unless it was decided
 
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
yesterday that the house has actually
 
00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:54.559 align:start position:0%
come to terms as to how those will be
 
00:31:54.559 --> 00:31:55.830 align:start position:0%
come to terms as to how those will be
done

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
i did testify in a senate hearing
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
yesterday and
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
they did have online what is the
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
equivalent of the pink card
 
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
or the blue sheet and
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
you were able to use that well it seems
 
00:32:10.399 --> 00:32:11.269 align:start position:0%
you were able to use that well it seems
that

00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
that system ought to be able to be used
 
00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:14.950 align:start position:0%
that system ought to be able to be used
or

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
to accommodate the house as well but as
 
00:32:17.679 --> 00:32:18.310 align:start position:0%
to accommodate the house as well but as
yet

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that those things have been
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
figured out nor have they figured out
 
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
how testimony will be submitted
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
with regard to the bills themselves what
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
i would certainly plan to do you know
 
00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
there are different types
 
00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
just as has been done in the past i'm
 
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
sure that we can clump
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
bills together to be heard that have a
 
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
common theme
 
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
we have the right to know bills for
 
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
example and
 
00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
bills that have to do with court
 
00:32:52.159 --> 00:32:54.230 align:start position:0%
bills that have to do with court
administration

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
administration
 
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
some bills that have to do just with
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
legal process or
 
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant or personal privacy or
 
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
reproductive rights or restrictions and
 
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:04.870 align:start position:0%
reproductive rights or restrictions and
so

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:07.039 align:start position:0%
what i do is i'll try to lump them all
 
00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
together so that they can be heard at
 
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
some bills may not require
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
immediate action and the question is
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
on those types of bills should we retain
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
them do we need to actually act on all
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
of those bills this session would it be
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
better to retain
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
some of the bills and then think about
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
working on them
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
when the world is a little bit different
 
00:33:37.519 --> 00:33:37.990 align:start position:0%
when the world is a little bit different
and

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
perhaps we would have more time to
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
address the bills
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
rather than to rush through
 
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
that's a great idea i like that idea but
 
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
i don't think a lot of people in the
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
room understand what
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
you mean when you say that we should
 
00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
retain them and work on them when we
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
have more time
 
00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
well by retaining
 
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
my intent would be to uh
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
and i don't know what the official
 
00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
language is in the first session whether
 
00:34:13.589 --> 00:34:13.599 align:start position:0%
it's retained
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
i think it's retained but retain the
 
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.270 align:start position:0%
i think it's retained but retain the
bill

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
the idea is that it would then be worked
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
on in the
 
00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
generally in the fall or sometime
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
after but generally in this particular
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
case in the fall
 
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
and then come back before the
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
legislature in the second year
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
of the session
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
and by the beginning of
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
next session it may be that enough
 
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
people have been
 
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
vaccinated or we have
 
00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
or we will have more ability to get
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
together and
 
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
work on things than we do currently
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
knowing that margery is isolated and
 
00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:00.829 align:start position:0%
knowing that margery is isolated and
[Laughter]

00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:35:00.839 --> 00:35:02.310 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
durham

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
durham
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
gordon at a good time representative
 
00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
smith and horrigan um have questions
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
yeah and representative smith
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much mr chair um
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
i am conscious kurt
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
raised one issue that i want to raise i
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
am conscious that we have a few freshmen
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure the reference to pink
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
cards and blue sheets translates
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
into normal english communication
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
so could you kind of explore that whole
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
bit about
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
how we hear from people
 
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
either as testimony or in terms of their
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
just being able to voice their opinion
 
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
right the pink cards typically are cards
 
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
which you
 
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
submit generally when you are going to
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
testify and testify in favor
 
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
or an opposition or just to provide
 
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
information on
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
on a bill and submit it to
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
the committee on the committee chair
 
00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.470 align:start position:0%
the committee on the committee chair
typically

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
typically
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
to be called on to participate so
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
basically it triggers your act of
 
00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:19.829 align:start position:0%
basically it triggers your act of
particip

00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:19.839 align:start position:0%
particip
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
basically a pink card triggers your
 
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
active participation in the committee
 
00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.829 align:start position:0%
active participation in the committee
process

00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:25.839 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
as generally a member of the public
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
or a lobbyist who intends to speak on a
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
the blue sheets themselves generally
 
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
indicate uh your support
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
or or against a bill
 
00:36:49.349 --> 00:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
and so that you can register your
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
support for a particular
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
bill one way or the other
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
and is that an adequate explanation
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
well i guess we have to ask the freshmen
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
who are on the committee
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
as to whether it's adequate i mean do
 
00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
they think we're speaking a foreign
 
00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:09.589 align:start position:0%
they think we're speaking a foreign
language

00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
or can they figure it out that's my
 
00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:14.790 align:start position:0%
or can they figure it out that's my
question

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
i would encourage the new members to ask
 
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
any questions that they might have
 
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
good idea thank you with regard to the
 
00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:26.630 align:start position:0%
good idea thank you with regard to the
process

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
the uh and also it's pretty typical for
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
people to submit written testimony and
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a mechanism for the
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
submission of that
 
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
right now that leads into
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
that leads into my main question which
 
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
was um actually we had
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
i think this committee just had an
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
executive session but several committees
 
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:48.390 align:start position:0%
executive session but several committees
did

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
actually have hearings especially all
 
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
the finance
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
bills that finance was going to hear
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
like in the last half of march
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
adhering so there is a procedure they
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
cobbled together and it actually worked
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
pretty well
 
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
effect i'm gonna say it probably worked
 
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.030 align:start position:0%
effect i'm gonna say it probably worked
better

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
than how we did it before because you
 
00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
would email basically you would uh
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
submit it you know up to uh up to up to
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
the staff from the fourth floor and then
 
00:38:13.109 --> 00:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
they would uh
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
then they would you know then and send
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
it on to the committee so i think that
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
worked better in the old procedure where
 
00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:19.190 align:start position:0%
worked better in the old procedure where
you

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
pass the papers around the table because
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes people don't bring
 
00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:23.430 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes people don't bring
enough

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
enough
 
00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
we had one freaking visitor who would
 
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
drink one copy and then
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
complain about how expensive
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
photocopying was although she eventually
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
started emailing us our stuff
 
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't a procedure for dealing
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
with incoming emails i think actually
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
there is a procedure i think maybe it's
 
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
better than what we had in the past so i
 
00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:40.630 align:start position:0%
better than what we had in the past so i
would

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
just uh so i would certainly urge you in
 
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:44.390 align:start position:0%
just uh so i would certainly urge you in
the

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
other chairs to take a close look at
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
that aspect of it
 
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
and um that was the main thing i was
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
asked about like what the procedure was
 
00:38:51.839 --> 00:38:52.310 align:start position:0%
asked about like what the procedure was
and

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
whether we'd be building on what we did
 
00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
do successfully
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
in this summer and also
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
with the retain bills do they have to
 
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
wait till 2022 to come to the floor or
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
would there be any
 
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
or would be able to bend the rules
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
enough so we could have possibly
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
obsession days in the fall of 2021 and
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
get some of them out of the way or would
 
00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:13.270 align:start position:0%
get some of them out of the way or would
they

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
all have to wait till after we convene
 
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:16.310 align:start position:0%
all have to wait till after we convene
in

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
well typically the committee would meet
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
to consider
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
the retain bill perhaps later in the
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
year but typically it wouldn't come back
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
before the legislature until the
 
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
beginning of the next year but i don't
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
know whether
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
there potentially might be some rule
 
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
change which would allow that
 
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
which which leads to the whole list
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
of sort of unanswered questions
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
right now if you ask ask me
 
00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh what room we're going to meet in i
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
can't answer that question so typically
 
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
at our orientation we'd be deciding that
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to meet in a particular room
 
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
generally 208 in the legislative office
 
00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.589 align:start position:0%
generally 208 in the legislative office
building

00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
it could be that we won't have one room
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
assigned but we'll be
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
assigned a particular double room it
 
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
could be any double room
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
which gets to another issue and
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
typically what would happen is
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
i think it's up to the chair of the
 
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
select the seating arrangement well
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
unless you know
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
where your how your committee is going
 
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
to be laid out you can really can't do a
 
00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
seating arrangement either which i would
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
intend to do
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
the hearings were supposed to have begun
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
next week and we
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
to hold our first hearing next week and
 
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
we're getting a little late for that
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
because we'd have to meet the calendar i
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
think today
 
00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
in order to have a hearing next week and
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
of course we have the holiday next week
 
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
but i think things have been exacerbated
 
00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:02.950 align:start position:0%
but i think things have been exacerbated
by

00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
the security issues next week as well so
 
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what the
 
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
status of hearings next week so
 
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
typically we would have expected one
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
next week i don't know that that's going
 
00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:25.270 align:start position:0%
to happen
[Music]

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
thing that i certainly would encourage
 
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
everybody to do as well
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
and that is obviously i'm going to
 
00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:32.630 align:start position:0%
and that is obviously i'm going to
expect

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
because you've signed up to do this duty
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
that you're going to attend
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
the committee meetings but if you can't
 
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
for some reason
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
you should let your office know that
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be able to attend
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
and perhaps a substitute could be
 
00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
provided in your place
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
so that we'll have be able to keep our
 
00:41:51.839 --> 00:41:52.870 align:start position:0%
so that we'll have be able to keep our
balance

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
balance
 
00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
with regard to fair balance with regard
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
the committee reports in terms of the
 
00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
process and the procedure
 
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
marjorie did such an excellent job
 
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
certainly i would
 
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
plan to continue to be to
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
handle the committee in the same manner
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
as we have in the past with the same
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
rules that we have in the past and i
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
know that doesn't mean much to perhaps
 
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
new members
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
but i'm sure that they will
 
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
learn very quickly that we do
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
manage to have a particular decorum
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
that we don't keep food in the room
 
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
that we act respectfully towards
 
00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
everyone who testifies
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
and if you're testifying on your own
 
00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:45.910 align:start position:0%
and if you're testifying on your own
bill

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
that you won't participate in the
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
discussion when you're
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
a committee member uh
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
as i said the testimonies intended to be
 
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
remote on all bills
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
but it may be that you have a bill which
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
is in place
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
and you happen to be in the building at
 
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
the same time if that's the case
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
i understand that they will let you
 
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
testify in person if you're a sponsor of
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
and that's you know other than questions
 
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
i think that's what i
 
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
intend just to communicate to you today
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
and that is uh
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
well for whatever reason i was selected
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
to be your chair the one thing that i
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
will focus on is being fair
 
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
and being efficient and trying to get as
 
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
much accomplished as we can
 
00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.510 align:start position:0%
much accomplished as we can

and being respectful of everybody on the
 
00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
committee and everybody who appears
 
00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:46.550 align:start position:0%
committee and everybody who appears
before

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
are there other concerns or questions
 
00:43:59.109 --> 00:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
i typically what would happen we do have
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
the types of bills in the past where
 
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
we've been required to be
 
00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know that that's going to be
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
necessary this year if
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
all of our testimony is going to be
 
00:44:15.599 --> 00:44:17.510 align:start position:0%
all of our testimony is going to be
received

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
received
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
electronically because i don't know that
 
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
there would be a need for us to be
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
in representatives but
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
if there were we certainly would make
 
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
those earnings if there was a need we
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative representatives maclean
 
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:37.430 align:start position:0%
representative representatives maclean
and

00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh burch have questions oh we're
 
00:44:41.109 --> 00:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
supposed to put our hands up
 
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um one of the things
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
that the staff was talking about was
 
00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
having us
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
identify some technical resources maybe
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
for some training to assist
 
00:44:58.550 --> 00:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
um you know obviously kurt is going to
 
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
be having
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
the the clerking role but um was there
 
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
any thought to canvas to members uh to
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
see if anybody has any interest in that
 
00:45:06.079 --> 00:45:08.950 align:start position:0%
see if anybody has any interest in that
area

00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
in in what what type of technical
 
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
issues just you know helping to
 
00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:17.670 align:start position:0%
issues just you know helping to
coordinate

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
coordinate
 
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
the zoom meetings while you're involved
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
are are there are there any particular
 
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
concerns with regard to technical issues
 
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
at this point perhaps any of the new
 
00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:34.069 align:start position:0%
at this point perhaps any of the new
members

00:45:34.069 --> 00:45:34.079 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:45:38.309 --> 00:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
um if i can if i can interject um
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
i think a representative mclean is is
 
00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
referencing the possibility of having
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
a member of the committee who can take
 
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
on the role that
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
i would have or i have been having since
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
we started this zoom process
 
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
um where in public hearings you may need
 
00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:58.630 align:start position:0%
um where in public hearings you may need
to

00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
promote an attendee to the panelist side
 
00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
keep an eye on the screen to make sure
 
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
that anyone who has
 
00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
questions that that's brought to the
 
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
attention of the chair
 
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
things like that so we're we're thinking
 
00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:14.710 align:start position:0%
things like that so we're we're thinking
of

00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
identifying folks on the committee who
 
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
can assist
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
in that respect um to take
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
some of those responsibilities off the
 
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
shoulder of the chair
 
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
um and also recognizing that with um
 
00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
just four researchers right now
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
it'll be hard for us to be everywhere
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
and covering that
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
role throughout with the the 20
 
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
committees that we have
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
mr chair if they're i would be happy
 
00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:43.990 align:start position:0%
mr chair if they're i would be happy
it's

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's margie speaking i would be happy to
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
um volunteer to um
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
be your um sherpa
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
if um if that
 
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:02.079 align:start position:0%
is uh would be helpful to you and
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps we
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
should have two people so that we're
 
00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
sure there's always one there
 
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
to help worry about the details so that
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
you can focus
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
on the more important issues
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
well i was expecting that representative
 
00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
mclean would
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
be assisting with the technical issues
 
00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
good choice mr chair yeah i
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
i i absolutely uh intend to be doing
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
that as well
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
it's great to have representative smith
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
there as well so that we can tag team
 
00:47:35.349 --> 00:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
with each other
 
00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
and in case one of us is not there
 
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
somebody else can
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
seamlessly slip back into that role and
 
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
also of course when representative
 
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
mclean is
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
okay and we know which bill it will be
 
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
so exactly the work's all done mark
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's going to be the easiest job
 
00:48:06.309 --> 00:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to have
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
and representative burch did you have a
 
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
question i
 
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
did and thank you mr chair you made
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
reference to the generally uh
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
the general practice of uh
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
sponsors of bills not taking part in the
 
00:48:24.069 --> 00:48:24.079 align:start position:0%
uh questioning at the hearings
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
of other witnesses and the like i'm
 
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
wondering if that is going to apply
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
to co-sponsors because i heard there was
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
some discussion
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
about what role co-sponsors of bills
 
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to that i don't
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
know if anyone
 
00:48:52.549 --> 00:48:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
ned i'm about elaborating on what
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
paul just said of course this prime
 
00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
sponsor presents the bill
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
and speaks and whatever in the past what
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
we've done
 
00:49:07.589 --> 00:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
is you choose you either decide that you
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
are going to testify
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
in which case at for that hearing your
 
00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:13.910 align:start position:0%
in which case at for that hearing your
role

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
role
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
is as is not as a committee member but
 
00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
as someone who testifies
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
or you choose not to testify
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
and you can sit at
 
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
the you know the committee table but
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
you don't ask questions if you are a
 
00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:34.790 align:start position:0%
you don't ask questions if you are a
co-sponsor

00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
i mean but i don't know what the the
 
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
current speaker
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh will have to say about whether
 
00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
i mean have been a lot of changes
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
apparently and
 
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
and how we're going to act some base
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
because of the realities of the pandemic
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
and some for other reasons
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
so i guess that would have to be
 
00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.109 align:start position:0%
so i guess that would have to be
clarified

00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
clarified
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that's was my response to
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
paul is
 
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
you know i know what the practice has
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
been i but i don't know if there has
 
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
been a change in that practice
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
if i'll jump in and probably and other
 
00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:14.870 align:start position:0%
if i'll jump in and probably and other
people

00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
oh go ahead represent morgan
 
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
oh thank you mr chair sorry i i'm
 
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
moving so you guess i've we had several
 
00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
other uh
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
hearings yesterday where other chairs
 
00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
said we'd have the hybrid meetings which
 
00:50:29.359 --> 00:50:29.750 align:start position:0%
said we'd have the hybrid meetings which
uh

00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
is i'm happy with my
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
we're a little bit unsure whether
 
00:50:37.109 --> 00:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
members you participate remotely
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
and right now i'm one of those who was
 
00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:40.950 align:start position:0%
and right now i'm one of those who was
really

00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:50:42.549 --> 00:50:42.559 align:start position:0%
quite reluctant to go anywhere near the
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
state house between the cohen
 
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
issues and the civil unrest issues and
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not a particularly fearful person
 
00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
well the
 
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
hybrid the members who are visually
 
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
remotely have
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
all the same privileges and powers as
 
00:50:56.549 --> 00:50:56.559 align:start position:0%
those who were meeting in person
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
because there's been some rumors going
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
around that like
 
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
people members are meeting who are you
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
know me
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
zooming in to a meeting that a summit
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
person attendees won't be able to ask
 
00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:08.559 align:start position:0%
questions we won't be able to do other
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
things which uh
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
normally we take it for granted that all
 
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
committee members can do
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
the second question is is the five
 
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
committee meetings
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
is that just a budgetary thing because
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
want to pay for more than five uh zoom
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
licenses or whatever other
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
licenses or is that um also because it's
 
00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
just the physical limitations on the
 
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
size of the lob that
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
if we have only double wide rooms
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
there's only so many double wide rooms
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
we can have at one time
 
00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
so no i i i can answer the second
 
00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:40.870 align:start position:0%
so no i i i can answer the second
question

00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
easily because i know the answer to that
 
00:51:44.069 --> 00:51:44.079 align:start position:0%
and that is it's just
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
a physical limitation on that building
 
00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:47.750 align:start position:0%
a physical limitation on that building
so

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
um with regard to the
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
first part the first question
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
i don't um the
 
00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
the uh i guess i'm assuming
 
00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
that if you participate remotely you'll
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
have the same
 
00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
abilities that you would if you were
 
00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
there as a committee member in person or
 
00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.150 align:start position:0%
there as a committee member in person or
should

00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
but i obviously i can't guarantee that
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
because i don't know exactly
 
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
technically whether or not that that i
 
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
know that there were
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
there were discussions early on about
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
limitations in the executive session
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
uh with regard to participation
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
uh but i do i'm not sure that those
 
00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and of course with
 
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
the executive sessions we had many
 
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
executive sessions this summer and um
 
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
totally remotely so we know it's
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
technically possible we'll do a remote
 
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:52:59.910 --> 00:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
and anyway thank you mr chairman yeah
 
00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
there any other
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:08.549 --> 00:53:08.559 align:start position:0%
you want to talk about the dress code
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
just because we don't have one
 
00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
well you know that's it's kind of
 
00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
interesting because i was thinking about
 
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
the meeting today and of course i put on
 
00:53:20.549 --> 00:53:20.559 align:start position:0%
a jacket and a tie
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
oh my goodness i didn't put my jacket on
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry yeah well
 
00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:26.839 align:start position:0%
geez i don't know what we're going to do
 
00:53:29.349 --> 00:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
and but i've been in so many i've been
 
00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
in so many zoo
 
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
meetings uh recently where
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
it's just in
 
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
it's informal so people tend not to
 
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
dress up
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
personally you know i think my
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
expectation is that you would
 
00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:53.839 align:start position:0%
dress in a manner which you dress if you
 
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
had a hearing at the state house but
 
00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:57.510 align:start position:0%
had a hearing at the state house but
[Music]

00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:53:59.349 --> 00:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
i think that that would be appropriate
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
because the public is going to be
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
viewing you
 
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
and forming their impression of you
 
00:54:08.309 --> 00:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
and the legislature as a whole so
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
i think my expectation would be that you
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
mr chairman if i may um i was just
 
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
following uh representative burch's lead
 
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
with no tie so i'll have a tie on it
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
next hearing though
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
and and mr chairman i i will not have a
 
00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:34.150 align:start position:0%
and and mr chairman i i will not have a
tie

00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
tie
 
00:54:38.069 --> 00:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
no i'm gonna have a jacket
 
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
yeah appropriate attire
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i have a question if i can
 
00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
just for clarification
 
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
so that the hearings are going to be
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
held in a double-wide
 
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
room in person yet testimony
 
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
or people that are testifying are going
 
00:54:59.190 --> 00:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
to do that via zoom is that correct
 
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
that's correct yes
 
00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding and uh
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
and if you're my understanding at this
 
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
point in time if you're a committee
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
member you can participate
 
00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
via zoom right okay
 
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
and one of the issues is
 
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
the types of hearings that we've had in
 
00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:27.589 align:start position:0%
the types of hearings that we've had in
judiciary

00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
judiciary
 
00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
are you going to have a hallway full of
 
00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:31.030 align:start position:0%
are you going to have a hallway full of
people

00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
at the state house it makes no sense to
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
bring in
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
a ton of people and have people exposed
 
00:55:41.349 --> 00:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
so i think if through testimony
 
00:55:41.359 --> 00:55:41.910 align:start position:0%
so i think if through testimony
everybody

00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
testifies over zoom that makes
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
a lot more sense
 
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
as i testified in the hearing yesterday
 
00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
it went very smoothly the senate
 
00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
had for the so-called pink cards
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
they have this thing online which you
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
filled in
 
00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:05.839 align:start position:0%
it actually was easier than do filling
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
out a pink card i think
 
00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
it was terrific
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
and they collate them five minutes
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
before the hearing and
 
00:56:18.549 --> 00:56:18.559 align:start position:0%
following it's terrific
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
so will this be a screen that we'll all
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
be able to see if we're there
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
in the hearing i'm just trying to
 
00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
envision this and also so you had your
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
for instance you just testified and you
 
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
had your
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
pink card does it then come first
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
first come first serve as to who
 
00:56:40.079 --> 00:56:41.270 align:start position:0%
first come first serve as to who
testifies

00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
testifies
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
by who fills out the card i think the
 
00:56:47.589 --> 00:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
i think this the chair picks who
 
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
testifies and what order people testify
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
just as they do now
 
00:56:56.789 --> 00:56:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
typically uh yesterday senators spoke
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
first i spoke
 
00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
and that's an interesting question as to
 
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
and of course as a
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
testifying i could
 
00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
zoom in and i could see all the
 
00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
but i don't believe the committee
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
members are seeing the people who
 
00:57:26.559 --> 00:57:28.950 align:start position:0%
members are seeing the people who
testifies

00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
testifies
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
oh and how did they ask questions
 
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
we should just wait
 
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:46.789 --> 00:57:46.799 align:start position:0%
ned isn't the way it worked this spring
 
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
is so that
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
you know we have panelists and we have
 
00:57:50.319 --> 00:57:51.910 align:start position:0%
you know we have panelists and we have
attendees

00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
attendees
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
and if and people who are watching
 
00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
because for whatever reason
 
00:57:58.630 --> 00:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
including that they're planning to
 
00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:00.230 align:start position:0%
including that they're planning to
testify

00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
when the chair calls that person um
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
at least in the spring what happened was
 
00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:07.750 align:start position:0%
at least in the spring what happened was
that

00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
and summer that that person would then
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
temporarily be moved
 
00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
into the panelist category would appear
 
00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
on the screen
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
so that the committee could see that
 
00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:20.230 align:start position:0%
so that the committee could see that
witness

00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
witness
 
00:58:23.109 --> 00:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
and that witness could see the committee
 
00:58:23.119 --> 00:58:23.670 align:start position:0%
and that witness could see the committee
and

00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
um uh and of course anybody who's what
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
else was watching could see the
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
committee and the witness
 
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
and then when the witness finished uh
 
00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
the witness would go back to the
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
attendee category and
 
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
could continue to watch the the
 
00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:40.950 align:start position:0%
could continue to watch the the
committee

00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
and hear the committee but just wouldn't
 
00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
be on the screen
 
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
i i mean jennifer would know more but i
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
think that's
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
kind of uh i mean i imagine they're
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
figure out the things that worked well
 
00:58:56.309 --> 00:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
and that did
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
and keep those and then just try to
 
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
fine-tune the things that
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
the speaker and the chair is that
 
00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
um the whole issue as to whether we
 
00:59:20.829 --> 00:59:20.839 align:start position:0%
would move into
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
executive session on a bill
 
00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
immediately after having her testimony
 
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
under um certain
 
00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh leaders and and rules in the house
 
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
um there was an insistence that we did
 
00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:39.990 align:start position:0%
um there was an insistence that we did
not

00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
execute bill at the same time
 
00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
that we heard the testimony unless there
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
was a particular
 
00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
overarching reason to do it um
 
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
and i have heard discussions generally
 
00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:55.589 align:start position:0%
and i have heard discussions generally
about

00:59:55.589 --> 00:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
whether that would continue or whether
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
it might
 
01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
make it easier um to move
 
01:00:08.789 --> 01:00:08.799 align:start position:0%
from from the
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
committee hearing to the executive
 
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
session if in fact
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
the committee is ready to um
 
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
to exec you know in other words not
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
having a subcommittee formed or a work
 
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
session or whatever
 
01:00:27.349 --> 01:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
and that i guess is that's going to be a
 
01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
mr chair is going to be something that
 
01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:30.150 align:start position:0%
mr chair is going to be something that
you

01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
and the speaker and others have
 
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
are going to have to work out right
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
well as of last friday we
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
would adhere to the policy that we had
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
last year and that is you would not exec
 
01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
on the same day terrific
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
but whether whether that changes between
 
01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:54.799 align:start position:0%
now and the time we have an executive
 
01:00:59.190 --> 01:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
and and we will continue to have you
 
01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
know because the calendar will come out
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
on thursday night
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%

01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
