00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:04.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:06.759 align:start position:0%
the all right good morning everyone
 
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.120 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference on House Bill
 
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
welcome so you didn't like our
 
00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:20.439 align:start position:0%
Amendment that's
 
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
correct the um the limit that's
 
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.550 align:start position:0%
correct the um the limit that's
included

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
included
 
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
um is first of all it's way too
 
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
low and secondly
 
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's not going to work at least
 
00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
partly because a recovery house needs to
 
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
be in a dent section where the people
 
00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
involved who probably don't have cars or
 
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
licenses can get around can get to
 
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
jobs um you couldn't do it in Epsom you
 
00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359 align:start position:0%
might be able to do it in downtown
 
00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield or down Town Allen toown
 
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
because they have facilities but you're
 
00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 align:start position:0%
not going to get uh recovery houses out
 
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 align:start position:0%
bonies so that's that's not going to
 
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 align:start position:0%
US senator Murphy you were probably the
 
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
most vocal in the Senate I was thank you
 
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
um the difficulty is and having
 
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 align:start position:0%
employed a large number of people who
 
00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 align:start position:0%
reside in these recovery homes in the
 
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
past um you know these are very critical
 
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 align:start position:0%
facilities we definitely need more of
 
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
them but they carry a a
 
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
consequence these homes reasonably have
 
00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719 align:start position:0%
rules residents can't come in drunk they
 
00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 align:start position:0%
can't come in high they can't fight they
 
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
can't steal there's a curfew and if they
 
00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 align:start position:0%
break the rules they're shown the
 
00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
door and when they're shown the door
 
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
often they end up
 
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.590 align:start position:0%
often they end up
homeless

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
homeless
 
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
and in
 
00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 align:start position:0%
Manchester the residents and the
 
00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 align:start position:0%
businesses have faced a severe impact
 
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
for the quality of life and when this
 
00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
bill came
 
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
forward uh I did some research and found
 
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 align:start position:0%
that Manchester and Nashville combined
 
00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 align:start position:0%
have approximately a thousand recovery
 
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
beds the rest of the state combined has
 
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.710 align:start position:0%
beds the rest of the state combined has
about

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 align:start position:0%
300 um so you know this includes
 
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 align:start position:0%
beds Berlin Salem Dairy Portsmith you
 
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
know these are areas that have the
 
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
density that you're speaking of I
 
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
understand that many of the residents
 
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
don't have cars some do but a lot do not
 
00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
and they may need a walkable community
 
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
and I understand that EPA may not be the
 
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
ideal location for them although to be
 
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
fair goof toown does have a facility um
 
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
with 12 beds so you know smaller
 
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
communities can support them um but it
 
00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 align:start position:0%
is not fair nor right that two
 
00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 align:start position:0%
cities carries the Lion Share of these
 
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 align:start position:0%
facilities in my opinion so that is why
 
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
the amendment was drafted the way it was
 
00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 align:start position:0%
and that is why the limit is set where
 
00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 align:start position:0%
it is where Nashville and Manchester
 
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
basically Nash is 100 beds over the
 
00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
limit if if one bed for every 200 and 50
 
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 align:start position:0%
residents isn't the proper number then
 
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 align:start position:0%
let's talk about where the number should
 
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
be but that's a
 
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 align:start position:0%
pretty you know
 
00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:44.439 align:start position:0%
420 468 beds in Manchester right now 475
 
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 align:start position:0%
in nashaa it's a lot of beds it's a lot
 
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
of people that are
 
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 align:start position:0%
facing they
 
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
they I truly wish the best for them I I
 
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 align:start position:0%
hope they get better we need more
 
00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
facilities but these communities can
 
00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 align:start position:0%
only take so much
 
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
well Manchester is close to 10% of the
 
00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 align:start position:0%
state's population so you would expect a
 
00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
significant number of of effort there I
 
00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 align:start position:0%
I don't disagree with the math except
 
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
that 10% and you know 44% give or take
 
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
of the beds a it doesn't really match up
 
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
so we have to spread these are critical
 
00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 align:start position:0%
facilities I advocate for spreading the
 
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
communities thank you have nashor or
 
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester come in saying that they need
 
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 align:start position:0%
this legislation and that they've
 
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
overburden they're overburdened by beds
 
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
I had a conversation with the mayor of
 
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester he told me he supported the
 
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
legislation as as
 
00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
amended um I've talked to my colleagues
 
00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:00.550 align:start position:0%
amended um I've talked to my colleagues
in

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
nasua uh one of whom supported the
 
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
not follow I'll follow up please if I
 
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 align:start position:0%
can follow up I understand the mayor
 
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
have may have a position is there a
 
00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 align:start position:0%
position taken from the board of Mayor
 
00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:17.390 align:start position:0%
position taken from the board of Mayor
and

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
Alderman it was mayj he did not indicate
 
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
he was speaking for the entire Board of
 
00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 align:start position:0%
Alder thank you madam chair I as I look
 
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
at this from a practical
 
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
standpoint the by
 
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
pushing these facilities out into rural
 
00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 align:start position:0%
parts of the state where the
 
00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 align:start position:0%
participants will have no no access to
 
00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
the facility because they can't get
 
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
there they don't have cars they can't
 
00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 align:start position:0%
there's no public
 
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
transportation uh it it sets it up for a
 
00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
program that's going to fail uh and I
 
00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
think that's that's not smart on our
 
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
part to to to set up failure before we
 
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 align:start position:0%
even start so these these facilities
 
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 align:start position:0%
need to be in urban areas that people
 
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
can walk to or take public
 
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.029 align:start position:0%
can walk to or take public
transportation

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
to representative do you believe that
 
00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 align:start position:0%
marac dairy Salem London dery uh
 
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth Hampton Milford any of these
 
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
may be able to sustain
 
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
facilities in in most cases no I know I
 
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
can tell you from London der uh there is
 
00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:34.039 align:start position:0%
no public transportation and in order to
 
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
get from from wherever they're residing
 
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
to to their counseling sessions uh
 
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
they'd have to take uh taxis or other
 
00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
other forms of uh private transportation
 
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
that would be too expensive and and not
 
00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
uh and and
 
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
just cause the uh individual not to show
 
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
up or not to not to
 
00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:00.759 align:start position:0%
participate if that logic is true then
 
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
how come bosan has 47 beds Littleton has
 
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
42 beds lonia has 65 beds these are
 
00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
communities that have stepped up and and
 
00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
done their share to help the rest of the
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
state with this critical need but Salem
 
00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.230 align:start position:0%
state with this critical need but Salem
has

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.240 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:23.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:26.919 align:start position:0%
sir another point to consider is this
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
only applies to
 
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.120 align:start position:0%
registered or certified recovery
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
homes and if you put a limit on
 
00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
registered or certified recovery homes
 
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
what you're going to get is
 
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
unregistered recovery
 
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
homes which are probably not as well-run
 
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
as the certified ones in
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
general I would agree with that Madam
 
00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
share but there is room for 3,000
 
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
additional beds under the limit
 
00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.589 align:start position:0%
additional beds under the limit
Statewide

00:07:59.589 --> 00:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
00:08:06.909 --> 00:08:06.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:11.560 align:start position:0%
that any else sen Department SC we
 
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:13.240 align:start position:0%
haven't heard from you you have anything
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
you want to talk
 
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
about you know I think all these points
 
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
have been well made I you know the
 
00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:25.639 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill is to make sure
 
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
that we are not there are no unnecessary
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
barriers to set a recovery houses right
 
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
because we know that these are an
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
important tool for people in recovery I
 
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
think the point about public
 
00:08:38.949 --> 00:08:38.959 align:start position:0%
transportation is well taken I also
 
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:41.320 align:start position:0%
think the point about these being
 
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
available in many parts of the state is
 
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
important because whether they're on
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
public transportation or not we do know
 
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
that um there are people in recovery all
 
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
over the state that said unfortunately
 
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
um and we had this discussion in
 
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
committee continue to believe that you
 
00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
know this amendment may not be the best
 
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
way to to accomplish that I mean I do
 
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
think more education is needed I think
 
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
that um easing the zoning which is is
 
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
done in the version passed by the house
 
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
could lead to other places sharing this
 
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:15.640 align:start position:0%
burden I mean you know I think that's
 
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
the intent and so um by by capping it
 
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
artificially in the amendment and
 
00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:22.959 align:start position:0%
especially by the addition of the
 
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
affirmative vote of the legislative body
 
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
I just think um we're we're
 
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately creating exactly the kind
 
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
of barriers that
 
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:34.360 align:start position:0%
that um that we that we don't want to
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
have and so to the extent that there are
 
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
people who need recovery homes I think
 
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
we want to make them available and that
 
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
is the intent of the bill and so
 
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um I T I tend to agree
 
00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
one I guess I'm the only one that has an
 
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
offer an opinion yet uh Senator Murphy
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
certainly you know was uh took the lead
 
00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:03.959 align:start position:0%
you know in the senate committee um but
 
00:10:05.949 --> 00:10:05.959 align:start position:0%
you know for years and years and years
 
00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:09.560 align:start position:0%
we hear Manchester NASA whatever come in
 
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
and say you know we're providing these
 
00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:14.519 align:start position:0%
services but we're providing it for the
 
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
whole state because people who need the
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
services come to
 
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
us uh safe stations is one of the
 
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:25.240 align:start position:0%
examples uh four years ago five years
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
ago we passed the bill and we gave NASA
 
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:31.720 align:start position:0%
X number of million dollarss million and
 
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
a half or whatever it was uh but then
 
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
they decided to discontinue the thing
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
but still wanted the million and a half
 
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
dollars okay um I hear from the people
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
who go to jail and other things that uh
 
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
the farther they are from their uh
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
individual family and their Network that
 
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
supports them or causes them their
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
problem in some cases maybe uh you know
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
that it affects their recovery so there
 
00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
are competing you know things here
 
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
um I guess what I would suggest and
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
that's if Senator Murphy is agreeable to
 
00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:16.959 align:start position:0%
it that
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh you know since he's the the most
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
outspoken U proponent of the Senate side
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
and you or someone on your group get
 
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
together and see if you can't work out a
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:36.829 align:start position:0%
 
meeting

00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:36.839 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
um but I suppose that's the timing is
 
00:11:44.629 --> 00:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
going to be very difficult but uh then
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
we'll off with two options and we find
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
it difficult to support yours and you're
 
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
finding it difficult to support ours I
 
00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
think that is the case one of the
 
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
two you know is it better to have one of
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh well
 
00:12:07.629 --> 00:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
we're people we've been working with in
 
00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:09.839 align:start position:0%
The Recovery House business are
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
convinced that the limit would be
 
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
intolerable so we and they would rather
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
have nothing so that's that's that's the
 
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.310 align:start position:0%
have nothing so that's that's that's the
house

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
position well I'll leave it open for you
 
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
if you guys want
 
00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:29.839 align:start position:0%
to you know recess for a while or
 
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
whatever and talk to Senator Murphy
 
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
whatever leave it open for the the only
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
thing I would say to Senator Murphy is
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
that if we clarify the zoning
 
00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:44.959 align:start position:0%
issues we might be able to get some of
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
these other municipalities to step up
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
and encourage recovered houses this came
 
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
because the city of Lebanon discovered
 
00:12:57.389 --> 00:12:57.399 align:start position:0%
their zoning was an issue and they were
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
confused and they needed to have it
 
00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:01.959 align:start position:0%
clearer in order to support the recovery
 
00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
houses they
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
wanted uh that may be the issue in Salem
 
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:11.240 align:start position:0%
OR Port Smith or
 
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
wherever and so I would like to suggest
 
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
that we try and see if clarifying that
 
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519 align:start position:0%
encourages recovery homes to be located
 
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities again I if if I'm only
 
00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
talking about dense municipalities you
 
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
know I can go right down through you
 
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
know Manchester Nashua uh conquer Dober
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
Rochester uh dairy uh I think it's Dairy
 
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
that you know the list of by population
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
no and I haven't haven't named anything
 
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
north of conquer yet well okay the thing
 
00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
is that it's not necessarily the number
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
of people in a town although that helps
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
what it is is to have a center
 
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
as I said you know downtown Pittsfield
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
has a supermarket and clusters of
 
00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:06.839 align:start position:0%
businesses it's not it's feasible to get
 
00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
there without a
 
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
call and there are undoubtedly other
 
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
small towns in the state that have old
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh old centers that are that
 
00:14:21.949 --> 00:14:21.959 align:start position:0%
are that are reasonable for this sort of
 
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:25.240 align:start position:0%
thing Littleton has a couple of recovery
 
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
houses Franklin has a couple
 
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
because they have
 
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
the back when a town of 3,000 people had
 
00:14:37.389 --> 00:14:37.399 align:start position:0%
a downtown and so they've got clustered
 
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
housing and clustered
 
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
jobs well um why don't the Senators CAU
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
Us in another room and
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
but all right you can use the uh real
 
00:14:51.519 --> 00:15:02.389 align:start position:0%
but all right you can use the uh real
office

00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.749 --> 00:15:04.759 align:start position:0%
you go right
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.959 --> 00:15:57.910 align:start position:0%
 
unlocked

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
I know that Senator Perkins coko wants
 
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
to speak and I think Senator Mur may
 
00:22:24.909 --> 00:22:24.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:27.640 align:start position:0%
speak um yeah thank you for giving us to
 
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
a minute to iner I mean I I do think
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
there's some potential compromise here I
 
00:22:35.149 --> 00:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
think your point representative about
 
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
this bill being needed for exactly the
 
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
reasons that concern Senator Murphy is
 
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:43.400 align:start position:0%
is wellmade and well taken you know this
 
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
bill as amended by the house may lead to
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
other places seeing additional recovery
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
houses um pop up and so you know I think
 
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
it's an important public policy for that
 
00:22:57.549 --> 00:22:57.559 align:start position:0%
reason that said you know I think there
 
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
there could be some compromise made um
 
00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
with Senator Murphy's position if you if
 
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
you guys are willing but um I think it's
 
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
an important BT I think we should try to
 
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
alive I'm willing to discuss compromise
 
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
in as far as the limit or as far as the
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
um affirmative vote by legislative body
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
municipality um you know my position
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
isn't set in stone but I can't in good
 
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
faith and frankly out of obligation to
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
my constituents support the house
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
position as it currently stands so the
 
00:23:36.669 --> 00:23:36.679 align:start position:0%
question for the my counterparts is are
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
you willing to
 
00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:40.919 align:start position:0%
move that's the
 
00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:42.870 align:start position:0%
move that's the
question

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
no okay all right we will disagree and
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you for coming and and sharing
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
we will will undoubtedly be dealing with
 
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
this in the future ma'am if you think
 
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
that there's any wiggle room you can
 
00:23:58.149 --> 00:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
certainly recess it and we would try to
 
00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
come back back but it's up to you I
 
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
don't think
