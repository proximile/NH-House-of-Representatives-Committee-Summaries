00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 align:start position:0%
uh certainly the things that we did with
 
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
463 uh we're in attempt to uh re a a a
 
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
good compromise we received lots and
 
00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 align:start position:0%
lots of letters about people believing
 
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 align:start position:0%
that this would allow the process that
 
00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:40.759 align:start position:0%
somebody could go in apply for an
 
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot or whatever register to
 
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
vote and never see an election official
 
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
certainly we tried to make that clear
 
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
with the words present down in the
 
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 align:start position:0%
bottom and adding the requirements in
 
00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
all of the different forms the
 
00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
registration form not in this doc
 
00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 align:start position:0%
docment with the absentee form in this
 
00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 align:start position:0%
document and the portal uh that people
 
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 align:start position:0%
put down the last four digit social
 
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
security number driver's license or non
 
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
driver ID or a checker box that says
 
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
they don't have either uh we think it's
 
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
a reasonable compromise
 
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
the I know that there has been push back
 
00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 align:start position:0%
on the portal portion of this uh
 
00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 align:start position:0%
certainly uh part of what we're trying
 
00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
to do there is so that people um who are
 
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
going to register uh could go to the
 
00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 align:start position:0%
portal get uh you know send an email to
 
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
the people get the forms back from them
 
00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 align:start position:0%
and you know bring them right to the
 
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
election on Election Day cutting down
 
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
the lines that would be there um the
 
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
other important parts is the reason that
 
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 align:start position:0%
the uh absentee request form was changed
 
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
is due to the there really is no ID
 
00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
requirements you know for absentee
 
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
balance uh so having those um extra
 
00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 align:start position:0%
fields in there gives us a better um you
 
00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
know check on uh who's applying uh and
 
00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 align:start position:0%
then certainly the funding that is in
 
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
there uh part for the portal uh but also
 
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
part for verification of Voters and the
 
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
way that's expanding uh in some of the
 
00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
conversations that I've had on
 
00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
1370 um that is important in fact in the
 
00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
latest revision of uh
 
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
1370 um I put instead of a dollar I put
 
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
$100,000 in there um to fund the group
 
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
that would do the
 
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
verification um that would either need
 
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
to be in here or in 1370 if we're going
 
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
to do that so I don't know if any of the
 
00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
issue seeing none I guess back to you
 
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
allocations I had the impression that
 
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:22.360 align:start position:0%
the $50,000 was also in another bill Am
 
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
I Wrong uh it was originally in a Senate
 
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
bill but you guys have put that on hold
 
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
I believe uh and that's why it was added
 
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
here is to make it easier uh to go
 
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
through I don't exactly know what you
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
guys status on that uh Senate bill is uh
 
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
but it only needs to be provided once
 
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
for that function but now that we're
 
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
expanding that group that would do the
 
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
verifications uh that is why like I said
 
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
in 1370 I asked for 100,000 or if we do
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
something different here with the portal
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh I would want to retain some of that
 
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
money if I don't put it in 1370 so again
 
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:09.800 align:start position:0%
it's funded in one place and you're good
 
00:08:12.309 --> 00:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
okay and it it's not already in
 
00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:15.639 align:start position:0%
1370 1370 The Way It Was Written so that
 
00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:18.039 align:start position:0%
it didn't have to go to finance was that
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
it was written with appropriation of $1
 
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
and then I put the appropriation in
 
00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:26.599 align:start position:0%
463 uh which was already going to go to
 
00:08:26.599 --> 00:08:28.110 align:start position:0%
463 uh which was already going to go to
finance

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
finance
 
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
okay got it
 
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
discussion um I have a question about
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballot requirements why why
 
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
are we adding absentee ballot
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
requirements into a portal Bill uh one
 
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
of the functions of the portal uh was
 
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
the ability to request an absentee
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
ballot uh so if we were when I I changed
 
00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
the portal bill so that I had
 
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
identification I know that senator Susi
 
00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.519 align:start position:0%
on the senate floor um questioned you
 
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
know why we were asking for more
 
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
identification and I said well Senator
 
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
Susi it would be a travesty if someone
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
went in and used your identity and
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
changed you from a Democrat to a
 
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
Republican and you weren't able to run
 
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
for office uh so again to make all the
 
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
forms consistent if you look at the
 
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
other all of the the registration form
 
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
the request for absentee ballot and in
 
00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.150 align:start position:0%
the request for absentee ballot and in
this

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
also the portal uh would all be
 
00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:34.959 align:start position:0%
requesting that four digits of the
 
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
social security number to help prove
 
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:40.360 align:start position:0%
identity and uh make sure that we're not
 
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
requests follow
 
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
up um at least as I read it this is
 
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
asking for more identification than is
 
00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
currently required to request an
 
00:09:58.910 --> 00:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot correct and and it goes
 
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:01.240 align:start position:0%
beyond what is in the current statute
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
for identification correct is is there a
 
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
reason for that uh there are people who
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
think that our current practice um does
 
00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
not identify uh people uh that
 
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
especially abente ballots uh are
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to
 
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:23.720 align:start position:0%
people um and so in an effort to uh make
 
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
it easy to vote but hard to cheat uh we
 
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
tried to add some information that's
 
00:10:33.069 --> 00:10:33.079 align:start position:0%
very easy for people to obtain um you
 
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
know you your parents now when you uh
 
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
they want to file the taxes get you a
 
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
social security number when you're just
 
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
a baby um and so you live with that
 
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
so people know their social security
 
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
numbers and then if you have a license
 
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
or a non driver ID uh that again is easy
 
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
information where you were born you know
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing again it's all easy
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
information that a person uh who is a
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
legitimate voter can you know copy down
 
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
very quickly uh and complete that and
 
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
those uh data elements will be in the
 
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
database and able to be verified against
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
what the voter put
 
00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
in represent
 
00:11:26.629 --> 00:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
qu uh thank you Mr chairman uh Senator I
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
also have a question about the absentee
 
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
ballot application
 
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
form it appears to me when it comes to
 
00:11:36.509 --> 00:11:36.519 align:start position:0%
what I'll call the winter weather
 
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
exception that the version of the form
 
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
in in this bill perpetuates an
 
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
inconsistency in the current statutes in
 
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
that it reads for use only on the Monday
 
00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:50.519 align:start position:0%
immediately prior to the election
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
National Weather Service has in issued a
 
00:11:53.949 --> 00:11:53.959 align:start position:0%
winter storm
 
00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
warning uh and then in the two
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
paragraphs below where it says I am
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
elderly or infirm and then I anticipate
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
that school Child Care adult care will
 
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
be cancelled that that
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
area uh when we uh excuse me a moment
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
when we look at eligibility under 657
 
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
colon one in the current
 
00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
statutes the uh I'm again going to call
 
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
the winter storm exception it just
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh that a person uh has concerns for his
 
00:12:34.189 --> 00:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
or her
 
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:36.440 align:start position:0%
safety and a person who cares for
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
children and firm adults it it does not
 
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
have a requirement that you state you're
 
00:12:43.189 --> 00:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
elderly or infirm or have a physical
 
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
disability so I see that as an
 
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
inconsistency in the form compared to
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
the eligibility portion of the statute
 
00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
6571 uh Roman numeral 2 if you're
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
looking at page three of the bill the
 
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:01.160 align:start position:0%
information that was changed is
 
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
highlighted there in bold letters uh the
 
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:09.320 align:start position:0%
rest is the statute as it was written um
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
and there is or was a u a bill that came
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
to us that requested some changes to
 
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
that um I'm not sure that the status of
 
00:13:22.829 --> 00:13:22.839 align:start position:0%
that and if we did change it then this
 
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
will will change to go along with it uh
 
00:13:29.189 --> 00:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
I believe that bill was HB 1119 if I
 
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
remember correctly and I uh it's my
 
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
recollection correct me if I'm wrong but
 
00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
I believe that went to interim study
 
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
then okay thank thank you representative
 
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
Lane so confirm the existing statute is
 
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
what's reflected in here best I know and
 
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh except for the changes involed it's
 
00:13:52.189 --> 00:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
uh yes this is reflecting the existing
 
00:13:54.269 --> 00:13:54.279 align:start position:0%
statute when it comes the definition of
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballot application but that
 
00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
itself is currently in consistent with
 
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
the eligibility requirements and I'm I'm
 
00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:04.839 align:start position:0%
suggesting basically this would be an
 
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to bring the application and
 
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
the eligibility portion of the statute
 
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
uh into
 
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
consistency um again since the Senate
 
00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959 align:start position:0%
has already taken a position on that
 
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
other bill um I don't know that uh we
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
would have to caucus to see if we could
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
support that or not but uh right now um
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
what's in front of us is is the changes
 
00:14:31.949 --> 00:14:31.959 align:start position:0%
that you see okay thank you for your
 
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
answer but chair if I might add to that
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
um we did the Senate did have a position
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
of passing um s SP 535 which did correct
 
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:47.240 align:start position:0%
this statutory inconsistency as well so
 
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
um I believe it would be something
 
00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:52.959 align:start position:0%
consistent with Senate previous Senate
 
00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
action what was the final status of that
 
00:14:57.749 --> 00:14:57.759 align:start position:0%
one I believe we sent it over to the
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
house who tabled it because there was HB
 
00:15:04.269 --> 00:15:04.279 align:start position:0%
1119 which we then sent to interim
 
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
study so there you
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
go uh certainly you know we would be
 
00:15:14.749 --> 00:15:14.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
but so I think that the most likely
 
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
outcome here is probably no report on
 
00:15:24.509 --> 00:15:24.519 align:start position:0%
463 having said that the $50,000
 
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
allocation for determining the
 
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
qualification of
 
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
Voters is there another bill before us
 
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
today where we could reasonably include
 
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
that considering we're supposed to work
 
00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
with what's
 
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
there um those that appropriation could
 
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
be put into uh 1370 in my opinion um
 
00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
that already had the appropriation of
 
00:15:47.199 --> 00:15:47.910 align:start position:0%
that already had the appropriation of
the

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
$1 uh and the number the place keeper i'
 
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
put in in that Amendment uh was only a
 
00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
place keeper just to so uh that those
 
00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.110 align:start position:0%
place keeper just to so uh that those
fund

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:04.279 align:start position:0%
to uh if we're going to really do 1370
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
and have a group that will help the
 
00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:09.079 align:start position:0%
voters uh provide their documentation
 
00:16:14.189 --> 00:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
Etc um and also that money can be used
 
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
for uh if a a person comes in and they
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
move from Manchester Ward one to
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester Ward 7 uh right now at the
 
00:16:26.309 --> 00:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
polling place uh they can't look up the
 
00:16:28.309 --> 00:16:28.319 align:start position:0%
people and know that they were
 
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
previously registered so that is one of
 
00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
the objections is that they would have
 
00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
to prove citizenship and uh an age uh
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that uh the
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
secretary of state is uh uh at least to
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
me seems agreeable to is providing a
 
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
tablet that would have the
 
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
database uh on it so that when a voter
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
comes in and says I was registered in
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester 1 and now we're in seven they
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
would be able to look them up and real
 
00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:01.079 align:start position:0%
time right there at the pole I shouldn't
 
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:03.160 align:start position:0%
say real time they will be able to look
 
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:05.720 align:start position:0%
them up uh at the polls because these
 
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
would not be connected to the internet
 
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
it would have the database stagnant on
 
00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:12.039 align:start position:0%
there uh and then they would only have
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
to prove identity and doile which is the
 
00:17:15.919 --> 00:17:17.029 align:start position:0%
to prove identity and doile which is the
current

00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
statute and if I can ask you a
 
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
legislating for dummy's question is it
 
00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:25.400 align:start position:0%
as simple as 1370 changing the $1 to 50
 
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
grand um again if we're going to do the
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
added things uh I wouldn't the 50 Grand
 
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
probably would not be sufficient
 
00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
especially if I'm going to buy the
 
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
tablets so that's why I moved it from to
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
up to
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
100,000 um also the revision that I put
 
00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
in in
 
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
1370 uh would have an extended period
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
for the data verification uh so that
 
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
group maybe stood up for a longer period
 
00:17:57.149 --> 00:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
of time uh than it was originally
 
00:17:59.549 --> 00:17:59.559 align:start position:0%
anticipated and that also would have an
 
00:17:59.559 --> 00:18:01.549 align:start position:0%
anticipated and that also would have an
added

00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
added
 
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:05.320 align:start position:0%
expense all right anything
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
further and I think we're going to close
 
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
463 and we're a few minutes behind our
 
00:18:18.909 --> 00:18:18.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
on what's up
 
00:18:33.149 --> 00:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
okay well pass him out anyway pass them
 
00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:52.830 align:start position:0%
okay well pass him out anyway pass them
out

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.390 align:start position:0%
 
anyway

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:57.630 align:start position:0%
 
am

00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:27.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:57.590 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
all right we're going to open the
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:43.149 --> 00:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
1091 and representative Lane can you
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
explain your
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
proposal uh yes the proposal
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
incorporates uh the changes that I sent
 
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
around when we were discussing yesterday
 
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
at Senate Bill
 
00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
534 um so it incorporates those it also
 
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
incorp Ates a few changes that Senator
 
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
Susi wanted to make so we did that and
 
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
then we incorporated um the change about
 
00:22:09.149 --> 00:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
the mandatory electronic
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
filing um so that it starts in uh for
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
the election of
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
2026 for the governor and executive
 
00:22:21.269 --> 00:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
counsel um and then in for the election
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
of 2028 it's mandatory for everybody
 
00:22:28.029 --> 00:22:28.039 align:start position:0%
else and uh it's optional um of course
 
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:29.960 align:start position:0%
for any anybody who wishes to file up
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
but it only becomes mandatory for
 
00:22:36.269 --> 00:22:36.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:39.149 --> 00:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
2028 and that's pretty much
 
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
2247 arrived on my desk it it just it
 
00:22:57.149 --> 00:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
just arrived on my desk five minutes ago
 
00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
too and unfortunately I did not keep a
 
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
draft of the changes but um the first
 
00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
change that I see is down on page um one
 
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
on line um 18 uh it's received
 
00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
contributions it looks like make is um
 
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
highlighted I thought that was in the
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
original draft but um there was uh
 
00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
Senator Susie wanted to remove the word
 
00:23:24.279 --> 00:23:26.710 align:start position:0%
Senator Susie wanted to remove the word
political

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
political
 
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
party was it from what was
 
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
me it was um in Roman it's on uh page
 
00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
one Roman numeral 3 line
 
00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
20 21 the word um political party was in
 
00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:52.559 align:start position:0%
there and she asked that it be removed
 
00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:53.270 align:start position:0%
so that was
 
00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:54.630 align:start position:0%
so that was
[Music]

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:03.610 align:start position:0%
on page
 
00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:06.549 align:start position:0%
on page
[Music]

00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:08.669 --> 00:24:08.679 align:start position:0%
two if you don't mind just repeating the
 
00:24:08.679 --> 00:24:10.510 align:start position:0%
two if you don't mind just repeating the
last

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:24:14.269 --> 00:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
one page number one line
 
00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
21 the words political party were
 
00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
removed so it said for the success or
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
defeat of a political party candidate
 
00:24:25.149 --> 00:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
blah and she said we agreed that it was
 
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
superflous and it didn't really need to
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:33.549 --> 00:24:33.559 align:start position:0%
the term candidate candidates measure
 
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
measures is repeated throughout the bill
 
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
the chapter throughout the
 
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
bill um on line two page 22 the word uh
 
00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
for the definition of
 
00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
contribution um it's for Value received
 
00:24:53.789 --> 00:24:53.799 align:start position:0%
or made the re she again Senator Susie
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
asked that received be put in there um
 
00:24:59.470 --> 00:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
rather than the other way around made be
 
00:25:01.269 --> 00:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
put in rather than received and when we
 
00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
talked about it we decided it really
 
00:25:05.549 --> 00:25:05.559 align:start position:0%
need to be both because it would catch
 
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
both the donor and the uh political
 
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
committee to which it was
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:50.200 align:start position:0%
paper if you go over
 
00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:59.350 --> 00:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
expenditure um I don't know what line
 
00:26:01.789 --> 00:26:01.799 align:start position:0%
that's on we wish that we could have
 
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.029 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:12.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
right right going to the bottom of page
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
um it's independent expenditure actually
 
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
go to the bottom of page three the
 
00:26:25.549 --> 00:26:25.559 align:start position:0%
language that was changed is as it is
 
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
now that independent expenditure means
 
00:26:29.389 --> 00:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
the dispers ment of funds for an
 
00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
expenditure made by a political
 
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
committee or person that promotes the
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
success or defeat of any candidate or
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
measure that is made without and then it
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
continues as it was already written in
 
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
the draft that came back from the Senate
 
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is that she
 
00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:48.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to make it clear that it would
 
00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
promote the SE success or defeat of any
 
00:26:53.389 --> 00:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
candidate because that's in the current
 
00:26:55.149 --> 00:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
statute and she wanted to make it clear
 
00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
that that was the
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
case so that's um um 30 and
 
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:14.909 --> 00:27:14.919 align:start position:0%
three weren't that many changes to be
 
00:27:14.919 --> 00:27:16.430 align:start position:0%
three weren't that many changes to be
honest

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
honest
 
00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
um on page eight and I'll have her
 
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
confirm this when she gets here but um
 
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
it's not page eight I'm
 
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
sorry it's page eight on our previous
 
00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.510 align:start position:0%
sorry it's page eight on our previous
draft

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
draft
 
00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
nine um line
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
22 the L the language except for the
 
00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
statement in paragraph Roman numeral I
 
00:27:43.509 --> 00:27:43.519 align:start position:0%
below which shall be inclusive through
 
00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:45.799 align:start position:0%
the Tuesday before the statement is due
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
that was added by um deputy secretary of
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
state um Aaron Hennessy to make sure
 
00:27:53.549 --> 00:27:53.559 align:start position:0%
that the last two days of the election
 
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:56.559 align:start position:0%
cycle were included in the last report
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
which is um I which is
 
00:28:04.669 --> 00:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
the oh okay I didn't but good all right
 
00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
so it's not an addition and then
 
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
everything else is the
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
6644 changed a bit and this is what I
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
wanted Senator Susi to get back to me on
 
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
because I haven't had her confirm this
 
00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:44.389 align:start position:0%
because I haven't had her confirm this
yet

00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:47.669 --> 00:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
um it has to do with the removal of
 
00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
political advocacy committees in the
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
oh okay oh it's still in okay well page
 
00:29:05.389 --> 00:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
seven at the bottom it's line 32 and
 
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:10.360 align:start position:0%
then it continues over onto page
 
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
eight no it's I'm sorry they're both on
 
00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
line 32 political advocacy organization
 
00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
on line 32 um we asked whether it should
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
come out because in line 31 it says any
 
00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799 align:start position:0%
other political committee and a
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
political advocacy organization is a
 
00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
political committee so it wasn't making
 
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
sense to us to have them both in there
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
one at 30 and one it
 
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
unlimited so she was going to check and
 
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
get back to me on
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
out and it looks to me when you turn
 
00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
over on page eight that there's
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
something missing
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
35 and then
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
36 there should
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
there okay so this isn't necessarily the
 
00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:13.720 align:start position:0%
finished product this is not the
 
00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.909 align:start position:0%
finished product this is not the
finished

00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
finished
 
00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
product do you want to mark it up this
 
00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
lot I guess my suggestion would be to
 
00:30:28.269 --> 00:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
break and not try to dig into this right
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
now break until a mutually agreeable
 
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
time later after both sides have had a
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
chance to review this it's up to you
 
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
Senator I think
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
that we need a final
 
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:47.320 align:start position:0%
version unfortunate that sus has a
 
00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.070 align:start position:0%
version unfortunate that sus has a
conflicting

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
conflicting
 
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
committee well I think it will only take
 
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
us 10 or 15 minutes to go through
 
00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:56.440 align:start position:0%
it I know getting back together is the
 
00:31:00.509 --> 00:31:00.519 align:start position:0%
hardest part but yeah well yeah not
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
everyone needs to show up if we have an
 
00:31:06.909 --> 00:31:06.919 align:start position:0%
agreement I'm around all day so what's
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
up I'm around all day
 
00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:12.200 align:start position:0%
so there's no escaping Senator
 
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
abis all right so do you want to do that
 
00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
yeah if you recess it for a half an hour
 
00:31:22.029 --> 00:31:22.039 align:start position:0%
or something and then we're late then
 
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
nobody's going to kill us if we're late
 
00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
yeah I can't recess then we have to do
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
it tomorrow okay whatever whatever the
 
00:31:31.269 --> 00:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
house rules allow you to do to get a a
 
00:31:33.389 --> 00:31:33.399 align:start position:0%
postponement for it's easy I simply
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
announce a break okay and then you and I
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
figure out when we want to come back and
 
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
when we figure that out we just do it
 
00:31:42.509 --> 00:31:42.519 align:start position:0%
okay all right so that's what's
 
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
happening there'll be no gavel cuz this
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
is not closed we're simply on a
 
00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:51.039 align:start position:0%
break all right let's move on to the
 
00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:56.830 align:start position:0%
break all right let's move on to the
next

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:26.830 align:start position:0%
 
one

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
we'll open the committee conference on
 
00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:19.870 align:start position:0%
we'll open the committee conference on
House

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
House
 
00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:23.509 align:start position:0%

00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
once Mr chairman I would just say that I
 
00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
think the the Senate position is
 
00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:52.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable the chain simply said that um
 
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
essentially uh change it from two free
 
00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
request to one and allow for other
 
00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
Electronic media provided by the clerk
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't need to be sent via email
 
00:34:09.069 --> 00:34:09.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
discussion house conf is okay with the
 
00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
changes Senate's
 
00:34:20.879 --> 00:34:22.950 align:start position:0%
changes Senate's
fine

00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:34:26.430 --> 00:34:26.440 align:start position:0%

00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:38.589 --> 00:34:38.599 align:start position:0%
and oddly now we have to wait 10
 
00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:56.200 align:start position:0%
fast was that
 
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:16.109 align:start position:0%

00:35:16.119 --> 00:35:23.030 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:25.119 align:start position:0%

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%

00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:24.829 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
qua

00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:24.839 align:start position:0%
qua
 
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr chairman uh my
 
00:46:34.109 --> 00:46:34.119 align:start position:0%
understanding of the differences between
 
00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
the House and Senate positions is that
 
00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
the house position called for having the
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
uh checklist updated every four years
 
00:46:49.069 --> 00:46:49.079 align:start position:0%
starting in 2027 with a 4-year look back
 
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
period meaning that someone hadn't voted
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
in four years they would be removed from
 
00:46:56.589 --> 00:46:56.599 align:start position:0%
the checklist the Senate position as I
 
00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
understand it was again a uh having the
 
00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
checklist updated every four years with
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
a six-year lookback period starting in
 
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
2025 and personally I think that the
 
00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
Senate position is acceptable thank you
 
00:47:20.829 --> 00:47:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
discussion Mr chair I don't know when
 
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
the appropriate time to tell you this is
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
but I will not be able to sign this
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
report okay
 
00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:32.359 align:start position:0%
so and Senator gray I think you
 
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:35.720 align:start position:0%
explained the idea was that if um
 
00:47:37.829 --> 00:47:37.839 align:start position:0%
somebody missed two presidential
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
elections then they got flagged on
 
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
this we moved the date from 27 back to
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
25 so it would happen right after the
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
presidential election and then we did
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
look back two years because most of the
 
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
voters that are affected by this are
 
00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
voters who
 
00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:01.400 align:start position:0%
who through their own choice usually
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
vote just in the presidential elections
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
and so this uh hopefully will cut down
 
00:48:09.549 --> 00:48:09.559 align:start position:0%
on the number of people who come in and
 
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
re-register uh but if we do implement
 
00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
the provisions in
 
00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
1370 if they are or were registered they
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
would not have to prove citizenship Etc
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
they would only be required to prove uh
 
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:29.960 align:start position:0%
uh identity and uh Gan for the their
 
00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:31.190 align:start position:0%
uh identity and uh Gan for the their
existing

00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
existing
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
else then I think the report will be to
 
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:55.720 --> 00:49:25.710 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:55.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:55.640 align:start position:0%

01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:45.160 align:start position:0%
line six on page
 
01:03:48.670 --> 01:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
one um near the end of the thing it says
 
01:03:51.309 --> 01:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
the Mover and that was supposed to be
 
01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
either voter or applicant and applicant
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
is the word that I want uh because the
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
two lines above that we talk about by
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
the applicant uh because they are until
 
01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
they get uh certified and registered
 
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
they're an applicant so uh that's one
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
change uh the other thing that we did
 
01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
talk about and that's on page two uh on
 
01:04:16.829 --> 01:04:16.839 align:start position:0%
the back is the
 
01:04:18.910 --> 01:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation and we talked about that
 
01:04:21.309 --> 01:04:21.319 align:start position:0%
when we talked about the portal Bill
 
01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
463 is that if we're going to make this
 
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
work that does need to be in appr
 
01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation the appropriation was in
 
01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
463 463 looks like it is uh going to be
 
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh not concurred on uh so that we would
 
01:04:41.029 --> 01:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
need uh the $100,000 that I put in here
 
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh to do uh the things that stand up
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
that group on Election Day uh but this
 
01:04:50.269 --> 01:04:50.279 align:start position:0%
actually has that group available
 
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
through uh noon time on Friday uh for
 
01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
making adjustments
 
01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
um and if we're going to also do the uh
 
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
tablets that would have the database on
 
01:05:07.109 --> 01:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
there for the whole state uh so the per
 
01:05:10.029 --> 01:05:10.039 align:start position:0%
person who comes in and says I'm in
 
01:05:12.029 --> 01:05:12.039 align:start position:0%
Manchester w i was registered in
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester 1 and now I'm in Manchester 7
 
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
or wherever uh they would be able to
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
look that person up and they would not
 
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
need to prove uh anything but uh their
 
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
identity and
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
doicy uh and that because of the actions
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
we took on 63 that 100,000 may actually
 
01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
need to go up some uh to to accomplish
 
01:05:40.829 --> 01:05:40.839 align:start position:0%
all that within the funds that we have
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh but this would also decrease the
 
01:05:46.829 --> 01:05:46.839 align:start position:0%
amount of time that the investigator in
 
01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
the AG's office uh has to spend uh the
 
01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
data that I got from uh 15 uh 16117
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
election time period uh from the
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State said that they spent
 
01:06:00.559 --> 01:06:01.470 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State said that they spent
uh

01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:01.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
871 hours and that's the last data that
 
01:06:07.870 --> 01:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
I have uh for that uh on those
 
01:06:10.029 --> 01:06:10.039 align:start position:0%
investigations which is almost a half a
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
man year um so uh I think that uh with
 
01:06:17.029 --> 01:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
the addition of this amendment uh we are
 
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
on track we will uh be able to withstand
 
01:06:24.430 --> 01:06:24.440 align:start position:0%
any challenge either from the court or
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
someone who thinks that
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
uh we're going to lose Motor Voter
 
01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
because on Election Day anybody that
 
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
comes in if they thought they had proper
 
01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
documentation uh this the way it's
 
01:06:38.430 --> 01:06:38.440 align:start position:0%
written right now would give them relief
 
01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
either through the court or be able to
 
01:06:44.109 --> 01:06:44.119 align:start position:0%
provide that documentation themselves uh
 
01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:47.480 align:start position:0%
by noon time on Friday or they would be
 
01:06:51.269 --> 01:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
able to uh uh the group if they could
 
01:06:53.549 --> 01:06:53.559 align:start position:0%
verify it after the fact they would be
 
01:06:56.109 --> 01:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
able to but remember it is still the
 
01:06:58.029 --> 01:06:58.039 align:start position:0%
voter's responsibility or the
 
01:06:59.910 --> 01:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
applicant's responsibility whatever you
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
want to call them at that time uh to
 
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
provide the
 
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
documentation uh that they have
 
01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:07.799 align:start position:0%
established a domicile that they are a
 
01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
citizen and they have attained the age
 
01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
and to prove any of those you first have
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
to prove identity uh because your
 
01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
documents like your birth certificate uh
 
01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
you know doesn't prove identity and so
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
you need to to know that so those are my
 
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
comments I don't know if any the
 
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
Senators have additional
 
01:07:30.829 --> 01:07:30.839 align:start position:0%
comments I have a question the the
 
01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
effective date on the
 
01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:34.990 align:start position:0%
effective date on the
bill

01:07:34.990 --> 01:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:07:38.510 --> 01:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
yep is so a lot of these changes if it
 
01:07:41.789 --> 01:07:41.799 align:start position:0%
were uh on upon Passage would they
 
01:07:44.789 --> 01:07:44.799 align:start position:0%
impact the next election
 
01:07:47.710 --> 01:07:47.720 align:start position:0%
correct and my conversations with
 
01:07:49.950 --> 01:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
secretary of state is that he can be
 
01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
and see he didn't even shake his head no
 
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:05.589 --> 01:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
that you have to go up
 
01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
is what about changing the effective day
 
01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:20.789 --> 01:08:20.799 align:start position:0%
election question for the senator
 
01:08:20.799 --> 01:08:22.590 align:start position:0%
election question for the senator
actually

01:08:22.590 --> 01:08:22.600 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
um the having these provisions go into
 
01:08:29.709 --> 01:08:29.719 align:start position:0%
effect before the primary you know gives
 
01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:32.199 align:start position:0%
you an election before the general
 
01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
election to try out everything that's
 
01:08:36.789 --> 01:08:36.799 align:start position:0%
going on I would expect that the
 
01:08:39.669 --> 01:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
provision in here for data verification
 
01:08:42.829 --> 01:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
ballot would be higher in the primary
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
because people are getting used to the
 
01:08:48.829 --> 01:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
process um and if if I don't make it
 
01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:51.640 align:start position:0%
effective then I don't get the benefits
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
of that either for the voter or for the
 
01:08:57.950 --> 01:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
State uh and and that's why although it
 
01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:01.400 align:start position:0%
be hurried uh the Secretary of State if
 
01:09:05.470 --> 01:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
he's got the time to uh to do it then
 
01:09:08.669 --> 01:09:08.679 align:start position:0%
I'm that's when it should happen Mr
 
01:09:10.510 --> 01:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
secretary you're
 
01:09:12.669 --> 01:09:12.679 align:start position:0%
up not at
 
01:09:23.669 --> 01:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
what so about getting this implemented
 
01:09:28.110 --> 01:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
for the upcoming
 
01:09:30.669 --> 01:09:30.679 align:start position:0%
election my question is I know that a
 
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
lot of legal challenges to changes in
 
01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:33.630 align:start position:0%
lot of legal challenges to changes in
election

01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
law uh especially for injunctive Relief
 
01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
are successful when it's close which is
 
01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
not actually properly legally defined as
 
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
far as I can tell to an upcoming
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
election is there risk of us making
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
these changes for the upcoming
 
01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
election there is no question that that
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
either this bill or
 
01:09:59.830 --> 01:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
1569 changes the process enough that we
 
01:10:01.870 --> 01:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
are going to have to do extensive
 
01:10:04.590 --> 01:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
training uh with local election
 
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
officials and the general public to help
 
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
them understand uh what the law change
 
01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
is we're certainly willing to make every
 
01:10:16.189 --> 01:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
effort uh to do that but there are three
 
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
months between now and the state primary
 
01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
election uh and five months before the
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
so you think it's okay to implement this
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
immediately I think if that's the choice
 
01:10:33.669 --> 01:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
of this legislature we would do
 
01:10:35.310 --> 01:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
everything in our power to make it
 
01:10:39.229 --> 01:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
happen Okay further discussion Senator
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
gray there are good parts in this bill I
 
01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
I do not want you to push the date out
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh but parts of this like standing up
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
that group uh and having tablets
 
01:10:54.669 --> 01:10:54.679 align:start position:0%
available at the various polling places
 
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
so that people people don't have to
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
prove citizenship is a benefit to the
 
01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
voter it's a benefit to the people who
 
01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
are doing it it should make the process
 
01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
go quicker and smoother so there are
 
01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
benefits in this uh but again you know I
 
01:11:13.390 --> 01:11:13.400 align:start position:0%
believe that we can withstand the court
 
01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
challenge uh at some point you know I
 
01:11:20.189 --> 01:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
imagine that there will be a challenge
 
01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
but everyone who walks into that
 
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
poll that provides information
 
01:11:28.990 --> 01:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
disproven by a research of the
 
01:11:34.510 --> 01:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
information is actually going to get to
 
01:11:37.629 --> 01:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
vote on that day some of them may have
 
01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
to provide additional information but
 
01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
again you know we will try to help them
 
01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
do that but it's still the voter's
 
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
documentation further discussion
 
01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.790 align:start position:0%
documentation further discussion
represent

01:11:53.790 --> 01:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
L um are you are you aware that the
 
01:11:59.430 --> 01:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
clerks and uh Association is against
 
01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
this bill for exactly the same reason
 
01:12:03.149 --> 01:12:03.159 align:start position:0%
that you
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
indicated and um have you talked with
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
the clerks about getting this
 
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
implemented and what's going to happen
 
01:12:12.990 --> 01:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
in a
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
very um uh shall we say watched election
 
01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:24.149 align:start position:0%
 
2024

01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
2024
 
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
um question is for
 
01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
me sorry it was for Senator gray okay uh
 
01:12:32.629 --> 01:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
I have talked to various people in the
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
clerk's Association I've talked to them
 
01:12:37.950 --> 01:12:37.960 align:start position:0%
over the years and one thing I can tell
 
01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
you is uh pretty much
 
01:12:45.550 --> 01:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
consisteny if a clerk um is required to
 
01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
do more than the clerk's Association uh
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
normally comes in and opposes whatever
 
01:12:55.470 --> 01:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
bill it is okay right now this bill is
 
01:12:58.750 --> 01:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
uh aimed at the voter it is aimed at
 
01:13:03.149 --> 01:13:03.159 align:start position:0%
election Integrity it is trying to uh
 
01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
satisfy both the people on the far right
 
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
and the far left uh that we are doing
 
01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
everything that we can do uh to help the
 
01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
voter uh except just taking their word
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
201 uh 1617 data which was compr uh
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
compiled by the AG's office there were
 
01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.470 align:start position:0%
compiled by the AG's office there were
230

01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
230
 
01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
affidavits that the inspectors in the
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
AG's office could not verify could not
 
01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
find the
 
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
people yes we have not had a lot of
 
01:13:42.270 --> 01:13:42.280 align:start position:0%
people who have been
 
01:13:46.629 --> 01:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
prosecuted but 230 that I can't find now
 
01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
there is a disclaimer in the report and
 
01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
I agree with it that I do not believe
 
01:13:53.950 --> 01:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
that all 230 of those people voted
 
01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:56.270 align:start position:0%
that all 230 of those people voted
improperly

01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
improperly
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
I don't think the number would be
 
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
anywhere near
 
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
230 but just because it happens
 
01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
infrequently you still lock your door at
 
01:14:07.390 --> 01:14:07.400 align:start position:0%
night you still lock your car when you
 
01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
park it here in the parking lot you
 
01:14:14.229 --> 01:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
still do all those things to in ensure
 
01:14:17.310 --> 01:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
the safety and integrity of your
 
01:14:19.950 --> 01:14:19.960 align:start position:0%
curtilage and your
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
property this is just another measure
 
01:14:25.709 --> 01:14:25.719 align:start position:0%
this is instead of having a person come
 
01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
in not have the documentation fill out
 
01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
an affidavit and then have them in
 
01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
investigated we're taking out the
 
01:14:35.629 --> 01:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
documentation we're taking out that
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
affidavit and we're going to do the
 
01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
inspection or the investigation on
 
01:14:43.709 --> 01:14:43.719 align:start position:0%
election day but if for some reason we
 
01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
can't this amendment gives them an out
 
01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
they can provide the documentation
 
01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
within the we'll say noon time on
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
Tuesday to noon time on Friday is three
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
days okay and we will also try to assist
 
01:14:59.629 --> 01:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
them in getting that information through
 
01:15:02.350 --> 01:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
this group and that this amendment does
 
01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
that further
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
discussion represent Lane um this is for
 
01:15:17.470 --> 01:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State um scandin have have
 
01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
you talked with anybody um at the
 
01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:21.550 align:start position:0%
you talked with anybody um at the
federal

01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:21.560 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:15:24.669 --> 01:15:24.679 align:start position:0%
doj um to assure us that we're not going
 
01:15:28.189 --> 01:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
to lose um our status under
 
01:15:31.709 --> 01:15:31.719 align:start position:0%
NV National the national voter
 
01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
registration I have not spoken with
 
01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
anybody from the federal
 
01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
doj uh New Hampshire has an exemption
 
01:15:41.310 --> 01:15:41.320 align:start position:0%
from the national voter registration act
 
01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
because we have election day
 
01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
registration um I don't see anything in
 
01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
this bill that you know where the
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
statute eliminates election day
 
01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:57.709 align:start position:0%
statute eliminates election day
registration

01:15:57.709 --> 01:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
registration
 
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh voters as long as they bring in the
 
01:16:03.629 --> 01:16:03.639 align:start position:0%
documentation that is required uh will
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to register and
 
01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:11.960 align:start position:0%
vote going beyond that you know if
 
01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:15.080 align:start position:0%
voters have trouble with that process on
 
01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
the day of the election you know does
 
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
that constitute a violation I I don't
 
01:16:21.950 --> 01:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that that's a legal
 
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:30.910 --> 01:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
I have more questions I'm assuming
 
01:16:32.629 --> 01:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
you're just going to go through all this
 
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
would that would make it simpler if I
 
01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
just asked the Secretary of State to
 
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
answer those
 
01:16:41.189 --> 01:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
questions um would you be willing those
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
were very thoughtful questions by the
 
01:16:44.669 --> 01:16:44.679 align:start position:0%
way thank
 
01:16:47.950 --> 01:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
you um do you think that you could run
 
01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:49.400 align:start position:0%
through them and answer them for us
 
01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:51.320 align:start position:0%
because they're concerns that I know
 
01:16:53.550 --> 01:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
that you and I have spoken about and
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
that others have spoken about
 
01:16:55.360 --> 01:17:01.470 align:start position:0%
that others have spoken about
out

01:17:01.470 --> 01:17:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
certainly so I the first one I just
 
01:17:07.229 --> 01:17:07.239 align:start position:0%
answered uh the second question have you
 
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
talked with anyone I answered that one
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
too so
 
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
um what percentage of granite Staters
 
01:17:18.629 --> 01:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
were born outside of New Hampshire uh I
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
don't have that number but I would
 
01:17:24.110 --> 01:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
safely say that there is a high number
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
01:17:28.149 --> 01:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
citizens and voters in New Hampshire who
 
01:17:31.470 --> 01:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
were not born in the state what I do
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
know is that there are about 45,000
 
01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
voters that were born in different
 
01:17:44.629 --> 01:17:44.639 align:start position:0%
countries and of those uh uh about
 
01:17:47.669 --> 01:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
7,000 used a qualified voter affidavit
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
to prove their citizenship
 
01:17:54.189 --> 01:17:54.199 align:start position:0%
qualifications can I inter I guess I
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
don't understand the the purpose why do
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
we want to know how many Gran Staters
 
01:18:01.149 --> 01:18:01.159 align:start position:0%
were born outside of New Hampshire well
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
because it is often very difficult in my
 
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
case it was very difficult to obtain a
 
01:18:09.270 --> 01:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
birth certificate because uh the
 
01:18:11.669 --> 01:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
hospital that I was born in was burned
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
down as were their records so it was
 
01:18:16.590 --> 01:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
very difficult for me I also when I got
 
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
married I did not uh take my husband's
 
01:18:22.590 --> 01:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
name but then took it later so when I
 
01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
went to register I had to get a copy of
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
my divorce certificate so these are
 
01:18:31.149 --> 01:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
steps that I don't think people expect
 
01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
to be taking and I guess I want to bring
 
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
that home that this is a whole new
 
01:18:36.990 --> 01:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
regime for people who want to register
 
01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
to vote where you from I was born in the
 
01:18:44.110 --> 01:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
great state of West Virginia oh maybe
 
01:18:46.229 --> 01:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
that's it I was born in New York in
 
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
1964 seeing the horrible mistake they
 
01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
made they tore down the hospital in
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
1965 and a couple of years ago I had to
 
01:18:55.950 --> 01:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
get my birth certificate I never got out
 
01:18:57.790 --> 01:18:57.800 align:start position:0%
of my jammies or left my house I did it
 
01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
online I couldn't just apply for one and
 
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
they sent it to me um I don't you were
 
01:19:06.669 --> 01:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
lucky maybe that was a product of West
 
01:19:10.149 --> 01:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
Virginia senator gray um some of the
 
01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
data that uh representative Lan is is
 
01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
speaking to is supported by by other
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
things that are going on uh if
 
01:19:23.149 --> 01:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
uh there's a a a what they call a save
 
01:19:26.189 --> 01:19:26.199 align:start position:0%
database and that's uh
 
01:19:29.189 --> 01:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
systematic alien verification for
 
01:19:31.830 --> 01:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
entitlements program that has a lot of
 
01:19:34.990 --> 01:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
information about people's citizenship
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh there is uh the data that is behind
 
01:19:43.790 --> 01:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
the scenes for your uh real ID uh the ID
 
01:19:46.030 --> 01:19:46.040 align:start position:0%
itself doesn't have the data but it is
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
in a database where a person for the D
 
01:19:50.910 --> 01:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
from the DMV has actually looked at your
 
01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
birth certificate that you provided for
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
that there is uh information on
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
TransUnion uh certainly in my
 
01:20:00.510 --> 01:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
conversations with the AG's office uh
 
01:20:02.470 --> 01:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things we did is uh we had
 
01:20:05.790 --> 01:20:05.800 align:start position:0%
him looked me up uh and he could tell me
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh within a year period of when I got my
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
Social Security and when I got my social
 
01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
security number uh and there's a lot of
 
01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
other information in TransUnion U that
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
is the kind of database between Equifax
 
01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
and Transunion is where when you call up
 
01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
and they say well we're going to ask you
 
01:20:26.669 --> 01:20:26.679 align:start position:0%
some questions uh which of these three
 
01:20:29.790 --> 01:20:29.800 align:start position:0%
places did you live in uh which of this
 
01:20:31.709 --> 01:20:31.719 align:start position:0%
that or the other thing and Transunion
 
01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
has that and remember that the criteria
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
is more likely than not okay so I I say
 
01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
that a young person comes in uh and
 
01:20:45.390 --> 01:20:45.400 align:start position:0%
they're uh driving a vehicle okay that
 
01:20:46.910 --> 01:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle may be registered in their
 
01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
mother and father's name but since
 
01:20:51.790 --> 01:20:51.800 align:start position:0%
they're driving it and they are 18 years
 
01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
old or 19 years old and they said they
 
01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
live at the same residence well that in
 
01:20:59.910 --> 01:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
itself might not be sufficient but if
 
01:21:02.350 --> 01:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
there's one or two other pieces you
 
01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
quickly get to the level of it's more
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
likely than not that their domicile is
 
01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
wherever um and again you know we're
 
01:21:14.669 --> 01:21:14.679 align:start position:0%
doing what we can but again it's the
 
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
voter's responsibility to provide the
 
01:21:21.629 --> 01:21:21.639 align:start position:0%
documentation it is not the state's
 
01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility thank
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
you could you continue general question
 
01:21:29.149 --> 01:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
is this bill changing the voter
 
01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
requirements or just the
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:39.950 --> 01:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
documentation repent Lane
 
01:21:42.350 --> 01:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
cons could U the Secretary of State
 
01:21:44.189 --> 01:21:44.199 align:start position:0%
please continue to answer the questions
 
01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
raised what was asking if the Secretary
 
01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
of State could continue to answer the
 
01:21:55.990 --> 01:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
questions that were raised in Senator
 
01:21:57.990 --> 01:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
susi's in my letter to
 
01:22:01.870 --> 01:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
him have ADD it and a key piece is how
 
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
the bill affects the
 
01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
question uh so the next question is how
 
01:22:10.709 --> 01:22:10.719 align:start position:0%
will these measures impact married women
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
whose names may not match their birth
 
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
certificates will they bring their
 
01:22:17.709 --> 01:22:17.719 align:start position:0%
marriage certificates and what if they
 
01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
were married outside of New
 
01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't know the answer to
 
01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
that question other than to say that
 
01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:26.830 align:start position:0%
that question other than to say that
that

01:22:26.830 --> 01:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
is an
 
01:22:32.229 --> 01:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
identity uh issue and New Hampshire
 
01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
currently has voter ID law uh where a
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
voter has to show their uh
 
01:22:44.910 --> 01:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
uh their photo identity to obtain a
 
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
ballot and issues related to that would
 
01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:50.440 align:start position:0%
be addressed in that process and right
 
01:22:53.629 --> 01:22:53.639 align:start position:0%
now we know that it is just a fraction
 
01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
of one % of Voters who do not have uh
 
01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
the appropriate
 
01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
identification and currently have to
 
01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
fill out a challenge voter affidavit and
 
01:23:08.590 --> 01:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
taken the next question is what
 
01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
Provisions are there for US citizens
 
01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:14.990 align:start position:0%
Provisions are there for US citizens
born

01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
born
 
01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
abroad uh including those born to
 
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.510 align:start position:0%
abroad uh including those born to
military

01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
military
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
families again if a uh um
 
01:23:27.709 --> 01:23:27.719 align:start position:0%
if it's a United States citizen they
 
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
should have documentation whether it's a
 
01:23:32.669 --> 01:23:32.679 align:start position:0%
passport or whatnot that they can bring
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
in uh military uh Personnel registering
 
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
to vote have to comply with Federal
 
01:23:41.629 --> 01:23:41.639 align:start position:0%
requirements in that process and they
 
01:23:43.189 --> 01:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
simply have to fill out a federal
 
01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
postcard application to become
 
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
registered to vote and I don't believe
 
01:23:52.590 --> 01:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
that changes uh with this proposed
 
01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
legislation how many voters will these
 
01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:56.310 align:start position:0%
legislation how many voters will these
bills

01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
affect um again I don't have a specific
 
01:24:03.070 --> 01:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
number that I can give you what I can
 
01:24:08.990 --> 01:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
tell you is uh historical numbers uh New
 
01:24:11.310 --> 01:24:11.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire went through a verification of
 
01:24:13.229 --> 01:24:13.239 align:start position:0%
the checklist some people call it a
 
01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
purge where there were about
 
01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
175,000 names removed from the
 
01:24:21.149 --> 01:24:21.159 align:start position:0%
checklist and what happens in the
 
01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
election or two after that occurs are
 
01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
those individuals will re-register to
 
01:24:30.750 --> 01:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
get back onto the checklist my
 
01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
understanding of the reading of this
 
01:24:36.629 --> 01:24:36.639 align:start position:0%
bill is that once identity and domicile
 
01:24:36.639 --> 01:24:37.669 align:start position:0%
bill is that once identity and domicile
are

01:24:37.669 --> 01:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:40.639 align:start position:0%
established any voter who was priorly
 
01:24:43.629 --> 01:24:43.639 align:start position:0%
registered in the system is would
 
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
automatically be accepted
 
01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
so we know that in uh 2012 for example a
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
presidential election immediately
 
01:24:59.229 --> 01:24:59.239 align:start position:0%
following a purge there were about
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
100,000 people registering to vote on
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
the day of the election uh in in that
 
01:25:07.470 --> 01:25:07.480 align:start position:0%
election I would expect we're going to
 
01:25:08.590 --> 01:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
have similar
 
01:25:11.950 --> 01:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
numbers uh in this election this
 
01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:15.229 align:start position:0%
numbers uh in this election this
presidential

01:25:15.229 --> 01:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
election I would believe the large
 
01:25:21.310 --> 01:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
percentage of those voters are
 
01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
already in inactive in the system
 
01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh but they would be quickly verified uh
 
01:25:31.270 --> 01:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
by searching their identity in the
 
01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
system so I think we're we would be
 
01:25:35.669 --> 01:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
dealing with a number probably in the
 
01:25:39.070 --> 01:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
low tens of thousands um you know in
 
01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:41.480 align:start position:0%
terms of numbers of individuals tens of
 
01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
thousands is that what you said I yes
 
01:25:51.990 --> 01:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:55.390 --> 01:25:55.400 align:start position:0%
25,000 what number of affected voter
 
01:25:58.990 --> 01:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
do I consider acceptable um you know
 
01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
obviously I firmly believe
 
01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
that any voter who's qualified to vote
 
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
should be able to exercise that right uh
 
01:26:13.950 --> 01:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
to be able to cast that vote uh I also
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
believe though that you know in New
 
01:26:18.189 --> 01:26:18.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it is incredibly easy to
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
register to vote and to go to a polling
 
01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
place and vote uh I think that it is a
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
legitimate concern of those people that
 
01:26:30.270 --> 01:26:30.280 align:start position:0%
are concerned about who is
 
01:26:34.510 --> 01:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
participating that they have uh backup
 
01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
information that those individuals that
 
01:26:39.709 --> 01:26:39.719 align:start position:0%
are participating are qualified so uh I
 
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
don't think that it is um voter
 
01:26:46.750 --> 01:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
suppression or uh too much to ask voters
 
01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
to be able
 
01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
to you know give that confidence that
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
they're qualified to vote there are
 
01:26:58.030 --> 01:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
limits I mean it can go to an extreme uh
 
01:27:01.709 --> 01:27:01.719 align:start position:0%
in either direction but uh you know I
 
01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
believe that asking for qualifications
 
01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:11.550 --> 01:27:11.560 align:start position:0%
unreasonable additionally what happens
 
01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
if someone shows up to register without
 
01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
a birth certificate or
 
01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
passport uh as Senator gray mentioned
 
01:27:23.149 --> 01:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
there is a provision in in this bill for
 
01:27:25.709 --> 01:27:25.719 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State to organize
 
01:27:28.629 --> 01:27:28.639 align:start position:0%
basically a phone bag with other state
 
01:27:31.990 --> 01:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
agencies that have access to databases
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
where this information uh would be
 
01:27:39.149 --> 01:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
available and that it would be
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
uh up to my office and that call center
 
01:27:45.910 --> 01:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
to try and confirm uh qualifications
 
01:27:51.109 --> 01:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
within 20 minutes and if uh that
 
01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
confirmation could not be made then
 
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
there was a process by which that voter
 
01:27:58.430 --> 01:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
could cast either a a judicial review
 
01:28:08.350 --> 01:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:10.750 --> 01:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
ballot how long does it typically take
 
01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
to obtain these documents and what are
 
01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
the associated
 
01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:17.910 align:start position:0%
the associated
costs

01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:28:20.229 --> 01:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
um you know I think we all know what the
 
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
process is for getting a driver's
 
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
license or a passport you know getting a
 
01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
passport could cost uh you know a a
 
01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
person depending on whether it's a pass
 
01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
card or passport somewhere between I
 
01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
don't know 80 and
 
01:28:38.830 --> 01:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
$150 you know driver's license fees are
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
what they
 
01:28:43.229 --> 01:28:43.239 align:start position:0%
are uh it's easy for a person to who's
 
01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
born in New Hampshire to obtain a birth
 
01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
certificate there for a reasonable cost
 
01:28:52.229 --> 01:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
other states have different processes
 
01:28:54.550 --> 01:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
for doing that are you
 
01:28:58.030 --> 01:28:58.040 align:start position:0%
aware of how long it takes to get um
 
01:28:58.040 --> 01:28:59.750 align:start position:0%
aware of how long it takes to get um
citizenship

01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
citizenship
 
01:29:07.669 --> 01:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
not how how will our election officials
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
be prepared by September and what is my
 
01:29:18.070 --> 01:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
response to their concerns
 
01:29:21.229 --> 01:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
um my my response to their concerns is
 
01:29:24.350 --> 01:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
that I agree that what has been being
 
01:29:28.990 --> 01:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
asked is a significant new program and
 
01:29:33.109 --> 01:29:33.119 align:start position:0%
it will require effort on the part of
 
01:29:36.990 --> 01:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
every local election official to be
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
trained on this new process so that they
 
01:29:45.470 --> 01:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
understand it I know from past
 
01:29:47.950 --> 01:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
exercises you know on laws that have
 
01:29:50.990 --> 01:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
passed uh we can do very extensive
 
01:29:52.830 --> 01:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
training uh and there will be
 
01:29:55.870 --> 01:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
individuals at at the local level that
 
01:29:58.870 --> 01:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh will not do it properly uh as
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
innocent as you know those issues are uh
 
01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
my office has already ramped up a very
 
01:30:10.189 --> 01:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
significant training program that is
 
01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
available to all uh local election
 
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
officials we do it in person we're doing
 
01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
recording of training so that they're
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
available online we do webinars and so
 
01:30:23.709 --> 01:30:23.719 align:start position:0%
we will we can make that effort to make
 
01:30:26.430 --> 01:30:26.440 align:start position:0%
sure that the information is
 
01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:28.030 align:start position:0%
sure that the information is
available

01:30:28.030 --> 01:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:30:31.350 --> 01:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
again my office still has to develop
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
what these procedures are going to be
 
01:30:36.189 --> 01:30:36.199 align:start position:0%
and then we have to train them uh within
 
01:30:38.830 --> 01:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
a three-month window before the state
 
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
primary uh and then the big event in
 
01:30:45.470 --> 01:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
November at the general
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
election regarding the proposed election
 
01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
hotline how will it operate what will it
 
01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
cost how many staff will it require
 
01:30:56.709 --> 01:30:56.719 align:start position:0%
what is the expected duration of the
 
01:30:59.070 --> 01:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
average call uh I don't know the answer
 
01:31:04.030 --> 01:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:07.310 --> 01:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
moment do you anticipate implementation
 
01:31:09.790 --> 01:31:09.800 align:start position:0%
of this legislation could result in long
 
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
lines and delays and do all New
 
01:31:15.229 --> 01:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire polling places have adequate
 
01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
cell phone service to support this
 
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
hotline um if this is not done properly
 
01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
it could result in uh delays uh and
 
01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
possibly voters leaving the polling
 
01:31:30.159 --> 01:31:33.790 align:start position:0%
possibly voters leaving the polling
place

01:31:33.790 --> 01:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
um the the Bill calls for extending the
 
01:31:41.109 --> 01:31:41.119 align:start position:0%
call center for
 
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
verification Beyond just election day so
 
01:31:46.149 --> 01:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
that we can continue to work to make
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
sure that voters who could not be
 
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
confirmed within that initial 20 minutes
 
01:31:55.109 --> 01:31:55.119 align:start position:0%
have a thorough review um and have an
 
01:32:01.070 --> 01:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
counted finally have you had any
 
01:32:07.229 --> 01:32:07.239 align:start position:0%
discussions with other agencies such as
 
01:32:10.109 --> 01:32:10.119 align:start position:0%
doj safety or
 
01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
hotline how many agencies do you expect
 
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
to participate and how many people will
 
01:32:22.510 --> 01:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
be required to staff the
 
01:32:25.149 --> 01:32:25.159 align:start position:0%
calls how long you anticipate a voter
 
01:32:27.510 --> 01:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
will need to wait for their information
 
01:32:28.669 --> 01:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
verified I have had superficial
 
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
conversations with other agencies uh and
 
01:32:38.350 --> 01:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
they are willing to participate in this
 
01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
effort obviously the objective and the
 
01:32:43.470 --> 01:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
goal would be to make sure that we are
 
01:32:46.629 --> 01:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
overstaffed in doing this as opposed to
 
01:32:50.070 --> 01:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
understaffed uh but those details still
 
01:32:52.350 --> 01:32:52.360 align:start position:0%
have to be worked
 
01:32:55.390 --> 01:32:55.400 align:start position:0%
out I believe that is the questions that
 
01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:57.750 align:start position:0%
out I believe that is the questions that
you

01:32:57.750 --> 01:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:00.590 --> 01:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
ask further
 
01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
discussion Senator
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
Avis thank you Mr chairman I just want
 
01:33:08.229 --> 01:33:08.239 align:start position:0%
to understand if I I want to make sure I
 
01:33:11.189 --> 01:33:11.199 align:start position:0%
understand this corre correctly we
 
01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
there's qualifications be eligible to
 
01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
vote and this is just requiring people
 
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate that they're actually
 
01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
eligible to vote so I guess when it
 
01:33:21.629 --> 01:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
comes to the
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
citizenship section if we're going to
 
01:33:25.470 --> 01:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
make that a
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
requirement why is it an issue to make
 
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
sure we're able to verify that when
 
01:33:33.229 --> 01:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
they're registering the vote I mean
 
01:33:35.709 --> 01:33:35.719 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's just there on paper with
 
01:33:37.109 --> 01:33:37.119 align:start position:0%
without any really Rhyme or Reason how
 
01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:45.510 --> 01:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
enforced representative Lan I think I
 
01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
can answer that question um Most states
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
do not require um uh proof of
 
01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
citizenship they take an affidavit um
 
01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
the reason being that there are some
 
01:34:00.149 --> 01:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
federal and there are state law uh uh
 
01:34:02.629 --> 01:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
repercussions uh if you lie on an
 
01:34:06.750 --> 01:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
affidavit uh statewise it's um up to
 
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
$5,000 and probably uh you would never
 
01:34:11.550 --> 01:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
become a citizen because then you would
 
01:34:13.390 --> 01:34:13.400 align:start position:0%
be down for fraud and you would never be
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
able to become a US citizen and it's
 
01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
unlikely that somebody is going to try
 
01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
to cheat to vote um and give up their
 
01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to become a US citizen um so
 
01:34:28.750 --> 01:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
Most states don't have it and um I think
 
01:34:30.189 --> 01:34:30.199 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're going to basically
 
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise 7,000 people
 
01:34:35.550 --> 01:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
because there's no proof that anybody
 
01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
has cheated on the citizen affidavit and
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
we are disenfranchising 7,000 people by
 
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.149 align:start position:0%
we are disenfranchising 7,000 people by
this

01:34:45.149 --> 01:34:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
bill Senator Greg um I take accep to the
 
01:34:54.750 --> 01:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
7,000 voters uh characterization uh the
 
01:34:56.270 --> 01:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
question that was answered where the
 
01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
7,000 came in was how many could be
 
01:35:01.229 --> 01:35:01.239 align:start position:0%
affected that affected could be people
 
01:35:03.229 --> 01:35:03.239 align:start position:0%
who didn't bring in an ID people who
 
01:35:05.550 --> 01:35:05.560 align:start position:0%
didn't bring in proof of domicile people
 
01:35:07.350 --> 01:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
who didn't and we
 
01:35:10.149 --> 01:35:10.159 align:start position:0%
addressed the concerns that were brought
 
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
to us by the
 
01:35:16.109 --> 01:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
opposition in every one of the things
 
01:35:20.109 --> 01:35:20.119 align:start position:0%
that that we could address okay the
 
01:35:23.149 --> 01:35:23.159 align:start position:0%
having a tablet uh available at the
 
01:35:25.950 --> 01:35:25.960 align:start position:0%
Poland place will cut down on the
 
01:35:29.149 --> 01:35:29.159 align:start position:0%
citizenship uh problems uh that you've
 
01:35:29.159 --> 01:35:30.750 align:start position:0%
citizenship uh problems uh that you've
cited

01:35:30.750 --> 01:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
cited
 
01:35:33.470 --> 01:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
considerably new registrations we could
 
01:35:35.709 --> 01:35:35.719 align:start position:0%
probably get the number of how many were
 
01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
new registrants that weren't you know
 
01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
but that's going to cost us time and
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
money okay I can tell you by the 25
 
01:35:48.669 --> 01:35:48.679 align:start position:0%
years that I was a moderator that it was
 
01:35:50.830 --> 01:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
very few people Hampshire that weren't
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
brand new voters new either moov moved
 
01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
into the state or whatever okay I've
 
01:35:58.990 --> 01:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
talked to the Secretary of State about
 
01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
having a public service announcements
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
that what we're doing and how to should
 
01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
be done when we implemented the
 
01:36:09.669 --> 01:36:09.679 align:start position:0%
affidavit ballot uh that took place
 
01:36:12.510 --> 01:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
within the last few weeks before the
 
01:36:14.430 --> 01:36:14.440 align:start position:0%
election it
 
01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
was rarely used and and I'll let the
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
secretary he probably knows the number
 
01:36:23.390 --> 01:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
okay and part of this is modeled after
 
01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
that same thing but we're going to try
 
01:36:28.430 --> 01:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
to help you if we
 
01:36:31.990 --> 01:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
can if you have a real ID and it's in
 
01:36:35.709 --> 01:36:35.719 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire fine if you have a a a a
 
01:36:38.629 --> 01:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
vehicle registered in the Hampshire okay
 
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
when I talked to the DMV people they
 
01:36:44.350 --> 01:36:44.360 align:start position:0%
said they could tell me every reg every
 
01:36:46.430 --> 01:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
vehicle that I've ever registered here
 
01:36:47.310 --> 01:36:47.320 align:start position:0%
in New
 
01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire okay if somebody walks in and
 
01:36:54.149 --> 01:36:54.159 align:start position:0%
they says okay yeah I had a uh a Chevy
 
01:36:58.030 --> 01:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
Nova a 1969 model that I registered
 
01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
brand new and you know that's pretty
 
01:37:03.669 --> 01:37:03.679 align:start position:0%
good indication that you know I am who I
 
01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
say I am right that maybe a social media
 
01:37:10.470 --> 01:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
account okay if you got a social media
 
01:37:12.109 --> 01:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
account that's been up for five or six
 
01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:14.360 align:start position:0%
years and you've got some other
 
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
corroborating information you meet the
 
01:37:19.510 --> 01:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
requirement of more likely than not in
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
my opinion that'll be up to the
 
01:37:23.149 --> 01:37:23.159 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and how he trains
 
01:37:25.149 --> 01:37:25.159 align:start position:0%
people we are not trying to
 
01:37:25.159 --> 01:37:27.830 align:start position:0%
people we are not trying to
disenfranchise

01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise
 
01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
anyone we are trying to help the V
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
voters meet their requirement to provide
 
01:37:39.310 --> 01:37:39.320 align:start position:0%
documentation of citizenship of age of
 
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
doile and then like I say many of those
 
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
documents don't prove who they're for so
 
01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
you then have to prove identity in
 
01:37:51.629 --> 01:37:51.639 align:start position:0%
addition to those for those other
 
01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
documents to work Mr chairman could I
 
01:37:55.870 --> 01:37:55.880 align:start position:0%
just make a quick clarification that I
 
01:37:58.109 --> 01:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
think is important that that 7,000
 
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
number was the number of of Voters that
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
filled out the qualified voter to
 
01:38:07.270 --> 01:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
establish their citizenship that were
 
01:38:09.790 --> 01:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
born out of the country those
 
01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
individuals are now on the
 
01:38:15.870 --> 01:38:15.880 align:start position:0%
checklist and so the only uh they were
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
already on the checklist as long as they
 
01:38:20.350 --> 01:38:20.360 align:start position:0%
prove their identity uh when they go to
 
01:38:23.950 --> 01:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
vote then they're going to be allowed to
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
oh thank you all right so I think I've
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
allowed a lot of latitude but this is
 
01:38:33.550 --> 01:38:33.560 align:start position:0%
clearly devolving into a debate on the
 
01:38:36.109 --> 01:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
bill and not the differences between the
 
01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
house and the
 
01:38:41.310 --> 01:38:41.320 align:start position:0%
Senate so let's try to zero win on
 
01:38:44.510 --> 01:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
that Senator gray your
 
01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:46.310 align:start position:0%
that Senator gray your
proposed

01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
01:38:50.990 --> 01:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
amendment right you want to change $1 to
 
01:38:54.750 --> 01:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
100,000 the amendment uh
 
01:38:58.950 --> 01:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
um has the the 100,000 in there and
 
01:39:01.109 --> 01:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
that's to fund the things that we didn't
 
01:39:02.910 --> 01:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
Fund in
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
463 uh the amendment does need at least
 
01:39:09.070 --> 01:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
one word change and that's on line six
 
01:39:12.750 --> 01:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
where it uh did an autoc correct and put
 
01:39:15.629 --> 01:39:15.639 align:start position:0%
in mover instead of voter but the actual
 
01:39:17.629 --> 01:39:17.639 align:start position:0%
correct word in there should be
 
01:39:19.950 --> 01:39:19.960 align:start position:0%
applicant because they are not a voter
 
01:39:22.589 --> 01:39:22.599 align:start position:0%
until they are registered so they are
 
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
applying so the the cor will not require
 
01:39:26.830 --> 01:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
voters to carry furniture into the
 
01:39:28.950 --> 01:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
polling place agreed
 
01:39:32.510 --> 01:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
amen so those that's to the amendment
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
that is the only change I have uh if the
 
01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
committee believes that you
 
01:39:42.629 --> 01:39:42.639 align:start position:0%
know probably if if I were to put in
 
01:39:45.390 --> 01:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
that dollar figure at the end right now
 
01:39:48.629 --> 01:39:48.639 align:start position:0%
I would probably go to 150,000 since we
 
01:39:51.109 --> 01:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
gutted all the money out of
 
01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
463 uh and I was depending upon on part
 
01:39:56.830 --> 01:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
of that to fund this but certainly
 
01:39:57.870 --> 01:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
whatever the
 
01:40:02.350 --> 01:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
committee's uh intent is or or comes to
 
01:40:07.669 --> 01:40:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:16.270 --> 01:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
there I don't see the Secretary of State
 
01:40:18.270 --> 01:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
shaking his head no
 
01:40:21.629 --> 01:40:21.639 align:start position:0%
so it's will 100,000 get us there I had
 
01:40:26.750 --> 01:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:28.360 align:start position:0%
say you want 100
 
01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:29.870 align:start position:0%
say you want 100
[Laughter]

01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:31.629 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
Grand

01:40:31.629 --> 01:40:31.639 align:start position:0%
Grand
 
01:40:31.639 --> 01:40:34.790 align:start position:0%
Grand
okay

01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
so changes to
 
01:40:40.109 --> 01:40:40.119 align:start position:0%
the amended by the Senate
 
01:40:42.910 --> 01:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
version your Amendment will have to fix
 
01:40:45.149 --> 01:40:45.159 align:start position:0%
mover and I looked at the language on
 
01:40:47.669 --> 01:40:47.679 align:start position:0%
the funding paragraph you just have to
 
01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
change the number right I think the rest
 
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
of the language is adequate the
 
01:40:54.589 --> 01:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
amendment already has the 100 th000 in
 
01:40:54.599 --> 01:40:57.189 align:start position:0%
amendment already has the 100 th000 in
it

01:40:57.189 --> 01:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:41:00.149 --> 01:41:00.159 align:start position:0%
okay the only change that I know of to
 
01:41:03.550 --> 01:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
my Amendment uh is changing that word
 
01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:06.750 align:start position:0%
my Amendment uh is changing that word
mover

01:41:06.750 --> 01:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:08.990 --> 01:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
okay anything
 
01:41:10.750 --> 01:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
else go
 
01:41:13.390 --> 01:41:13.400 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chair I just had one
 
01:41:15.310 --> 01:41:15.320 align:start position:0%
mechanical question on the amendment on
 
01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
line six where you have this 20 minute
 
01:41:20.550 --> 01:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
window I wondered when who starts the
 
01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
clock uh the wording that I put in there
 
01:41:27.589 --> 01:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
is not verified or disproven within 20
 
01:41:30.430 --> 01:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
minutes by the individuals trained by
 
01:41:32.709 --> 01:41:32.719 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state so as soon as
 
01:41:35.310 --> 01:41:35.320 align:start position:0%
they contact them that's when the clock
 
01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
signal I'm I'm willing to change the the
 
01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
wording in there to help you out uh I'm
 
01:41:48.750 --> 01:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
just curious do you have a
 
01:41:50.750 --> 01:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
suggestion yes but it's probably not
 
01:41:53.669 --> 01:41:53.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate at this time
 
01:41:56.669 --> 01:41:56.679 align:start position:0%
okay this says if we can't reconcile
 
01:41:58.990 --> 01:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
their issue within 20 minutes once
 
01:42:03.950 --> 01:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:07.629 --> 01:42:07.639 align:start position:0%
yeah making it longer would just prolong
 
01:42:07.639 --> 01:42:08.709 align:start position:0%
yeah making it longer would just prolong
the

01:42:08.709 --> 01:42:08.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
process and it but if they don't get
 
01:42:13.109 --> 01:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
resolve in 20 minutes they they get the
 
01:42:15.750 --> 01:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
Go cast their Bell and that's
 
01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
it you want to make it shorter I think
 
01:42:27.870 --> 01:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
okay so I think we can draft a
 
01:42:34.510 --> 01:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
report that has this make
 
01:42:37.589 --> 01:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
sure we don't have to be movers to vote
 
01:42:41.109 --> 01:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
and and 100,000 was already in here
 
01:42:44.830 --> 01:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
right y does the chair want me to do the
 
01:42:46.589 --> 01:42:46.599 align:start position:0%
drafting of the amendment or is the
 
01:42:49.229 --> 01:42:49.239 align:start position:0%
chair going to do OSS is going to ask is
 
01:42:51.589 --> 01:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
this an amendment or a report let's not
 
01:42:55.229 --> 01:42:55.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:57.550 --> 01:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
I can do it if you need assist
 
01:43:00.109 --> 01:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
additional assistance from me you know
 
01:43:01.709 --> 01:43:01.719 align:start position:0%
I'd be more than happy to help
 
01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely so this to the Senate amended
 
01:43:08.870 --> 01:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
version fixing the word mover and and
 
01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:10.149 align:start position:0%
version fixing the word mover and and
we're

01:43:10.149 --> 01:43:10.159 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:43:10.159 --> 01:43:13.550 align:start position:0%
we're
there

01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
to and that changes to
 
01:43:19.550 --> 01:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
voter I would I would say applicant
 
01:43:21.790 --> 01:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
applicant and if you look two lines
 
01:43:24.350 --> 01:43:24.360 align:start position:0%
above it says says presented by the
 
01:43:27.149 --> 01:43:27.159 align:start position:0%
applicant so to be
 
01:43:29.550 --> 01:43:29.560 align:start position:0%
consistent that mover should go to
 
01:43:45.629 --> 01:43:45.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:45.639 --> 01:43:47.830 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:43:51.629 --> 01:43:51.639 align:start position:0%
and this 20 minute thing is that new uh
 
01:43:54.550 --> 01:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
the 20 minute uh was
 
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
to in my discussions with the Secretary
 
01:44:00.589 --> 01:44:00.599 align:start position:0%
of State you know we needed to have some
 
01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
kind of a cut off I mean you know if a
 
01:44:04.990 --> 01:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
person you know was working on it and
 
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
working on it and working on it and
 
01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:08.750 align:start position:0%
working on it and working on it and
that's

01:44:08.750 --> 01:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
why because you have the affidavits
 
01:44:13.870 --> 01:44:13.880 align:start position:0%
right now that there is a cuto off you
 
01:44:15.390 --> 01:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
fill out the affidavit and then you go
 
01:44:17.870 --> 01:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
on about your business and that's why we
 
01:44:20.950 --> 01:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
put in you know uh pending judicial
 
01:44:23.589 --> 01:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
review or data verification and
 
01:44:25.950 --> 01:44:25.960 align:start position:0%
therefore put that time limit in there
 
01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
but then those people at the site uh may
 
01:44:32.310 --> 01:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
continue to work on that if they don't
 
01:44:34.629 --> 01:44:34.639 align:start position:0%
receive another call that requires their
 
01:44:37.030 --> 01:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
attention and may be able to resolve the
 
01:44:47.070 --> 01:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
Day yep
 
01:44:54.189 --> 01:44:54.199 align:start position:0%
okay all right anything else on this
 
01:44:55.709 --> 01:44:55.719 align:start position:0%
we will close then the committee
 
01:45:00.629 --> 01:45:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:03.229 --> 01:45:03.239 align:start position:0%
1370 and what now
 
01:45:03.239 --> 01:45:04.830 align:start position:0%
1370 and what now
1569

01:45:04.830 --> 01:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
1569
 
01:45:35.870 --> 01:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:40.510 --> 01:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
right now we're going to do 1596 because
 
01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:43.709 align:start position:0%
right now we're going to do 1596 because
it's

01:45:43.709 --> 01:45:43.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:43.719 --> 01:45:51.910 align:start position:0%
 
sched

01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:51.920 --> 01:46:21.910 align:start position:0%
 
pretty

01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:51.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:51.840 --> 01:47:21.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:51.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:45.070 --> 01:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
all righty let's get open the committee
 
01:48:49.750 --> 01:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
of conference on House Bill
 
01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:51.470 align:start position:0%
of conference on House Bill
1596

01:48:51.470 --> 01:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
1596
 
01:48:54.709 --> 01:48:54.719 align:start position:0%
FN uh I can s Senator G we we were fine
 
01:48:56.390 --> 01:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
the only issue that we had was there was
 
01:49:00.629 --> 01:49:00.639 align:start position:0%
a concern that an inadvertent regular
 
01:49:03.990 --> 01:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
person didn't have a protection in the
 
01:49:05.629 --> 01:49:05.639 align:start position:0%
language that that we have
 
01:49:05.639 --> 01:49:06.870 align:start position:0%
language that that we have
representative

01:49:06.870 --> 01:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:49:09.589 --> 01:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
Brennan has brought us language that she
 
01:49:12.149 --> 01:49:12.159 align:start position:0%
believes doesn't really change your bill
 
01:49:15.790 --> 01:49:15.800 align:start position:0%
except adds an exemption for somebody
 
01:49:20.470 --> 01:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
who sees a deep fake of I don't know
 
01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
that evil representative Smith
 
01:49:26.830 --> 01:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
being mean to puppies and goes oh my God
 
01:49:28.750 --> 01:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
this is terrible and they repost it we
 
01:49:31.270 --> 01:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
don't want them held liable because they
 
01:49:33.310 --> 01:49:33.320 align:start position:0%
didn't do research or run analysis to
 
01:49:35.629 --> 01:49:35.639 align:start position:0%
find out that I would never hurt a puppy
 
01:49:38.910 --> 01:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
in fact I love dogs more than people
 
01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:43.589 align:start position:0%
in fact I love dogs more than people
good

01:49:43.589 --> 01:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:47.109 --> 01:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
Reon I don't know if you can look at
 
01:49:48.950 --> 01:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
this and decide now or if you want to
 
01:50:04.950 --> 01:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:07.669 --> 01:50:07.679 align:start position:0%
Senor I can just ask one question uh
 
01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
lines four and five of the
 
01:50:14.229 --> 01:50:14.239 align:start position:0%
amendment it appears in on under Roman
 
01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
numeral 5A it just adds four content
 
01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
provided by another
 
01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
party what's the Reason by I guess
 
01:50:21.750 --> 01:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter if it was provided by
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
another party or was the rational by
 
01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:24.550 align:start position:0%
another party or was the rational by
adding

01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
adding
 
01:50:28.470 --> 01:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
that representative Brennan thank you um
 
01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
the addition of that makes it consistent
 
01:50:32.390 --> 01:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
with the other AI bill that has been
 
01:50:35.109 --> 01:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
passed by both bodies that's hb1 1432
 
01:50:36.790 --> 01:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
and so just to keep it consistent which
 
01:50:38.310 --> 01:50:38.320 align:start position:0%
was really important to both the house
 
01:50:40.510 --> 01:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
and the Senate that uh the language
 
01:50:42.910 --> 01:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
between AI bills be consistent that is
 
01:50:45.270 --> 01:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
the reason for this change thank you can
 
01:50:46.870 --> 01:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
you give an example of an interactive
 
01:50:50.189 --> 01:50:50.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:52.430 --> 01:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
provider there may be someone who is
 
01:50:54.270 --> 01:50:54.280 align:start position:0%
here here who would like to do that for
 
01:50:57.669 --> 01:50:57.679 align:start position:0%
us otherwise I would say there are
 
01:51:00.109 --> 01:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
experts who have advised us that this is
 
01:51:04.149 --> 01:51:04.159 align:start position:0%
the most appropriate language my bad
 
01:51:07.310 --> 01:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
um so for
 
01:51:10.270 --> 01:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
example if I'm having a zoom meeting and
 
01:51:14.830 --> 01:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
show a deep fake during the meeting Zoom
 
01:51:18.149 --> 01:51:18.159 align:start position:0%
itself is exempt I believe is the intent
 
01:51:18.159 --> 01:51:21.149 align:start position:0%
itself is exempt I believe is the intent
of

01:51:21.149 --> 01:51:21.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
this thank you
 
01:51:23.360 --> 01:51:30.830 align:start position:0%
this thank you
okay

01:51:30.830 --> 01:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:32.910 --> 01:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
further we
 
01:51:37.510 --> 01:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
set all right so the report will be the
 
01:51:42.189 --> 01:51:42.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:44.750 --> 01:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
amendment Mr chair do you need a formal
 
01:51:46.910 --> 01:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
introduction of this amendment or
 
01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
adoption of this amend mode or does it
 
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
just go with in the report
 
01:51:55.069 --> 01:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
does um there is no Amendment there's a
 
01:51:56.830 --> 01:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
report and this language will just being
 
01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the report thank you
 
01:51:59.950 --> 01:51:59.960 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:52:02.109 --> 01:52:02.119 align:start position:0%
clarification all
 
01:52:05.109 --> 01:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
good all right thanks for playing let's
 
01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
close House Bill 1596 and I believe that
 
01:52:11.310 --> 01:52:11.320 align:start position:0%
concludes our business except for
 
01:52:16.109 --> 01:52:16.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
