00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
without further Ado I'm going to uh open
 
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
on the amendment
 
00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to recognize
 
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 align:start position:0%
representative true to come and
 
00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
committee for the record I am Chris true
 
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
representing Rockingham District 9 the
 
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 align:start position:0%
town of Sandown thank you for allowing
 
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
me to introduce this amendment
 
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
this amendment before you does
 
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
principally two things
 
00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 align:start position:0%
first it allows New Hampshire citizens
 
00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 align:start position:0%
who scuba dive a small four-week minimum
 
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
period somewhere during the months of
 
00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 align:start position:0%
April through September to take no more
 
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
than three lobsters a day
 
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 align:start position:0%
for their personal consumption
 
00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 align:start position:0%
scuba divers currently are allowed to
 
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
dive for crabs and scallops in New
 
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with no reported safety or
 
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 align:start position:0%
enforcement issues in these same Waters
 
00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 align:start position:0%
the Amendment sets a cap of 100 licenses
 
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 align:start position:0%
and stipulates that lobsters must be
 
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 align:start position:0%
caught by hand measured on the ocean
 
00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 align:start position:0%
floor be of legal size and sex and most
 
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 align:start position:0%
importantly caught only in the
 
00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 align:start position:0%
designated areas
 
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
the second goal the amendment is to
 
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
close a loophole on our statutes that
 
00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
has hampered New Hampshire but not Maine
 
00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
from following many other Atlantic
 
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
states who are doing environmental
 
00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 align:start position:0%
cleanup of their Coastal Waters our
 
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
Coastal waters are littered with
 
00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
countless numbers of lost or disguided
 
00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 align:start position:0%
pieces of fishing gear
 
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
whether the fishing gear is called
 
00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
derelict abandoned or ghost it remains
 
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
to be just plain trash
 
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
my goal should be to clean up our
 
00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 align:start position:0%
Coastline of this underwater trash the
 
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
loophole currently prevents us from
 
00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 align:start position:0%
cleaning up the trash in an efficient
 
00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:22.969 align:start position:0%
cleaning up the trash in an efficient
manner

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 align:start position:0%
manner
 
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
the statue was put in place to prevent
 
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
commercial lobstermen from messing with
 
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 align:start position:0%
each other's traps it says essentially
 
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 align:start position:0%
no one can touch another's fishing gear
 
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
unless they have the owner's permission
 
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 align:start position:0%
or they are a New Hampshire conservation
 
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
officer that law prevents law-abiding
 
00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 align:start position:0%
scuba divers from touching the traps to
 
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
identify their owner or indoor to attach
 
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
surface lines so the garbage can be
 
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 align:start position:0%
lifted up to the surface and dispose of
 
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
an orderly fashion
 
00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 align:start position:0%
this amendment allows New Hampshire to
 
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
begin the arduous task of cleaning up
 
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
our Coastal Waters in the most efficient
 
00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 align:start position:0%
manner possible
 
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
efficient in two senses first in terms
 
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 align:start position:0%
of cost using volunteer divers is
 
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 align:start position:0%
tremendously cost effective but secondly
 
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment the efficiency is to use
 
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
scuba divers eyes on the situation to
 
00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 align:start position:0%
First locate and then report the
 
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
location with fish and game and then
 
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
assist with the actual cleanup
 
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
you will hear much more about the
 
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
process from Key Witnesses who runs a
 
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit company in Maine doing
 
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
just this
 
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
it is a much better system than dragging
 
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 align:start position:0%
a heavy damaged grappling hook and the
 
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 align:start position:0%
haphazard blind luck manner in the hopes
 
00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 align:start position:0%
of snagging and abandoning an abandoned
 
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
lobster trap
 
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 align:start position:0%
the fact that they catch some traps is
 
00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139 align:start position:0%
only Testament to the fact that ocean
 
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
water is not teeming with garbage
 
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
beneath the waves
 
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire divers I'm asking for this
 
00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:44.699 align:start position:0%
law good citizens and they have
 
00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 align:start position:0%
environmentalists they see that the
 
00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 align:start position:0%
garbage that needs cleaning up and are
 
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
seeking to be part of the solution they
 
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 align:start position:0%
witness firsthand the captive lobsters
 
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
and fish that remain in derelict lobster
 
00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 align:start position:0%
traps that need to be released into the
 
00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:58.129 align:start position:0%
traps that need to be released into the
wild

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 align:start position:0%
wild
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
they are asking permission to catch by
 
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 align:start position:0%
hand three lobsters for their own
 
00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
consumption and in doing so participate
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
in the sport that has allowed and
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
encouraged all Atlantic Coastal States
 
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 align:start position:0%
except in New Hampshire
 
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 align:start position:0%
in Maine
 
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
by the way of explanation for just how
 
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
ridiculous the arguments have in
 
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
opposition to the sport I offer four
 
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 align:start position:0%
facts one the government reports the
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
Atlantic states marine fisheries
 
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
Commission report
 
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
containing 500 pages was last completed
 
00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
in 2021
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
that report States the vast majority of
 
00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 align:start position:0%
Landings came from Gulf of Maine and
 
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.100 align:start position:0%
Georgia's Bank where the stock of
 
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 align:start position:0%

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 align:start position:0%

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 align:start position:0%

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 align:start position:0%
Lobster is also taken recreationally
 
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 align:start position:0%

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
likely to be a negligible source of
 
00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.689 align:start position:0%
likely to be a negligible source of
removals

00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 align:start position:0%
removals
 
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
three Massachusetts who has allowed
 
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
recreational scuba diving for as long as
 
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
anyone can remember allows divers to
 
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
dive year round and take up to 15
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
lobsters per day they keep very good
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
records They report the average scuba
 
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
diver license holder spends 13.2 hours
 
00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:17.819 align:start position:0%
of diving for lobster they average 0.9
 
00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:20.759 align:start position:0%
lobsters per hour less than one per hour
 
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts sold 1425 scuba permits
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
we are asking for 100.
 
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
they have provided us with a positive
 
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
report about enforcement and their
 
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
program is whole
 
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
as it is uh has every other state we
 
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
contacted about the state's diver
 
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
program no issues
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
we should have received written comments
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
from your chair
 
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
you should have received written
 
00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:45.419 align:start position:0%
comments for me a chair from both
 
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Rhode Island to that
 
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
effect lastly
 
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
just something to consider New Hampshire
 
00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
currently sells non-residents commercial
 
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
Lobster licenses for six hundred dollars
 
00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
so a commercial business originating in
 
00:07:59.809 --> 00:07:59.819 align:start position:0%
Maine can come to New Hampshire and pay
 
00:08:02.809 --> 00:08:02.819 align:start position:0%
600 for a license we'll pay his home
 
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
state 888 for a comparable license
 
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
if we look at the reverse situation if a
 
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Commercial Business wanted
 
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
a Min non-resident Lobster license it
 
00:08:14.749 --> 00:08:14.759 align:start position:0%
would cost twenty eight hundred and
 
00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:16.919 align:start position:0%
eighty dollars we think a New Hampshire
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
resident scuba diver is at least worthy
 
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:20.940 align:start position:0%
of being able to enjoy this natural
 
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:23.340 align:start position:0%
resource as a non-resident Commercial
 
00:08:25.969 --> 00:08:25.979 align:start position:0%
Business from Maine in Massachusetts
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
the mission of a fish and game
 
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:30.300 align:start position:0%
department says conserve manage protect
 
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
these resources in their habitats and
 
00:08:35.089 --> 00:08:35.099 align:start position:0%
provide public with opportunities to use
 
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
and appreciate these resources
 
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
from what the mission statements doesn't
 
00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:41.099 align:start position:0%
say is probably more to the point it
 
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
doesn't say provide out-of-state
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
businesses with the opportunity to
 
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
profit from our resources and leave
 
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
trash in the waters I will leave you
 
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
with this one thought if this bill
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
passes every scuba diver
 
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
uh was successful as the Massachusetts
 
00:08:58.910 --> 00:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
divers then New Hampshire divers
 
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't possibly equal 1 100th of the
 
00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:02.700 align:start position:0%
production of just one of the
 
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
non-residential commercial Lobster
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
license holders
 
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for the time I don't know how
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
much uh lobsters expect I think I don't
 
00:09:12.889 --> 00:09:12.899 align:start position:0%
know much about lobsters except they are
 
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
delicious and in some places they look
 
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
much different but I won't eat them
 
00:09:20.329 --> 00:09:20.339 align:start position:0%
my business partner Ian Hill and I I'm
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
speaking for Greg Hill I only eat uh
 
00:09:24.769 --> 00:09:24.779 align:start position:0%
Maine Lobsters after writing a
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
complicated computer programs that's all
 
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
I know about that so I am
 
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:32.220 align:start position:0%
reading for respectfully from
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative Greg Hill Merrimack too I
 
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
believe I've taken enough of your time I
 
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
won't take any questions in the interest
 
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
of time because if I took more time that
 
00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:56.180 align:start position:0%
a chair recognizes Jim tetone
 
00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
representing or from Seabrook New
 
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh he's asked for five minutes
 
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
my name is Jim tatone I'm from Seabrook
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm a commercial
 
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.190 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm a commercial
lobsterman

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
lobsterman
 
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
I'm representing today the Yankee
 
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
Fisherman's co-op in Seabrook and it's
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
60 plus members who are in opposition to
 
00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:32.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
the uh the lobster industry right now
 
00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
was facing many challenges we have uh
 
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
we have environmental challenges we have
 
00:10:44.329 --> 00:10:44.339 align:start position:0%
challenges where this potential
 
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
industrialization of a plenty of ocean
 
00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:50.060 align:start position:0%
bottom and we have the regulatory
 
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
challenges we have
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
currently there are over 13
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
000 regulations that govern commercial
 
00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.850 align:start position:0%
000 regulations that govern commercial
fishing

00:10:58.850 --> 00:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
fishing
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
that's opposed to the oil and gas
 
00:11:03.889 --> 00:11:03.899 align:start position:0%
exploration industry which only has 12
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
000 regulations to comply with and
 
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical manufacturing that has a
 
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
little more than 11 000 regulations
 
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
so commercial fishing is one of the most
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
regulated Industries in this country
 
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
but the majority of the uh regulations
 
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
pertaining to commercial fishing deals
 
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
with sustainability of the different
 
00:11:24.889 --> 00:11:24.899 align:start position:0%
species that we land that help feed
 
00:11:24.899 --> 00:11:26.030 align:start position:0%
species that we land that help feed
America

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
America
 
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
and in the Gulf of Maine
 
00:11:30.889 --> 00:11:30.899 align:start position:0%
we uh we're fortunate to have plenty of
 
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
scientists who um who do plenty of
 
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
research on how to sustain the lobster
 
00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.030 align:start position:0%
research on how to sustain the lobster
population

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
and the main contributor to the Lobster
 
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
sustainability is abated lobster trap
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's been proven through scientific
 
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
research that allops bated lobster trap
 
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
is the main source of food for lobsters
 
00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
now I've I've been searching for any
 
00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:58.140 align:start position:0%
kind of scientific research where it
 
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
indicates that the taking of lobsters by
 
00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:03.180 align:start position:0%
the diving activity
 
00:12:05.449 --> 00:12:05.459 align:start position:0%
contributes to the sustainability of the
 
00:12:09.769 --> 00:12:09.779 align:start position:0%
lobster resource and there's no no
 
00:12:11.569 --> 00:12:11.579 align:start position:0%
information out there at all no
 
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence that this is a
 
00:12:15.889 --> 00:12:15.899 align:start position:0%
contribution to the sustainability of
 
00:12:17.569 --> 00:12:17.579 align:start position:0%
this important resource
 
00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
now we've heard testimony in the past
 
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
here from proponents of this bill that
 
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
this lops the bill if it would pass
 
00:12:26.569 --> 00:12:26.579 align:start position:0%
would allow the taking of four to five
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
thousand lobsters that's four to five
 
00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:31.740 align:start position:0%
thousand lobsters that are taken in an
 
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
unsustainable manner
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
another one of the challenges we're
 
00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
facing right now and we'll get probably
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
heard a lot about them news is the
 
00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:44.519 align:start position:0%
decline since 2012 of the juvenile
 
00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:46.740 align:start position:0%
Lobster settlement to the bottom of the
 
00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.170 align:start position:0%
Lobster settlement to the bottom of the
ocean

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:48.180 align:start position:0%
ocean
 
00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
now I'm gonna in relation in relative to
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
the juvenile Lobster recruitment
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
scientific Studies have shown that
 
00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
shelter occupancy by post-lava lobsters
 
00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
in near shore Rocky environments is
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
critically important to the
 
00:13:07.129 --> 00:13:07.139 align:start position:0%
sustainability of the juvenile Lobster
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
stock to reduce the risk of predation
 
00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
from uh the other species now the New
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire coastal areas proposed by this
 
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:18.650 align:start position:0%
Hampshire coastal areas proposed by this
bill

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:18.660 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
for the taking of lobsters by diving are
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
the same near shore Rocky bottom that
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
where a majority of the juvenile Ops to
 
00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:29.930 align:start position:0%
where a majority of the juvenile Ops to
settle

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
settle
 
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
in the search for Lobsters by divers
 
00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
there's trouble turning rocks and large
 
00:13:38.449 --> 00:13:38.459 align:start position:0%
or small Boulders exposing these
 
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:41.700 align:start position:0%
juveniles to predation
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
so we have a situation here we have a
 
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
activity that doesn't contribute to the
 
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
sustainability of a valuable resource is
 
00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
a deterrent to the sustainability of the
 
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
resource as it exposes our juvenile
 
00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
Lobster population to increase risk of
 
00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.910 align:start position:0%
Lobster population to increase risk of
predation

00:13:58.910 --> 00:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
predation
 
00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.590 align:start position:0%
predation
now

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
the regulatory requirements that are
 
00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
imposed upon the law of the fishermen we
 
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
have all the requirements on our
 
00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.670 align:start position:0%
have all the requirements on our
shoulders

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
shoulders
 
00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
to be to assure the sustainability of
 
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:16.220 align:start position:0%
this valuable resource and there's no
 
00:14:18.889 --> 00:14:18.899 align:start position:0%
responsibility whatsoever for the taking
 
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
a dialopsis by diving to have contribute
 
00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
to the sustainability of this of this
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
thing so we have a non-contribution to
 
00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
the sustainability of the lobster we
 
00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:32.339 align:start position:0%
have a deterrent to the contribution to
 
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
the sustainability of Lobster by
 
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
exposing juveniles to predation and we
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
have a house bill here that contains
 
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:43.740 align:start position:0%
even more regulations for the lobster
 
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
fishing industry that are totally
 
00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.629 align:start position:0%
fishing industry that are totally
unenforceable

00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
unenforceable
 
00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
now the mission of the fish and game
 
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
department is to protect and preserve
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
all our natural resources especially the
 
00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
lobster resource this house bill does
 
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:00.180 align:start position:0%
neither of those
 
00:15:02.449 --> 00:15:02.459 align:start position:0%
everybody every resident of this state
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
has the opportunity to exploit the
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
lobster resource and that's through a
 
00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:10.019 align:start position:0%
sustainable manner of the Trap fishery
 
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
and if you're gonna sit if you if you
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
want to be able to exploit the resource
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
do it in a sustainable Manner and that
 
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
is the Trap Fishery so that's my
 
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:21.180 align:start position:0%
testimony for today I'll be more than
 
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
happy to answer anybody's questions
 
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
thank you sir are there any questions
 
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
you recognized representative
 
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:40.860 align:start position:0%
tell us uh there's a big argument that
 
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:43.980 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Maine does this you
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
know the whatever the bill is asking for
 
00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:48.839 align:start position:0%
tell me that how big is the main cost
 
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
and how big is the Massachusetts coast
 
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
and what we have here in New Hampshire
 
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:56.220 align:start position:0%
well in in Maine there's a Prohibition
 
00:15:57.889 --> 00:15:57.899 align:start position:0%
he gets diving for lobsters
 
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has been a there's been a
 
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
law in effect for that allows the uh
 
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
diving for offices but you're talking
 
00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.189 align:start position:0%
diving for offices but you're talking
States

00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
States
 
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
for basically Cape Ann Cape Ann has more
 
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
coastline than the state of New
 
00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:15.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that's just that one small
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
portion of the state of Massachusetts so
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has extensive Coastline
 
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
that can that's um that can be allowed
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
for the technical offices we just don't
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
have it and like I said the bottom that
 
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
would be open to the diving for Law
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
Offices is the same bottom where the
 
00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
juvenile offices settle and that bottom
 
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
gets Disturbed and we're going to have
 
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
our juvenile stock subject to uh
 
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
additional predation and we all know
 
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
that the decline the decline in the
 
00:16:47.689 --> 00:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
settlement of the law juvenile office
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
has been a serious problem
 
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chairman follow-up
 
00:16:58.009 --> 00:16:58.019 align:start position:0%
did you hear that the 17 or 18 Mile
 
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
Coastline we have in New Hampshire we
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
are very proud of our what we have and
 
00:17:08.449 --> 00:17:08.459 align:start position:0%
that is our Crown Jewel
 
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
basically it is yeah we have such a
 
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
short Coastline we need to do all we can
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
to protect the resources that we derive
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
from the small bit of Coastline that we
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
do have
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:22.689 --> 00:17:22.699 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
representative Tudor
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
could you tell me do you fish the same
 
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
area that is being proposed for the
 
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
scuba diver I do there are certain times
 
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
of the year where I am fishing in that
 
00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
uh near Shore Water sometimes in seven
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
to ten feet of water follow up Mr chair
 
00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:42.419 align:start position:0%
follow up and can you tell me what the
 
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
difference would be from dragging a trap
 
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
across the bottom from a to a dive of
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
turning over rocks on the bottom well
 
00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
generally what you're doing is you're
 
00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
you're moving you both forward so you're
 
00:17:54.409 --> 00:17:54.419 align:start position:0%
not dragging your traps across the
 
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
bottom because if you do happen to be in
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
a circumstance of dragging the traps you
 
00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
could get the Trap hung up on a large
 
00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
Rock and the Rope could possibly snap so
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
what you do is when you're in the
 
00:18:09.049 --> 00:18:09.059 align:start position:0%
shallow bottom you keep moving your boat
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
forward so you have a direct access from
 
00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
where the Trap is right up to the boat
 
00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:16.740 align:start position:0%
so you prevent the dragging because you
 
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
don't want to get those traps hung up in
 
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
any rocks because you there's a
 
00:18:24.049 --> 00:18:24.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:26.049 --> 00:18:26.059 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question just following up on
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
the other representative's question
 
00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:34.860 align:start position:0%
regarding the traps bouncing across the
 
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
ocean floor what is the weight of a
 
00:18:39.529 --> 00:18:39.539 align:start position:0%
lobster trap well it depends what size
 
00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
of the Trap if you have a three foot
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
trap it's probably
 
00:18:45.289 --> 00:18:45.299 align:start position:0%
um 40 pounds and a four foot trap would
 
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
probably be maybe 50 50 pounds
 
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:52.860 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up so you're saying
 
00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
your intention is to not drag a trap
 
00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
across the ocean floor which I
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
understand but obviously you can't see
 
00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
Into the Depths if that trap is being
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
dragged across the ocean floor well if
 
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
if you're in if you're fishing in near
 
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
shore sections and you're in seven to
 
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
ten feet of water yeah you can tell just
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
by where your lines are going where that
 
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
trap is and you basically follow that
 
00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:16.919 align:start position:0%
line with your boat to make sure that
 
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
you don't get that trap snagged up in
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
any potential rocks that are on the
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
bottom there one more follow-up one more
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
isn't it also true that traps get left
 
00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:28.860 align:start position:0%
in the ocean for a period of time and
 
00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
When Storms come in they get bounced
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
around by the weather the currents
 
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
disturbing the ocean floor much more
 
00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
than a diver my the entire ocean floor
 
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
especially near shore gets Disturbed
 
00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:41.700 align:start position:0%
when you have large storms it's not only
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
from the traps but the wave action
 
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
that's actually if you've drove down or
 
00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
uh along the coast you can see how many
 
00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
rocks this past year have been thrown up
 
00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
from the ocean during some of those
 
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
large storms we've had so it's just not
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
the traps alone that would be disturbing
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
the bottom Mother Nature itself is going
 
00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
to cause more damage than any of these
 
00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
traps thank you
 
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520 align:start position:0%

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
thank you very much your time any
 
00:22:48.409 --> 00:22:48.419 align:start position:0%
questions I'd be glad to answer them
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
00:22:57.409 --> 00:22:57.419 align:start position:0%
today one additional thing fellow spoke
 
00:22:58.850 --> 00:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
about dragging the traps across the
 
00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
motion across the bottom of the ocean
 
00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
that's absurd when you hold the Lobster
 
00:23:06.289 --> 00:23:06.299 align:start position:0%
Pot draw a string whatever you want to
 
00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
call it you want the boat has to stay up
 
00:23:10.669 --> 00:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
on the line vertically we're lifting
 
00:23:12.289 --> 00:23:12.299 align:start position:0%
these traps vertically up we're not
 
00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:14.220 align:start position:0%
dragging them across the ocean we lift
 
00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
them off the bottom of the ocean thank
 
00:23:18.529 --> 00:23:18.539 align:start position:0%
you sir you drag your traps around
 
00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:20.220 align:start position:0%
that's one of the other problems these
 
00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
things are very very expensive now it
 
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
damages your traps to drag them across
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
the ocean that's a false one
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:33.649 --> 00:23:33.659 align:start position:0%
the chair will now call
 
00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:36.440 align:start position:0%
Ward bird
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh representing industry
 
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
from East Brentwood and uh opposes the
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh letting me have some
 
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning and uh
 
00:23:59.330 --> 00:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of uh
 
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
misinformation I I heard the gentleman
 
00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:03.590 align:start position:0%
misinformation I I heard the gentleman
that

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:06.289 --> 00:24:06.299 align:start position:0%
read out the bill New Hampshire does not
 
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
allow non-residents to Lobster fish in
 
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
I believe he said they did that's just
 
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
not true
 
00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.250 align:start position:0%
not true
um

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:15.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
as Mr Flanagan said we lift traps off
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
the bottom we don't
 
00:24:22.799 --> 00:24:24.049 align:start position:0%
the bottom we don't
hmm

00:24:24.049 --> 00:24:24.059 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:25.799 align:start position:0%
we don't drag them
 
00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
our traps are approximately 150 a piece
 
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
if you drag a trap across the bottom it
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
peels the vinyl off the Trap exposes the
 
00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
wire and our traps brought out period so
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's in our best interest to lift them
 
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
not drag him
 
00:24:45.529 --> 00:24:45.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
talk about this bill as a whole we had
 
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
then we had an amendment and now we have
 
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
another amendment
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
I I it really makes me wonder what's
 
00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
going on here we've turned in from
 
00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
diving from lopses
 
00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
to set and Regulatory measures against
 
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
our industry
 
00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:05.870 align:start position:0%
our industry
uh

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know if this
 
00:25:12.049 --> 00:25:12.059 align:start position:0%
group knows what we are going through
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
with windmills in our future
 
00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:18.780 align:start position:0%
what it what happens to us in 10 years
 
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:20.460 align:start position:0%
when they want to put windmills off our
 
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:23.220 align:start position:0%
Coast what happens to my living what
 
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:25.740 align:start position:0%
happens to all these fishermen's living
 
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:27.900 align:start position:0%
what happens that
 
00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:29.220 align:start position:0%
yet you want to create another
 
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
regulatory measure right whales we've
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
been regulated to death on that we've
 
00:25:36.409 --> 00:25:36.419 align:start position:0%
met every requirement
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
by the NOAA in National marine fisheries
 
00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:41.220 align:start position:0%
to make our
 
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
we need your help we don't need this
 
00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
hindrance of uh it's like a this bill is
 
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
like a a little dog chewing at our ankle
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
compared to the global giants that are
 
00:26:00.289 --> 00:26:00.299 align:start position:0%
attacking us on a daily basis
 
00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:01.860 align:start position:0%
I don't know if anybody in this room
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
seen what's happening down south of us
 
00:26:06.289 --> 00:26:06.299 align:start position:0%
right now in New Jersey with seismic
 
00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:08.700 align:start position:0%
testing for windmills is killing whales
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
hand over fist to the degree of 34
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
something whales
 
00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:16.860 align:start position:0%
we need your help we don't need more
 
00:26:21.049 --> 00:26:21.059 align:start position:0%
regulations more red tape more
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
taking from what we've already regulated
 
00:26:26.409 --> 00:26:26.419 align:start position:0%
fish and game has done a fine job
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
setting regulations in this state
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
and another layer of an area where
 
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to close off bottom so
 
00:26:36.529 --> 00:26:36.539 align:start position:0%
individuals can take three lobsters it's
 
00:26:36.539 --> 00:26:37.430 align:start position:0%
individuals can take three lobsters it's
just

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:40.740 align:start position:0%
it's just gone too far I'm I I've had it
 
00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:42.779 align:start position:0%
I got to tell you right now it's like
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
every direction we're coming from if
 
00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
you're a fisherman you're under the gun
 
00:26:48.409 --> 00:26:48.419 align:start position:0%
and we're just trying to make an honest
 
00:26:48.419 --> 00:26:49.430 align:start position:0%
and we're just trying to make an honest
living

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
living
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
the time that's been spent by
 
00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:53.940 align:start position:0%
individuals in this room a Damon
 
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
Frampton a Bobby nud
 
00:26:59.230 --> 00:26:59.240 align:start position:0%
and Eric Anderson have spent countless
 
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
thousands of hours
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
working on making us a better industry
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
we need your help we don't need any more
 
00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
we can't take anymore our fuel prices
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
are through the roof uh bait prices are
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
through the roof and uh Fuel and our
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
expenses have just they've tripled
 
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
and yet uh Lobster prices have dwindled
 
00:27:27.049 --> 00:27:27.059 align:start position:0%
last year as a whole
 
00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
this Lobster industry in New Hampshire I
 
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
can safely say made half of what we made
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
the year before half of our income yet
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
our expenses tripled
 
00:27:39.649 --> 00:27:39.659 align:start position:0%
I think this bill is a bogus bill I
 
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
think it needs to be thrown out
 
00:27:45.409 --> 00:27:45.419 align:start position:0%
and let us do uh thing fishing thank you
 
00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:52.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
chair now calls David Coyle
 
00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.610 align:start position:0%
chair now calls David Coyle
um

00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:58.620 align:start position:0%

where it's checked off saying that
 
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
is there no written testimony I'll just
 
00:28:12.049 --> 00:28:12.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:13.740 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
a large part of why I've gotten involved
 
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
in this is somebody came up to me and
 
00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:47.700 align:start position:0%
said if you don't like the way the law
 
00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
is do something to change it so that's
 
00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
kind of why I'm here
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
um the um
 
00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
everything has gotten more difficult
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
um in in our the way we're living so I
 
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
do sympathize for the lobstermen we are
 
00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:07.799 align:start position:0%
not trying to damage their industry we
 
00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:10.140 align:start position:0%
are only looking to be able to help any
 
00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:12.140 align:start position:0%
way that we can
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
I have come to this meeting and I've
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
talked about how when I go scuba diving
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
and I've seen things in lobster traps
 
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
and I am the people the person that is
 
00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:24.539 align:start position:0%
talking and training people how to scuba
 
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
dive and telling them that we are not
 
00:29:30.049 --> 00:29:30.059 align:start position:0%
able to be able to help to be able to
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
move their lobster traps I went um a
 
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
couple weekends ago we went out and we
 
00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
went diving just to see how many lobster
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
traps they were abandoned that we could
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
find and we found a bunch and we've um
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
I've taken pictures of them so that you
 
00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
could see them
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
um and so what we'd like to do is is to
 
00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
be able to help our oceans how to be
 
00:29:51.529 --> 00:29:51.539 align:start position:0%
able to remove them you're going to hear
 
00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
testimony today of an organization
 
00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
that's been in Maine that's working very
 
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:56.930 align:start position:0%
that's been in Maine that's working very
well

00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:56.940 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
um and I'd like to be able to see if I
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
can help out work with the loftsman work
 
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
with the the fishing game
 
00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
um to be able to have a better community
 
00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
and help support the sustaining of the
 
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
lobsters and also be able to be able to
 
00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:14.700 align:start position:0%
take a small amount of lobsters as if I
 
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
was a um doing a five Pot
 
00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
Limit that I can do now as a resident
 
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
I would have very little to be able to
 
00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
see what's under the water to see what
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
is going down when I am going scuba
 
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
diving I can see the lobsters I don't
 
00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
have to even touch them to see if
 
00:30:36.289 --> 00:30:36.299 align:start position:0%
they're too small a lot of times they
 
00:30:39.049 --> 00:30:39.059 align:start position:0%
are in holes and they're hiding during
 
00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
the day because they come out during the
 
00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
night that's why the traps do do very
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
well because they're they're nocturnal
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
they come out at night and they are able
 
00:30:51.529 --> 00:30:51.539 align:start position:0%
to do a go into the traps and I'm
 
00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
feeding that way when we're going during
 
00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
the day we're just looking for the ones
 
00:30:58.850 --> 00:30:58.860 align:start position:0%
that are not hiding we're not disturbing
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
the bottom we're stewards of the ocean
 
00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
and that's a large part that I take very
 
00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
serious that we want to be able to
 
00:31:09.529 --> 00:31:09.539 align:start position:0%
educate and help our community as well
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions
 
00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:18.049 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions
yes

00:31:18.049 --> 00:31:18.059 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:31:21.289 --> 00:31:21.299 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair one quick question
 
00:31:24.889 --> 00:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
do the majority of divers carry some
 
00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
sort of GPS with them when they're
 
00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
diving they don't have a GPS GPS doesn't
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
work underwater
 
00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:35.870 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:31:40.669 --> 00:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
so my question goes to the amendment we
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
you shall report the location of a pot
 
00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:53.820 align:start position:0%
trap or car that you locate yeah how
 
00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
will you go about putting a location if
 
00:31:58.909 --> 00:31:58.919 align:start position:0%
you don't use GPS so what what I'd like
 
00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:01.980 align:start position:0%
to be able to do is we have a um a water
 
00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
bottle that would be empty
 
00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
um I could carry it with me and have a
 
00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
rope that would be attached that I could
 
00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
if I see lobster traps that are
 
00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:13.740 align:start position:0%
abandoned I could if we painted it
 
00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
orange we could deploy that by adding
 
00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
air to it to be able to send it to the
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
surface then the lobster men would be
 
00:32:21.289 --> 00:32:21.299 align:start position:0%
able to retrieve it that way or you
 
00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:23.220 align:start position:0%
could come to the surface and then you
 
00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559 align:start position:0%
could use your phone to create a um a
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
GPS system on the surface but not
 
00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.130 align:start position:0%
GPS system on the surface but not
underwater

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:31.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:38.220 align:start position:0%
representative Brown
 
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair thanks for taking
 
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:46.980 align:start position:0%
are all divers capable of doing what you
 
00:32:50.269 --> 00:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
said that you do which is not disturbing
 
00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
the lobster population
 
00:32:54.889 --> 00:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
while taking them I I believe at the
 
00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
last hearing we heard some from fish and
 
00:32:58.970 --> 00:32:58.980 align:start position:0%
game that there was the potential for
 
00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:02.460 align:start position:0%
loss of claw and um disturbing juveniles
 
00:33:03.889 --> 00:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
so that they wouldn't
 
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:07.140 align:start position:0%
uh they wouldn't uh continue to survive
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's kind of what I wanted to
 
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
get involved in this is to be able to
 
00:33:12.649 --> 00:33:12.659 align:start position:0%
educate if there's people out and
 
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:13.980 align:start position:0%
they're taking lobsters now they're
 
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
doing it illegal I think that was
 
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
something that was done more in the past
 
00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
I don't know of anybody that's going out
 
00:33:22.009 --> 00:33:22.019 align:start position:0%
for lobsters
 
00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
um as of now because they know it's
 
00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:24.950 align:start position:0%
um as of now because they know it's
illegal

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
00:33:27.409 --> 00:33:27.419 align:start position:0%
um if they were to be able to do it I
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
would like to work with fish and game
 
00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
and come up with a program
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
um a grandma and myself are actually
 
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
talking about just doing one anyway to
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
be able to create a a lobster awareness
 
00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
um the an ecology program to be able to
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
help people understand more about
 
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
lobsters and their habitat
 
00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
00:33:59.870 --> 00:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:03.049 --> 00:34:03.059 align:start position:0%
chair will now call Buzz Scott from
 
00:34:04.509 --> 00:34:04.519 align:start position:0%
Newcastle Maine
 
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't say whether you support
 
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
or oppose the bill we'll check that off
 
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
for you if you'll let me know okay
 
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:15.300 align:start position:0%
um I think I uh might speak for both
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
sides so oh I don't know if I uh we'll
 
00:34:20.089 --> 00:34:20.099 align:start position:0%
leave it blank then should even put
 
00:34:22.369 --> 00:34:22.379 align:start position:0%
something in there uh my name is Buzz
 
00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
Scott I'm from Newcastle Maine I uh I'm
 
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
the founder of Ocean's wide which is a
 
00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
an educational program uh designed after
 
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
I worked as a commercial fisherman for
 
00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:35.780 align:start position:0%
17 years on the coast of Maine
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
I also when I was working as a
 
00:34:40.849 --> 00:34:40.859 align:start position:0%
commercial fisherman I was told to leave
 
00:34:42.649 --> 00:34:42.659 align:start position:0%
the island get out and see the rest of
 
00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:44.460 align:start position:0%
the world so that I could come back and
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
make the state of Maine a better place I
 
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
didn't know how I was going to do that
 
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
but after you know a number of years I'm
 
00:34:55.609 --> 00:34:55.619 align:start position:0%
62 now I realized that I could come back
 
00:34:58.970 --> 00:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
and help by educating young people like
 
00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
I was when I was a fisherman
 
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
I wanted to help them explore the ocean
 
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
I was a Navy Seabee I was working for
 
00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
the U.S Antarctic program on board their
 
00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:13.140 align:start position:0%
research vessels and later in life for
 
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
the last 25 years I've been flying
 
00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:17.060 align:start position:0%
remotely operated unmanned submarines
 
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
rovs for research in waters around the
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
world and as I was doing that I was
 
00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
seeing a lot of things on the bottom of
 
00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:29.700 align:start position:0%
the ocean and I thought my gosh we got a
 
00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
we got a problem here and and I continue
 
00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
to do the ROV work I still do on
 
00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:39.540 align:start position:0%
occasion but I wanted to come back and
 
00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
teach the kids about ocean exploration
 
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
and adventure and and basically learning
 
00:35:47.569 --> 00:35:47.579 align:start position:0%
more about what they can do to protect
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
the ocean environment I came back we
 
00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
started teaching kids how to scuba dive
 
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
we taught in how to drive rovs and run
 
00:35:59.870 --> 00:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
boats and as we were down there these
 
00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:01.940 align:start position:0%
students were seeing
 
00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of traps on the bottom littering
 
00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
the bottom and these were we were going
 
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
out during the time when the fishermen
 
00:36:12.589 --> 00:36:12.599 align:start position:0%
either had their gear offshore or up and
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
so the traps that we were seeing were
 
00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.710 align:start position:0%
so the traps that we were seeing were
all

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
um either derelict or abandoned or ghost
 
00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
gear whatever you want to call them and
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh our students students from Maine
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
students from New York students from
 
00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
South Carolina all said we've got to do
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
something about this so I asked one of
 
00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:36.839 align:start position:0%
our students two of our students who
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
were fishermen to go out and talk to
 
00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:41.700 align:start position:0%
their community and ask if you know is
 
00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:44.420 align:start position:0%
can we can we collect any of your traps
 
00:36:47.089 --> 00:36:47.099 align:start position:0%
and they went out in two days they came
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
back with a thousand traps these are
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
Shore based traps and the reason we did
 
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
shorebase first is because I wanted to
 
00:36:55.849 --> 00:36:55.859 align:start position:0%
make sure that we were supporting the
 
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
fishing community and I wanted to see if
 
00:36:59.930 --> 00:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
they had traps that they wanted to get
 
00:37:01.849 --> 00:37:01.859 align:start position:0%
rid of but were unable to
 
00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
they found a thousand traps in two days
 
00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:05.099 align:start position:0%
and said that they could have ten
 
00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
thousand traps in a month and I said wow
 
00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
so we started a land-based program where
 
00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
we took traps from the fishermen they
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
brought them to us and we broke them
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
apart and crushed them and recycled them
 
00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
and uh and then the word got out that we
 
00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
were doing this and a Gentleman came to
 
00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:26.700 align:start position:0%
us from Boothbay Harbor and said would
 
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
you like to go underwater and see what's
 
00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
down there and I said well absolutely we
 
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:34.380 align:start position:0%
had the support of the fishermen to do
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
that we we talked to them quite often
 
00:37:42.109 --> 00:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
and we started out by doing surveys so
 
00:37:43.609 --> 00:37:43.619 align:start position:0%
we surveyed the bottom to see how many
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
traps we could find in 18 days we found
 
00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:49.140 align:start position:0%
850 in just Boothbay Harbor in a one
 
00:37:50.589 --> 00:37:50.599 align:start position:0%
mile radius
 
00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:53.220 align:start position:0%
we started taking those traps up and
 
00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
since then we've taken up 2700 traps
 
00:37:59.210 --> 00:37:59.220 align:start position:0%
roughly 2 700 traps from the Boothbay
 
00:38:01.849 --> 00:38:01.859 align:start position:0%
Harbor area and we've disposed of those
 
00:38:04.609 --> 00:38:04.619 align:start position:0%
there are probably 10 times that on the
 
00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
bottom in that one Harbor and one one
 
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
local location
 
00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:10.670 align:start position:0%
local location
um

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:14.089 --> 00:38:14.099 align:start position:0%
we're working to do that again in other
 
00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:16.740 align:start position:0%
locations matinicus Island where I grew
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
up Stonington Maine
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
Boothbay has about 120 fishermen
 
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
Stonington has 450. jonesport has
 
00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:29.220 align:start position:0%
another 350 and so you can imagine the
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
amount of traps that are on the bottom
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
in the in the Gulf of Maine and we're
 
00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
trying to do our best to take them up
 
00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
numbers that can help 20 percent of the
 
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
traps that we take out
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
are still fishable some of them are like
 
00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:44.829 align:start position:0%
are still fishable some of them are like
new

00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:38:47.329 --> 00:38:47.339 align:start position:0%
about two-thirds of the traps that we
 
00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:49.640 align:start position:0%
take up have animals in them
 
00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
we we do
 
00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:52.609 align:start position:0%
we we do
um

00:38:52.609 --> 00:38:52.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:55.609 --> 00:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
we do release the animals and set them
 
00:38:58.130 --> 00:38:58.140 align:start position:0%
free but you've got everything and I've
 
00:38:59.630 --> 00:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
got a list of the animals that we've
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
taken out of these traps and and
 
00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
the traps are coated in plastic
 
00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
everybody knows that this is a problem
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
Plastics in the ocean are killing
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
animals and so the more traps we get out
 
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
of the water the more we can support the
 
00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
fishing community and support the
 
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
thank you sir thank you I assume you're
 
00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
willing to take questions if we have any
 
00:39:27.609 --> 00:39:27.619 align:start position:0%
absolutely do we have any questions
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
taking my question you said two-thirds
 
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
of the traps have animals in them that's
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
correct can you just give a quick brief
 
00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
summary of the type of animals and if
 
00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
they're alive or mostly dead
 
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
yes uh so we have we've caught lobster
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
crab Cod we've got one Cod uh flat fish
 
00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
we get a number of them Connor are very
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
um often found in these straps uh sculp
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
and sea Robbins
 
00:39:58.730 --> 00:39:58.740 align:start position:0%
urchins Rock tunnels sea cucumbers
 
00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
mussels of course are growing on the
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
traps themselves and we have sea stars
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
and uh sand dollars and the kinds of
 
00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
any any further yes Vice chair
 
00:40:17.329 --> 00:40:17.339 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:40:20.089 --> 00:40:20.099 align:start position:0%
I guess I want to follow up on that and
 
00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
because you said two-thirds have animals
 
00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
but we're hearing
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
that list goes on and on how many
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
actually have lobsters in them when
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
you're bringing them up uh I'm gonna say
 
00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
half those traps the third of the traps
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
that we pick out some of them have four
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
of them four or five of them you know
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
I've hauled out four really nice select
 
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
lobsters out of a trap
 
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
um and uh and that's not that's a very
 
00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:45.710 align:start position:0%
um and uh and that's not that's a very
common

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
common
 
00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:49.490 align:start position:0%
common
uh

00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
rep Ford
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:57.530 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
um

00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
two questions
 
00:41:02.089 --> 00:41:02.099 align:start position:0%
um you said 2700 out of Boothbay
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
um do you have what's the time frame for
 
00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
that how how many days uh how many days
 
00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:08.460 align:start position:0%
I can't really give you that but we've
 
00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
been doing it since uh 2020. okay uh we
 
00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:13.740 align:start position:0%
work in the spring before the fishermen
 
00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:15.660 align:start position:0%
put their gear in and then again in the
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
fall after they've gone offshore that's
 
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
um and then can I follow up Sir
 
00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you chairman
 
00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:22.970 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you chairman
um

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:22.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
I'm learning a lot
 
00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
about traps and lobsters and all such
 
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
and I learned that waves and storms can
 
00:41:33.609 --> 00:41:33.619 align:start position:0%
wash traps around
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
from your expertise where are these all
 
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
main lobster traps are they all from
 
00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
Boothbay like where are they from
 
00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
imagining we have a very small Shoreline
 
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
and traps are getting washed to and from
 
00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:49.980 align:start position:0%
across our shorelines all the time so
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering where you found these
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
traps to be from or they're typically
 
00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
local traps within you know they they
 
00:41:59.770 --> 00:41:59.780 align:start position:0%
move around a couple hundred yards maybe
 
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
in the storms especially and then they
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
wash up on the shore we wash up over
 
00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
Ledges we found one area with uh is
 
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
about the size of a football field and
 
00:42:14.329 --> 00:42:14.339 align:start position:0%
there were 300 traps taken out and
 
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
probably that amount left there to be
 
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
 
00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.190 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
and then hold on representative page
 
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
first then pair
 
00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
so we've heard a testimony about
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
more modern traps having biodegradable
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
material to allow
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
uh new creatures to Escape right
 
00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:45.900 align:start position:0%
with the derelict gear that you found in
 
00:42:49.089 --> 00:42:49.099 align:start position:0%
Boothbay that has all of these different
 
00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:51.900 align:start position:0%
creatures in it
 
00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
are those older traps or are those
 
00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
current traps that should be allowing
 
00:42:59.450 --> 00:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
those those creatures to escape I just
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:08.089 --> 00:43:08.099 align:start position:0%
on top of the um the rocky bottom
 
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
and the Escape vents do just what
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
they're designed to do they break away
 
00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:14.900 align:start position:0%
the mild steel hog rings
 
00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:17.700 align:start position:0%
dissolve and they break away the animals
 
00:43:19.609 --> 00:43:19.619 align:start position:0%
are allowed to get out of those traps
 
00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
there are also Sandy Bottom and Muddy
 
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
Bottom where the traps sink into the
 
00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
sediment and I've got some pictures of
 
00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:27.980 align:start position:0%
that if you'd like to see those
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
and sometimes they'll trap that escape
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
vent so even if it does even if they do
 
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
rot away they stay in in place and it
 
00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
doesn't open up for the fish to get out
 
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
of the animals to get out
 
00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:47.780 align:start position:0%
the age of the traps they range from
 
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:53.700 align:start position:0%

00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you Mr chair I don't know
 
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
if you're the right person to ask but
 
00:43:59.690 --> 00:43:59.700 align:start position:0%
I'll ask anyway are these things that
 
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
you found in the excuse me this the
 
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
derelict traps typical of I of creatures
 
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
that also end up in excuse me active
 
00:44:10.609 --> 00:44:10.619 align:start position:0%
active traps that are being fished on a
 
00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:11.940 align:start position:0%
regular basis
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
I'd like the fishermen to talk to that
 
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
but uh I would guess so
 
00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:22.609 --> 00:44:22.619 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions
 
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
representative Brown
 
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
so I want to see if you can thank you Mr
 
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
chair sorry and thanks for taking my
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
question see if you can clarify for me
 
00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
because I think
 
00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
to make sure that I didn't misunderstand
 
00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:38.819 align:start position:0%
there is plastic on lobster traps that's
 
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
correct that could come off
 
00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
and then in the next sentence you said
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of problems with Plastics
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
in the oceans and do you have a
 
00:44:50.809 --> 00:44:50.819 align:start position:0%
correlation or is is there to make sure
 
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
that we're not placing blame where it
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be
 
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
do you have an exact correlation of that
 
00:44:59.210 --> 00:44:59.220 align:start position:0%
or is that just a a statement that
 
00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
that's a statement there's plastic and
 
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
that is a plastic problem and yeah so
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
PVC they're coated in PVC
 
00:45:08.089 --> 00:45:08.099 align:start position:0%
um and that is negatively buoyant so it
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
sinks to the bottom and uh I have some
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
scientific papers here that I can share
 
00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
with you as well
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
um and I will get the answer here in a
 
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
second but uh any PVC any Plastics in
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
the ocean is bad and the more we take
 
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
out the better off our resources are
 
00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
going to be the healthier our oceans are
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
going to be direct correlation no I
 
00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
don't have that and I can't tell you
 
00:45:32.809 --> 00:45:32.819 align:start position:0%
that because we don't know how much
 
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
plastic is in the ocean actually
 
00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
I just want to address this situation
 
00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
sir uh we don't take questions unless
 
00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:47.220 align:start position:0%
you're actually recognized to speak so I
 
00:45:50.589 --> 00:45:50.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
well we can get to that but not at this
 
00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:56.220 align:start position:0%
point when somebody's speaking so I just
 
00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:57.230 align:start position:0%
point when somebody's speaking so I just
wanna

00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
wanna
 
00:45:59.690 --> 00:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
that's thank you very much I'd like to
 
00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
take that question because I can answer
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
that then it should have been mentioned
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
if you would like him to join you at the
 
00:46:07.069 --> 00:46:07.079 align:start position:0%
table he can ask his question or make
 
00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
his comment and then you can you can
 
00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
answer to it
 
00:46:12.589 --> 00:46:12.599 align:start position:0%
um so if you'd like to step forward so
 
00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
you're at the microphone sir you can go
 
00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
ahead and and um
 
00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
it's probably valuable to the committee
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
I think with this fellow spoke about it
 
00:46:25.609 --> 00:46:25.619 align:start position:0%
very true
 
00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:27.180 align:start position:0%
I don't want to
 
00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
belittle the enforcement in the state of
 
00:46:31.309 --> 00:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
Maine these are this Escape vent from a
 
00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
trap this is what he speaks about if
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
they're installed properly and trapped
 
00:46:37.849 --> 00:46:37.859 align:start position:0%
they work very very well I could pass
 
00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
this around the room this would be the
 
00:46:41.809 --> 00:46:41.819 align:start position:0%
the Escape vent in the top of the Trap
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
one side faster with stainless steel
 
00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
rings the other side faster
 
00:46:47.809 --> 00:46:47.819 align:start position:0%
biodegradable steel rings
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
the way things are now water temperature
 
00:46:53.089 --> 00:46:53.099 align:start position:0%
are cheap cheap Chinese steel rings they
 
00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:55.140 align:start position:0%
last about 10 months that door falls
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
open they work perfectly well the Trap
 
00:46:59.450 --> 00:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
they have to be they're required in all
 
00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
the traps so he's finding a lot of traps
 
00:47:02.569 --> 00:47:02.579 align:start position:0%
without these that's an Enforcement
 
00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:04.140 align:start position:0%
issue with the different states but
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
that's I'd like to pass this around the
 
00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
room so you people could see it you can
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
pass that around the room and I'll let
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
you address the thing now issue that was
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
brought up is is that uh is that vent in
 
00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
uh in the door
 
00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:21.780 align:start position:0%
I wish Maine did that I wish Maine did
 
00:47:23.329 --> 00:47:23.339 align:start position:0%
that they put the Escape vents on the
 
00:47:26.809 --> 00:47:26.819 align:start position:0%
sides and and that's very different a
 
00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
lot of times they will put a uh a piece
 
00:47:31.849 --> 00:47:31.859 align:start position:0%
of wood lath in there
 
00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
um so it would it would uh the lab would
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
stay until it was in the water for six
 
00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
or eight months and then it would
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
dissolve away and that would allow the
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
animal to get out of the Trap so yes
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
those are very good Escape vents
 
00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
I wish there were more of them
 
00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
any other representative Ford
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman um
 
00:47:59.450 --> 00:47:59.460 align:start position:0%
I I guess I I'm I'm straightforward in
 
00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
your opinion this bill will it help or
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
hurt the issues in which you see in
 
00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:06.050 align:start position:0%
hurt the issues in which you see in
Maine

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:06.060 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
00:48:08.589 --> 00:48:08.599 align:start position:0%
the issues the the
 
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
Lost ghosts traps the the
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
um pollution all of the things that are
 
00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
issues which helped you create the
 
00:48:20.329 --> 00:48:20.339 align:start position:0%
nonprofit that you have with scuba
 
00:48:22.609 --> 00:48:22.619 align:start position:0%
divers here in New Hampshire assist or
 
00:48:22.619 --> 00:48:23.690 align:start position:0%
divers here in New Hampshire assist or
hurt

00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
hurt
 
00:48:26.809 --> 00:48:26.819 align:start position:0%
I believe that it would help
 
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
um all the way around I think it would
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
help the fishermen get their gear back
 
00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
if they have you know if they haven't
 
00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:35.220 align:start position:0%
been able to get that with grapples
 
00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:36.660 align:start position:0%
um then they would be able to get it
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
back we have to adhere to a very strict
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
um set of rules uh we have to deal with
 
00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
the local politicians the local
 
00:48:49.069 --> 00:48:49.079 align:start position:0%
officials the the Marine Patrol we have
 
00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
to report everything that we do and it
 
00:48:54.609 --> 00:48:54.619 align:start position:0%
isn't an easy thing to do what we do
 
00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
costs a lot of money and if you could
 
00:49:01.069 --> 00:49:01.079 align:start position:0%
get fishermen and divers to work
 
00:49:01.079 --> 00:49:02.089 align:start position:0%
get fishermen and divers to work
together

00:49:02.089 --> 00:49:02.099 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
I think that you could see a big benefit
 
00:49:13.809 --> 00:49:13.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
representative page
 
00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
so I think a a critical difference I'm
 
00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
seeing here between Maine and New
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is that it sounds from your
 
00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
description like you had your community
 
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
on board
 
00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:30.290 align:start position:0%
on board
um

00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
could you speak and that's clearly not
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
the case here from what we're seeing
 
00:49:35.569 --> 00:49:35.579 align:start position:0%
from people who are coming up coming to
 
00:49:38.089 --> 00:49:38.099 align:start position:0%
testify can you speak a little bit about
 
00:49:41.329 --> 00:49:41.339 align:start position:0%
what the process was of bringing the
 
00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
lobstering community on board with this
 
00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
and and how that happened how you how
 
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
how you were able to collaborate to have
 
00:49:53.329 --> 00:49:53.339 align:start position:0%
this be a team effort certainly uh so I
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
knew a lot of the fishermen on the coast
 
00:49:58.970 --> 00:49:58.980 align:start position:0%
of Maine uh from my time there and uh I
 
00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
was able to speak to them about what was
 
00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
going on and before we got in the water
 
00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
to the point where we could be seen as
 
00:50:11.089 --> 00:50:11.099 align:start position:0%
molesting their gear we worked with them
 
00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
on Shore and we talked about the benefit
 
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
that this would bring and uh and quite
 
00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:20.660 align:start position:0%
honestly they all uh
 
00:50:23.089 --> 00:50:23.099 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say we have just about 100
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
of them on board we had a couple of them
 
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
that said oh you know I don't want you
 
00:50:28.609 --> 00:50:28.619 align:start position:0%
out there I don't want you touching my
 
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
gear and as soon as I told them that we
 
00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:33.300 align:start position:0%
brought in 20 of fishable gear they were
 
00:50:36.589 --> 00:50:36.599 align:start position:0%
on board and uh I I hope that that could
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
be the case here
 
00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:42.180 align:start position:0%
yeah um so we we have
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
um we work with the the students who are
 
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
living in the fishing communities we're
 
00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
bringing added benefit to them by
 
00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
teaching them how to scuba dive uh
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
teaching them cold water survival
 
00:50:55.609 --> 00:50:55.619 align:start position:0%
training drill conductor courses we're
 
00:50:58.130 --> 00:50:58.140 align:start position:0%
teaching them a lot about uh how to be
 
00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:00.180 align:start position:0%
safe and how to be responsible on the
 
00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:03.180 align:start position:0%
ocean and the fishermen appreciate that
 
00:51:07.069 --> 00:51:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:09.410 --> 00:51:09.420 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:12.180 align:start position:0%
I've got one myself
 
00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:13.980 align:start position:0%
um if you would
 
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
be able to answer we have heard
 
00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:19.319 align:start position:0%
testimony uh in the last uh date of
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
public hearing and and seeing some stuff
 
00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
since that uh from Massachusetts Rhode
 
00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
Island and Maine they they have uh an
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
estimate that about 10 of the lobster
 
00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:33.260 align:start position:0%
gear is lost each year
 
00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:36.660 align:start position:0%
and that's a significant amount of traps
 
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
every year
 
00:51:40.609 --> 00:51:40.619 align:start position:0%
we were told by the fishermen here in
 
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that they don't lose 10
 
00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:43.559 align:start position:0%
percent because they're very expensive
 
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
and that if they do lose the traps they
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
end up on Route 1 when a storm comes
 
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
because the storm action brings them up
 
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
and washes them ashore
 
00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:53.930 align:start position:0%
and washes them ashore
um

00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
could you
 
00:51:57.530 --> 00:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
00:52:00.589 --> 00:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
the percentages that that you're seeing
 
00:52:03.049 --> 00:52:03.059 align:start position:0%
do you think it's 10 in Maine as we're
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
getting reported
 
00:52:07.069 --> 00:52:07.079 align:start position:0%
um and what would the difference be
 
00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:10.740 align:start position:0%
between the numbers that we're seeing uh
 
00:52:13.069 --> 00:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire versus Maine or being
 
00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:15.780 align:start position:0%
reported in Boothbay Harbor I would say
 
00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
yes there are 10 of the traps
 
00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
um being lost and the reason I say that
 
00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
is Boothbay Harbor is a tourist spot
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
it's uh there's a lot of boat traffic
 
00:52:29.329 --> 00:52:29.339 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of um
 
00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:31.980 align:start position:0%
whale watching and turo uh
 
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
eco-terrorists kind of uh events going
 
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
on so the traps in Boothbay Harbor
 
00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
um their High number and I would say yes
 
00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
that is correct offshore uh I don't
 
00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:49.140 align:start position:0%
think that they're losing that many and
 
00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
um and I think when when the 10 percent
 
00:52:53.290 --> 00:52:53.300 align:start position:0%
is given
 
00:52:56.089 --> 00:52:56.099 align:start position:0%
they should look at whether or not those
 
00:52:58.130 --> 00:52:58.140 align:start position:0%
are retired traps that have been brought
 
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:01.740 align:start position:0%
ashore and are are you know still in the
 
00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
yards and and wharves of the fishermen
 
00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:06.780 align:start position:0%
that could be part of the ten percent
 
00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:09.780 align:start position:0%
and um we're still trying to figure that
 
00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:11.089 align:start position:0%
and um we're still trying to figure that
out

00:53:11.089 --> 00:53:11.099 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:13.140 align:start position:0%
and I have one follow-up you did mention
 
00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:16.140 align:start position:0%
briefly that you recover traps that are
 
00:53:17.329 --> 00:53:17.339 align:start position:0%
still usable
 
00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
I imagine you're able to get those back
 
00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
to the individual lobsterman to whom
 
00:53:23.089 --> 00:53:23.099 align:start position:0%
they belong and that that's a big
 
00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:24.660 align:start position:0%
savings for them because of how
 
00:53:26.089 --> 00:53:26.099 align:start position:0%
expensive we've heard the traps are
 
00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
that's right um that's part of why
 
00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
they've agreed to work with you that's
 
00:53:31.609 --> 00:53:31.619 align:start position:0%
correct all right I wanted to clarify
 
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
uh yes Mr Vice chair
 
00:53:37.790 --> 00:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and just one quick
 
00:53:40.609 --> 00:53:40.619 align:start position:0%
follow-up on that as you said there's a
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
lot of boat traffic in the area
 
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
Lobster fisherman boat traffic that's
 
00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
public boat traffic that's probably
 
00:53:50.809 --> 00:53:50.819 align:start position:0%
cutting off the lines or causing some
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
other damage not to the fault of the
 
00:53:55.130 --> 00:53:55.140 align:start position:0%
lobsterman all of the above there are
 
00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
fishermen there are whale watch type
 
00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
boats and then there are pleasure boats
 
00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:03.020 align:start position:0%
that are typically big and powerful and
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
go through and if if the Tide's running
 
00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:07.740 align:start position:0%
at all and the buoys are under they
 
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:15.300 align:start position:0%
okay any further questions
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
00:54:19.849 --> 00:54:19.859 align:start position:0%
and if you've got written anything to
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
make sure that you get it to the group
 
00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
um and you mentioned pictures I if you
 
00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:25.740 align:start position:0%
only have one set you can give them to
 
00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:27.180 align:start position:0%
the clerk and they'll make copies for
 
00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:29.220 align:start position:0%
everyone to look at later okay and the
 
00:54:30.349 --> 00:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
clerk is
 
00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
right here thank you thank you very much
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time today
 
00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:40.140 align:start position:0%
uh I will now call Eric Anderson
 
00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:42.420 align:start position:0%
from the nhcfa
 
00:54:44.329 --> 00:54:44.339 align:start position:0%
who opposes the bill and is asking for
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:02.220 align:start position:0%
uh good morning Mr chairman and
 
00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:03.109 align:start position:0%
uh good morning Mr chairman and
committee

00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
um my name is Eric Anderson I'm here
 
00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
representing the concerns and opposition
 
00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:09.300 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 442 as president of New
 
00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire commercial Fisherman's
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
Association I have been here when this
 
00:55:18.049 --> 00:55:18.059 align:start position:0%
bill was originally proposed and um and
 
00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
also through the course of the last five
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
years where this bill has come to the
 
00:55:23.450 --> 00:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
attention of this Committee in its never
 
00:55:26.569 --> 00:55:26.579 align:start position:0%
passed uh legislation
 
00:55:29.089 --> 00:55:29.099 align:start position:0%
um the amended version is no better than
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
a previous submissions and broken into
 
00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:32.510 align:start position:0%
a previous submissions and broken into
components

00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
components
 
00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
um it describes
 
00:55:36.349 --> 00:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
um is not well written and confusing in
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
its text in its meeting
 
00:55:41.329 --> 00:55:41.339 align:start position:0%
um and I'll go into some of the uh
 
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
details of that allowing um to take
 
00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
Lobsters by means of diming is just not
 
00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:48.839 align:start position:0%
good policy no matter how described from
 
00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
a variety of reasons and you will hear
 
00:55:54.290 --> 00:55:54.300 align:start position:0%
that type of testimony from fishermen
 
00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:55.740 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire Fish and Game
 
00:55:57.890 --> 00:55:57.900 align:start position:0%
biologists and New Hampshire Fish and
 
00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
Game enforcement today the policy for
 
00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
harvesting this resource is over a
 
00:56:06.049 --> 00:56:06.059 align:start position:0%
hundred years in standing
 
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
and has been and has proven successful
 
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
in maintaining this resource it has been
 
00:56:13.549 --> 00:56:13.559 align:start position:0%
presented here this legislation has been
 
00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:15.839 align:start position:0%
presented here because of its allowance
 
00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts
 
00:56:19.849 --> 00:56:19.859 align:start position:0%
much to the regret of Massachusetts
 
00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Marine Resources
 
00:56:25.309 --> 00:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
and any proposal like this in the state
 
00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
of Maine would not see the light of day
 
00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
as far as taking Boxes by means of
 
00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:33.589 align:start position:0%
as far as taking Boxes by means of
diving

00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
diving
 
00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
I've in previous presentation I've I've
 
00:56:38.809 --> 00:56:38.819 align:start position:0%
submitted to you that it's been proven
 
00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
that a
 
00:56:42.049 --> 00:56:42.059 align:start position:0%
um that this that the lobster trap
 
00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
fishery sustains this resource
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
um through the course of seven years
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
that a lobster the juvenile Lobster will
 
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
grow and mature until it take until it's
 
00:56:54.829 --> 00:56:54.839 align:start position:0%
of a reasonable size
 
00:56:57.770 --> 00:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
um to harvest that Lobster has been in
 
00:56:59.569 --> 00:56:59.579 align:start position:0%
that that Lobster has been in through
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
that trap thousands of times it knows a
 
00:57:06.109 --> 00:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
trap as well as you know why are you
 
00:57:07.849 --> 00:57:07.859 align:start position:0%
sitting here it knows how to get into
 
00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:09.660 align:start position:0%
the Trap it knows how to feed in the
 
00:57:12.349 --> 00:57:12.359 align:start position:0%
Trap it knows how to get out of the Trap
 
00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
and the only reason that we catch
 
00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
lobsters is because we Haul them when
 
00:57:18.290 --> 00:57:18.300 align:start position:0%
the lobsters they're in there and so it
 
00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:21.300 align:start position:0%
has every means to maneuver through that
 
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
trap with seven years of experience
 
00:57:29.569 --> 00:57:29.579 align:start position:0%
until it gets to legal length
 
00:57:29.579 --> 00:57:31.609 align:start position:0%
until it gets to legal length
um

00:57:31.609 --> 00:57:31.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:33.300 align:start position:0%
some of the confusing and not well
 
00:57:35.770 --> 00:57:35.780 align:start position:0%
written language is represented in pages
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
in lines on page one lines 30 through 32
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
where it states
 
00:57:45.309 --> 00:57:45.319 align:start position:0%
um with regards to a designated area
 
00:57:49.309 --> 00:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
it says all areas outside the zones
 
00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
shall be restricted to harvesting of
 
00:57:53.809 --> 00:57:53.819 align:start position:0%
lobsters by those with the scuba diver
 
00:57:56.210 --> 00:57:56.220 align:start position:0%
recreational Lobster license I don't
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
know what that means
 
00:58:00.109 --> 00:58:00.119 align:start position:0%
in one sense it says that there'll be a
 
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
zone for diving for lobsters and then in
 
00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:03.660 align:start position:0%
the net and then in this sentence
 
00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
vertebrate him it says that harvesting a
 
00:58:09.049 --> 00:58:09.059 align:start position:0%
lobsters will take place out harvesting
 
00:58:10.730 --> 00:58:10.740 align:start position:0%
by little officers by means the diving
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
will take place outside those zones
 
00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:14.210 align:start position:0%
will take place outside those zones
areas

00:58:14.210 --> 00:58:14.220 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:58:17.450 --> 00:58:17.460 align:start position:0%
so even an amended version this this
 
00:58:19.549 --> 00:58:19.559 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation just is not well
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
written and it's confusing and out of
 
00:58:23.089 --> 00:58:23.099 align:start position:0%
respect to this committee I think any
 
00:58:24.589 --> 00:58:24.599 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation that comes before
 
00:58:26.349 --> 00:58:26.359 align:start position:0%
you ought to be well written understood
 
00:58:29.329 --> 00:58:29.339 align:start position:0%
and and and not questioned in a way that
 
00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:31.020 align:start position:0%
it's written
 
00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:34.549 align:start position:0%
it's written
um

00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:37.069 --> 00:58:37.079 align:start position:0%
Lobster diving zones must be it says in
 
00:58:39.289 --> 00:58:39.299 align:start position:0%
that in this legislation Lobster diving
 
00:58:41.329 --> 00:58:41.339 align:start position:0%
zones must have parking and
 
00:58:43.849 --> 00:58:43.859 align:start position:0%
accessibility to um to waters for divers
 
00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
I don't believe the executive director
 
00:58:49.130 --> 00:58:49.140 align:start position:0%
has the authority to designate these
 
00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
areas under his under those requirements
 
00:58:54.289 --> 00:58:54.299 align:start position:0%
I think that is legislatively he doesn't
 
00:58:56.690 --> 00:58:56.700 align:start position:0%
that the executive it states the
 
00:58:59.210 --> 00:58:59.220 align:start position:0%
executive director must designate those
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
zones and he doesn't have the authority
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
to do that from a shoreline perspective
 
00:59:06.589 --> 00:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
all licensed Revenue shall be credited
 
00:59:08.809 --> 00:59:08.819 align:start position:0%
to the derelict fishing gear and Coastal
 
00:59:10.970 --> 00:59:10.980 align:start position:0%
cleanup fund this is the wrong place
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
even if this is considered we are
 
00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:14.940 align:start position:0%
opposed to this but if it's a place for
 
00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:16.740 align:start position:0%
Revenue to go this is the wrong place
 
00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:19.140 align:start position:0%
for it to go the administrative and
 
00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:21.660 align:start position:0%
manpower to perform the requirements of
 
00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
this legislation is prohibitively costly
 
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
and as much as we are opposed to it it
 
00:59:29.569 --> 00:59:29.579 align:start position:0%
would be wiser to have any license fees
 
00:59:31.309 --> 00:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
go to the operating costs of New
 
00:59:33.530 --> 00:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Fish and Game this is not a
 
00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:35.940 align:start position:0%
this is this is a very expensive piece
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
of legislation as far as operating costs
 
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Fish and Game
 
00:59:42.109 --> 00:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
department and that should be considered
 
00:59:44.089 --> 00:59:44.099 align:start position:0%
in your con that should be taken into
 
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
consideration for your for this
 
00:59:48.530 --> 00:59:48.540 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
um the reporting requirements described
 
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
in the legislation do not currently
 
00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:55.380 align:start position:0%
exist and would and would require
 
00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
considerable time and effort to
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
construct either it's either from the
 
01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
diving perspective or where they're
 
01:00:02.089 --> 01:00:02.099 align:start position:0%
going to report that they'd take
 
01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:05.700 align:start position:0%
lobsters or from the from the fact of of
 
01:00:08.329 --> 01:00:08.339 align:start position:0%
of of of of trapping tracking where
 
01:00:11.569 --> 01:00:11.579 align:start position:0%
Lobster gear is presently located
 
01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
um it's it just doesn't make sense it
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
just doesn't make sense and it was I
 
01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
think this is written outside the
 
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
context of of of the the knowledge of
 
01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:27.180 align:start position:0%
how how the fishery operates
 
01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:28.970 align:start position:0%
how how the fishery operates
um

01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:28.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
this legislation states that the
 
01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:32.339 align:start position:0%
executive director would have to
 
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
sanction and approve dive shops and
 
01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
instructors by means of certification
 
01:00:39.049 --> 01:00:39.059 align:start position:0%
and compliance this would require a
 
01:00:40.849 --> 01:00:40.859 align:start position:0%
whole new set of circumstances not
 
01:00:42.289 --> 01:00:42.299 align:start position:0%
currently with the New Hampshire Fish
 
01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:44.220 align:start position:0%
and Game system
 
01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:46.980 align:start position:0%
so what this is a it's a complicated you
 
01:00:48.589 --> 01:00:48.599 align:start position:0%
know and it would take some time to do
 
01:00:48.599 --> 01:00:49.849 align:start position:0%
know and it would take some time to do
it

01:00:49.849 --> 01:00:49.859 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:00:49.859 --> 01:00:50.569 align:start position:0%
it
um

01:00:50.569 --> 01:00:50.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:52.980 align:start position:0%
starting on page three lines 34 and
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
onward this legislation
 
01:00:57.530 --> 01:00:57.540 align:start position:0%
has requirements for lofts to trap
 
01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
location tracking
 
01:01:01.609 --> 01:01:01.619 align:start position:0%
and it's not well understood why this
 
01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:04.140 align:start position:0%
legislation is trying to dictate a
 
01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:06.180 align:start position:0%
policy of requirements already practiced
 
01:01:08.809 --> 01:01:08.819 align:start position:0%
by a lobster industry and when Lobster
 
01:01:11.809 --> 01:01:11.819 align:start position:0%
gear and when Lobster gear gets detached
 
01:01:15.049 --> 01:01:15.059 align:start position:0%
from the mark from its boys
 
01:01:15.059 --> 01:01:16.130 align:start position:0%
from the mark from its boys
um

01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:16.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:18.289 --> 01:01:18.299 align:start position:0%
every particular effort by the
 
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
lobsterman to recover that gear is made
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
this gear is not cheap
 
01:01:26.089 --> 01:01:26.099 align:start position:0%
in the last couple of years it has
 
01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:28.980 align:start position:0%
doubled in quadrupled in the cost of a
 
01:01:32.809 --> 01:01:32.819 align:start position:0%
lobster trap so the loss of a trap
 
01:01:32.819 --> 01:01:33.470 align:start position:0%
lobster trap so the loss of a trap
um

01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
the industry goes to a great extents for
 
01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:37.069 align:start position:0%
the industry goes to a great extents for
recovery

01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:37.079 align:start position:0%
recovery
 
01:01:37.079 --> 01:01:38.750 align:start position:0%
recovery
uh

01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:01:41.809 --> 01:01:41.819 align:start position:0%
when it's when it's detached
 
01:01:41.819 --> 01:01:42.650 align:start position:0%
when it's when it's detached
um

01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:42.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
I think that you should described by the
 
01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:48.660 align:start position:0%
previous speaker almost makes sound
 
01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
horrendous that this is a tremendous
 
01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
problem within the fishery in the state
 
01:01:55.789 --> 01:01:55.799 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire I just don't believe
 
01:01:57.530 --> 01:01:57.540 align:start position:0%
that so
 
01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:00.660 align:start position:0%
um we don't have you know uh
 
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:02.700 align:start position:0%
the the type of Fisheries along the
 
01:02:05.089 --> 01:02:05.099 align:start position:0%
shore it's not in a it's not an area
 
01:02:06.829 --> 01:02:06.839 align:start position:0%
like Moon Bay Harbor where there's a lot
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
of other boat traffic that that you know
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
contributes to the lawsuit here
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
um it is a different it is a different
 
01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:17.220 align:start position:0%
fishery and I think that an oncoming
 
01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:19.980 align:start position:0%
speaker will will describe that it's not
 
01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
the same fishery in New Hampshire as it
 
01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
is in Maine
 
01:02:24.119 --> 01:02:24.829 align:start position:0%
is in Maine
um

01:02:24.829 --> 01:02:24.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
and we would go for it we can go further
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
in many of the aspects of this
 
01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
legislation that are confusing it just
 
01:02:32.809 --> 01:02:32.819 align:start position:0%
don't make complete sense but these
 
01:02:34.010 --> 01:02:34.020 align:start position:0%
seven or eight points that we've
 
01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
described would raise concern within
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
this committee to question its Merit we
 
01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
hope you listen closely to New Hampshire
 
01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game and their concerns is they
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
are the ones who ultimately have to
 
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
administer enforce this legislation
 
01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
and and again and you know outside of
 
01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
these comments it's just a editorial
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
opinion I think when a piece of
 
01:02:54.289 --> 01:02:54.299 align:start position:0%
legislation comes in front of this
 
01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:55.559 align:start position:0%
committee and the value of this
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
committee and what it has to consider it
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
should be well written it should be not
 
01:03:02.809 --> 01:03:02.819 align:start position:0%
confusing it shouldn't raise concern to
 
01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
questions over its Merit and and I don't
 
01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:07.980 align:start position:0%
think this this piece of legislation is
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
does it does that I I can read through
 
01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:12.299 align:start position:0%
it I could go on for a considerable
 
01:03:13.970 --> 01:03:13.980 align:start position:0%
amount of time over some of the
 
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
intricacies that are described in this
 
01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
legislation and some of the questions
 
01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:19.740 align:start position:0%
that it raises that it should raise with
 
01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
you and and it's not well described and
 
01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:25.380 align:start position:0%
it's confusing and it's just not well
 
01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:26.569 align:start position:0%
it's confusing and it's just not well
written

01:03:26.569 --> 01:03:26.579 align:start position:0%
written
 
01:03:30.289 --> 01:03:30.299 align:start position:0%
even in in even in its amended form and
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
so I would hope that you would consider
 
01:03:35.089 --> 01:03:35.099 align:start position:0%
to um oppose or itl this piece of
 
01:03:37.309 --> 01:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
legislation for further considerations
 
01:03:40.490 --> 01:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
and then um I appreciate your time thank
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
you thank you sir for your testimony
 
01:03:44.650 --> 01:03:44.660 align:start position:0%
today are there any questions
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
so I I have a question about the zones
 
01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:53.220 align:start position:0%
as well um
 
01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
I heard testimony that
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
um divers don't have underwater GPS it
 
01:04:00.049 --> 01:04:00.059 align:start position:0%
doesn't work or they don't have that or
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
or whatever so if if you're a diver how
 
01:04:07.609 --> 01:04:07.619 align:start position:0%
would and you don't have that GPS
 
01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
equipment available to you or it doesn't
 
01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
work how how would you know if you're
 
01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:14.460 align:start position:0%
still within the zone
 
01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question it's it's
 
01:04:18.410 --> 01:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
described in here that you know there
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
should be a Zone but it you know in in
 
01:04:23.569 --> 01:04:23.579 align:start position:0%
the actual you know anytime you you make
 
01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:25.740 align:start position:0%
a Zone you make a line that on one side
 
01:04:27.049 --> 01:04:27.059 align:start position:0%
of the line you're good on the other
 
01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
side of the line you're bad the dive I
 
01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
don't think there's a reasonable there's
 
01:04:33.049 --> 01:04:33.059 align:start position:0%
a reasonable way to measure that system
 
01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:35.460 align:start position:0%
in the water and that divers would not
 
01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:37.799 align:start position:0%
have the ability to recognize where they
 
01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
exactly are if they're outside or inside
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
the zone or
 
01:04:44.569 --> 01:04:44.579 align:start position:0%
um whether there's any other
 
01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
um whether there's anything else going
 
01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:48.900 align:start position:0%
on within their activity you know in
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
regards to taking lobsters and I've said
 
01:04:54.049 --> 01:04:54.059 align:start position:0%
it in previous legislation but I mean
 
01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
what was described by the previous
 
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
speaker it creates it creates two user
 
01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
groups in the water at the same time
 
01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
it's the same place
 
01:05:06.289 --> 01:05:06.299 align:start position:0%
and it creates a safety issue that is
 
01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
beyond comprehension
 
01:05:10.609 --> 01:05:10.619 align:start position:0%
I think it would be tragic if you were
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
to pass the legislation and create a
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
system where these two user groups
 
01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
are operating at the same time and I'll
 
01:05:22.849 --> 01:05:22.859 align:start position:0%
tell you one thing oh you know a boat or
 
01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
getting tangled up in the gear uh you
 
01:05:27.289 --> 01:05:27.299 align:start position:0%
know a diver getting tangled up in gear
 
01:05:30.049 --> 01:05:30.059 align:start position:0%
or anything else that could potentially
 
01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
um develop in this situation I think it
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
would be a tragic travesty to pass
 
01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
legislation that would that would that
 
01:05:42.289 --> 01:05:42.299 align:start position:0%
would allow this to take place
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
um and and I don't think it's an issue
 
01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that you should
 
01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:49.260 align:start position:0%
consider at this particular time
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
01:05:54.530 --> 01:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony

01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman members of this committee
 
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:35.809 --> 01:06:35.819 align:start position:0%
before I start my testimony uh I'd like
 
01:06:37.789 --> 01:06:37.799 align:start position:0%
to give a quick rebuttal to the
 
01:06:39.890 --> 01:06:39.900 align:start position:0%
gentleman from Newcastle Maine
 
01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:43.370 align:start position:0%

01:06:43.370 --> 01:06:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
I understand I understand the project I
 
01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
understand the project that happened uh
 
01:06:51.069 --> 01:06:51.079 align:start position:0%
that's going on and has happened
 
01:06:54.289 --> 01:06:54.299 align:start position:0%
down in Massachusetts Bay and the
 
01:06:58.250 --> 01:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
concept uh is very admirable and I I
 
01:07:00.289 --> 01:07:00.299 align:start position:0%
actually agree with the concept
 
01:07:04.849 --> 01:07:04.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
and secondly the main trap fishery is a
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%

we don't have the loss of gear that you
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
will have in the single trap
 
01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:28.430 align:start position:0%

01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
the Trap fishery is accepted throughout
 
01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
the world as the only resource
 
01:08:31.729 --> 01:08:31.739 align:start position:0%
sustainable and environmentally friendly
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
method of taking lobsters
 
01:08:35.809 --> 01:08:35.819 align:start position:0%
the commercial officer men have been
 
01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
stewards of this resource and the
 
01:08:41.209 --> 01:08:41.219 align:start position:0%
environment for 100 years or better
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
to try to portray them or their methods
 
01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
of fishing is something different does a
 
01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
during the hearing on the original bill
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
I listened to testimony that Lobster men
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
lose 10 percent of their traps every
 
01:08:56.279 --> 01:08:57.709 align:start position:0%
lose 10 percent of their traps every
year

01:08:57.709 --> 01:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
I believe reference to that figure comes
 
01:09:02.329 --> 01:09:02.339 align:start position:0%
from the fact that lobstermen are given
 
01:09:05.169 --> 01:09:05.179 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to purchase 10
 
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
additional trap tags above their trap
 
01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:10.130 align:start position:0%
additional trap tags above their trap
allocation

01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
allocation
 
01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
apparently to some that has become
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
synonymous the traps lost every year
 
01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
that is not true that 10 percent was an
 
01:09:24.050 --> 01:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
arbitrary figure based mostly on helping
 
01:09:26.749 --> 01:09:26.759 align:start position:0%
the states and fishermen deal with a new
 
01:09:29.689 --> 01:09:29.699 align:start position:0%
and burdensome regulation how do I know
 
01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:32.699 align:start position:0%
that I sat at the table
 
01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
if a commercial lobsterman lost 10
 
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
percent of its traps every year he would
 
01:09:38.809 --> 01:09:38.819 align:start position:0%
not be in business
 
01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:41.460 align:start position:0%
extra trap tags were allowed for trap
 
01:09:43.610 --> 01:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
tags lost from the traps
 
01:09:46.610 --> 01:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
it periodic switching out of gear as
 
01:09:48.519 --> 01:09:48.529 align:start position:0%
well as an occasional trap loss
 
01:09:48.529 --> 01:09:50.269 align:start position:0%
well as an occasional trap loss

itself
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
as with the first version of this bill I
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
am still concerned about page two y9

diving Lobster was described
 
01:10:10.729 --> 01:10:10.739 align:start position:0%
my concern is the admission of RSA 211

01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
which all relate to the preservation of

the Atlantic states marine fisheries
 
01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
commission there was testimony from a

Rhode Island dive organization opposing
 
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
those Provisions because their dive
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
parties were only interested in Trophy
 
01:10:36.719 --> 01:10:37.970 align:start position:0%

everything I'm talking about today
 
01:10:49.729 --> 01:10:49.739 align:start position:0%
uh I'll probably mute points if this
 
01:10:52.669 --> 01:10:52.679 align:start position:0%
bill is adopted as written

with this provision
 
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
as a lobsterman I find it
 
01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
find a usefulness of this type of log
 
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
questionable I know where my gear is
 
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
years ago someone asked my wife if I
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
hold trapped in the fog and how I found
 
01:11:44.159 --> 01:11:45.290 align:start position:0%
hold trapped in the fog and how I found
them

01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:11:47.689 --> 01:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
people asked and she said here's a

01:11:57.709 --> 01:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
I see this provisioned as an invasion

into my personal fishing knowledge and
 
01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
nothing more than harassment of a

control this practice was eliminated
 
01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:29.100 align:start position:0%

although many of you have been led to
 
01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
believe that the lobster industry need
 
01:13:10.450 --> 01:13:10.460 align:start position:0%
to do nothing in relation to Wales until

01:13:51.770 --> 01:13:51.780 align:start position:0%
there are fishermen in other states and
 
01:13:54.189 --> 01:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
federal waters currently experimenting
 
01:13:58.490 --> 01:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
using gear without attached buoys

starting in the spring of summer this
 
01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
year is anticipated that there will be
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire fishermen also involved
 
01:14:06.890 --> 01:14:06.900 align:start position:0%
this paragraph is a complete
 
01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
contradiction to the development of
 
01:14:11.209 --> 01:14:11.219 align:start position:0%
phishing methods that may allow the New
 
01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire logs and fishery to coexist in
 
01:14:17.149 --> 01:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
the face of a challenging situation
 
01:14:19.370 --> 01:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
now I want you to know that I hold the
 
01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
legislation of this state and highest
 
01:14:23.330 --> 01:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
regard and I have the greatest respect
 
01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
for those who give their time here
 
01:14:28.490 --> 01:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
but to me the part of this bill that
 
01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
deals with lobsters is a vindictive
 
01:14:32.930 --> 01:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
attack on the only commercial fishery
 
01:14:34.610 --> 01:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
left in the state
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
all because lots of fishing will believe
 
01:14:39.770 --> 01:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
the taken of lobsters by active rather
 
01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
than passive message is inappropriate
 
01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
it's an attempt to demonize a fishery
 
01:14:47.450 --> 01:14:47.460 align:start position:0%
the Geary users and the way it's
 
01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:50.580 align:start position:0%
conducted when in fact this fishery has
 
01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
always been in the Forefront when it
 
01:14:56.090 --> 01:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
comes to sustainability and environment
 
01:14:57.890 --> 01:14:57.900 align:start position:0%
if I have offended anybody with my
 
01:15:01.850 --> 01:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
statements I offer my sincere apologies
 
01:15:03.169 --> 01:15:03.179 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to crafting
 
01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
legislation involving lobsters it's best
 
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
left to those who understand and are
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
aware of the implications and the
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
ramifications those proposed laws may
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
have the largest scheme of things
 
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
and I thank you very much for listening
 
01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
to me
 
01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today are
 
01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:23.580 align:start position:0%
there any questions

Vice chair
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair would you take one
 
01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:29.030 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair would you take one
question

01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
excuse me I'm sorry no right here thank
 
01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:33.530 align:start position:0%
excuse me I'm sorry no right here thank
you

01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:15:36.169 --> 01:15:36.179 align:start position:0%
go ahead you had mentioned early in your
 
01:15:38.689 --> 01:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
testimony the difference between how
 
01:15:38.699 --> 01:15:40.250 align:start position:0%
testimony the difference between how
Maine

01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
01:15:43.490 --> 01:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
sets traps as single traps versus trawl
 
01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire could you just explain
 
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
the difference of the two and what
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
you're talking about for those who don't
 
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
know yes main state of Maine the state
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
of Maine uh the inshore Fishery uh is
 
01:15:56.330 --> 01:15:56.340 align:start position:0%
basically a single trap Fishery
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh which means one trap one buoy
 
01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:00.290 align:start position:0%
uh which means one trap one buoy
uh

01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:03.290 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
has

01:16:03.290 --> 01:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:04.910 align:start position:0%
has
or

01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
I won't say forever but for
 
01:16:10.189 --> 01:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
50 years has been a trial Fishery where
 
01:16:11.689 --> 01:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
we fish
 
01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:14.580 align:start position:0%
a number of a number of traps with Bowie
 
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
on each end
 
01:16:18.530 --> 01:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
the difference is that with a single
 
01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:19.430 align:start position:0%
the difference is that with a single
buoy

01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
buoy
 
01:16:21.229 --> 01:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
boat traffic
 
01:16:21.239 --> 01:16:24.169 align:start position:0%
boat traffic
chafing

01:16:24.169 --> 01:16:24.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:27.229 --> 01:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
Mother Nature or whatever uh
 
01:16:29.630 --> 01:16:29.640 align:start position:0%
can easily detach a single buoy from the
 
01:16:33.169 --> 01:16:33.179 align:start position:0%
trap then the Trap is no longer is lost
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's a trawl fishery which we have in
 
01:16:38.209 --> 01:16:38.219 align:start position:0%
this state we have a say 10 trap for all
 
01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
we have a bouillon each end we lose one
 
01:16:42.530 --> 01:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
buoy we still have the ten traps because
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
we have the other buoy one buoy chafes
 
01:16:46.850 --> 01:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
off right we still have the other one
 
01:16:48.970 --> 01:16:48.980 align:start position:0%
right if both boys
 
01:16:52.850 --> 01:16:52.860 align:start position:0%
chafe off we have 10 traps with one
 
01:16:55.729 --> 01:16:55.739 align:start position:0%
ground line that is easily retrievable
 
01:16:57.890 --> 01:16:57.900 align:start position:0%
you can't do that with a single trap
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
which is what Maine's fishery is so to
 
01:17:03.770 --> 01:17:03.780 align:start position:0%
compare the two I'm not don't get me
 
01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
wrong the concept the concept of
 
01:17:08.930 --> 01:17:08.940 align:start position:0%
cleaning up the ocean
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
is not something I have a problem with
 
01:17:12.239 --> 01:17:13.250 align:start position:0%
is not something I have a problem with
so

01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:15.169 --> 01:17:15.179 align:start position:0%
but but the two Fisheries can't be
 
01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
compared right and this
 
01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:20.820 align:start position:0%
that's a concept what he's talking about
 
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about the builders before
 
01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:24.900 align:start position:0%
you today and to build it before you
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
today is is does not do what
 
01:17:33.770 --> 01:17:33.780 align:start position:0%
the concept is thank you thank you
 
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:36.290 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
the chair will now call Weldon Bosworth
 
01:17:41.930 --> 01:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
representing himself and he supports the
 
01:17:45.850 --> 01:17:45.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman splane members of
 
01:17:51.890 --> 01:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:53.810 --> 01:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
I am from Guilford New Hampshire I
 
01:17:55.970 --> 01:17:55.980 align:start position:0%
submitted a testimony on this particular
 
01:17:59.209 --> 01:17:59.219 align:start position:0%
Bill last year and again this year in uh
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
in January and I just had a couple of
 
01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
points I'd like to make as an amendment
 
01:18:05.689 --> 01:18:05.699 align:start position:0%
to the Maye testimony
 
01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
I wanted just first of all to remind
 
01:18:09.770 --> 01:18:09.780 align:start position:0%
those on the committee who may have not
 
01:18:12.169 --> 01:18:12.179 align:start position:0%
been here before my experience I've been
 
01:18:16.090 --> 01:18:16.100 align:start position:0%
a certified diver for almost 64 years
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
I've as a youngster used to take
 
01:18:20.810 --> 01:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
Lobsters by hand and Massachusetts where
 
01:18:25.010 --> 01:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
it was permitted I have a doctorate in
 
01:18:28.010 --> 01:18:28.020 align:start position:0%
Marine Biology with an emphasis on
 
01:18:30.590 --> 01:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
benthic ecology which is a study of the
 
01:18:32.689 --> 01:18:32.699 align:start position:0%
animals and plants live in and on the
 
01:18:32.699 --> 01:18:33.649 align:start position:0%
animals and plants live in and on the
bottom

01:18:33.649 --> 01:18:33.659 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
01:18:35.570 --> 01:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
and I make these comments from that
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
standpoint again my Consulting career
 
01:18:40.330 --> 01:18:40.340 align:start position:0%
was on evaluating impacts of human
 
01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
activities on species in the ocean
 
01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
a couple of uh
 
01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
I guess issues have risen to the top
 
01:18:52.729 --> 01:18:52.739 align:start position:0%
here of a reason why people oppose this
 
01:18:55.790 --> 01:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
bill the first was the damage to the
 
01:18:58.490 --> 01:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
lobsters and the bottom uh
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
basically in fact a couple of the people
 
01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
from Fish and Game maintain that based
 
01:19:05.630 --> 01:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
on their experience this is a
 
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
significant issue
 
01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
while it may be their experience or the
 
01:19:12.530 --> 01:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
experience of others they've talked to I
 
01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:14.460 align:start position:0%
think in no way should this be
 
01:19:17.570 --> 01:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
considered to be a generalized point
 
01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh I think anybody that is a experienced
 
01:19:24.169 --> 01:19:24.179 align:start position:0%
diver that has hunted lobsters realizes
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
what an earlier speaker say you don't go
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
turning over rocks you hunt them and
 
01:19:33.050 --> 01:19:33.060 align:start position:0%
it's a subtle Sport with basically like
 
01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:36.300 align:start position:0%
hunting deer or Birds Upland game that
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
kind of thing you wait till you see them
 
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
lobsters in their native state during
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
the day when the divers are there
 
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
generally would have their antennae or
 
01:19:47.630 --> 01:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
their head sticking out of a crevice and
 
01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
you basically grab that the thorax
 
01:19:53.149 --> 01:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
behind that and bring them out you don't
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
rip off their claws I mean the first
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
time diver may do that once and find on
 
01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
its uh a very ineffective way to get uh
 
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
to get lobsters as a benchmark I have
 
01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
taken lobsters crabs scallops and even
 
01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
Flounder with my bare hands and not made
 
01:20:14.090 --> 01:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
any impact to the ocean bottom the other
 
01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
point I'd like to make is what I
 
01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:18.780 align:start position:0%
consider to be the inequity of looking
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
at this rulemaking as hey you're guilty
 
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
until a proven innocent in other words
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
there's this doubt here that if this
 
01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
bill goes into effect or the rules
 
01:20:30.770 --> 01:20:30.780 align:start position:0%
associated with this bill that goes into
 
01:20:32.930 --> 01:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
effect all hell is going to break loose
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
and diver's going to be out there
 
01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
poaching traps I can assure you this is
 
01:20:39.290 --> 01:20:39.300 align:start position:0%
not going to happen like with any group
 
01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
of people there may be met Bad actors we
 
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
have only a hundred permits given by
 
01:20:47.870 --> 01:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
this bill contemplated uh they're going
 
01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
to be registered with their names and
 
01:20:52.490 --> 01:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
everything on the boys so you'll know
 
01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
who's there and I just don't think
 
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a major issue to try
 
01:21:00.290 --> 01:21:00.300 align:start position:0%
to enforce in fact uh fish and game has
 
01:21:03.169 --> 01:21:03.179 align:start position:0%
a lot more difficult problems enforce
 
01:21:04.729 --> 01:21:04.739 align:start position:0%
and I gave it as an example in my
 
01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
testimony the number of hunting licenses
 
01:21:10.010 --> 01:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
and fishing licenses which total over
 
01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:11.689 align:start position:0%
and fishing licenses which total over
260

01:21:11.689 --> 01:21:11.699 align:start position:0%
260
 
01:21:14.689 --> 01:21:14.699 align:start position:0%
000 which the state it has to enforce
 
01:21:16.370 --> 01:21:16.380 align:start position:0%
with I think it's less than 40
 
01:21:18.770 --> 01:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
conservation officers now which is
 
01:21:20.689 --> 01:21:20.699 align:start position:0%
ridiculous it should be twice that at
 
01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:21.780 align:start position:0%
least but
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
to try to put into a perspective from a
 
01:21:27.010 --> 01:21:27.020 align:start position:0%
statistical or probabilistic standpoint
 
01:21:29.930 --> 01:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
catching that one diver that might catch
 
01:21:33.169 --> 01:21:33.179 align:start position:0%
might poach a trap to the violations
 
01:21:35.930 --> 01:21:35.940 align:start position:0%
that could take place on any of these uh
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
licenses that are already issued is uh I
 
01:21:43.490 --> 01:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
mean it pales by comparison
 
01:21:46.189 --> 01:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
the idea that was brought up by the uh
 
01:21:48.350 --> 01:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
speaker who or the representative that
 
01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
introduced this bill that we are
 
01:21:53.930 --> 01:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
basically uh favoring in some instances
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
the non-resident because non-residents
 
01:22:01.490 --> 01:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
can hunt fish and take Lobster
 
01:22:04.189 --> 01:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
uh from our Waters and you you're
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
denying a group of divers a small group
 
01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
of divers from taking some of their uh
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
one of our public trust resources I
 
01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
think is inequitable and basically
 
01:22:18.169 --> 01:22:18.179 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with New Hampshire's New
 
01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Fish and games mission
 
01:22:21.890 --> 01:22:21.900 align:start position:0%
I wanted to speak just a little bit
 
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
about uh sustainability which is brought
 
01:22:27.610 --> 01:22:27.620 align:start position:0%
up by a couple of speakers
 
01:22:30.890 --> 01:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
sustainability has many faces and if you
 
01:22:33.169 --> 01:22:33.179 align:start position:0%
look at it from a holistic standpoint
 
01:22:36.110 --> 01:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
the lobstermen that use the bait in our
 
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
Gulf of Maine waters are basically
 
01:22:41.470 --> 01:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
taking other fish other species and
 
01:22:44.930 --> 01:22:44.940 align:start position:0%
using them to bathe their lobster traps
 
01:22:48.649 --> 01:22:48.659 align:start position:0%
the typical Maiden uh in the Gulf of
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
Maine used to be the herring in fact the
 
01:22:54.530 --> 01:22:54.540 align:start position:0%
lobsterman took over as it reported over
 
01:22:56.930 --> 01:22:56.940 align:start position:0%
70 percent of the Herring stocks in the
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
Gulf of Maine
 
01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
the Herring stocks are now depressed so
 
01:23:03.050 --> 01:23:03.060 align:start position:0%
they're switching to menhaden and I
 
01:23:05.209 --> 01:23:05.219 align:start position:0%
guess a couple other species to bait
 
01:23:07.310 --> 01:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
their traps so that's one element of
 
01:23:09.290 --> 01:23:09.300 align:start position:0%
sustainability that one has to look at
 
01:23:11.450 --> 01:23:11.460 align:start position:0%
to look at the overall sustainability
 
01:23:14.630 --> 01:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
quotient of lobster fishing the other is
 
01:23:16.669 --> 01:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
these uh ghost traps that we've been
 
01:23:19.209 --> 01:23:19.219 align:start position:0%
talking about uh
 
01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
given that some of the traps here are
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
trawl traps in New Hampshire there's
 
01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
others that are single traps basically
 
01:23:29.330 --> 01:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
once a trap is lost it continues to fish
 
01:23:31.729 --> 01:23:31.739 align:start position:0%
and studies that have been done show the
 
01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
escape from the traps more the mortality
 
01:23:36.530 --> 01:23:36.540 align:start position:0%
from fish
 
01:23:38.630 --> 01:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
caught in the traps can range from 10 to
 
01:23:41.090 --> 01:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
40 percent those studies were done in
 
01:23:44.530 --> 01:23:44.540 align:start position:0%
Maine and down around the cape
 
01:23:47.209 --> 01:23:47.219 align:start position:0%
as a
 
01:23:51.729 --> 01:23:51.739 align:start position:0%
in a trap as the time goes on other
 
01:23:55.010 --> 01:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
animals actually wander into the Trap
 
01:23:57.050 --> 01:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
and they may die they provide bait for
 
01:23:58.850 --> 01:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
the next sequence of animals that come
 
01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
into the Trap if a trap stays down over
 
01:24:03.410 --> 01:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
a winter you have a lot of things
 
01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:05.300 align:start position:0%
growing on it not just
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
sponges and hydroids but also seaweed
 
01:24:12.050 --> 01:24:12.060 align:start position:0%
and so forth that basically causes the
 
01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
vents not to work as they properly
 
01:24:15.890 --> 01:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
should so here's another element of
 
01:24:18.890 --> 01:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
sustainability I wouldn't base I would
 
01:24:21.530 --> 01:24:21.540 align:start position:0%
guess based on looking at the various
 
01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
data that the amount of lobsters
 
01:24:25.970 --> 01:24:25.980 align:start position:0%
projected to get
 
01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
uh by the Harvest by divers is far less
 
01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
than those that are going to die in any
 
01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:34.130 align:start position:0%
than those that are going to die in any
trap

01:24:34.130 --> 01:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
and as far as the reading of this bill I
 
01:24:40.490 --> 01:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
read this uh page one article 31 is that
 
01:24:43.610 --> 01:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
the scuba divers are restricted from
 
01:24:45.410 --> 01:24:45.420 align:start position:0%
going outside the zone so I think that's
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
the way it's supposed to be
 
01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:51.960 align:start position:0%

popular idea but because in its sixth
 
01:25:59.689 --> 01:25:59.699 align:start position:0%
attempt there is obviously concerns and

House Bill 442 is divers listed as Skin

diving scuba diving and free diving
 
01:27:05.149 --> 01:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
those are three kinds of diving which
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
means three more ways for law
 
01:27:08.689 --> 01:27:08.699 align:start position:0%
enforcement must attempt to monitor plus
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
three more ways to create problems in

01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
I also struggle with how this proposed
 
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
bill will impact the resource the state
 
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%

entice lobsters into our lobster traps

01:28:24.770 --> 01:28:24.780 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we have a lobster trap
 
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
fishery and it works
 
01:28:28.729 --> 01:28:28.739 align:start position:0%
every New Hampshire resident has the
 
01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
right to obtain this lot to participate
 
01:28:33.770 --> 01:28:33.780 align:start position:0%
in this Lobster resource my opinion is
 
01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
the Trap fishery is the best thing for
 
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
its residents the resorts and its users
 
01:28:41.810 --> 01:28:41.820 align:start position:0%
and I've to end this and in the past uh
 
01:28:43.669 --> 01:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
I think the sixth time or maybe more
 
01:28:46.250 --> 01:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
that I've been here I've offered and
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
will continue to offer anyone who shows
 
01:28:49.790 --> 01:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
interest and wants to learn about
 
01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:51.420 align:start position:0%

uh Lobster's taken by diving will be
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
enticed or ripped or tickled excuse me
 
01:29:20.930 --> 01:29:20.940 align:start position:0%
enticed by being ripped or tickled out
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
of their hole that I understand or
 
01:29:25.129 --> 01:29:25.139 align:start position:0%
burrow without a full belly and no
 
01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
possibility of Escape what is the point
 
01:29:29.390 --> 01:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
of them not having a full belly can you

01:29:36.050 --> 01:29:36.060 align:start position:0%
and uh lobsters are always looking for
 
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
food yeah so
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%

01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
that Neil Kirk who served here for many
 
01:31:58.850 --> 01:31:58.860 align:start position:0%
many years always said
 
01:32:01.610 --> 01:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
tell the committee or the house what
 
01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to say and where you stand
 
01:32:05.810 --> 01:32:05.820 align:start position:0%
at the beginning tell them in the middle
 
01:32:09.169 --> 01:32:09.179 align:start position:0%
and tell them at the end
 
01:32:11.689 --> 01:32:11.699 align:start position:0%
and he was quite a good legislature and
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
he sat on the other side of the aisle
 
01:32:16.250 --> 01:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:19.250 --> 01:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
I think that this bill is deserving
 
01:32:24.530 --> 01:32:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:26.810 --> 01:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
coming from this committee
 
01:32:28.970 --> 01:32:28.980 align:start position:0%
you might ask how I arrive at this
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
conclusion but first let me give you
 
01:32:34.090 --> 01:32:34.100 align:start position:0%
some background of where I come from
 
01:32:37.490 --> 01:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
regarding Lobster management
 
01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
I'm a former seven term legislator
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%

01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
I was the chairman of this committee for
 
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%

commission which you've heard mentioned
 
01:33:04.490 --> 01:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
numerous times this morning during
 
01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:07.729 align:start position:0%
numerous times this morning during
testimony

01:33:07.729 --> 01:33:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:09.649 --> 01:33:09.659 align:start position:0%

01:33:21.290 --> 01:33:21.300 align:start position:0%
that have been promulgated by the fish
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%

the Atlantic states marine fisheries
 
01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
commission was established in 1942
 
01:33:37.810 --> 01:33:37.820 align:start position:0%
to be a Cooperative group amongst the 15
 
01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:40.560 align:start position:0%

state
 
01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
I being one I am the permanent proxy for
 
01:33:50.930 --> 01:33:50.940 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters
 
01:33:53.149 --> 01:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
Sheree Patterson who's in the back of
 
01:33:55.550 --> 01:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
the room is the second one and Doug
 
01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:03.709 --> 01:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
leader of the Marine Division in Durham
 
01:34:06.410 --> 01:34:06.420 align:start position:0%
is the third commissioner we vote as a
 
01:34:09.709 --> 01:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
body a state has one vote
 
01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
for the three of us
 
01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
we meet four times a year in Washington
 
01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
D.C we have numerous State hearings and
 
01:34:20.270 --> 01:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a hearing tomorrow
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
evening on of all things lobsters
 
01:34:27.370 --> 01:34:27.380 align:start position:0%
and one of the issues I think Bobby nudd
 
01:34:30.430 --> 01:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned or someone maybe it was Eric
 
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
Anderson that mentioned that we're going
 
01:34:36.590 --> 01:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
to be looking at possibly increasing the
 
01:34:40.250 --> 01:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
gauge size because contrary to what the
 
01:34:42.050 --> 01:34:42.060 align:start position:0%
person who introduced this amendment
 
01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
said the lobsterf
 
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
the lobster fishery is not in As Good
 
01:34:50.030 --> 01:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
Health as some of us would like to
 
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
believe according to the scientists
 
01:34:55.209 --> 01:34:55.219 align:start position:0%
they're finding that settlement meaning
 
01:34:58.729 --> 01:34:58.739 align:start position:0%
juvenile Lobster counts are down in the
 
01:35:00.770 --> 01:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
state of Maine and therefore the state
 
01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
of Maine is
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
was the principal mover in having us
 
01:35:08.930 --> 01:35:08.940 align:start position:0%
look at regulations regarding lobsters
 
01:35:11.090 --> 01:35:11.100 align:start position:0%
and one of the easiest things to do is
 
01:35:14.209 --> 01:35:14.219 align:start position:0%
change the minimum size but sitting over
 
01:35:16.729 --> 01:35:16.739 align:start position:0%
in the corner of previous fellow that
 
01:35:16.739 --> 01:35:18.290 align:start position:0%
in the corner of previous fellow that
testified

01:35:18.290 --> 01:35:18.300 align:start position:0%
testified
 
01:35:21.229 --> 01:35:21.239 align:start position:0%
my good friend would tell you that we
 
01:35:23.570 --> 01:35:23.580 align:start position:0%
shouldn't shouldn't be doing that and we
 
01:35:26.689 --> 01:35:26.699 align:start position:0%
probably probably shouldn't and before I
 
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:28.679 align:start position:0%
go into some of my written testimony I'd
 
01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
like to take issue with some of the
 
01:35:33.530 --> 01:35:33.540 align:start position:0%
things that were said and I would thank
 
01:35:37.310 --> 01:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
Bobby nudd for his enlightened testimony
 
01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
though I do disagree with him that Maine
 
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
has a single line Fishery
 
01:35:46.430 --> 01:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
at present a big movement because of the
 
01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
whale issue is and we're dealing with
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
that also is that they're trying to
 
01:35:54.290 --> 01:35:54.300 align:start position:0%
minimize the amount of fishing lines
 
01:35:56.570 --> 01:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
buoy lines in the water
 
01:35:58.669 --> 01:35:58.679 align:start position:0%
they have two usually they fish in
 
01:36:00.890 --> 01:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
trials with two on each end which
 
01:36:03.709 --> 01:36:03.719 align:start position:0%
minimizes the chances of losing the
 
01:36:07.610 --> 01:36:07.620 align:start position:0%
trolls if you break one buoy off you
 
01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
still have the other one allow you to
 
01:36:12.050 --> 01:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
retrieve the rest of the trawl and as
 
01:36:14.450 --> 01:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
Bobby Ned said I know that they know
 
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
where every one of their trolls is set
 
01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
through the year
 
01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
and we also our organization
 
01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:23.510 align:start position:0%
and we also our organization
through

01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
knowers insistence we just
 
01:36:29.689 --> 01:36:29.699 align:start position:0%
passed another law for the lobsterman
 
01:36:30.890 --> 01:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
where they're going to have to have
 
01:36:33.709 --> 01:36:33.719 align:start position:0%
trackers on their boat so that we can
 
01:36:35.689 --> 01:36:35.699 align:start position:0%
tell they can tell
 
01:36:39.110 --> 01:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
where those people are fishing in real
 
01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:40.970 align:start position:0%
where those people are fishing in real
time

01:36:40.970 --> 01:36:40.980 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
and those are going to be installed I
 
01:36:45.709 --> 01:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
think in the next year
 
01:36:47.689 --> 01:36:47.699 align:start position:0%
some of the other things that were
 
01:36:49.790 --> 01:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned number of traps I sponsored
 
01:36:53.410 --> 01:36:53.420 align:start position:0%
that bill for harmony traps could be
 
01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
fished in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:36:58.970 --> 01:36:58.980 align:start position:0%
another thing before I get into my
 
01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
written testimony was gentleman said
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
that there's a loss of up to 10 percent
 
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
of traps Bobby Nutt counted that by
 
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
saying yes
 
01:37:12.169 --> 01:37:12.179 align:start position:0%
we passed the law in Atlantic states
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
that we issue extra trap tags for
 
01:37:18.370 --> 01:37:18.380 align:start position:0%
whatever reason damage traps or whatever
 
01:37:21.169 --> 01:37:21.179 align:start position:0%
you have to put a different tag on
 
01:37:23.870 --> 01:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
because of the tag that you use you
 
01:37:26.149 --> 01:37:26.159 align:start position:0%
can't break it and put it onto another
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
trap so that's another reason why
 
01:37:31.250 --> 01:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
they're issued extra traps and think
 
01:37:33.290 --> 01:37:33.300 align:start position:0%
about it for a minute
 
01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
the state of Maine has 6 000 licensed
 
01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:39.110 align:start position:0%
the state of Maine has 6 000 licensed
lobstermen

01:37:39.110 --> 01:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
lobstermen
 
01:37:41.330 --> 01:37:41.340 align:start position:0%
the majority of them are allowed to fish
 
01:37:44.930 --> 01:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
800 traps do the math and you come up
 
01:37:48.169 --> 01:37:48.179 align:start position:0%
with two to three million traps do you
 
01:37:50.570 --> 01:37:50.580 align:start position:0%
think they're losing 200 000 traps a
 
01:37:53.209 --> 01:37:53.219 align:start position:0%
year I don't think so
 
01:37:55.370 --> 01:37:55.380 align:start position:0%
I'll bet you that Mike Flanagan will
 
01:37:56.930 --> 01:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
tell you that he probably didn't lose
 
01:37:59.689 --> 01:37:59.699 align:start position:0%
one trap last year because he's a good
 
01:38:01.790 --> 01:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
lobsterman as are all the gentlemen
 
01:38:05.330 --> 01:38:05.340 align:start position:0%
behind us or good lobster fishermen and
 
01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
again as I stated at the very beginning
 
01:38:12.110 --> 01:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
I'm here because I'm here to protect
 
01:38:15.229 --> 01:38:15.239 align:start position:0%
those lobstermen those lobstermen are
 
01:38:17.209 --> 01:38:17.219 align:start position:0%
trying to make a living
 
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
and me on the other side of the coin at
 
01:38:23.410 --> 01:38:23.420 align:start position:0%
times are involved in enacting
 
01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:25.330 align:start position:0%
times are involved in enacting
regulations

01:38:25.330 --> 01:38:25.340 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
not regulations necessarily but what we
 
01:38:33.649 --> 01:38:33.659 align:start position:0%
do at Atlantic states is if we pass
 
01:38:36.410 --> 01:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
an amendment or an addendum store
 
01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
management plan the state has to comply
 
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
with it if they don't comply with it
 
01:38:44.510 --> 01:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
they are subject to being
 
01:38:46.370 --> 01:38:46.380 align:start position:0%
held to account by the federal
 
01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:47.689 align:start position:0%
held to account by the federal
government

01:38:47.689 --> 01:38:47.699 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
so anyway let me see what more I can say
 
01:38:55.189 --> 01:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to say
 
01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
as I read this bill I didn't have to go
 
01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
by the first sentence before I knew this
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
was a bad Bill
 
01:39:06.850 --> 01:39:06.860 align:start position:0%
because I feel that unlike individuals
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
legally fishing for lobsters divers have
 
01:39:14.330 --> 01:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
and will not make any investment in
 
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
promoting the health and well-being of

the industry
 
01:39:20.750 --> 01:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
these people sitting in the back here
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
are running what I would consider a
 
01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:24.850 align:start position:0%
are running what I would consider a
modified

01:39:24.850 --> 01:39:24.860 align:start position:0%
modified
 
01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
aquaculture industry
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea of how much food
 
01:39:32.689 --> 01:39:32.699 align:start position:0%
that they are feeding to the lobsters I
 
01:39:36.050 --> 01:39:36.060 align:start position:0%
heard Eric Anderson say that the lobster
 
01:39:37.970 --> 01:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
goes in and out of a trap maybe a
 
01:39:40.970 --> 01:39:40.980 align:start position:0%
thousand times in his lifetime and they
 
01:39:42.950 --> 01:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
they're waiting for these lobsters to
 
01:39:45.169 --> 01:39:45.179 align:start position:0%
reach the minimum size of three and a
 
01:39:48.229 --> 01:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
quarter inches before they can take them
 
01:39:52.370 --> 01:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
so probably or for instance in the state
 
01:39:55.010 --> 01:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
of Maine alone they caught 12 million
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
pounds of menhaven to feed lobsters
 
01:40:01.129 --> 01:40:01.139 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire caught about 5 million
 
01:40:03.950 --> 01:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
pounds of Manhattan to feed lobsters
 
01:40:06.910 --> 01:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
That's not including the
 
01:40:10.669 --> 01:40:10.679 align:start position:0%
2000 tons of Herring that are caught to
 
01:40:13.850 --> 01:40:13.860 align:start position:0%
feed lobsters every fish in the ocean is
 
01:40:16.370 --> 01:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
feeding off another fish or or creature
 
01:40:17.930 --> 01:40:17.940 align:start position:0%
out there
 
01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
we have to remember I think at the end
 
01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
of the day
 
01:40:23.390 --> 01:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
that these lobstermen are individual
 
01:40:26.030 --> 01:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
business owners and they're trying to
 
01:40:28.250 --> 01:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
make a living
 
01:40:31.370 --> 01:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
and they have an investment
 
01:40:33.890 --> 01:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
a lifelong investment in the
 
01:40:38.030 --> 01:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
sustainability of the lobster industry
 
01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:39.649 align:start position:0%
sustainability of the lobster industry
they

01:40:39.649 --> 01:40:39.659 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
abide by the laws they're as I said
 
01:40:45.290 --> 01:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
they're feeding the lobsters and also
 
01:40:47.030 --> 01:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
another thing that hasn't been mentioned
 
01:40:50.810 --> 01:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
that the lobstermen do is we have a
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
v-notch program where egg-bearing
 
01:40:57.770 --> 01:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
females the lobsters carry their eggs on
 
01:41:00.050 --> 01:41:00.060 align:start position:0%
the bottom of their tail for quite a
 
01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:02.159 align:start position:0%
length of time they have to put a
 
01:41:05.030 --> 01:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
v-notch in those lobsters and place them
 
01:41:07.970 --> 01:41:07.980 align:start position:0%
and they can't can't take them home so
 
01:41:10.610 --> 01:41:10.620 align:start position:0%
again their their investment is
 
01:41:13.010 --> 01:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
substantial and I think that we should
 
01:41:16.610 --> 01:41:16.620 align:start position:0%
be very aware of the things that we do
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
that affect their livelihood I'm not
 
01:41:21.530 --> 01:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
going to get into the second part of
 
01:41:24.110 --> 01:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
this non-germanum amendment talking
 
01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:26.209 align:start position:0%
this non-germanum amendment talking
about

01:41:26.209 --> 01:41:26.219 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:41:28.669 --> 01:41:28.679 align:start position:0%
keeping track of what's going on on the
 
01:41:32.330 --> 01:41:32.340 align:start position:0%
bottom and whatever basically we don't
 
01:41:36.189 --> 01:41:36.199 align:start position:0%
need divers catching lobsters
 
01:41:38.330 --> 01:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
I compare
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
some of us might say that lobstering is
 
01:41:44.689 --> 01:41:44.699 align:start position:0%
a natural is a resource public resource
 
01:41:48.590 --> 01:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
and it is but for you people 75 percent
 
01:41:52.370 --> 01:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
of you maybe more are really divorced
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
from the Seacoast but how would you
 
01:41:56.810 --> 01:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
think if you were living up in Colebrook
 
01:41:59.750 --> 01:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
or in Ossipee or wherever and you were
 
01:42:02.629 --> 01:42:02.639 align:start position:0%
nurturing a forest and someone comes in
 
01:42:04.430 --> 01:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
and says I want to start cutting down
 
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
some trees and take them home with me
 
01:42:09.290 --> 01:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
are you planting a garden
 
01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
and someone after all the work that
 
01:42:14.810 --> 01:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
you've done wants to come in
 
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
and pick your crop
 
01:42:20.209 --> 01:42:20.219 align:start position:0%
these people
 
01:42:23.689 --> 01:42:23.699 align:start position:0%
as I've seen in the past few years are
 
01:42:25.729 --> 01:42:25.739 align:start position:0%
having more difficulties a greater
 
01:42:28.430 --> 01:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
difficulties in making a living
 
01:42:30.890 --> 01:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
one of our fellow Commissioners from the
 
01:42:32.330 --> 01:42:32.340 align:start position:0%
state of Maine
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
said that he's diversifying out of the
 
01:42:38.090 --> 01:42:38.100 align:start position:0%
lobster industry lifelong fishermen he's
 
01:42:40.850 --> 01:42:40.860 align:start position:0%
growing kelp now
 
01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
in the winter Lobster and used to catch
 
01:42:45.709 --> 01:42:45.719 align:start position:0%
northern shrimp you know the shrimp you
 
01:42:47.629 --> 01:42:47.639 align:start position:0%
used to buy on the roadside or whatever
 
01:42:50.450 --> 01:42:50.460 align:start position:0%
you won't find them now because we
 
01:42:52.189 --> 01:42:52.199 align:start position:0%
Atlantic states have declared a
 
01:42:56.209 --> 01:42:56.219 align:start position:0%
moratorium for the past nine years or so
 
01:42:58.970 --> 01:42:58.980 align:start position:0%
so again they're being buffeted by so
 
01:43:01.550 --> 01:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
many things the right whale issue is
 
01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
such a big thing
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
you know that's going to cause the
 
01:43:07.970 --> 01:43:07.980 align:start position:0%
ropeless fishing uh possibility of
 
01:43:07.980 --> 01:43:09.590 align:start position:0%
ropeless fishing uh possibility of
seasonal

01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
seasonal
 
01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:10.970 align:start position:0%
seasonal
fishing

01:43:10.970 --> 01:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
fishing
 
01:43:13.070 --> 01:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
I've probably taken more of your time
 
01:43:16.129 --> 01:43:16.139 align:start position:0%
than I should but however I'd ask you
 
01:43:19.609 --> 01:43:19.619 align:start position:0%
this is a non-partisan issue
 
01:43:22.490 --> 01:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
the issue here today is the well-being
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
of the lobster industry
 
01:43:27.290 --> 01:43:27.300 align:start position:0%
so I ask you to respect the lobsterman
 
01:43:30.350 --> 01:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
and the long-standing tradition of
 
01:43:32.330 --> 01:43:32.340 align:start position:0%
lobster fishing
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
show your respect for the independent
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
businessmen that they are go and shake
 
01:43:39.770 --> 01:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
their calloused hands that have worked
 
01:43:42.169 --> 01:43:42.179 align:start position:0%
on the water all these years
 
01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
do not change the method of taking do
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
not add another nail to that coffin
 
01:43:49.790 --> 01:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
and I
 
01:43:51.890 --> 01:43:51.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for your attention
 
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
and I'll take any any questions that you
 
01:43:56.930 --> 01:43:56.940 align:start position:0%
have and if you ask me questions I could
 
01:43:59.149 --> 01:43:59.159 align:start position:0%
be here all all day but I welcome your
 
01:44:02.209 --> 01:44:02.219 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you hopefully
 
01:44:03.950 --> 01:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
we're not here all day
 
01:44:08.270 --> 01:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:10.490 --> 01:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you Mr
 
01:44:10.500 --> 01:44:11.870 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you Mr
chairman

01:44:11.870 --> 01:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question so
 
01:44:15.410 --> 01:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
you made a statement that you deny that
 
01:44:20.030 --> 01:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
10 of traps are lost uh to the Sea could
 
01:44:22.010 --> 01:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
you then tell me where the thousands
 
01:44:23.629 --> 01:44:23.639 align:start position:0%
upon thousands of traps that are
 
01:44:25.370 --> 01:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
discovered underwater where they come
 
01:44:25.380 --> 01:44:26.930 align:start position:0%
discovered underwater where they come
from

01:44:26.930 --> 01:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:44:30.830 --> 01:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
I will grant you that a lot of traps do
 
01:44:32.930 --> 01:44:32.940 align:start position:0%
end up in the bottom of the ocean for
 
01:44:36.109 --> 01:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
various reasons I think that here in New
 
01:44:38.810 --> 01:44:38.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they have a coastal cleanup to
 
01:44:42.770 --> 01:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
pick up lobster traps that are
 
01:44:45.050 --> 01:44:45.060 align:start position:0%
that are lost through the course of a
 
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
winter hurricanes and the like again
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
that Lobster fisherman that uh I
 
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned he's from
 
01:44:57.590 --> 01:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
fishes out of Portland Harbor I think
 
01:45:00.669 --> 01:45:00.679 align:start position:0%
that last year he was part of a program
 
01:45:04.129 --> 01:45:04.139 align:start position:0%
where they went out looking for lobster
 
01:45:07.010 --> 01:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
traps and I think he pulled up a ball of
 
01:45:09.290 --> 01:45:09.300 align:start position:0%
traps that was so big they actually had
 
01:45:11.810 --> 01:45:11.820 align:start position:0%
to get a crane to lift them all out of
 
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
the water but again if you look if Maine
 
01:45:18.830 --> 01:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
is fishing two million traps do you
 
01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
think that they're losing 200 000 traps
 
01:45:24.770 --> 01:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
a year and multiplying that over a
 
01:45:27.229 --> 01:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
period of 10 years do you think that
 
01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
it's probably you know two million traps
 
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
on the bottom there is a lot of traps
 
01:45:36.410 --> 01:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
and you know that's an issue but that's
 
01:45:39.709 --> 01:45:39.719 align:start position:0%
entirely separate from divers wanting to
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
go diving which is supposed to be this
 
01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
subject of the bill
 
01:45:47.590 --> 01:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
the lobstermen don't want to lose traps
 
01:45:49.689 --> 01:45:49.699 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
01:45:52.910 --> 01:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
testifiers told you that a trap sitting
 
01:45:55.370 --> 01:45:55.380 align:start position:0%
on the bottom of the water represents a
 
01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifty dollars
 
01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of them fished 10 trap trawls in
 
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
some areas maybe more maybe less
 
01:46:05.870 --> 01:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
depending on situations do you think
 
01:46:09.229 --> 01:46:09.239 align:start position:0%
they're interested in losing fifteen
 
01:46:11.810 --> 01:46:11.820 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars they grapple for the
 
01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
traps if they know where their traps are
 
01:46:15.890 --> 01:46:15.900 align:start position:0%
they I would guess that each of these
 
01:46:18.530 --> 01:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
Lobster probably has a grapple hook on
 
01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
their boat and they can do their best to
 
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
recover it because they don't want to
 
01:46:27.470 --> 01:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:31.790 --> 01:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
thank you uh yes representative Brown
 
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
can you clarify sorry thank you Mr chair
 
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:46:38.930 --> 01:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
can you clarify what you said about
 
01:46:42.350 --> 01:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
um some locating devices that a law that
 
01:46:44.689 --> 01:46:44.699 align:start position:0%
has requiring locating devices and what
 
01:46:46.970 --> 01:46:46.980 align:start position:0%
the cost of that is and just give it yes
 
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
that was a recent addendum to one of our
 
01:46:52.790 --> 01:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
management plans it's in the process of
 
01:46:55.070 --> 01:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
being enacted right now
 
01:46:57.229 --> 01:46:57.239 align:start position:0%
it's going to be funded by NOAA
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
Fisheries to initially
 
01:47:03.430 --> 01:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
Supply The
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
Trackers to the boats
 
01:47:09.290 --> 01:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
and they can look
 
01:47:12.109 --> 01:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
they can look that ties into your cell
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
phone through the internet and they can
 
01:47:16.609 --> 01:47:16.619 align:start position:0%
actually track
 
01:47:20.030 --> 01:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
where your boat's going and in time they
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
can see that your boat is stationary for
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
a length of time and they can
 
01:47:28.430 --> 01:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
see that you're hauling traps the reason
 
01:47:31.790 --> 01:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
for that partial in large part is to
 
01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
show where the fishing activity is
 
01:47:37.149 --> 01:47:37.159 align:start position:0%
there's an awful lot of fishing activity
 
01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
offshore and this is intended again it's
 
01:47:43.129 --> 01:47:43.139 align:start position:0%
only those that are holding Federal
 
01:47:46.430 --> 01:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
permits that are going to be required to
 
01:47:49.090 --> 01:47:49.100 align:start position:0%
have trackers aboard and I will say
 
01:47:52.850 --> 01:47:52.860 align:start position:0%
initially and I voted against having
 
01:47:52.860 --> 01:47:53.750 align:start position:0%
initially and I voted against having
them

01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:47:56.090 --> 01:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
have trackers on their boat because I
 
01:47:59.270 --> 01:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
felt it was an infringement on their
 
01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:00.649 align:start position:0%
felt it was an infringement on their
privacy

01:48:00.649 --> 01:48:00.659 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
01:48:03.050 --> 01:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
and whatever and whatever I didn't think
 
01:48:05.390 --> 01:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
that we should be doing it because those
 
01:48:08.090 --> 01:48:08.100 align:start position:0%
trackers are working all the time that
 
01:48:10.910 --> 01:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
you can't shut them off so if even if
 
01:48:13.189 --> 01:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
they're in state waters state waters
 
01:48:15.890 --> 01:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
being within three miles of the shore
 
01:48:19.310 --> 01:48:19.320 align:start position:0%
federal waters are three miles out
 
01:48:22.189 --> 01:48:22.199 align:start position:0%
but everywhere they're going you know
 
01:48:24.649 --> 01:48:24.659 align:start position:0%
big brother can be tracking them so
 
01:48:24.659 --> 01:48:26.510 align:start position:0%
big brother can be tracking them so
whatever

01:48:26.510 --> 01:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:48:29.209 --> 01:48:29.219 align:start position:0%
and again as I said that's being paid
 
01:48:32.510 --> 01:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
for by the federal government at this
 
01:48:35.689 --> 01:48:35.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:37.850 --> 01:48:37.860 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you
 
01:48:39.530 --> 01:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
so to be clear that's for tracking
 
01:48:43.070 --> 01:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
vessel location not Lobster Pot location
 
01:48:45.950 --> 01:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
no but you can deduce from that if a
 
01:48:49.129 --> 01:48:49.139 align:start position:0%
boat is stationary in one location you
 
01:48:52.669 --> 01:48:52.679 align:start position:0%
know moving from one area transiting an
 
01:48:54.350 --> 01:48:54.360 align:start position:0%
area you can see they're not fishing
 
01:48:56.750 --> 01:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
there but that will also you know have
 
01:48:59.629 --> 01:48:59.639 align:start position:0%
the benefit of showing where lobster
 
01:49:01.990 --> 01:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
fishing is occurring and where lobsters
 
01:49:03.890 --> 01:49:03.900 align:start position:0%
lobsters are
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
but there are is another gentleman said
 
01:49:09.410 --> 01:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
there are so so many rules that they
 
01:49:12.530 --> 01:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
have to comply with and a further Point
 
01:49:15.770 --> 01:49:15.780 align:start position:0%
let me make one last point if I may
 
01:49:19.250 --> 01:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
back in 1997 when I started on this
 
01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:20.390 align:start position:0%
back in 1997 when I started on this
committee

01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:49:22.370 --> 01:49:22.380 align:start position:0%
there was a fellow again the committee
 
01:49:25.669 --> 01:49:25.679 align:start position:0%
room was set up a bit differently and in
 
01:49:29.450 --> 01:49:29.460 align:start position:0%
the back corner here sat a fellow from
 
01:49:32.030 --> 01:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
London not Londonderry Litchfield I
 
01:49:34.850 --> 01:49:34.860 align:start position:0%
believe his name was Bill bushy
 
01:49:37.129 --> 01:49:37.139 align:start position:0%
and he was in a wheelchair he'd been in
 
01:49:39.530 --> 01:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
a wheelchair since the Korean War
 
01:49:42.290 --> 01:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
he was a republican on the other side of
 
01:49:44.450 --> 01:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
the aisle for me but I viewed him as a
 
01:49:47.030 --> 01:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
mentor when I had questions about what
 
01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
was going on here I went to Bill
 
01:49:53.450 --> 01:49:53.460 align:start position:0%
and bill says always be careful of
 
01:49:55.450 --> 01:49:55.460 align:start position:0%
granting the fish and game department
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
rule-making Authority because once you
 
01:50:01.070 --> 01:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
grant them rule-making Authority they
 
01:50:04.850 --> 01:50:04.860 align:start position:0%
then have the ability to make rules
 
01:50:08.350 --> 01:50:08.360 align:start position:0%
after you made a law so he was always
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
suspicious I'm not suspicious
 
01:50:14.090 --> 01:50:14.100 align:start position:0%
individually of the colonel back here or
 
01:50:17.209 --> 01:50:17.219 align:start position:0%
Cherie Patterson but you don't know who
 
01:50:18.830 --> 01:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
they're responsible to they're
 
01:50:22.129 --> 01:50:22.139 align:start position:0%
responsible to 11 other politicians the
 
01:50:23.330 --> 01:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
Commissioners Fish and Game
 
01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and appointed director so
 
01:50:28.609 --> 01:50:28.619 align:start position:0%
be careful of granting rule making
 
01:50:28.619 --> 01:50:32.209 align:start position:0%
be careful of granting rule making
Authority

01:50:32.209 --> 01:50:32.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:35.390 --> 01:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative Khan you can
 
01:50:37.070 --> 01:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
ask your question
 
01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:50:41.149 --> 01:50:41.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:50:43.910 --> 01:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that a lobster you know
 
01:50:46.729 --> 01:50:46.739 align:start position:0%
juvenile Lobster goes in and out of the
 
01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
trap a thousand times you know
 
01:50:53.629 --> 01:50:53.639 align:start position:0%
many many times and our fishermens are
 
01:50:56.090 --> 01:50:56.100 align:start position:0%
feeding them and those
 
01:50:59.330 --> 01:50:59.340 align:start position:0%
feeds are not cheap those are expensive
 
01:51:01.250 --> 01:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
you know feeds you know those fishes
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
that you put on the Trap the food
 
01:51:08.810 --> 01:51:08.820 align:start position:0%
and you saying that our fishermen are
 
01:51:10.910 --> 01:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
giving them food and everything making
 
01:51:14.090 --> 01:51:14.100 align:start position:0%
you know helping them grow and somebody
 
01:51:16.669 --> 01:51:16.679 align:start position:0%
else is going to come to catch them are
 
01:51:18.350 --> 01:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
you saying that can you elaborate a
 
01:51:19.450 --> 01:51:19.460 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
01:51:21.530 --> 01:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
elaborate on that
 
01:51:23.629 --> 01:51:23.639 align:start position:0%
well it's very simple
 
01:51:26.930 --> 01:51:26.940 align:start position:0%
a lobsterman is feeding those those
 
01:51:29.689 --> 01:51:29.699 align:start position:0%
Lobster a lob cement is feeding those
 
01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
lobsters with principally men Hayden and
 
01:51:36.229 --> 01:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
and that's what they're eating and
 
01:51:39.590 --> 01:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
that's what they're
 
01:51:41.390 --> 01:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
they're living off
 
01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
I would say because of the proliferation
 
01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
of number of traps out there in bait
 
01:51:49.550 --> 01:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
provided that's contributing to the
 
01:51:52.370 --> 01:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
health of the resource
 
01:51:55.250 --> 01:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
if that answers your question thank you
 
01:51:59.390 --> 01:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:01.129 --> 01:52:01.139 align:start position:0%

01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
proposing a recreational license
 
01:53:06.229 --> 01:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
recreational license for New Hampshire
 
01:53:08.209 --> 01:53:08.219 align:start position:0%
resident scuba divers to take Lobsters
 
01:53:11.450 --> 01:53:11.460 align:start position:0%
by hand and to free animals trapped in
 
01:53:13.930 --> 01:53:13.940 align:start position:0%
abandoned lobster traps
 
01:53:17.390 --> 01:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
before I go through this I just want to
 
01:53:19.669 --> 01:53:19.679 align:start position:0%
say first and foremost that the
 
01:53:23.689 --> 01:53:23.699 align:start position:0%
education and the history that I've
 
01:53:26.629 --> 01:53:26.639 align:start position:0%
heard here this morning is just it's
 
01:53:30.169 --> 01:53:30.179 align:start position:0%
just blows my mind it's amazing I and I
 
01:53:32.090 --> 01:53:32.100 align:start position:0%
respect these lobstermen these guys work
 
01:53:34.370 --> 01:53:34.380 align:start position:0%
harder than me maybe I don't know I work
 
01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
hard I'm in the construction industry so
 
01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
you know we all work hard and
 
01:53:42.890 --> 01:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
I envy them I I would I would really
 
01:53:44.390 --> 01:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
love to you know get involved with that
 
01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
but I grew up in construction but I'm
 
01:53:48.410 --> 01:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
going to get back to the uh business at
 
01:53:48.420 --> 01:53:49.609 align:start position:0%
going to get back to the uh business at
hand

01:53:49.609 --> 01:53:49.619 align:start position:0%
hand
 
01:53:51.050 --> 01:53:51.060 align:start position:0%
um you know trying to describe scuba
 
01:53:52.850 --> 01:53:52.860 align:start position:0%
diving in words will always fall short
 
01:53:54.830 --> 01:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
of the actual experience
 
01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
it is very physically demanding and even
 
01:53:58.790 --> 01:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
more mentally challenging than most

most who try don't follow through with
 
01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
this as a regular activity diving isn't
 
01:54:07.550 --> 01:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
for everybody it's an there are inherent
 
01:54:09.770 --> 01:54:09.780 align:start position:0%
risks and potential hazards they're far
 
01:54:11.890 --> 01:54:11.900 align:start position:0%
too numerous to talk about
 
01:54:14.209 --> 01:54:14.219 align:start position:0%
and they could take any of our lives at
 
01:54:16.490 --> 01:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
any time if you were to ask even the
 
01:54:18.050 --> 01:54:18.060 align:start position:0%
experienced divers many will quickly
 
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
tell you that diving in New Hampshire
 
01:54:22.129 --> 01:54:22.139 align:start position:0%
sucks all right the water's cold the
 
01:54:25.070 --> 01:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
visibility is awful the variables are
 
01:54:27.290 --> 01:54:27.300 align:start position:0%
numerous and dangerous and most of the
 
01:54:29.930 --> 01:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
time unexpected quite honestly it can be
 
01:54:31.550 --> 01:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
very scary at times for even the

01:54:41.149 --> 01:54:41.159 align:start position:0%
be at the front of your mind and only
 
01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
then may you consider the task at hand
 
01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
whether it be recovery repair

the water began around 2004 after a
 
01:54:54.770 --> 01:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
certification course I got for a
 
01:54:57.109 --> 01:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
birthday gift I found being in the
 
01:54:58.850 --> 01:54:58.860 align:start position:0%
underwater environment was more than
 
01:55:00.649 --> 01:55:00.659 align:start position:0%
exhilarating the fish the Rocks the
 
01:55:02.510 --> 01:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
caves the silence it was a spiritual
 
01:55:04.790 --> 01:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
awakening for me to A Whole New World I
 
01:55:06.770 --> 01:55:06.780 align:start position:0%
loved it and I wanted to keep seeing
 
01:55:08.930 --> 01:55:08.940 align:start position:0%
more I've always loved nature Hunting

it was a spirit it was it's
 
01:55:21.109 --> 01:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry but it blows my mind that it's
 
01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
against the law to free an entrapped
 
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
creature from certain death in an
 
01:55:27.709 --> 01:55:27.719 align:start position:0%
abandoned trap and there are piles of
 
01:55:29.810 --> 01:55:29.820 align:start position:0%
them and thousands in this video and

01:55:40.729 --> 01:55:40.739 align:start position:0%
or that it's against the law or even to
 
01:55:43.250 --> 01:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
even identify the Lost gear for the men
 
01:55:46.910 --> 01:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
to put a buoyah on it you know I the
 
01:55:48.649 --> 01:55:48.659 align:start position:0%
videos and the testimony today you know
 
01:55:50.689 --> 01:55:50.699 align:start position:0%
that are available demonstrate just a
 
01:55:53.689 --> 01:55:53.699 align:start position:0%
small fraction a small small fraction of

the Carnage that's been ignored for
 
01:55:56.750 --> 01:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
decades yes there there's certain
 
01:55:58.729 --> 01:55:58.739 align:start position:0%
retrieval programs but they'll never get
 
01:56:00.709 --> 01:56:00.719 align:start position:0%
it all you can if you're not seeing it
 
01:56:02.629 --> 01:56:02.639 align:start position:0%
you're not going to drag you can't the
 
01:56:04.970 --> 01:56:04.980 align:start position:0%
hooks don't have eyes

01:56:10.189 --> 01:56:10.199 align:start position:0%
you know what hard per hardworking tax
 
01:56:12.709 --> 01:56:12.719 align:start position:0%
paying Sportsman or woman wouldn't want
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
to help their fellows recover the tools
 
01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
of their trade their livelihoods while
 
01:56:19.430 --> 01:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
improving the natural environment we're
 
01:56:21.590 --> 01:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
there to improve we're not there to you
 
01:56:23.750 --> 01:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
know the opposition of this bill can
 
01:56:25.790 --> 01:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
only be based on unwarranted paranoia we
 
01:56:26.990 --> 01:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
want to help
 
01:56:28.490 --> 01:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
we aren't here looking to be Good
 
01:56:29.930 --> 01:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
Samaritans we don't we're not looking
 
01:56:31.729 --> 01:56:31.739 align:start position:0%
for a pat on the back we love diving we
 
01:56:33.770 --> 01:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
love the ocean
 
01:56:35.450 --> 01:56:35.460 align:start position:0%
but seeing the amounts of entangled
 
01:56:37.250 --> 01:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
traps is beyond disturbing these traps
 
01:56:40.430 --> 01:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
can and will perpetually kill why well
 
01:56:42.709 --> 01:56:42.719 align:start position:0%
obviously a trap that is not retrievable
 
01:56:45.649 --> 01:56:45.659 align:start position:0%
its lobsters die guess what the dead
 
01:56:46.790 --> 01:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
Lobster has just become a
 
01:56:49.370 --> 01:56:49.380 align:start position:0%
self-perpetuating bait the owner of the
 
01:56:51.470 --> 01:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
gear can't retrieve it then they are in
 
01:56:53.750 --> 01:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
turn hurt financially the environmental
 
01:56:56.270 --> 01:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
damage continues to compound that's why
 
01:56:58.189 --> 01:56:58.199 align:start position:0%
we're here not just because we would
 
01:56:59.870 --> 01:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
like to take a few lobsters we're
 
01:57:02.890 --> 01:57:02.900 align:start position:0%
talking about a hundred permits you know
 
01:57:05.570 --> 01:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
so small and you know a small amount of
 
01:57:10.910 --> 01:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:13.609 --> 01:57:13.619 align:start position:0%
divers don't need traps to harvest by
 
01:57:16.189 --> 01:57:16.199 align:start position:0%
hand safely
 
01:57:17.990 --> 01:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
divers won't drag traps across the
 
01:57:19.970 --> 01:57:19.980 align:start position:0%
bottom or pull rocks across the bottom
 
01:57:22.490 --> 01:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
drivers won't bring smaller egg-bearing
 
01:57:24.229 --> 01:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
lapses for the surface stressing them
 
01:57:25.850 --> 01:57:25.860 align:start position:0%
out and exposing them as an easy target
 
01:57:27.970 --> 01:57:27.980 align:start position:0%
to other Predators on their way down
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
divers can save lives of unintended
 
01:57:33.770 --> 01:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
bycatch divers can Mark gear divers can
 
01:57:36.470 --> 01:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
improve the habitat that was canned and
 
01:57:38.689 --> 01:57:38.699 align:start position:0%
want to work with fishermen this is a
 
01:57:41.689 --> 01:57:41.699 align:start position:0%
good build this isn't a bad Bill
 
01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
we have way too much time money training
 
01:57:46.430 --> 01:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
and respect for the environment we love
 
01:57:48.890 --> 01:57:48.900 align:start position:0%
and want to conserve
 
01:57:51.290 --> 01:57:51.300 align:start position:0%
we don't want to steal your lobsters
 
01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
help us help you
 
01:57:56.149 --> 01:57:56.159 align:start position:0%
and that's pretty much all I've got any
 
01:57:58.729 --> 01:57:58.739 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir he's open to
 
01:58:02.450 --> 01:58:02.460 align:start position:0%

German Rockingham 40 super Hampton
 
01:58:34.129 --> 01:58:34.139 align:start position:0%
I've actually represented Seabrook
 
01:58:35.810 --> 01:58:35.820 align:start position:0%
it's my third term representative
 
01:58:40.250 --> 01:58:40.260 align:start position:0%
Seabrook I've represented District
 
01:58:43.250 --> 01:58:43.260 align:start position:0%

01:58:49.729 --> 01:58:49.739 align:start position:0%
re-configuring of all the districts
 
01:58:49.739 --> 01:58:51.050 align:start position:0%
re-configuring of all the districts
um

01:58:51.050 --> 01:58:51.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
I I do want to say that my history in
 
01:58:56.030 --> 01:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
the town of Seabrook
 
01:58:57.950 --> 01:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
my family's been there since before it
 
01:58:59.510 --> 01:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
was a town they've been here since
 
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
before it was the province of New
 
01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:03.350 align:start position:0%
before it was the province of New
Hampshire

01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:59:06.229 --> 01:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
so my family came here from the Isle of
 
01:59:10.550 --> 01:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
Jersey via Nova Scotia as fishermen
 
01:59:14.629 --> 01:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
and so I signed on as a co-sponsor of
 
01:59:16.790 --> 01:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
the original underlying bill for a
 
01:59:18.290 --> 01:59:18.300 align:start position:0%
couple reasons I'll get to that in a few
 
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
moments but it may be very interesting
 
01:59:24.050 --> 01:59:24.060 align:start position:0%
to you that a co-sponsor of the original
 
01:59:27.169 --> 01:59:27.179 align:start position:0%
bill is against the amendment and now
 
01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
against the bill underlying
 
01:59:32.930 --> 01:59:32.940 align:start position:0%
I'll explain why one of the things that
 
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
a state representative as you know has
 
01:59:38.030 --> 01:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
the ability to do is to be named to a
 
01:59:39.950 --> 01:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
commission by the speaker of the house
 
01:59:45.490 --> 01:59:45.500 align:start position:0%
so the Speaker of the House in 2017 2019
 
01:59:47.629 --> 01:59:47.639 align:start position:0%
appointed me to the Coastal Marine

01:59:51.370 --> 01:59:51.380 align:start position:0%

we have dread everybody dreads them
 
02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
and the aquaculture industry has a
 
02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
second representative on that commission
 
02:01:05.270 --> 02:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's very interesting to note that this
 
02:01:08.270 --> 02:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
legislation was not recommended
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
and was not given to you by that
 
02:01:13.370 --> 02:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
commission that commission is put in
 
02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
place to track where things are I can
 
02:01:18.350 --> 02:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
tell you two years ago three years ago
 
02:01:18.360 --> 02:01:19.430 align:start position:0%
tell you two years ago three years ago
now

02:01:19.430 --> 02:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:01:22.490 --> 02:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
that we had this conversation about this
 
02:01:26.149 --> 02:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
bill and and the amendment that you're
 
02:01:29.510 --> 02:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
seeing here about tracking down Lost
 
02:01:32.030 --> 02:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
Lobster pots
 
02:01:35.089 --> 02:01:35.099 align:start position:0%
um and and all those sorts of things we
 
02:01:38.030 --> 02:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
met with the industry they do have the
 
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
cleanup days they have a cleanup fund
 
02:01:42.290 --> 02:01:42.300 align:start position:0%
and they're correct they don't want to
 
02:01:45.290 --> 02:01:45.300 align:start position:0%
lose their their fishing gear out there
 
02:01:45.300 --> 02:01:47.149 align:start position:0%
lose their their fishing gear out there
so

02:01:47.149 --> 02:01:47.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:01:50.750 --> 02:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
this bill again is unnecessary
 
02:01:53.270 --> 02:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
we've already the question was asked by
 
02:01:55.010 --> 02:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
representative goalie you know how how
 
02:01:56.750 --> 02:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
are they going to geolocate where that
 
02:01:58.910 --> 02:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
trap is under the under the water they
 
02:01:58.920 --> 02:01:59.689 align:start position:0%
trap is under the under the water they
can't

02:01:59.689 --> 02:01:59.699 align:start position:0%
can't
 
02:02:01.490 --> 02:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
they can't
 
02:02:01.500 --> 02:02:02.330 align:start position:0%
they can't
um

02:02:02.330 --> 02:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:05.270 --> 02:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
if if the people that are scuba divers
 
02:02:07.310 --> 02:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
want to help the fishing industry
 
02:02:08.870 --> 02:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
go into business
 
02:02:10.609 --> 02:02:10.619 align:start position:0%
hire yourselves out to those Lobster
 
02:02:10.619 --> 02:02:11.689 align:start position:0%
hire yourselves out to those Lobster
fishermen

02:02:11.689 --> 02:02:11.699 align:start position:0%
fishermen
 
02:02:14.030 --> 02:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
and go out and find their traps
 
02:02:16.850 --> 02:02:16.860 align:start position:0%
so that they can go pick them up
 
02:02:18.589 --> 02:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
maybe they'll pay you with lobsters
 
02:02:21.470 --> 02:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
there's no need for this bill or the
 
02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:25.070 align:start position:0%
there's no need for this bill or the
amendment

02:02:25.070 --> 02:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:27.410 --> 02:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
02:02:30.350 --> 02:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative taking my question
 
02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative as you all know or some
 
02:02:41.149 --> 02:02:41.159 align:start position:0%
of them some of us do not know that the
 
02:02:42.589 --> 02:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
Seabrook Beach
 
02:02:45.109 --> 02:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
is owned by Seabrook taxpayers not the
 
02:02:46.970 --> 02:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
02:02:49.970 --> 02:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
and do you think that passing this bill
 
02:02:53.330 --> 02:02:53.340 align:start position:0%
is gonna clash with the town planning
 
02:02:53.340 --> 02:02:54.169 align:start position:0%
is gonna clash with the town planning
board

02:02:54.169 --> 02:02:54.179 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:02:56.030 --> 02:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
not only the Seabrook but all the
 
02:02:58.010 --> 02:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
coastal towns and cities that they're
 
02:03:00.229 --> 02:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
going to have new zoning
 
02:03:04.550 --> 02:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
for shops for diving you know shops or
 
02:03:06.350 --> 02:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
diving industry because they're good
 
02:03:08.330 --> 02:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
people they're they're good industry I
 
02:03:10.250 --> 02:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
have nothing against them
 
02:03:13.490 --> 02:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
but they can team up and they can have
 
02:03:15.890 --> 02:03:15.900 align:start position:0%
new Zoning for this that they're not you
 
02:03:18.050 --> 02:03:18.060 align:start position:0%
know towns and cities it's not going to
 
02:03:20.209 --> 02:03:20.219 align:start position:0%
be allowing
 
02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
well I will say this that uh presently
 
02:03:25.189 --> 02:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
into my knowledge in Hampton between
 
02:03:27.709 --> 02:03:27.719 align:start position:0%
Hampton Hampton Falls which doesn't have
 
02:03:31.010 --> 02:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
Beach but does have uh waterfront on the
 
02:03:33.470 --> 02:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
Harbor and Seabrook there are only two
 
02:03:36.129 --> 02:03:36.139 align:start position:0%
dive shops actually I take that back one
 
02:03:38.510 --> 02:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh the second one we're not a business
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
the first one had a fire and relocated
 
02:03:43.490 --> 02:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
to the second business so there's only
 
02:03:44.990 --> 02:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
one dive shop
 
02:03:48.169 --> 02:03:48.179 align:start position:0%
between Hampton and Seabrook so I I
 
02:03:50.930 --> 02:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
don't see this as a booming industry
 
02:03:52.729 --> 02:03:52.739 align:start position:0%
and just for the record I'm actually
 
02:03:56.089 --> 02:03:56.099 align:start position:0%
Paddy certified and and I actually scuba
 
02:03:58.430 --> 02:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
dive with boy scouts because I was a sea
 
02:04:00.470 --> 02:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
Scout okay okay so I'm not against
 
02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
divers I'm damn well not against our
 
02:04:05.990 --> 02:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
fishermen so thank you
 
02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:09.360 align:start position:0%

representing uh the New Hampshire Vision
 
02:04:56.330 --> 02:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
game department
 
02:05:00.410 --> 02:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
uh just as a note that the Fish and Game
 
02:05:04.370 --> 02:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
Commission has voted to oppose this bill
 
02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
in each version that we have been
 
02:05:10.310 --> 02:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
presented with
 
02:05:13.250 --> 02:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
as I have testified in the first hearing
 
02:05:15.530 --> 02:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
of this bill on January 30th then you
 
02:05:17.810 --> 02:05:17.820 align:start position:0%
may have received
 
02:05:20.050 --> 02:05:20.060 align:start position:0%
the written testimony
 
02:05:22.609 --> 02:05:22.619 align:start position:0%
the lobster commercial fishing industry
 
02:05:25.910 --> 02:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
is the largest fishing industry in New
 
02:05:30.229 --> 02:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it brings in a revenue of 34
 
02:05:30.239 --> 02:05:31.310 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it brings in a revenue of 34
million

02:05:31.310 --> 02:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:05:33.530 --> 02:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
dollars annually
 
02:05:36.229 --> 02:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
for the
 
02:05:39.350 --> 02:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
little over 300 commercial Harvesters
 
02:05:41.330 --> 02:05:41.340 align:start position:0%
that we have licensed
 
02:05:44.330 --> 02:05:44.340 align:start position:0%
if you look at the economy as a whole it
 
02:05:46.609 --> 02:05:46.619 align:start position:0%
likely is three to four times that
 
02:05:48.790 --> 02:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
amount or roughly
 
02:05:52.070 --> 02:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
102 to 136 million dollars
 
02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
as you've heard today this is a highly
 
02:05:57.229 --> 02:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
regular regulated Fishery
 
02:06:01.669 --> 02:06:01.679 align:start position:0%
it's regulated through
 
02:06:05.330 --> 02:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
collaborative efforts of the states that
 
02:06:07.450 --> 02:06:07.460 align:start position:0%
have American lobster
 
02:06:11.930 --> 02:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
and Fisheries that land American lobster
 
02:06:15.830 --> 02:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
and it this collaborative effort is as
 
02:06:17.629 --> 02:06:17.639 align:start position:0%
you've heard Dennis say through the
 
02:06:18.950 --> 02:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
Atlantic states marine fisheries
 
02:06:22.310 --> 02:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
commission and there is Lobster
 
02:06:26.770 --> 02:06:26.780 align:start position:0%
management plan that is constantly being
 
02:06:32.709 --> 02:06:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:37.070 --> 02:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
this current version of House Bill 442
 
02:06:39.470 --> 02:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
changes nothing that was emphasized
 
02:06:43.010 --> 02:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
during an earlier testimony for the four
 
02:06:47.570 --> 02:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:47.580 --> 02:06:49.129 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:06:49.129 --> 02:06:49.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:51.649 --> 02:06:51.659 align:start position:0%
to indicate a few on this particular
 
02:06:51.659 --> 02:06:52.910 align:start position:0%
to indicate a few on this particular
version

02:06:52.910 --> 02:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
version
 
02:06:55.089 --> 02:06:55.099 align:start position:0%
we we do have
 
02:06:59.870 --> 02:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
concerns about some unfunded mandates
 
02:07:03.649 --> 02:07:03.659 align:start position:0%
we have concerns about how the wording
 
02:07:05.689 --> 02:07:05.699 align:start position:0%
can be both nebulous and scope and
 
02:07:05.699 --> 02:07:07.370 align:start position:0%
can be both nebulous and scope and
confusing

02:07:07.370 --> 02:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
02:07:09.649 --> 02:07:09.659 align:start position:0%
on the intent
 
02:07:13.250 --> 02:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
and right now the department does not
 
02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
have resources to conduct unfunded
 
02:07:19.729 --> 02:07:19.739 align:start position:0%
mandates and we do see also
 
02:07:19.739 --> 02:07:21.229 align:start position:0%
mandates and we do see also
um

02:07:21.229 --> 02:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
with these mandates some unenforceable
 
02:07:24.480 --> 02:07:28.370 align:start position:0%
with these mandates some unenforceable
issues

02:07:28.370 --> 02:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:33.490 --> 02:07:33.500 align:start position:0%
I would like to go over some of these
 
02:07:37.070 --> 02:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
concerns in this current bill and I have
 
02:07:38.530 --> 02:07:38.540 align:start position:0%
line by line
 
02:07:41.629 --> 02:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
comments not line by line I should say
 
02:07:43.510 --> 02:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
there are some lines that I have
 
02:07:47.990 --> 02:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
comments on for example line one I mean
 
02:07:51.129 --> 02:07:51.139 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry page one line
 
02:07:54.169 --> 02:07:54.179 align:start position:0%
28 there's a phrase there that says
 
02:07:56.870 --> 02:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
unless a lower industry-wide limit is
 
02:07:56.880 --> 02:07:58.310 align:start position:0%
unless a lower industry-wide limit is
established

02:07:58.310 --> 02:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
established
 
02:08:01.189 --> 02:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
we're not sure what this means
 
02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
um who would initiate a lower
 
02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
industry-wide limit would it be the
 
02:08:06.890 --> 02:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
Atlantic states marine fisheries
 
02:08:06.900 --> 02:08:09.070 align:start position:0%
Atlantic states marine fisheries
Commission

02:08:09.070 --> 02:08:09.080 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
02:08:11.570 --> 02:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
that pretty much just

02:08:46.370 --> 02:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
this is confusing language as you've
 
02:08:47.570 --> 02:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
already heard
 
02:08:49.310 --> 02:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
it can mean

it can mean
that

02:08:50.750 --> 02:08:50.760 align:start position:0%

02:09:01.189 --> 02:09:01.199 align:start position:0%

can only fish within established diving
 
02:09:07.310 --> 02:09:07.320 align:start position:0%

02:09:09.649 --> 02:09:09.659 align:start position:0%

02:09:27.350 --> 02:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
well New Hampshire doesn't have any

authority over parking and water access
 
02:09:32.689 --> 02:09:32.699 align:start position:0%
outside of Fish and Game properties so
 
02:09:35.950 --> 02:09:35.960 align:start position:0%
does this mean that if a municipality
 
02:09:38.350 --> 02:09:38.360 align:start position:0%

02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:41.520 align:start position:0%

if those parameters change
 
02:09:47.810 --> 02:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
does fish and game need to change those
 
02:09:51.229 --> 02:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
zones and how quickly can that happen
 
02:09:53.709 --> 02:09:53.719 align:start position:0%
or would fish and game

areas that are frequented by divers
 
02:10:03.229 --> 02:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
these are just assumptions that are
 
02:10:06.410 --> 02:10:06.420 align:start position:0%

02:10:25.490 --> 02:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
mean that an individual that holds a

02:16:19.189 --> 02:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
in state waters those four licenses
 
02:16:21.410 --> 02:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
are for
 
02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
Harvest that occurs in federal waters
 
02:16:27.050 --> 02:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
and allowed to be landed in New
 
02:16:27.060 --> 02:16:29.629 align:start position:0%
and allowed to be landed in New
Hampshire

02:16:29.629 --> 02:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:32.690 --> 02:16:32.700 align:start position:0%
there is no license in this section that
 
02:16:34.370 --> 02:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
requires a person
 
02:16:36.889 --> 02:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
licensed Lobster by trap in New
 
02:16:40.250 --> 02:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to track location of traps
 
02:16:42.650 --> 02:16:42.660 align:start position:0%
essentially those that Harvest Lobster
 
02:16:44.810 --> 02:16:44.820 align:start position:0%
in federal waters are subjected to this
 
02:16:47.690 --> 02:16:47.700 align:start position:0%
proposed location tracking New Hampshire
 
02:16:50.389 --> 02:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
would not be able to enact enforce this
 
02:16:52.549 --> 02:16:52.559 align:start position:0%
in federal waters without complementary
 
02:16:55.009 --> 02:16:55.019 align:start position:0%
federal regulations
 
02:16:57.650 --> 02:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in here that would be
 
02:17:00.530 --> 02:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
tracking any Lobster gear that would be
 
02:17:04.370 --> 02:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:07.310 --> 02:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
there is no definition for normal
 
02:17:09.770 --> 02:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
fishing methods what what is normal
 
02:17:13.129 --> 02:17:13.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:16.310 --> 02:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
there's also a phrase in there that says
 
02:17:18.530 --> 02:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
shell the lobster industry shall make a
 
02:17:22.910 --> 02:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
good faith effort to retrieve traps
 
02:17:25.549 --> 02:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
how is that defined
 
02:17:28.990 --> 02:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:32.209 --> 02:17:32.219 align:start position:0%
violations of this section this would
 
02:17:34.730 --> 02:17:34.740 align:start position:0%
require Fish and Game verification that
 
02:17:37.549 --> 02:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
there was detached gear for longer than
 
02:17:43.790 --> 02:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:48.290 --> 02:17:48.300 align:start position:0%
page four lines eight and nine for traps
 
02:17:50.870 --> 02:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
that are attached and retrievable no
 
02:17:54.049 --> 02:17:54.059 align:start position:0%
person except the owner
 
02:17:58.190 --> 02:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
someone authorized by the owner Etc
 
02:18:00.410 --> 02:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
what does this mean and who decides
 
02:18:02.330 --> 02:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
whether they are attached and
 
02:18:05.750 --> 02:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
retrievable you've heard already about
 
02:18:08.929 --> 02:18:08.939 align:start position:0%
on demand or buoyless gear that is
 
02:18:11.530 --> 02:18:11.540 align:start position:0%
likely to be
 
02:18:14.750 --> 02:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
enacted into the lobster fishing
 
02:18:16.849 --> 02:18:16.859 align:start position:0%
industry in
 
02:18:19.790 --> 02:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
years to come
 
02:18:23.990 --> 02:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:26.810 --> 02:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
and there is currently testing being
 
02:18:30.049 --> 02:18:30.059 align:start position:0%
conducted in other states and will be
 
02:18:32.690 --> 02:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
conducted in New Hampshire with
 
02:18:37.009 --> 02:18:37.019 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:40.910 --> 02:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
also this may leave someone that is
 
02:18:43.849 --> 02:18:43.859 align:start position:0%
unlicensed to be able to pull gear in on
 
02:18:46.849 --> 02:18:46.859 align:start position:0%
a consistent basis
 
02:18:49.429 --> 02:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
this can allow people in a particular
 
02:18:52.610 --> 02:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
license category whether it be 100 600
 
02:18:55.310 --> 02:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
or 1200 trap license category to be able
 
02:18:57.849 --> 02:18:57.859 align:start position:0%
to fish more traps by allowing somebody
 
02:19:02.089 --> 02:19:02.099 align:start position:0%
they authorize to pull traps
 
02:19:04.310 --> 02:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
this becomes a loophole
 
02:19:06.830 --> 02:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
we already have a process for extreme
 
02:19:09.589 --> 02:19:09.599 align:start position:0%
situations that require letters letters
 
02:19:11.750 --> 02:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
of authorization to be possessed and
 
02:19:14.089 --> 02:19:14.099 align:start position:0%
notifications made
 
02:19:17.089 --> 02:19:17.099 align:start position:0%
for example if there is a lobster
 
02:19:19.370 --> 02:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
Harvester that has passed away and he
 
02:19:21.950 --> 02:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
has gear out in the water
 
02:19:24.969 --> 02:19:24.979 align:start position:0%
we have set up letters of authorization
 
02:19:28.549 --> 02:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
to allow other members of the fishing
 
02:19:31.310 --> 02:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
industry to go out and pull his gear
 
02:19:35.030 --> 02:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
we already have those set up
 
02:19:38.629 --> 02:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
page four lines 20 and 21 under no
 
02:19:42.049 --> 02:19:42.059 align:start position:0%
circumstance May the animals released be
 
02:19:42.059 --> 02:19:43.310 align:start position:0%
circumstance May the animals released be
kept

02:19:43.310 --> 02:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
kept
 
02:19:46.070 --> 02:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
how would this be enforceable
 
02:19:55.250 --> 02:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:58.010 --> 02:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
in conclusion we want to continue to
 
02:19:59.690 --> 02:19:59.700 align:start position:0%
emphasize that people concurrently
 
02:20:02.210 --> 02:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
Harvest lobsters recreationally in New
 
02:20:02.220 --> 02:20:03.530 align:start position:0%
Harvest lobsters recreationally in New
Hampshire

02:20:03.530 --> 02:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:20:06.770 --> 02:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
buy the five trap Lobster license and
 
02:20:08.510 --> 02:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
this is open to any New Hampshire
 
02:20:08.520 --> 02:20:10.190 align:start position:0%
this is open to any New Hampshire
resident

02:20:10.190 --> 02:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
resident
 
02:20:10.200 --> 02:20:11.690 align:start position:0%
resident
currently

02:20:11.690 --> 02:20:11.700 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:20:15.889 --> 02:20:15.899 align:start position:0%
there is no non-resident
 
02:20:15.899 --> 02:20:16.969 align:start position:0%
there is no non-resident
um

02:20:16.969 --> 02:20:16.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:19.070 --> 02:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
that are licensed in the state of New
 
02:20:22.810 --> 02:20:22.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's residents only that are
 
02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
licensed to fish in state waters
 
02:20:29.330 --> 02:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
this is because it's not that we don't
 
02:20:31.610 --> 02:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
have that license category
 
02:20:34.490 --> 02:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
but there is an exception within the
 
02:20:39.590 --> 02:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
rules regulations to indicate that if
 
02:20:43.010 --> 02:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
the non-residence state
 
02:20:47.090 --> 02:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
does not allow for the same category of
 
02:20:47.100 --> 02:20:48.349 align:start position:0%
does not allow for the same category of
Licensing

02:20:48.349 --> 02:20:48.359 align:start position:0%
Licensing
 
02:20:51.230 --> 02:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
then they cannot get a non-resident
 
02:20:51.240 --> 02:20:54.110 align:start position:0%
then they cannot get a non-resident
license

02:20:54.110 --> 02:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:57.290 --> 02:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
and there's no States from New Jersey up
 
02:20:59.210 --> 02:20:59.220 align:start position:0%
to Maine that have the same licensing
 
02:20:59.220 --> 02:21:00.889 align:start position:0%
to Maine that have the same licensing
categories

02:21:00.889 --> 02:21:00.899 align:start position:0%
categories
 
02:21:04.809 --> 02:21:04.819 align:start position:0%
so you'll find that for commercial
 
02:21:08.270 --> 02:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
licensees there will be no non-residents
 
02:21:10.309 --> 02:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
it would be residents only
 
02:21:13.510 --> 02:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
same with recreational there is no
 
02:21:16.070 --> 02:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
non-resident this is for New Hampshire
 
02:21:21.889 --> 02:21:21.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:25.130 --> 02:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
it allows a uniform enforcement
 
02:21:28.010 --> 02:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
opportunity when it comes to harvesting
 
02:21:30.469 --> 02:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
lobsters using traps while trying to
 
02:21:33.889 --> 02:21:33.899 align:start position:0%
provide balance access to the resource
 
02:21:36.469 --> 02:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
the state's advisory committee on marine
 
02:21:38.750 --> 02:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
fisheries also oppose continues to
 
02:21:41.330 --> 02:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
oppose this legislation Unfortunately
 
02:21:47.150 --> 02:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
they are unable to come today to testify
 
02:21:49.010 --> 02:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
I thank you for the opportunity to
 
02:21:51.050 --> 02:21:51.060 align:start position:0%

02:21:54.530 --> 02:21:54.540 align:start position:0%
the committee to vote House Bill 442 in
 
02:21:56.809 --> 02:21:56.819 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate and if you have
 
02:22:00.650 --> 02:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
any questions I would be happy to answer
 
02:22:02.630 --> 02:22:02.640 align:start position:0%

job for all of us thank you
 
02:22:23.450 --> 02:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
my question two-part question one is
 
02:22:26.090 --> 02:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
all the testimony you heard
 
02:22:29.389 --> 02:22:29.399 align:start position:0%
for last couple of hours do you have any
 
02:22:29.399 --> 02:22:30.730 align:start position:0%
for last couple of hours do you have any
desire

02:22:30.730 --> 02:22:30.740 align:start position:0%
desire
 
02:22:33.230 --> 02:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
disagreement on those testimony that do
 
02:22:34.910 --> 02:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
you disagree with any of those
 
02:22:37.130 --> 02:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
testimonies that we had from
 
02:22:40.190 --> 02:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill
 
02:22:42.650 --> 02:22:42.660 align:start position:0%
on the fishing industry
 
02:22:46.370 --> 02:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:46.380 --> 02:22:47.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:22:47.450 --> 02:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:50.830 --> 02:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
the last man should speak for themselves
 
02:22:53.929 --> 02:22:53.939 align:start position:0%
you know I could speak to
 
02:22:57.469 --> 02:22:57.479 align:start position:0%
um fisheries management aspects of
 
02:22:59.809 --> 02:22:59.819 align:start position:0%
lobster harvesting and some
 
02:23:02.570 --> 02:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
enforceability we have law enforcement
 
02:23:07.070 --> 02:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
here to provide testimony also if you
 
02:23:08.389 --> 02:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
have more
 
02:23:11.270 --> 02:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
specific enforcement questions
 
02:23:13.309 --> 02:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman follow-up
 
02:23:13.319 --> 02:23:14.630 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman follow-up
follow-up

02:23:14.630 --> 02:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:23:18.650 --> 02:23:18.660 align:start position:0%
so uh one of this testimony was uh
 
02:23:20.210 --> 02:23:20.220 align:start position:0%
I didn't know that you know it's
 
02:23:22.730 --> 02:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
eye-opening for me that the juvenile
 
02:23:25.670 --> 02:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
Lobster goes in and out many many times
 
02:23:28.429 --> 02:23:28.439 align:start position:0%
and the number was thousands of times in
 
02:23:32.389 --> 02:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
and out of trap and we know that those
 
02:23:38.090 --> 02:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
traps brings thousands of pounds of food
 
02:23:40.630 --> 02:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
under you know the ocean floor
 
02:23:43.429 --> 02:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
do you think that that is that that is
 
02:23:45.050 --> 02:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
the fact that you know that those
 
02:23:47.929 --> 02:23:47.939 align:start position:0%
juveniles gets bigger because of those
 
02:23:50.570 --> 02:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
food and the other food
 
02:23:52.790 --> 02:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
it's well understood that it's
 
02:23:55.790 --> 02:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
essentially an agriculture system there
 
02:23:59.270 --> 02:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
the the animals are being fed until they
 
02:24:01.910 --> 02:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
get to a particular size that allows
 
02:24:06.590 --> 02:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:09.770 --> 02:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:11.450 --> 02:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:24:14.929 --> 02:24:14.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:16.910 --> 02:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
the chair calls Graham Birch
 
02:24:19.790 --> 02:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
representing himself uh asked for 10
 
02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:20.809 align:start position:0%
representing himself uh asked for 10
minutes

02:24:20.809 --> 02:24:20.819 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
02:24:26.330 --> 02:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:35.210 --> 02:24:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:36.650 --> 02:24:36.660 align:start position:0%
if you want to hand that at the end
 
02:24:44.030 --> 02:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:14.349 --> 02:25:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:18.050 --> 02:25:18.060 align:start position:0%
so Mr chairman members of committee my
 
02:25:21.110 --> 02:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
name is Graham Butch I'm a 26-year
 
02:25:23.809 --> 02:25:23.819 align:start position:0%

company and in my leisure time I'm a
 
02:25:33.530 --> 02:25:33.540 align:start position:0%

Specialties in Merrimack New Hampshire
 
02:25:38.750 --> 02:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
where I enjoy introducing people of all
 
02:25:41.270 --> 02:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
ages to the sport of scuba diving and
 
02:25:43.849 --> 02:25:43.859 align:start position:0%
teaching them to safely enjoy and
 
02:25:46.670 --> 02:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
respect our Coastal environments please
 
02:25:48.290 --> 02:25:48.300 align:start position:0%
don't be intimidated by the large number
 
02:25:49.910 --> 02:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
of pages I've just given you all I don't
 
02:25:51.830 --> 02:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
intend to go through them all most of it
 
02:25:54.230 --> 02:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
is just for your reference
 
02:25:54.240 --> 02:25:55.309 align:start position:0%
is just for your reference
um

02:25:55.309 --> 02:25:55.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:58.010 --> 02:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
so I'm here today as a member of the New
 
02:26:00.230 --> 02:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire diving Community to express my
 
02:26:04.010 --> 02:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
support for Bill 442 I believe that this
 
02:26:07.190 --> 02:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
bill is a very reasonable proposal I
 
02:26:09.290 --> 02:26:09.300 align:start position:0%
think it respects the environment of the
 
02:26:11.210 --> 02:26:11.220 align:start position:0%
ocean the wildlife of the ocean and
 
02:26:13.010 --> 02:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
those that make their living from the
 
02:26:13.020 --> 02:26:14.389 align:start position:0%
those that make their living from the
ocean

02:26:14.389 --> 02:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
ocean
 
02:26:17.090 --> 02:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
you were gracious enough to hear my
 
02:26:18.950 --> 02:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
testimony at a hearing of this bill on
 
02:26:20.570 --> 02:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
January 31st of this year so I'm not
 
02:26:23.030 --> 02:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
going to bore you with a repeat of the
 
02:26:25.130 --> 02:26:25.140 align:start position:0%
same testimony but you will find that
 
02:26:27.590 --> 02:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
testimony attached at the very back of
 
02:26:29.990 --> 02:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
the packet that I just gave you for your
 
02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:34.190 align:start position:0%
the packet that I just gave you for your
reference

02:26:34.190 --> 02:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:36.830 --> 02:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
just before I start the three points I'd
 
02:26:38.710 --> 02:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
like to make I just want to address one
 
02:26:41.389 --> 02:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
point that was made earlier about uh you
 
02:26:45.410 --> 02:26:45.420 align:start position:0%
know how scuba divers might be
 
02:26:48.650 --> 02:26:48.660 align:start position:0%
um hunting for Lobsters by turning over
 
02:26:48.660 --> 02:26:50.570 align:start position:0%
um hunting for Lobsters by turning over
rocks

02:26:50.570 --> 02:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
rocks
 
02:26:53.570 --> 02:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
you've got to be there to see it
 
02:26:56.389 --> 02:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
and number one you can't just go turning
 
02:26:57.770 --> 02:26:57.780 align:start position:0%
over rocks while you're diving you're
 
02:26:59.809 --> 02:26:59.819 align:start position:0%
neutrally buoyant you have no purchase
 
02:27:01.550 --> 02:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that number two if you
 
02:27:03.110 --> 02:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
were to try and do that you're lifting
 
02:27:04.190 --> 02:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
The Rock
 
02:27:07.250 --> 02:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
lobsters underwater don't move like they
 
02:27:09.950 --> 02:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
do in Market Basket
 
02:27:13.070 --> 02:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
they don't crawl they they swim so that
 
02:27:15.410 --> 02:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
big lobster tail that you enjoy eating
 
02:27:18.110 --> 02:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
is a muscle that allows the lobster to
 
02:27:20.389 --> 02:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
propel itself backwards incredibly
 
02:27:23.990 --> 02:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
quickly you have zero chance as a diver
 
02:27:26.330 --> 02:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
of catching a lobster on the move like
 
02:27:28.429 --> 02:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
that so now you've got one hand lifting
 
02:27:30.889 --> 02:27:30.899 align:start position:0%
up a rock allegedly right the lobs has
 
02:27:32.330 --> 02:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
gone off and you're trying to catch this
 
02:27:34.010 --> 02:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
thing that's going at tremendous speed
 
02:27:37.910 --> 02:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
one-handed I'm sorry it's ludicrous
 
02:27:40.910 --> 02:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
and and on many counts so what I would
 
02:27:43.790 --> 02:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
like to say is uh I'd like to give the
 
02:27:46.910 --> 02:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity for anybody on a committee
 
02:27:49.010 --> 02:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
or any of Fish and Game who are
 
02:27:50.870 --> 02:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
certified divers I'd love to take you
 
02:27:53.870 --> 02:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
out and show you how it's done
 
02:27:56.570 --> 02:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I can't
 
02:27:58.969 --> 02:27:58.979 align:start position:0%
because I'm in New Hampshire
 
02:28:01.190 --> 02:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
and it would be illegal
 
02:28:03.110 --> 02:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
but if you would like to see it done I'm
 
02:28:04.490 --> 02:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
sure I could hook you up with one of my
 
02:28:08.090 --> 02:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts bodies and uh they'd be
 
02:28:09.770 --> 02:28:09.780 align:start position:0%
happy to take you out and show you
 
02:28:12.349 --> 02:28:12.359 align:start position:0%
exactly how it's done and uh how very
 
02:28:14.510 --> 02:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
little disturbance there is to the
 
02:28:16.610 --> 02:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
underwater environment which we respect
 
02:28:16.620 --> 02:28:18.650 align:start position:0%
underwater environment which we respect
deeply

02:28:18.650 --> 02:28:18.660 align:start position:0%
deeply
 
02:28:21.469 --> 02:28:21.479 align:start position:0%
so on to my uh my testimony I have three
 
02:28:21.479 --> 02:28:23.030 align:start position:0%
so on to my uh my testimony I have three
points

02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
points
 
02:28:24.950 --> 02:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
Point number one uh there was a question
 
02:28:26.750 --> 02:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
in the last hearing about which Atlantic
 
02:28:29.389 --> 02:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
states allow diving for lobsters so I
 
02:28:31.370 --> 02:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
spent an inordinate amount of time
 
02:28:32.929 --> 02:28:32.939 align:start position:0%
trying to research this on the internet
 
02:28:34.570 --> 02:28:34.580 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you for sure
 
02:28:37.270 --> 02:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Rhode Island Connecticut
 
02:28:40.370 --> 02:28:40.380 align:start position:0%
New York New Jersey Delaware Maryland
 
02:28:42.770 --> 02:28:42.780 align:start position:0%
Virginia and then you know what it kind
 
02:28:44.270 --> 02:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
of Peters off a little bit into states
 
02:28:45.530 --> 02:28:45.540 align:start position:0%
that really don't care that much because
 
02:28:46.610 --> 02:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
they don't seem to have that many
 
02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
lobsters as you get further south until
 
02:28:50.929 --> 02:28:50.939 align:start position:0%
you hit Florida
 
02:28:52.610 --> 02:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
but they don't have real lobsters down
 
02:28:58.010 --> 02:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:01.010 --> 02:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:02.929 --> 02:29:02.939 align:start position:0%
in the last hearing I heard
 
02:29:05.510 --> 02:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
one com one conservation officer said
 
02:29:06.889 --> 02:29:06.899 align:start position:0%
that it was his understanding that
 
02:29:08.990 --> 02:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts would end their scuba
 
02:29:11.870 --> 02:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
diving program if given the chance like
 
02:29:15.230 --> 02:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
this is just so contrary to what I'm
 
02:29:17.210 --> 02:29:17.220 align:start position:0%
hearing from other Massachusetts divers
 
02:29:19.790 --> 02:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
that I I want to do some research I call
 
02:29:22.610 --> 02:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
it the Massachusetts experience I know
 
02:29:25.790 --> 02:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
when not Massachusetts right but when
 
02:29:27.830 --> 02:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
you're looking for
 
02:29:30.170 --> 02:29:30.180 align:start position:0%
who else is doing this and what's the
 
02:29:32.150 --> 02:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
experience like then I think we do well
 
02:29:33.650 --> 02:29:33.660 align:start position:0%
to just at least
 
02:29:36.950 --> 02:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
learn from the state next door
 
02:29:38.929 --> 02:29:38.939 align:start position:0%
so as part of your package
 
02:29:41.870 --> 02:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
um I I came across this document this is
 
02:29:45.110 --> 02:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
a from May of 2019 it's from the
 
02:29:46.910 --> 02:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts division of marine
 
02:29:51.290 --> 02:29:51.300 align:start position:0%
fisheries it's a technical report TR 69.
 
02:29:53.330 --> 02:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
it appears to me
 
02:29:55.870 --> 02:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
based on
 
02:30:01.130 --> 02:30:01.140 align:start position:0%
the citations on pages 14 and 15. it
 
02:30:03.490 --> 02:30:03.500 align:start position:0%
appears to be a very well thought out
 
02:30:07.429 --> 02:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
deeply researched document I'm not an
 
02:30:09.770 --> 02:30:09.780 align:start position:0%
expert I'm a scuba diver so I'm just
 
02:30:13.130 --> 02:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
reading what the experts have to say and
 
02:30:22.190 --> 02:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:25.730 --> 02:30:25.740 align:start position:0%
this this paper this paper just it says
 
02:30:27.889 --> 02:30:27.899 align:start position:0%
nothing at all about the commercial
 
02:30:29.330 --> 02:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
Lobster industry
 
02:30:31.610 --> 02:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
this is all about
 
02:30:35.630 --> 02:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
the recreational Lobster industry so you
 
02:30:37.610 --> 02:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
know say it up front absolutely nothing
 
02:30:41.510 --> 02:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
at all against the lobstermen that make
 
02:30:43.790 --> 02:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
their living out of fishing for lobsters
 
02:30:46.370 --> 02:30:46.380 align:start position:0%
fully support that industry and this
 
02:30:48.950 --> 02:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
paper does not denigrate that industry
 
02:30:52.309 --> 02:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
at all it's purely recreational
 
02:30:54.110 --> 02:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
what it does is it provides us insight
 
02:30:57.770 --> 02:30:57.780 align:start position:0%
into the recreational trap
 
02:31:02.030 --> 02:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
practice and also recreational diving so
 
02:31:09.290 --> 02:31:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:12.110 --> 02:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
so it pretty much in fact maybe I could
 
02:31:14.030 --> 02:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
I highlighted a few
 
02:31:15.770 --> 02:31:15.780 align:start position:0%
pieces for you
 
02:31:17.809 --> 02:31:17.819 align:start position:0%
um again we don't have to go through
 
02:31:19.130 --> 02:31:19.140 align:start position:0%
them all today but if you can turn your
 
02:31:23.510 --> 02:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:27.110 --> 02:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
in the the abstract at the top
 
02:31:29.330 --> 02:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
I highlighted something just uh you know
 
02:31:30.710 --> 02:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
part way down there
 
02:31:34.070 --> 02:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
annual trap loss in the recreational
 
02:31:38.270 --> 02:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
fishery is estimated at 26 percent of
 
02:31:41.090 --> 02:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
traps fished now these guys don't lose
 
02:31:44.270 --> 02:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
that much I fully believe that there's a
 
02:31:46.429 --> 02:31:46.439 align:start position:0%
reason that recreational Ops have been
 
02:31:47.750 --> 02:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
losing so much because they ain't that
 
02:31:50.870 --> 02:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:52.670 --> 02:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
and the paper goes on to describe
 
02:31:54.349 --> 02:31:54.359 align:start position:0%
numerous circumstances as to you know
 
02:31:57.950 --> 02:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:57.960 --> 02:31:59.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:31:59.270 --> 02:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:00.710 --> 02:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
at the top of the introduction the
 
02:32:02.450 --> 02:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
accumulation of accidentally lost and
 
02:32:04.070 --> 02:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
intentionally abandoned fishing gear and
 
02:32:06.349 --> 02:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
Marine Waters is a global problem coming

02:32:17.270 --> 02:32:17.280 align:start position:0%

and cause damage to the sea floor
 
02:32:22.370 --> 02:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
habitats for many years and there's a
 
02:32:24.830 --> 02:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
number of citations
 
02:32:27.170 --> 02:32:27.180 align:start position:0%
the next paragraph contrary to popular
 
02:32:29.450 --> 02:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
belief and I think we've heard the
 
02:32:31.250 --> 02:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
popular belief today contrary to popular
 
02:32:34.429 --> 02:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
belief derelict traps often continue to
 
02:32:37.429 --> 02:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
catch Target and non-target species well
 
02:32:39.830 --> 02:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
after the original bird source is gone
 
02:32:42.349 --> 02:32:42.359 align:start position:0%
trapped organisms die and cyclically
 
02:32:45.469 --> 02:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
self-bit The Traps again a number of
 
02:32:48.110 --> 02:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
citations in a phenomenon known as ghost
 
02:32:50.510 --> 02:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
fishing which can result in local
 
02:32:54.469 --> 02:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:54.479 --> 02:32:55.730 align:start position:0%
 
opinion

02:32:55.730 --> 02:32:55.740 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
02:32:59.450 --> 02:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
this is taken from a well-researched
 
02:32:59.460 --> 02:33:03.469 align:start position:0%
this is taken from a well-researched
document

02:33:03.469 --> 02:33:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:06.830 --> 02:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
so I'll uh spare you the misery of
 
02:33:08.870 --> 02:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
reading you the other pieces that I've
 
02:33:08.880 --> 02:33:10.370 align:start position:0%
reading you the other pieces that I've
highlighted

02:33:10.370 --> 02:33:10.380 align:start position:0%
highlighted
 
02:33:12.469 --> 02:33:12.479 align:start position:0%
um but I'm sure you can draw your own
 
02:33:15.530 --> 02:33:15.540 align:start position:0%
conclusions by just at least paying
 
02:33:17.030 --> 02:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
attention to the the parts that I
 
02:33:21.670 --> 02:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:24.790 --> 02:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
so I think this uh this this paper
 
02:33:26.870 --> 02:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
refutes the notion that recreational
 
02:33:29.330 --> 02:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
trout fishing is preferred over hand
 
02:33:32.630 --> 02:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:34.790 --> 02:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
it quantifies the impact of diving for
 
02:33:36.469 --> 02:33:36.479 align:start position:0%
lobsters on the industry we'll get into
 
02:33:38.870 --> 02:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
that in a moment it understands the need
 
02:33:40.969 --> 02:33:40.979 align:start position:0%
to take action to clear erosions of
 
02:33:43.969 --> 02:33:43.979 align:start position:0%
ghost traps and it does not raise any
 
02:33:46.550 --> 02:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
significant issues at all related to
 
02:33:51.349 --> 02:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:53.210 --> 02:33:53.220 align:start position:0%
in the last hearing it was asserted and
 
02:33:54.590 --> 02:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
in this hearing was asserted the only
 
02:33:56.150 --> 02:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
method for non-commercial taken of
 
02:33:58.309 --> 02:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
lobster traps of lobster should be by
 
02:34:01.550 --> 02:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
trap and yet this entire 22-page
 
02:34:03.410 --> 02:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
document is dedicated to the negative
 
02:34:07.250 --> 02:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
environmental impact of that activity
 
02:34:09.050 --> 02:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
the environmental impact of lost
 
02:34:11.150 --> 02:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
recreational lobster traps is so serious
 
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
that the Massachusetts division of
 
02:34:14.270 --> 02:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
marine fishery has launched an
 
02:34:16.190 --> 02:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
educational campaign to combat the
 
02:34:25.250 --> 02:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:27.770 --> 02:34:27.780 align:start position:0%
I believe it's highlighted at the column
 
02:34:31.809 --> 02:34:31.819 align:start position:0%
two the top paragraph beginning in 2017
 
02:34:34.849 --> 02:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
the DMF published a series of videos
 
02:34:36.889 --> 02:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
designed to Foster responsible
 
02:34:38.510 --> 02:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
recreational lobstering and provide
 
02:34:40.550 --> 02:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
participants with a more comprehensive
 
02:34:42.950 --> 02:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
understanding of the fishery videos are
 
02:34:45.530 --> 02:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
available on the DMF website
 
02:34:47.630 --> 02:34:47.640 align:start position:0%
there's nine videos up there they're
 
02:34:50.570 --> 02:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
great videos I watched every one of them
 
02:34:53.030 --> 02:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
but it was such a problem that they had
 
02:34:56.570 --> 02:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
to take action and go and produce a
 
02:34:58.670 --> 02:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
series of videos and educational
 
02:34:58.680 --> 02:35:05.630 align:start position:0%
series of videos and educational
programs

02:35:05.630 --> 02:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:08.150 --> 02:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
funnily enough in those videos you'll
 
02:35:10.309 --> 02:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
actually see in the I think it's the
 
02:35:12.290 --> 02:35:12.300 align:start position:0%
first or the second one you'll see them
 
02:35:15.830 --> 02:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
retrieving traps that are ghost traps
 
02:35:18.050 --> 02:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
lost traps and in some cases they're
 
02:35:21.710 --> 02:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
pulling animals out of the traps
 
02:35:21.720 --> 02:35:26.090 align:start position:0%
pulling animals out of the traps
foreign

02:35:26.090 --> 02:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:29.210 --> 02:35:29.220 align:start position:0%
how can the opponents of this bill
 
02:35:32.570 --> 02:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
possibly propose a recreational Trap
 
02:35:35.330 --> 02:35:35.340 align:start position:0%
Fishing as an alternative to Simply
 
02:35:37.309 --> 02:35:37.319 align:start position:0%
taking a lobster
 
02:35:38.809 --> 02:35:38.819 align:start position:0%
by diving
 
02:35:40.849 --> 02:35:40.859 align:start position:0%
when the environmental impacts of
 
02:35:43.309 --> 02:35:43.319 align:start position:0%
recreational Trap Fishing are so well
 
02:35:43.319 --> 02:35:46.070 align:start position:0%
recreational Trap Fishing are so well
documented

02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:48.349 --> 02:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
such a suggestion is environmentally
 
02:35:48.359 --> 02:35:49.730 align:start position:0%
such a suggestion is environmentally
unconscionable

02:35:49.730 --> 02:35:49.740 align:start position:0%
unconscionable
 
02:35:52.490 --> 02:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
the suggestion is frankly ludicrous and
 
02:35:57.650 --> 02:35:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:59.510 --> 02:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
secondly and I think this is probably my
 
02:36:01.429 --> 02:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
biggest Point here we've just got to
 
02:36:03.710 --> 02:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
talk about the elephant in a room this
 
02:36:06.650 --> 02:36:06.660 align:start position:0%
this report helps us to understand
 
02:36:10.550 --> 02:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
the negligible impact of divers on the
 
02:36:13.969 --> 02:36:13.979 align:start position:0%
lobster population no diver wants to
 
02:36:16.849 --> 02:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
steal a family's living
 
02:36:19.730 --> 02:36:19.740 align:start position:0%
and if if that's in your mind we've got
 
02:36:24.770 --> 02:36:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:27.889 --> 02:36:27.899 align:start position:0%
so let's try and do some numbers
 
02:36:30.950 --> 02:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
so the bill says you know not let not
 
02:36:33.230 --> 02:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
less than four weeks so let's assume we
 
02:36:36.290 --> 02:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
give an eight week season or eight
 
02:36:39.290 --> 02:36:39.300 align:start position:0%
Saturdays or eight Sundays of diving
 
02:36:42.530 --> 02:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
assume the diver has a great day for
 
02:36:44.510 --> 02:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
each of those days and he backs his
 
02:36:46.670 --> 02:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
limit of three lobsters
 
02:36:49.010 --> 02:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
so three lobsters defined in line 28.
 
02:36:53.750 --> 02:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
This is an annual catch of 24 lobsters
 
02:36:57.590 --> 02:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
assume per diver assume that on any one
 
02:36:57.600 --> 02:36:58.730 align:start position:0%
assume per diver assume that on any one
day

02:36:58.730 --> 02:36:58.740 align:start position:0%
day
 
02:37:00.530 --> 02:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
fifty percent of the divers with a
 
02:37:02.870 --> 02:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
license are hunting and the all 100
 
02:37:05.270 --> 02:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
licenses are issued as defined in line
 
02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:09.349 align:start position:0%
licenses are issued as defined in line
14.

02:37:09.349 --> 02:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:12.290 --> 02:37:12.300 align:start position:0%
which is actually 50 is actually High
 
02:37:14.929 --> 02:37:14.939 align:start position:0%
when you compare it to figure three on
 
02:37:17.809 --> 02:37:17.819 align:start position:0%
page six which suggests about 30 percent
 
02:37:20.990 --> 02:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
of recreational licenses are actually
 
02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.150 align:start position:0%
of recreational licenses are actually
fished

02:37:23.150 --> 02:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
fished
 
02:37:26.150 --> 02:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
so the total catch of all divers is
 
02:37:28.670 --> 02:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
about 1200 lobsters in a year
 
02:37:31.550 --> 02:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
average Lobster weight 1.46 pounds again
 
02:37:33.349 --> 02:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
that is not my supposition I'm just
 
02:37:34.550 --> 02:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
getting that out of the working numbers
 
02:37:38.090 --> 02:37:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:41.469 --> 02:37:41.479 align:start position:0%
so that gives us an annual catch of
 
02:37:45.050 --> 02:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
1752 pounds so we pull the annual
 
02:37:47.710 --> 02:37:47.720 align:start position:0%
commercial catch from the NOAA website
 
02:37:50.710 --> 02:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire of
 
02:37:57.790 --> 02:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
5708 942 pounds do the numbers it's
 
02:38:00.230 --> 02:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
0.03 percent
 
02:38:03.230 --> 02:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
of the commercial catch
 
02:38:05.809 --> 02:38:05.819 align:start position:0%
I try to give you a graphic and through
 
02:38:10.490 --> 02:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
the magic of excel you have a chart
 
02:38:13.490 --> 02:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
as part of your package
 
02:38:16.070 --> 02:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
the Red Lobster is a commercially caught
 
02:38:20.590 --> 02:38:20.600 align:start position:0%
Lobster the black Lobster on our
 
02:38:23.210 --> 02:38:23.220 align:start position:0%
optimistic estimates
 
02:38:26.330 --> 02:38:26.340 align:start position:0%
is what the diver would catch it's
 
02:38:29.630 --> 02:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
rounding errors it's insignificant
 
02:38:32.450 --> 02:38:32.460 align:start position:0%
I honestly don't know why we're having
 
02:38:34.370 --> 02:38:34.380 align:start position:0%
this conversation without first having
 
02:38:36.050 --> 02:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
visited the facts to see what the real
 
02:38:39.170 --> 02:38:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:40.910 --> 02:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
so another data point
 
02:38:44.929 --> 02:38:44.939 align:start position:0%
if we look at uh again from tr69 table 3
 
02:38:47.330 --> 02:38:47.340 align:start position:0%
on page seven gives us some really nice
 
02:38:49.010 --> 02:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
numbers it gives us the numbers of
 
02:38:51.410 --> 02:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
permits that were reporting a catch the
 
02:38:53.090 --> 02:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
number of traps fished the hours of
 
02:38:56.570 --> 02:38:56.580 align:start position:0%
diving and the pounds of lobster caught
 
02:39:01.210 --> 02:39:01.220 align:start position:0%
hours of diving 4403 pounds of lobster
 
02:39:03.889 --> 02:39:03.899 align:start position:0%
18809 caught in those hours that gives
 
02:39:08.090 --> 02:39:08.100 align:start position:0%
you 1.3 pounds per hour average size of
 
02:39:11.809 --> 02:39:11.819 align:start position:0%
lobster 1.4 pounds it means that a
 
02:39:13.450 --> 02:39:13.460 align:start position:0%
diver's catch in about
 
02:39:17.030 --> 02:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
0.9 lobsters per hour
 
02:39:21.349 --> 02:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
let's round it up call it one
 
02:39:23.630 --> 02:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
80 cubic foot cylinder of air lasts
 
02:39:25.790 --> 02:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
between 40 minutes and one hour it's
 
02:39:28.250 --> 02:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
about one Lobster a dive
 
02:39:29.870 --> 02:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
two tanks per day
 
02:39:31.309 --> 02:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
two lobsters
 
02:39:31.319 --> 02:39:32.270 align:start position:0%
two lobsters
so

02:39:32.270 --> 02:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:39:34.190 --> 02:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
original assumption that led to this
 
02:39:36.290 --> 02:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
chart said three lobsters a day that was
 
02:39:38.090 --> 02:39:38.100 align:start position:0%
an overestimate
 
02:39:40.250 --> 02:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
based on actual numbers
 
02:39:42.230 --> 02:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
coming out of a state that does allow
 
02:39:44.929 --> 02:39:44.939 align:start position:0%
diving for lobsters
 
02:39:47.030 --> 02:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
we can use another data point divers
 
02:39:48.190 --> 02:39:48.200 align:start position:0%
caught 18
 
02:39:52.309 --> 02:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
809 pounds of lobsters divided by 140 so
 
02:39:56.270 --> 02:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
by 1.46 that gives us 12 803 lobsters
 
02:39:57.770 --> 02:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
divide the number by the number of
 
02:39:57.780 --> 02:39:59.450 align:start position:0%
divide the number by the number of
permits

02:39:59.450 --> 02:39:59.460 align:start position:0%
permits
 
02:40:02.389 --> 02:40:02.399 align:start position:0%
12 lobsters
 
02:40:05.510 --> 02:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
12 lobsters in here my estimate that led
 
02:40:08.150 --> 02:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
to this was 24 lobsters the numbers
 
02:40:10.130 --> 02:40:10.140 align:start position:0%
coming out of Massachusetts suggest it's
 
02:40:13.309 --> 02:40:13.319 align:start position:0%
probably nearer 12. so you could double
 
02:40:15.050 --> 02:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
the number of Reds
 
02:40:19.849 --> 02:40:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:22.250 --> 02:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
another data point take it from the main
 
02:40:23.830 --> 02:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
lobster industry
 
02:40:26.510 --> 02:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
2021 Lobster harvest in man according to
 
02:40:31.910 --> 02:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
NOAA 10 million 230 440 pounds divide
 
02:40:35.410 --> 02:40:35.420 align:start position:0%
that by 1.46 it gives you 75 75 million
 
02:40:35.420 --> 02:40:37.030 align:start position:0%
that by 1.46 it gives you 75 75 million
533

02:40:37.030 --> 02:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
533
 
02:40:42.110 --> 02:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
75 million 500 301 lobsters
 
02:40:44.330 --> 02:40:44.340 align:start position:0%
divide it by the estimated number of
 
02:40:48.230 --> 02:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
traps been fished which is 2800 and
 
02:40:49.969 --> 02:40:49.979 align:start position:0%
sorry two million eight hundred and
 
02:40:51.590 --> 02:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
sixty one thousand
 
02:40:55.969 --> 02:40:55.979 align:start position:0%
gives you 216 lobsters per trap per year
 
02:40:58.730 --> 02:40:58.740 align:start position:0%
previously we estimated the annual catch
 
02:41:02.150 --> 02:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
per diver at about 24 per year
 
02:41:05.750 --> 02:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
to 26 24.
 
02:41:10.610 --> 02:41:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:14.090 --> 02:41:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:17.150 --> 02:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
ocean cleanup
 
02:41:19.610 --> 02:41:19.620 align:start position:0%
an important aspect of this bill is the
 
02:41:20.929 --> 02:41:20.939 align:start position:0%
initiative to form a positive working
 
02:41:22.849 --> 02:41:22.859 align:start position:0%
relationship between the recreational
 
02:41:24.830 --> 02:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
dive community and Commercial fishermen
 
02:41:26.750 --> 02:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
to improve our marine environment by
 
02:41:29.150 --> 02:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
removing harmful lost fishing gear from
 
02:41:33.410 --> 02:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
our Coastal Waters I myself on a dive
 
02:41:34.990 --> 02:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
swam past
 
02:41:38.990 --> 02:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
numerous love supports abandoned Lobster
 
02:41:41.570 --> 02:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
pots or lost or ghost
 
02:41:44.809 --> 02:41:44.819 align:start position:0%
but one sticks out in particular I put a
 
02:41:47.809 --> 02:41:47.819 align:start position:0%
picture in your packet there this uh
 
02:41:49.809 --> 02:41:49.819 align:start position:0%
this little beauty
 
02:41:54.050 --> 02:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:55.730 --> 02:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
kind of fish that probably only his
 
02:41:57.889 --> 02:41:57.899 align:start position:0%
mother would love it's a ugly looking
 
02:41:59.270 --> 02:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
beast but it's what we get to work with
 
02:42:00.830 --> 02:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
you don't have it we don't have angel
 
02:42:03.349 --> 02:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
fish and butterfly fish in in New
 
02:42:05.570 --> 02:42:05.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but they come in great all
 
02:42:07.070 --> 02:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
kinds of colors they come from this kind
 
02:42:09.110 --> 02:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
of deep russet color all through oranges
 
02:42:11.330 --> 02:42:11.340 align:start position:0%
and yellows but I'm swimming past the
 
02:42:11.340 --> 02:42:12.710 align:start position:0%
and yellows but I'm swimming past the
Trap

02:42:12.710 --> 02:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
Trap
 
02:42:15.110 --> 02:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
the Trap is covered with Marine debris
 
02:42:17.450 --> 02:42:17.460 align:start position:0%
like it's it's got algae growing all
 
02:42:19.910 --> 02:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
over it it's been down there a long time
 
02:42:22.370 --> 02:42:22.380 align:start position:0%
it has a single piece of rope dangling
 
02:42:24.469 --> 02:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
off the end that's four feet long and
 
02:42:29.510 --> 02:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:32.330 --> 02:42:32.340 align:start position:0%
turn around and swim away
 
02:42:34.429 --> 02:42:34.439 align:start position:0%
I can't touch it
 
02:42:36.710 --> 02:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
I couldn't open the Trap
 
02:42:40.429 --> 02:42:40.439 align:start position:0%
and let him go even though it's plain to
 
02:42:43.190 --> 02:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
anybody with common sense that that trap
 
02:42:49.790 --> 02:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:52.730 --> 02:42:52.740 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion um thank you very much
 
02:42:56.170 --> 02:42:56.180 align:start position:0%
for listening to my testimony and I urge
 
02:42:59.809 --> 02:42:59.819 align:start position:0%
vote common sense and vote Yes for the
 
02:43:02.090 --> 02:43:02.100 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you
 
02:43:03.770 --> 02:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions thank you for
 
02:43:05.270 --> 02:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
your testimony he's willing to take
 
02:43:06.370 --> 02:43:06.380 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions
 
02:43:08.750 --> 02:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey thank you Mr
 
02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:09.770 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey thank you Mr
chairman

02:43:09.770 --> 02:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:43:12.410 --> 02:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question
 
02:43:15.410 --> 02:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
um I'm not a numbers person
 
02:43:17.210 --> 02:43:17.220 align:start position:0%
um and you threw a lot of them out there
 
02:43:20.150 --> 02:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
at me so
 
02:43:22.610 --> 02:43:22.620 align:start position:0%
um I I'm going to turn your
 
02:43:25.910 --> 02:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
numbers around i s i see where you're
 
02:43:28.790 --> 02:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
trying to make the point that this this
 
02:43:31.550 --> 02:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
one little black Lobster down here
 
02:43:34.790 --> 02:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect anything over here I I
 
02:43:36.710 --> 02:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
get that that was the message that you
 
02:43:38.809 --> 02:43:38.819 align:start position:0%
were giving rounding hours okay all
 
02:43:41.270 --> 02:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
right so but my question I'm going to
 
02:43:43.670 --> 02:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
turn it around these people are all
 
02:43:47.270 --> 02:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
doing this mostly for a living that
 
02:43:49.250 --> 02:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
they're This Is How They sustain
 
02:43:52.809 --> 02:43:52.819 align:start position:0%
themselves and their family okay so
 
02:43:55.429 --> 02:43:55.439 align:start position:0%
why do you want to take that one Lobster
 
02:43:56.929 --> 02:43:56.939 align:start position:0%
you're saying you're going to get one
 
02:43:59.150 --> 02:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
Lobster per dive I'm sorry that's not
 
02:44:02.570 --> 02:44:02.580 align:start position:0%
even enough for my dinner so why is it
 
02:44:05.990 --> 02:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
that you want to do this I get these
 
02:44:09.530 --> 02:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
people they this is their living why are
 
02:44:13.070 --> 02:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
you asking for since it's so Minnesota
 
02:44:15.469 --> 02:44:15.479 align:start position:0%
that's a fantastic question it's just a
 
02:44:17.630 --> 02:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
fun thing yeah it's a great question I'm
 
02:44:19.849 --> 02:44:19.859 align:start position:0%
really glad you asked because if we
 
02:44:21.349 --> 02:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
think of this as Lobster harvesting
 
02:44:22.550 --> 02:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
you're thinking of it from the wrong
 
02:44:31.570 --> 02:44:31.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:33.530 --> 02:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you what my wife would be
 
02:44:38.389 --> 02:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:42.889 --> 02:44:42.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:44.990 --> 02:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
02:44:49.130 --> 02:44:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:51.349 --> 02:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
and the chair will now call Colonel
 
02:44:52.910 --> 02:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
Kevin Jordan from New Hampshire Fish and
 
02:44:56.330 --> 02:44:56.340 align:start position:0%
Game our last speaker of the day
 
02:44:58.730 --> 02:44:58.740 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to let the committee know
 
02:45:01.130 --> 02:45:01.140 align:start position:0%
that since we have an exec session
 
02:45:03.469 --> 02:45:03.479 align:start position:0%
scheduled for one o'clock
 
02:45:06.889 --> 02:45:06.899 align:start position:0%
my intent is to let us eat lunch so we
 
02:45:08.750 --> 02:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
will open the exact session and recess
 
02:45:10.790 --> 02:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
it when we hit hit the one o'clock time
 
02:45:14.030 --> 02:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
to a Time known so we'll give each other
 
02:45:17.270 --> 02:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh until probably two to eat and then
 
02:45:19.910 --> 02:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
come back and do our exec session and
 
02:45:23.030 --> 02:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
that's my intent so we can discuss it if
 
02:45:25.670 --> 02:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
needed but I think the the ranking
 
02:45:28.130 --> 02:45:28.140 align:start position:0%
member here is is also interested in
 
02:45:30.889 --> 02:45:30.899 align:start position:0%
eating something and taking a break
 
02:45:30.899 --> 02:45:32.450 align:start position:0%
eating something and taking a break
um

02:45:32.450 --> 02:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:34.370 --> 02:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
they didn't bring any Lobster that I
 
02:45:35.330 --> 02:45:35.340 align:start position:0%
know of
 
02:45:35.340 --> 02:45:36.469 align:start position:0%
know of
um

02:45:36.469 --> 02:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:38.570 --> 02:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
and if the divers brought it it would
 
02:45:43.550 --> 02:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:46.070 --> 02:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
and with that Colonel Jordan it is up
 
02:45:48.710 --> 02:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
all up for you now all right good uh
 
02:45:50.030 --> 02:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
good morning or actually good afternoon
 
02:45:52.070 --> 02:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman of members of the committee
 
02:45:54.170 --> 02:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
appreciate your patience I know it's
 
02:45:57.170 --> 02:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
been a very long process for this
 
02:45:57.180 --> 02:45:57.950 align:start position:0%
been a very long process for this
um

02:45:57.950 --> 02:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:00.710 --> 02:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
I I am going to raise concerns one one
 
02:46:03.830 --> 02:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
thing that by 33 years I get more and
 
02:46:05.870 --> 02:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
more irritated as I spend more time here
 
02:46:07.490 --> 02:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
of people that come up here and tell you
 
02:46:08.870 --> 02:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
how to do law enforcement that have
 
02:46:10.790 --> 02:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
never spent one minute of their life
 
02:46:13.429 --> 02:46:13.439 align:start position:0%
doing it I'm here to tell you
 
02:46:15.710 --> 02:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
I would encourage those folks to join us
 
02:46:17.929 --> 02:46:17.939 align:start position:0%
when you try to prove a case because it
 
02:46:19.490 --> 02:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
is very different from what you're being
 
02:46:19.500 --> 02:46:20.389 align:start position:0%
is very different from what you're being
told

02:46:20.389 --> 02:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
told
 
02:46:23.990 --> 02:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
and I would ask you uh to not take my
 
02:46:25.969 --> 02:46:25.979 align:start position:0%
word for that but to pick up a law book
 
02:46:28.309 --> 02:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
and read it very carefully on laws that
 
02:46:29.929 --> 02:46:29.939 align:start position:0%
have been established for over 80 years
 
02:46:32.510 --> 02:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
and read them line by line and you will
 
02:46:34.490 --> 02:46:34.500 align:start position:0%
see very clearly they're written in a
 
02:46:37.190 --> 02:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes confusing way but of but a
 
02:46:39.410 --> 02:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
very distinct way the elements are clear
 
02:46:41.870 --> 02:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
the things that you need to prove are
 
02:46:44.570 --> 02:46:44.580 align:start position:0%
very uh they jump should jump off the
 
02:46:46.490 --> 02:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
page to you and those are those are laws
 
02:46:47.630 --> 02:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
that work
 
02:46:50.630 --> 02:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
this amendment represents anything but
 
02:46:53.750 --> 02:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
that this amendment confuses me more
 
02:46:56.030 --> 02:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
than any amendment I have reviewed in
 
02:46:57.530 --> 02:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
the 10 years I have been coming to the
 
02:47:00.230 --> 02:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
legislature it has got more doubling
 
02:47:03.530 --> 02:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
back switching over and and it's
 
02:47:04.910 --> 02:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
frightening to me and I'll tell you why
 
02:47:06.830 --> 02:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
it's frightening to me I don't Lobster
 
02:47:09.469 --> 02:47:09.479 align:start position:0%
fish I I love all of these guys behind
 
02:47:12.590 --> 02:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
me because I work with them and I'd ask
 
02:47:15.050 --> 02:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
you to keep one very important factor in
 
02:47:17.630 --> 02:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
mind they are not recreating they're
 
02:47:19.730 --> 02:47:19.740 align:start position:0%
trying to feed their families they're
 
02:47:22.070 --> 02:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
taking these lobsters home to feed their
 
02:47:25.309 --> 02:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
lives their children support their boats
 
02:47:27.410 --> 02:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
and support the New Hampshire economy
 
02:47:28.790 --> 02:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
that's a little different than deer
 
02:47:30.410 --> 02:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
hunting because I enjoy deer hunting
 
02:47:32.210 --> 02:47:32.220 align:start position:0%
it's a little different than than
 
02:47:34.130 --> 02:47:34.140 align:start position:0%
trapping because I enjoy the sport of
 
02:47:35.809 --> 02:47:35.819 align:start position:0%
trapping they're making their living on
 
02:47:39.230 --> 02:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
it and I think it requires us all of us
 
02:47:42.050 --> 02:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
including me and my officers and and I
 
02:47:43.910 --> 02:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
brought a young redhead back there that
 
02:47:46.010 --> 02:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
will that will substantiate that I'm
 
02:47:48.530 --> 02:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
very strict on how we do deal with these
 
02:47:51.469 --> 02:47:51.479 align:start position:0%
people for that very reason they they
 
02:47:53.210 --> 02:47:53.220 align:start position:0%
believe very strongly in what they do
 
02:47:55.429 --> 02:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
they're not perfect we make violations
 
02:47:58.190 --> 02:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
for lobster fishermen we don't do it a
 
02:48:00.290 --> 02:48:00.300 align:start position:0%
lot but we have done it I think I think
 
02:48:01.790 --> 02:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
they have really cleaned their act up
 
02:48:04.849 --> 02:48:04.859 align:start position:0%
over the last two decades
 
02:48:07.849 --> 02:48:07.859 align:start position:0%
um but but please consider that when you
 
02:48:09.590 --> 02:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
look at this this is a little more than
 
02:48:12.469 --> 02:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
I want to get a lobster you know we we
 
02:48:14.270 --> 02:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
currently have
 
02:48:16.610 --> 02:48:16.620 align:start position:0%
uh in your own researcher found this out
 
02:48:20.270 --> 02:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
we sold 531 Lobster commercial Lobster
 
02:48:23.210 --> 02:48:23.220 align:start position:0%
license along our 18-mile Coastline and
 
02:48:25.849 --> 02:48:25.859 align:start position:0%
that 18 miles is a stretch it's a very
 
02:48:29.030 --> 02:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
short Coastline so we had 531 licenses
 
02:48:31.010 --> 02:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
that means that at any given time the
 
02:48:34.130 --> 02:48:34.140 align:start position:0%
possibility exists that we can have 21
 
02:48:37.250 --> 02:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
000 lobster traps in that 18 miles now
 
02:48:38.690 --> 02:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
if you're going to sit here and tell me
 
02:48:40.790 --> 02:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
that in that 18 miles we're going to put
 
02:48:42.290 --> 02:48:42.300 align:start position:0%
divers down here and there's not going
 
02:48:44.330 --> 02:48:44.340 align:start position:0%
to be a conflict I got news for you
 
02:48:46.550 --> 02:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
there is going to be a conflict there
 
02:48:49.429 --> 02:48:49.439 align:start position:0%
has to be it's too short of a distance I
 
02:48:52.190 --> 02:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
I compared it talking to my lieutenant
 
02:48:53.570 --> 02:48:53.580 align:start position:0%
back there I compared it to Interstate
 
02:48:55.670 --> 02:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
95 Interstate 95 in the state of New
 
02:48:57.770 --> 02:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is about 16 miles long this
 
02:48:59.809 --> 02:48:59.819 align:start position:0%
would be the same as if we took those
 
02:49:02.030 --> 02:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
Troopers and we blindfolded them and we
 
02:49:04.429 --> 02:49:04.439 align:start position:0%
said go out on 95 and enforce the law
 
02:49:07.370 --> 02:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
because they can't see to enforce it no
 
02:49:09.110 --> 02:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
more than I can see to enforce the
 
02:49:11.150 --> 02:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
diving as I've explained to you in that
 
02:49:13.370 --> 02:49:13.380 align:start position:0%
last bill and then and then I want them
 
02:49:15.650 --> 02:49:15.660 align:start position:0%
to provide me stats on how how they did
 
02:49:17.510 --> 02:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
that enforcement those stats aren't
 
02:49:18.770 --> 02:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
going to be very valuable because there
 
02:49:20.690 --> 02:49:20.700 align:start position:0%
aren't going to be many of them you
 
02:49:23.330 --> 02:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
cannot enforce half of what's in this
 
02:49:26.330 --> 02:49:26.340 align:start position:0%
bill you just can't do it and and I've
 
02:49:28.790 --> 02:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
got some Cherie went through it line by
 
02:49:30.770 --> 02:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
line which I which I really appreciated
 
02:49:32.990 --> 02:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
there are some extra ones though that I
 
02:49:34.429 --> 02:49:34.439 align:start position:0%
just wanted to bring your attention to
 
02:49:37.969 --> 02:49:37.979 align:start position:0%
some that I think are are significant so
 
02:49:39.650 --> 02:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
the first one right out of the gate on
 
02:49:41.690 --> 02:49:41.700 align:start position:0%
page one out of eight paragraph eight
 
02:49:44.450 --> 02:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
and nine they're inserting this new
 
02:49:46.490 --> 02:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
paragraph lobster crab scuba diving
 
02:49:48.170 --> 02:49:48.180 align:start position:0%
recreational Lobster license and by the
 
02:49:50.090 --> 02:49:50.100 align:start position:0%
way scuba diving recreational Lobster
 
02:49:51.650 --> 02:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
licenses called four different things
 
02:49:53.630 --> 02:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
all through this bill it's a commercial
 
02:49:55.429 --> 02:49:55.439 align:start position:0%
diving license it's a recreational
 
02:49:58.130 --> 02:49:58.140 align:start position:0%
diving license it's a diving license so
 
02:49:59.990 --> 02:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's going to create confusion in any
 
02:50:02.210 --> 02:50:02.220 align:start position:0%
courtroom that you go into we've got to
 
02:50:04.070 --> 02:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
refer to this stuff exactly the same
 
02:50:05.929 --> 02:50:05.939 align:start position:0%
every time time that we do that in order
 
02:50:09.110 --> 02:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
to prove a case they want to amend 2118
 
02:50:11.150 --> 02:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
by inserting this after paragraph 2A
 
02:50:13.670 --> 02:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
that's the wrong location that needs to
 
02:50:16.130 --> 02:50:16.140 align:start position:0%
be inserted under paragraph three in
 
02:50:18.710 --> 02:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
that law following criteria shall apply
 
02:50:20.270 --> 02:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
to the issuance of lobster and crab
 
02:50:22.250 --> 02:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
licenses by the department I've got
 
02:50:25.010 --> 02:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
three pages of that kind of stuff
 
02:50:26.929 --> 02:50:26.939 align:start position:0%
where this has been misplaced or
 
02:50:30.050 --> 02:50:30.060 align:start position:0%
misworded or misquoted basically or or
 
02:50:32.330 --> 02:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
ineffective in the law
 
02:50:36.050 --> 02:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
another one we talk about in here is
 
02:50:36.060 --> 02:50:41.530 align:start position:0%
another one we talk about in here is
um

02:50:41.530 --> 02:50:41.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:44.270 --> 02:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
uh making dive tanks or putting numbers
 
02:50:46.190 --> 02:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
I do appreciate the effort here that
 
02:50:48.830 --> 02:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
this license shall consist of letters
 
02:50:50.389 --> 02:50:50.399 align:start position:0%
and numbers which a person engage in
 
02:50:52.130 --> 02:50:52.140 align:start position:0%
scuba diving shall affix to his or her
 
02:50:54.770 --> 02:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
diving tanks and regulation die flag in
 
02:50:57.110 --> 02:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
a contrasting color making it readily
 
02:50:59.270 --> 02:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
visible to a conservation officer that
 
02:51:00.950 --> 02:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
should read plainly visible because
 
02:51:02.809 --> 02:51:02.819 align:start position:0%
that's defined in law not readily
 
02:51:04.490 --> 02:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
visible and it should read law
 
02:51:05.929 --> 02:51:05.939 align:start position:0%
enforcement instead of a conservation
 
02:51:08.210 --> 02:51:08.220 align:start position:0%
officer so a defense attorney can come
 
02:51:10.309 --> 02:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
into a courtroom for those of you that
 
02:51:11.750 --> 02:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
have never been into a courtroom and he
 
02:51:13.910 --> 02:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
can say to me can you define Colonel
 
02:51:16.070 --> 02:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
readily visible
 
02:51:17.750 --> 02:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
now I'm going to ask you can you define
 
02:51:17.760 --> 02:51:19.070 align:start position:0%
now I'm going to ask you can you define
that

02:51:19.070 --> 02:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:51:21.290 --> 02:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
I was asked once to tell you tell a
 
02:51:24.410 --> 02:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
defense attorney how what alcohol smell
 
02:51:24.420 --> 02:51:25.370 align:start position:0%
defense attorney how what alcohol smell
like

02:51:25.370 --> 02:51:25.380 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:51:27.349 --> 02:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
and my answer to him was can you tell me
 
02:51:29.510 --> 02:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
what spaghetti smells like
 
02:51:31.910 --> 02:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
but that's what these cases come down to
 
02:51:33.889 --> 02:51:33.899 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of language that you
 
02:51:35.889 --> 02:51:35.899 align:start position:0%
have to be careful of you have to use
 
02:51:38.510 --> 02:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
verbage and phrases that are already
 
02:51:40.190 --> 02:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
defined in our law and there's a lot of
 
02:51:42.230 --> 02:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
them plainly visible law enforcement
 
02:51:43.910 --> 02:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
officer those are things that have to be
 
02:51:46.370 --> 02:51:46.380 align:start position:0%
included and and this bill has none of
 
02:51:48.530 --> 02:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
that it has absolutely none of that
 
02:51:50.929 --> 02:51:50.939 align:start position:0%
it refers to statues that don't pertain
 
02:51:53.269 --> 02:51:53.279 align:start position:0%
to the action that they're discussing it
 
02:51:57.590 --> 02:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
it it's just a mess from start to finish
 
02:51:57.600 --> 02:51:58.610 align:start position:0%
it it's just a mess from start to finish
um

02:51:58.610 --> 02:51:58.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:00.650 --> 02:52:00.660 align:start position:0%
setting a season by rule for the
 
02:52:03.590 --> 02:52:03.600 align:start position:0%

02:52:07.670 --> 02:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
we've never done we've never registered
 
02:52:09.469 --> 02:52:09.479 align:start position:0%
lobsters we registered deer we register
 
02:52:11.929 --> 02:52:11.939 align:start position:0%
there we've never registered Lobster to
 
02:52:13.490 --> 02:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
create an online system we're currently
 
02:52:15.290 --> 02:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
working on an oh HIV we've been working
 
02:52:17.269 --> 02:52:17.279 align:start position:0%
on it for two years to create an online
 
02:52:20.990 --> 02:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
ability to register your ohrv through
 
02:52:22.370 --> 02:52:22.380 align:start position:0%
your computer as you're coming up the
 
02:52:23.929 --> 02:52:23.939 align:start position:0%
highway rather than going to an agent
 
02:52:26.330 --> 02:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
we're at a cost of close to thirty
 
02:52:27.650 --> 02:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
02:52:30.290 --> 02:52:30.300 align:start position:0%
who's going to fund that where's that
 
02:52:31.910 --> 02:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
money going to come from I we don't have
 
02:52:34.010 --> 02:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
that kind of money and we're in a
 
02:52:35.809 --> 02:52:35.819 align:start position:0%
predicament now where that law passed
 
02:52:37.490 --> 02:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
they mandated that we do it and the
 
02:52:40.550 --> 02:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
governor has is run on a platform that
 
02:52:43.429 --> 02:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
we we can't charge any new fees so those
 
02:52:45.170 --> 02:52:45.180 align:start position:0%
Hits come into the department and I
 
02:52:46.550 --> 02:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
don't I shouldn't have to tell this
 
02:52:47.809 --> 02:52:47.819 align:start position:0%
committee because a lot of you have been
 
02:52:50.090 --> 02:52:50.100 align:start position:0%
here a long time these unfunded mandates
 
02:52:52.730 --> 02:52:52.740 align:start position:0%
are killing us rabies go out and collect
 
02:52:54.530 --> 02:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
rabies and investigate rabies we're not
 
02:52:56.210 --> 02:52:56.220 align:start position:0%
going to give you a nickel for it but
 
02:52:57.590 --> 02:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
transport them all over the state and
 
02:52:59.269 --> 02:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
get them tested and and make sure you do
 
02:53:01.010 --> 02:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
that with the 35 guys that you got
 
02:53:02.269 --> 02:53:02.279 align:start position:0%
covering from Pittsburgh to
 
02:53:04.550 --> 02:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts oh and then if you get a
 
02:53:06.410 --> 02:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
call for a fallen hiker I want you to
 
02:53:07.790 --> 02:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
run up there Scurry up there and pick
 
02:53:11.030 --> 02:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
those Folks up at 50 000 and drag them
 
02:53:12.650 --> 02:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
down and we're not going to give you any
 
02:53:13.969 --> 02:53:13.979 align:start position:0%
money for that either because you guys
 
02:53:15.950 --> 02:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
know some of you have helped me try to
 
02:53:17.330 --> 02:53:17.340 align:start position:0%
get that money out of the general fund
 
02:53:18.889 --> 02:53:18.899 align:start position:0%
it's not going to happen
 
02:53:22.370 --> 02:53:22.380 align:start position:0%
and we can't do it anymore frankly I I
 
02:53:24.469 --> 02:53:24.479 align:start position:0%
think a better way to do this let's try
 
02:53:26.809 --> 02:53:26.819 align:start position:0%
something new let's try to come up with
 
02:53:29.510 --> 02:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
a way this bill is trying to address a
 
02:53:31.130 --> 02:53:31.140 align:start position:0%
couple of different things
 
02:53:33.710 --> 02:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
is trying to give diaper divers an
 
02:53:36.230 --> 02:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to enjoy our resources I
 
02:53:37.370 --> 02:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
would submit to you they have that
 
02:53:39.670 --> 02:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity now they can get a five pot
 
02:53:41.990 --> 02:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
license they're not prohibited from
 
02:53:43.790 --> 02:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
Catching lobsters the method is
 
02:53:46.070 --> 02:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
prohibited just like they can hunt deer
 
02:53:47.750 --> 02:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
but you can't do it with a cannon you
 
02:53:49.250 --> 02:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
can do it with with guns that are
 
02:53:50.929 --> 02:53:50.939 align:start position:0%
permitted but everybody gets the ability
 
02:53:52.309 --> 02:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
to hunt deer everybody can take a
 
02:53:54.889 --> 02:53:54.899 align:start position:0%
lobster too it's just we limit how they
 
02:53:57.469 --> 02:53:57.479 align:start position:0%
do it for for some of these reasons so
 
02:53:59.269 --> 02:53:59.279 align:start position:0%
let's take an opportunity if we're
 
02:54:01.730 --> 02:54:01.740 align:start position:0%
really looking to address two issues
 
02:54:04.130 --> 02:54:04.140 align:start position:0%
which I think this bill is Ghost traps
 
02:54:06.469 --> 02:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
which I'm a little shaky on the science
 
02:54:08.990 --> 02:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
on that I'm looking at at information
 
02:54:11.690 --> 02:54:11.700 align:start position:0%
that was received from the biologist in
 
02:54:13.190 --> 02:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island who by the way is a
 
02:54:14.929 --> 02:54:14.939 align:start position:0%
recreational diver I'm sure he didn't
 
02:54:16.490 --> 02:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
share that with anyone but he is a
 
02:54:17.929 --> 02:54:17.939 align:start position:0%
recreational diver
 
02:54:19.790 --> 02:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
and then the one for Mass the division
 
02:54:21.590 --> 02:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
chief for mass and with all due respect
 
02:54:23.690 --> 02:54:23.700 align:start position:0%
to both of those States they don't
 
02:54:25.730 --> 02:54:25.740 align:start position:0%
really have other than than Mass has
 
02:54:27.050 --> 02:54:27.060 align:start position:0%
done a little bit of work they don't
 
02:54:28.429 --> 02:54:28.439 align:start position:0%
have a lot of information about this
 
02:54:30.170 --> 02:54:30.180 align:start position:0%
they're all starting to look at it
 
02:54:32.030 --> 02:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
they're all which is great I think New
 
02:54:33.769 --> 02:54:33.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should start to look at it and
 
02:54:35.269 --> 02:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
I heard today for the first time that
 
02:54:37.790 --> 02:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
maybe we are why don't we do that first
 
02:54:40.370 --> 02:54:40.380 align:start position:0%
why don't we look at this first number
 
02:54:43.190 --> 02:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
one this is just a suggestion number two
 
02:54:45.469 --> 02:54:45.479 align:start position:0%
come up with this thing that is in this
 
02:54:47.870 --> 02:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
amendment that talks about I don't even
 
02:54:49.790 --> 02:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
know what it is the regulatory guide
 
02:54:52.010 --> 02:54:52.020 align:start position:0%
program the educational program I'm
 
02:54:53.750 --> 02:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
assuming so that we don't have issues
 
02:54:55.969 --> 02:54:55.979 align:start position:0%
let's create that and and most
 
02:54:55.979 --> 02:54:57.110 align:start position:0%
let's create that and and most
importantly

02:54:57.110 --> 02:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
importantly
 
02:54:59.030 --> 02:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
let's come up with a way to pay for it
 
02:55:01.610 --> 02:55:01.620 align:start position:0%
before we spend it let's come up with a
 
02:55:03.889 --> 02:55:03.899 align:start position:0%
way that we can guarantee the money's
 
02:55:05.750 --> 02:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
going to be available to be used for all
 
02:55:07.130 --> 02:55:07.140 align:start position:0%
the right things which is what we're
 
02:55:09.110 --> 02:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
trying to do here because if there's no
 
02:55:11.809 --> 02:55:11.819 align:start position:0%
money for it we can't do it we can't do
 
02:55:13.969 --> 02:55:13.979 align:start position:0%
it the other thing that I want to stress
 
02:55:15.650 --> 02:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
to you again we talked to all the law
 
02:55:17.389 --> 02:55:17.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies in these states
 
02:55:19.010 --> 02:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
that allow it I talked to the deputy
 
02:55:20.870 --> 02:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
chief Kurt Blanchett in Rhode Island I
 
02:55:24.050 --> 02:55:24.060 align:start position:0%
talked to the Marine Patrol colonel in
 
02:55:25.309 --> 02:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
Maine and by the way the state of Maine
 
02:55:27.110 --> 02:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
will never see this happen and that's
 
02:55:28.610 --> 02:55:28.620 align:start position:0%
the largest Coastline on the New England
 
02:55:30.769 --> 02:55:30.779 align:start position:0%
coast why do you suppose that is if it's
 
02:55:32.630 --> 02:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
such a great idea why is it Maine
 
02:55:34.670 --> 02:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
jumping on board I think there's a
 
02:55:37.490 --> 02:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
reason for that frankly Rhode Island and
 
02:55:39.410 --> 02:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
Mass both have done it both their law
 
02:55:40.969 --> 02:55:40.979 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies told me very
 
02:55:42.469 --> 02:55:42.479 align:start position:0%
similar things the major at Rhode Island
 
02:55:45.830 --> 02:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
said when when this first came to be the
 
02:55:47.630 --> 02:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
lobster populations on the shoreline of
 
02:55:49.070 --> 02:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island were much greater than they
 
02:55:51.830 --> 02:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
are today he blames the warming of our
 
02:55:54.410 --> 02:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
oceans uh and that the fact that the
 
02:55:56.389 --> 02:55:56.399 align:start position:0%
majority of their lobsters are now
 
02:55:58.730 --> 02:55:58.740 align:start position:0%
caught three miles off the coastline so
 
02:56:01.790 --> 02:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
that reduced the ability to catch to
 
02:56:04.010 --> 02:56:04.020 align:start position:0%
catch lobsters diving so he thinks the
 
02:56:05.389 --> 02:56:05.399 align:start position:0%
numbers of the complaints went down
 
02:56:07.250 --> 02:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
because of that he said in its Heyday
 
02:56:09.290 --> 02:56:09.300 align:start position:0%
when the lobsters were popular along the
 
02:56:11.030 --> 02:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
coastline like they are currently in New
 
02:56:11.040 --> 02:56:12.349 align:start position:0%
coastline like they are currently in New
Hampshire

02:56:12.349 --> 02:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:56:14.269 --> 02:56:14.279 align:start position:0%
um that there were numerous conflicts
 
02:56:16.250 --> 02:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts Coastal officer who
 
02:56:18.410 --> 02:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
enforces this and again these are the
 
02:56:20.330 --> 02:56:20.340 align:start position:0%
guys that are going to get the calls for
 
02:56:22.250 --> 02:56:22.260 align:start position:0%
the complaints these are the guys that
 
02:56:23.510 --> 02:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
are going to do the enforcement they're
 
02:56:25.730 --> 02:56:25.740 align:start position:0%
not biologists or division heads they're
 
02:56:27.469 --> 02:56:27.479 align:start position:0%
the people like me they're the people
 
02:56:29.950 --> 02:56:29.960 align:start position:0%
out in the field like like this
 
02:56:32.510 --> 02:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant behind me that are going to
 
02:56:35.269 --> 02:56:35.279 align:start position:0%
be dealing with this you know this will
 
02:56:36.950 --> 02:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
shock you but when they approach divers
 
02:56:38.990 --> 02:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
they dump the lobsters
 
02:56:40.969 --> 02:56:40.979 align:start position:0%
um he can't see what happened I've seen
 
02:56:43.070 --> 02:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
that happen in New Hampshire the one one
 
02:56:45.650 --> 02:56:45.660 align:start position:0%
time I made a lobster diving case a guy
 
02:56:47.330 --> 02:56:47.340 align:start position:0%
came to the surface with a garbage bag
 
02:56:49.130 --> 02:56:49.140 align:start position:0%
full of them I don't know how he did it
 
02:56:50.570 --> 02:56:50.580 align:start position:0%
I don't know if he got him out of traps
 
02:56:52.130 --> 02:56:52.140 align:start position:0%
but he had a garbage bag full of bugs
 
02:56:53.990 --> 02:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
and as we approached him he dumped those
 
02:56:56.030 --> 02:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
luckily he was closer to Shore and we
 
02:56:57.410 --> 02:56:57.420 align:start position:0%
could scrounge those up because if you
 
02:56:58.730 --> 02:56:58.740 align:start position:0%
don't have the evidence you don't have a
 
02:57:00.110 --> 02:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
case obviously
 
02:57:02.630 --> 02:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
so they they tell us that that happens
 
02:57:04.969 --> 02:57:04.979 align:start position:0%
and and the one thing the coastal
 
02:57:07.309 --> 02:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
officer said in Massachusetts
 
02:57:10.670 --> 02:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
was that over half of the checks that he
 
02:57:13.130 --> 02:57:13.140 align:start position:0%
does with lobster diving results in some
 
02:57:15.830 --> 02:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
sort of a violation so it's not uncommon
 
02:57:17.990 --> 02:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
to have that happen what is also a
 
02:57:19.250 --> 02:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
challenge for him would be the same
 
02:57:20.510 --> 02:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
challenge in New Hampshire is you can't
 
02:57:22.550 --> 02:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
prove it folks you can put a paragraph
 
02:57:25.250 --> 02:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
in here a well thought out paragraph and
 
02:57:27.650 --> 02:57:27.660 align:start position:0%
it was the divers will measure these
 
02:57:30.349 --> 02:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
lobsters before they reach the surface
 
02:57:32.570 --> 02:57:32.580 align:start position:0%
you're going to see that
 
02:57:34.969 --> 02:57:34.979 align:start position:0%
no I'm not going to either and there's
 
02:57:36.530 --> 02:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
nobody in this uniform that's going to
 
02:57:38.870 --> 02:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
see that so that's not worth the Papers
 
02:57:40.670 --> 02:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
written because you can't enforce that
 
02:57:42.410 --> 02:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
unless unless you're going to give me
 
02:57:44.570 --> 02:57:44.580 align:start position:0%
extra people and dive tanks we got dive
 
02:57:46.790 --> 02:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
tanks but unless I put dive tanks on
 
02:57:49.010 --> 02:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
them and put them down that's not worth
 
02:57:50.750 --> 02:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
the ink that was used to write it
 
02:57:52.429 --> 02:57:52.439 align:start position:0%
because you can't enforce it how do I
 
02:57:54.349 --> 02:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
prove in a courtroom that he measured
 
02:57:55.849 --> 02:57:55.859 align:start position:0%
those lobsters or that he didn't measure
 
02:57:58.130 --> 02:57:58.140 align:start position:0%
those lobsters you cannot do that don't
 
02:58:00.769 --> 02:58:00.779 align:start position:0%
do that to us please don't give me a law
 
02:58:03.889 --> 02:58:03.899 align:start position:0%
that we can enforce it's ridiculous it's
 
02:58:06.769 --> 02:58:06.779 align:start position:0%
ridiculous and then I would strongly
 
02:58:09.710 --> 02:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
suggest that we separate these issues I
 
02:58:12.410 --> 02:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
think there is some absolute interest on
 
02:58:14.690 --> 02:58:14.700 align:start position:0%
both the divers and the lobster
 
02:58:16.250 --> 02:58:16.260 align:start position:0%
fishermen from what I heard sitting here
 
02:58:17.929 --> 02:58:17.939 align:start position:0%
today and certainly I know there is for
 
02:58:21.889 --> 02:58:21.899 align:start position:0%
my agency to do some research on ghost
 
02:58:23.870 --> 02:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
gear and find more effective ways to
 
02:58:25.490 --> 02:58:25.500 align:start position:0%
clear it from our oceans I think we're
 
02:58:27.349 --> 02:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
all in agreement to that I think there's
 
02:58:29.750 --> 02:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
money to be made for our divers if it's
 
02:58:31.550 --> 02:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
done correctly I think that possibility
 
02:58:33.349 --> 02:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
exists and I and I think that's
 
02:58:35.450 --> 02:58:35.460 align:start position:0%
something that we should think about but
 
02:58:37.849 --> 02:58:37.859 align:start position:0%
separate that from the diving piece of
 
02:58:40.670 --> 02:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
it don't don't couple it with diving in
 
02:58:42.349 --> 02:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
order to get the diving piece passed
 
02:58:44.210 --> 02:58:44.220 align:start position:0%
that's what I feel like happened here
 
02:58:46.790 --> 02:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
those are two separate issues take up
 
02:58:48.889 --> 02:58:48.899 align:start position:0%
diving and discuss the issues take up
 
02:58:50.690 --> 02:58:50.700 align:start position:0%
ghost gear and figure out a way to do
 
02:58:53.389 --> 02:58:53.399 align:start position:0%
that and and make it enforceable for all
 
02:58:55.190 --> 02:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
of us so that what you give me in
 
02:58:56.870 --> 02:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
writing I'll make sure that we follow
 
02:58:59.389 --> 02:58:59.399 align:start position:0%
that's all I'm asking you to do
 
02:59:01.370 --> 02:59:01.380 align:start position:0%
that's all I have
 
02:59:03.530 --> 02:59:03.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Colonel do we have any
 
02:59:07.670 --> 02:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:09.830 --> 02:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
Colonel George
 
02:59:11.769 --> 02:59:11.779 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:59:14.030 --> 02:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
it may surprise you when I was reading
 
02:59:16.070 --> 02:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
this that I thought I was reading two
 
02:59:18.230 --> 02:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
different bills because one is about
 
02:59:20.710 --> 02:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
lobsters and one is about
 
02:59:22.849 --> 02:59:22.859 align:start position:0%
traps and I had to go back to the
 
02:59:25.910 --> 02:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
beginning to see no it's the same bill
 
02:59:28.510 --> 02:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
um so I'm assuming that
 
02:59:31.130 --> 02:59:31.140 align:start position:0%
neither of these sponsors was in touch
 
02:59:31.140 --> 02:59:32.330 align:start position:0%
neither of these sponsors was in touch
with

02:59:32.330 --> 02:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:59:35.030 --> 02:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
um fish and game as this bill was being
 
02:59:38.630 --> 02:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
crafted to maybe alleviate some of the
 
02:59:40.370 --> 02:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
questions that you have brought forth
 
02:59:41.990 --> 02:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
well I don't want to say they weren't in
 
02:59:43.490 --> 02:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
touch with fishing game I could tell you
 
02:59:45.889 --> 02:59:45.899 align:start position:0%
uh clearly no one was in touch with
 
02:59:47.809 --> 02:59:47.819 align:start position:0%
anyone from law enforcement no one was
 
02:59:49.490 --> 02:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
in touch with us I don't I think there
 
02:59:52.190 --> 02:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
was some contact very early on with our
 
02:59:54.290 --> 02:59:54.300 align:start position:0%
marine biologists but I but I don't
 
02:59:56.809 --> 02:59:56.819 align:start position:0%
certainly we weren't contact not the and
 
02:59:58.910 --> 02:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't please don't take that
 
03:00:01.190 --> 03:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
to mean that I'm an expert I don't need
 
03:00:03.469 --> 03:00:03.479 align:start position:0%
to be contacted I'm just saying let's
 
03:00:05.990 --> 03:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
write one that we can enforce that's the
 
03:00:08.210 --> 03:00:08.220 align:start position:0%
you give me good laws 90 of the time
 
03:00:10.190 --> 03:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
let's not let's not spoil that with this
 
03:00:12.410 --> 03:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
and people behind me that don't do law
 
03:00:13.849 --> 03:00:13.859 align:start position:0%
enforcement tell you this is a good law
 
03:00:15.349 --> 03:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
it's because they don't do law
 
03:00:17.450 --> 03:00:17.460 align:start position:0%
enforcement because it's not a good law
 
03:00:19.309 --> 03:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
it's a mess
 
03:00:21.650 --> 03:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
so so maybe some contact might have
 
03:00:23.150 --> 03:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
helped follow up
 
03:00:25.370 --> 03:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
thank you no I'm done
 
03:00:27.730 --> 03:00:27.740 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
03:00:29.809 --> 03:00:29.819 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you Mr
 
03:00:31.190 --> 03:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Colonel for your
 
03:00:33.410 --> 03:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
yes sir let me ask you a question you
 
03:00:35.030 --> 03:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
said you have a list of items in front
 
03:00:37.730 --> 03:00:37.740 align:start position:0%
of you uh on could you supply that to
 
03:00:39.530 --> 03:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
the committee please we can do that I'd
 
03:00:41.389 --> 03:00:41.399 align:start position:0%
rather go back and clean it up but I'll
 
03:00:42.889 --> 03:00:42.899 align:start position:0%
get it to you some of the issues that we
 
03:00:45.769 --> 03:00:45.779 align:start position:0%
had yes we have uh 30
 
03:00:49.849 --> 03:00:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:52.309 --> 03:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
23 excuse me 23 different points that
 
03:00:53.870 --> 03:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
we're questioning yes okay with
 
03:00:55.910 --> 03:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
different verbiage and and things like
 
03:00:57.650 --> 03:00:57.660 align:start position:0%
that thank you Eric and this is for the
 
03:00:59.210 --> 03:00:59.220 align:start position:0%
chair can we take a five minute recess
 
03:01:01.130 --> 03:01:01.140 align:start position:0%
before we go uh out of the public
 
03:01:02.870 --> 03:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
hearing before we go into the exact
 
03:01:02.880 --> 03:01:04.190 align:start position:0%
hearing before we go into the exact
session

03:01:04.190 --> 03:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
session
 
03:01:06.230 --> 03:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to be going into the exact
 
03:01:08.150 --> 03:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
session and recessing it to a Time
 
03:01:10.070 --> 03:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
certain so that we can eat lunch and
 
03:01:11.870 --> 03:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
then we'll be back so you'll have plenty
 
03:01:16.490 --> 03:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
of time to do anything thank you
 
03:01:18.769 --> 03:01:18.779 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
03:01:21.950 --> 03:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
representative Brown thank you Mr chair
 
03:01:23.630 --> 03:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question yes sir
 
03:01:25.070 --> 03:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
it's not quite related to what you were
 
03:01:27.469 --> 03:01:27.479 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
03:01:29.870 --> 03:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
is Fish and Game responsible for
 
03:01:33.530 --> 03:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
managing where divers can be and have
 
03:01:34.670 --> 03:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
you had any complaints about
 
03:01:36.590 --> 03:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
interactions between lobstermen and
 
03:01:38.690 --> 03:01:38.700 align:start position:0%
recreational diving regardless of what
 
03:01:41.870 --> 03:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
of of this spill online yes so I well
 
03:01:43.730 --> 03:01:43.740 align:start position:0%
the first question is we don't really
 
03:01:45.950 --> 03:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
regulate where they can be I can't think
 
03:01:47.990 --> 03:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
of any place that we do that because
 
03:01:49.490 --> 03:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
currently in New Hampshire they can go
 
03:01:51.469 --> 03:01:51.479 align:start position:0%
wherever they want but in regards to
 
03:01:54.230 --> 03:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
that in this bill that creates some
 
03:01:56.210 --> 03:01:56.220 align:start position:0%
concerns that that representative Khan
 
03:01:58.370 --> 03:01:58.380 align:start position:0%
brings up is it you know if you're going
 
03:02:00.950 --> 03:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
to set up zones the most difficult job
 
03:02:03.530 --> 03:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
we have is boundaries on zones that's
 
03:02:06.170 --> 03:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
why we use highways uh I don't know how
 
03:02:07.910 --> 03:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
you do it in the ocean you'd have to
 
03:02:09.530 --> 03:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
you'd have to have some sort of a
 
03:02:11.690 --> 03:02:11.700 align:start position:0%
landmark for them to understand are you
 
03:02:13.070 --> 03:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
going to create criminals out of some of
 
03:02:14.450 --> 03:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
them and the other problem that you're
 
03:02:15.410 --> 03:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
going to get into is you're going to get
 
03:02:16.969 --> 03:02:16.979 align:start position:0%
into conflicts with some of the towns
 
03:02:18.889 --> 03:02:18.899 align:start position:0%
and cities that own the property where
 
03:02:21.050 --> 03:02:21.060 align:start position:0%
this would begin we don't have authority
 
03:02:23.330 --> 03:02:23.340 align:start position:0%
there I do get complaints from
 
03:02:25.309 --> 03:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
lobsterman not a lot of them but I do
 
03:02:27.050 --> 03:02:27.060 align:start position:0%
get complaints from losterman that
 
03:02:30.530 --> 03:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
divers uh are hitting our traps we used
 
03:02:32.570 --> 03:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
to get it a lot more than we get now the
 
03:02:34.370 --> 03:02:34.380 align:start position:0%
one advantage I have with that sir is
 
03:02:36.349 --> 03:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
that's something I can enforce because I
 
03:02:38.809 --> 03:02:38.819 align:start position:0%
can find out where his traps are and I
 
03:02:40.790 --> 03:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
can set up surveillance on those traps
 
03:02:43.250 --> 03:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
or set up surveillance in that area and
 
03:02:45.950 --> 03:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
check divers if I see them if I have a
 
03:02:47.929 --> 03:02:47.939 align:start position:0%
diver who's randomly hitting traps the
 
03:02:49.370 --> 03:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
only way I'm going to know that is if
 
03:02:51.230 --> 03:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
I'm under the water with him with tanks
 
03:02:53.990 --> 03:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the concern I and I
 
03:02:56.510 --> 03:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
don't you know I want to I'm always
 
03:02:58.250 --> 03:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
concerned about the people that attend
 
03:02:59.690 --> 03:02:59.700 align:start position:0%
these hearings because these are not
 
03:03:01.610 --> 03:03:01.620 align:start position:0%
criminals behind me you've got divers
 
03:03:03.530 --> 03:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
here who I can tell you from listening
 
03:03:05.150 --> 03:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
to them are very qualified and very good
 
03:03:06.769 --> 03:03:06.779 align:start position:0%
individuals those are not the
 
03:03:08.389 --> 03:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
individuals I'm going to be chasing just
 
03:03:10.190 --> 03:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
like these lobstermen on those people
 
03:03:11.750 --> 03:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
don't come to those hearings to these
 
03:03:13.849 --> 03:03:13.859 align:start position:0%
hearings the people that I chase
 
03:03:15.830 --> 03:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
um and I will tell you if I told my
 
03:03:17.990 --> 03:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
officers to stop working nights no more
 
03:03:19.550 --> 03:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
working nights you go home at five
 
03:03:21.469 --> 03:03:21.479 align:start position:0%
o'clock every night in November deer
 
03:03:23.630 --> 03:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
season 2 you go out at night I can
 
03:03:25.010 --> 03:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
guarantee you at the end of that season
 
03:03:26.870 --> 03:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
I can come in here with all honesty and
 
03:03:27.889 --> 03:03:27.899 align:start position:0%
say we're not having a problem with
 
03:03:29.210 --> 03:03:29.220 align:start position:0%
night hunting we're not having any
 
03:03:30.950 --> 03:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
poaching going on you know why that is
 
03:03:33.349 --> 03:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
folks because we don't know about it we
 
03:03:34.969 --> 03:03:34.979 align:start position:0%
don't know about it when I know for a
 
03:03:36.650 --> 03:03:36.660 align:start position:0%
fact it is a problem
 
03:03:38.630 --> 03:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
um so those are the things I'm asking
 
03:03:40.849 --> 03:03:40.859 align:start position:0%
you to consider
 
03:03:43.910 --> 03:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
03:03:46.309 --> 03:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
03:03:49.610 --> 03:03:49.620 align:start position:0%
and uh if there's nobody else in the
 
03:03:52.070 --> 03:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
audience who has yet to speak that needs
 
03:03:53.210 --> 03:03:53.220 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
03:03:55.550 --> 03:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm going to close the
 
03:03:57.230 --> 03:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
03:03:57.240 --> 03:04:00.130 align:start position:0%
hearing on
Amendment

03:04:09.670 --> 03:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
I am now opening the exec session for
 
03:04:09.680 --> 03:04:11.230 align:start position:0%
I am now opening the exec session for
HB

03:04:11.230 --> 03:04:11.240 align:start position:0%
HB
 
03:04:16.309 --> 03:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
442fn and any Associated amendments
 
03:04:18.710 --> 03:04:18.720 align:start position:0%

04:14:46.189 --> 04:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
I'll second it myself so we can continue

04:15:10.610 --> 04:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
and do I have a second on that
 
04:15:15.590 --> 04:15:15.600 align:start position:0%

the amendment is now open for discussion
 
04:15:20.809 --> 04:15:20.819 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open the floor here for
 
04:15:24.530 --> 04:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
discussion does anybody want to go first
 
04:15:28.910 --> 04:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:31.309 --> 04:15:31.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:15:32.570 --> 04:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:15:34.250 --> 04:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
after hearing
 
04:15:37.130 --> 04:15:37.140 align:start position:0%
a number of
 
04:15:39.410 --> 04:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
instances of problems with this
 
04:15:39.420 --> 04:15:40.729 align:start position:0%
instances of problems with this
amendment

04:15:40.729 --> 04:15:40.739 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:15:43.910 --> 04:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
I as one cannot support this being in
 
04:15:45.410 --> 04:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
the house as long as they have it's
 
04:15:48.710 --> 04:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:50.750 --> 04:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
on the Committees I've been on to pass
 
04:15:52.910 --> 04:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
legislation that is ready for prime time
 
04:15:56.389 --> 04:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
and this by no means is ready for Prime
 
04:15:58.550 --> 04:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
Time listening to the issues that were
 
04:16:00.950 --> 04:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
brought before us
 
04:16:02.990 --> 04:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
um I I came
 
04:16:04.910 --> 04:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
go down all of them
 
04:16:07.490 --> 04:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
um we'd be here a while
 
04:16:09.410 --> 04:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
but I mean
 
04:16:11.510 --> 04:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
some of the main ones I look at are just
 
04:16:16.550 --> 04:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
looking on page one line 30 down to 32.
 
04:16:16.560 --> 04:16:17.809 align:start position:0%
looking on page one line 30 down to 32.
um

04:16:17.809 --> 04:16:17.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:21.349 --> 04:16:21.359 align:start position:0%
especially specifically line 3132 and on
 
04:16:23.330 --> 04:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
to page two when it says all areas
 
04:16:25.610 --> 04:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
outside zones shall be restricted to
 
04:16:27.650 --> 04:16:27.660 align:start position:0%
harvesting Lobsters by those with a
 
04:16:29.330 --> 04:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
scuba diver license
 
04:16:32.450 --> 04:16:32.460 align:start position:0%
tells me the way that's worded is
 
04:16:34.189 --> 04:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
the only ones outside the permitted
 
04:16:34.199 --> 04:16:36.710 align:start position:0%
the only ones outside the permitted
zones

04:16:36.710 --> 04:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:40.189 --> 04:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
to get lobsters or scuba divers
 
04:16:42.889 --> 04:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
it will prohibit those
 
04:16:46.729 --> 04:16:46.739 align:start position:0%
that do love commercial lobstering
 
04:16:50.750 --> 04:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:53.210 --> 04:16:53.220 align:start position:0%
I can't support that this has to be
 
04:16:55.189 --> 04:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
worded much better I mean we heard from
 
04:16:57.110 --> 04:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
the colonel earlier it's all about
 
04:16:58.729 --> 04:16:58.739 align:start position:0%
interpretation and how it's put into
 
04:16:58.739 --> 04:16:59.870 align:start position:0%
interpretation and how it's put into
language

04:16:59.870 --> 04:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
language
 
04:17:03.590 --> 04:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
and this the way I read it specifically
 
04:17:05.510 --> 04:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
puts that zone
 
04:17:07.610 --> 04:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
into scuba diving only anything outside
 
04:17:09.110 --> 04:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
the zone
 
04:17:13.429 --> 04:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:15.710 --> 04:17:15.720 align:start position:0%
make zones for the
 
04:17:21.050 --> 04:17:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:23.150 --> 04:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know how you
 
04:17:27.710 --> 04:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
make a Zone on a body of water
 
04:17:31.610 --> 04:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
other than GPS coordinates which I heard
 
04:17:34.550 --> 04:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
when I specifically asked GPS doesn't
 
04:17:36.530 --> 04:17:36.540 align:start position:0%
work underwater
 
04:17:38.750 --> 04:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
because there are no fence lines there
 
04:17:41.030 --> 04:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
are no Border Lines there are no
 
04:17:43.250 --> 04:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
markings out in the ocean to determine
 
04:17:45.830 --> 04:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
where that
 
04:17:48.710 --> 04:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
body of water is that you can take
 
04:17:53.809 --> 04:17:53.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:57.170 --> 04:17:57.180 align:start position:0%
then I can go on to line nine on page
 
04:17:57.180 --> 04:17:58.910 align:start position:0%
then I can go on to line nine on page
two

04:17:58.910 --> 04:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:18:01.429 --> 04:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
that tell us how a scuba diver
 
04:18:04.130 --> 04:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
Recreation license how they will go by
 
04:18:06.710 --> 04:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
the legal size and Provisions
 
04:18:10.910 --> 04:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:13.010 --> 04:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
and when I look at those rsas and I
 
04:18:16.550 --> 04:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
looked at the rsas in statute
 
04:18:18.710 --> 04:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
as it was being discussed and I heard a
 
04:18:21.889 --> 04:18:21.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:25.429 --> 04:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
I think two of the most specific ones
 
04:18:27.229 --> 04:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
the and most important ones that were
 
04:18:28.729 --> 04:18:28.739 align:start position:0%
left out
 
04:18:30.590 --> 04:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
were ones dealing with spawning with
 
04:18:35.630 --> 04:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:37.729 --> 04:18:37.739 align:start position:0%
without those in here
 
04:18:39.530 --> 04:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing it could be taken that if
 
04:18:42.170 --> 04:18:42.180 align:start position:0%
someone comes up with a lobster
 
04:18:44.330 --> 04:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
egg producing Lobster
 
04:18:45.830 --> 04:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
they could legally take that because
 
04:18:47.750 --> 04:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's not specific in this language that
 
04:18:49.729 --> 04:18:49.739 align:start position:0%
is prohibited
 
04:18:55.729 --> 04:18:55.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:02.090 --> 04:19:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:06.650 --> 04:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
lines 27 on page two talking about
 
04:19:10.670 --> 04:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:13.550 --> 04:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know where that is
 
04:19:15.349 --> 04:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if it's even a statue what
 
04:19:17.269 --> 04:19:17.279 align:start position:0%
e regulation is
 
04:19:22.370 --> 04:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:24.769 --> 04:19:24.779 align:start position:0%
we heard about interfering with lobster
 
04:19:30.769 --> 04:19:30.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:33.469 --> 04:19:33.479 align:start position:0%
I go down to page three right at the
 
04:19:37.490 --> 04:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
bottom lines 34 through 37 there are
 
04:19:37.500 --> 04:19:38.689 align:start position:0%
bottom lines 34 through 37 there are
four

04:19:38.689 --> 04:19:38.699 align:start position:0%
four
 
04:19:41.269 --> 04:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
rsa's referenced there
 
04:19:43.490 --> 04:19:43.500 align:start position:0%

04:19:45.229 --> 04:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
any person who holds a license to take
 
04:19:47.450 --> 04:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
lobster under and there's four overseas
 
04:19:47.460 --> 04:19:50.090 align:start position:0%
lobster under and there's four overseas
listed

04:19:50.090 --> 04:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:52.070 --> 04:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
while it was being discussed I pulled up
 
04:19:54.650 --> 04:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
those four rsas
 
04:19:57.050 --> 04:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
and what does it say in the rsas
 
04:19:59.150 --> 04:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
one's a non-residential commercial salt
 
04:20:04.550 --> 04:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:10.429 --> 04:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:13.969 --> 04:20:13.979 align:start position:0%
it is RSA
 
04:20:15.889 --> 04:20:15.899 align:start position:0%
it's line
 
04:20:18.170 --> 04:20:18.180 align:start position:0%
page three line
 
04:20:24.769 --> 04:20:24.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:26.929 --> 04:20:26.939 align:start position:0%
it comes back and it says specifically
 
04:20:29.809 --> 04:20:29.819 align:start position:0%
this license shall not include the
 
04:20:32.210 --> 04:20:32.220 align:start position:0%
taking possession Landing or transport
 
04:20:34.910 --> 04:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
of Northern shrimp which requires a
 
04:20:38.510 --> 04:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
license on RSA to 1149e or The Taking of
 
04:20:40.370 --> 04:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
lobsters and crab which requires this
 
04:20:40.380 --> 04:20:41.330 align:start position:0%
lobsters and crab which requires this
license

04:20:41.330 --> 04:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:20:44.330 --> 04:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
so it's referring to a license that is
 
04:20:49.309 --> 04:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:51.110 --> 04:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure in all four of these
 
04:20:52.670 --> 04:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
that are referenced in here specifically
 
04:20:55.189 --> 04:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
at the end of the statute say are not
 
04:21:10.610 --> 04:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:15.530 --> 04:21:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:17.570 --> 04:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
the other issue that I see is on page
 
04:21:17.580 --> 04:21:19.070 align:start position:0%
the other issue that I see is on page
four

04:21:19.070 --> 04:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
four
 
04:21:22.729 --> 04:21:22.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:24.229 --> 04:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
or traps that are attached and
 
04:21:26.330 --> 04:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
retrievable no person except the owner
 
04:21:29.990 --> 04:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
someone authorized by the owner
 
04:21:31.910 --> 04:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
and that right there throws up a red
 
04:21:35.510 --> 04:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:39.710 --> 04:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
if you have the license for the traps
 
04:21:42.050 --> 04:21:42.060 align:start position:0%
we don't have a designated Lobster
 
04:21:44.990 --> 04:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
license you cannot sit there and say
 
04:21:47.870 --> 04:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have the license for these
 
04:21:47.880 --> 04:21:49.309 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have the license for these
traps

04:21:49.309 --> 04:21:49.319 align:start position:0%
traps
 
04:21:50.630 --> 04:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to give permission to so
 
04:21:52.670 --> 04:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
and so to go out and check my traps
 
04:21:57.170 --> 04:21:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:59.210 --> 04:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
I can't support that
 
04:22:01.910 --> 04:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
this language was in there for a reason
 
04:22:04.790 --> 04:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
that only the owner
 
04:22:07.250 --> 04:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
or fishing game
 
04:22:09.530 --> 04:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
can go out there or someone authorized
 
04:22:11.450 --> 04:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
by the department
 
04:22:13.849 --> 04:22:13.859 align:start position:0%
you're sitting here allowing a back door
 
04:22:16.250 --> 04:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
for someone to allow someone else to
 
04:22:18.290 --> 04:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
tend their traps
 
04:22:22.490 --> 04:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:24.229 --> 04:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
and then the final point I'll final
 
04:22:26.570 --> 04:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
thing I'll point out before I go and
 
04:22:28.550 --> 04:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
then I'll be done and there's more in
 
04:22:30.889 --> 04:22:30.899 align:start position:0%
here that I could go for go against but
 
04:22:32.269 --> 04:22:32.279 align:start position:0%
these are some of the main sticking
 
04:22:39.469 --> 04:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:41.030 --> 04:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
when I look at
 
04:22:43.969 --> 04:22:43.979 align:start position:0%
line 15 on page four
 
04:22:47.030 --> 04:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
it says any person who identifies a pot
 
04:22:49.070 --> 04:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
trap car that
 
04:22:50.269 --> 04:22:50.279 align:start position:0%
except for the taking holding the
 
04:22:52.429 --> 04:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
lobster the crab and such is
 
04:22:55.610 --> 04:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
to item is unattached to a boy or in
 
04:22:58.010 --> 04:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
retrievable by normal medical genes and
 
04:23:02.389 --> 04:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:05.689 --> 04:23:05.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:08.030 --> 04:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
so if I'm walking on Hampton Beach I
 
04:23:09.710 --> 04:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
walk by a trap
 
04:23:11.570 --> 04:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
am I in trouble for not reporting as
 
04:23:13.010 --> 04:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
soon as possible the fishing game that I
 
04:23:21.650 --> 04:23:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:24.290 --> 04:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons I mean as what I
 
04:23:26.030 --> 04:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
can see is
 
04:23:26.040 --> 04:23:27.170 align:start position:0%
can see is
if

04:23:27.170 --> 04:23:27.180 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:23:29.750 --> 04:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
at all we take a vote on this it needs a
 
04:23:31.729 --> 04:23:31.739 align:start position:0%
lot of cleanup
 
04:23:33.889 --> 04:23:33.899 align:start position:0%
so for that those reasons mentioned I
 
04:23:36.050 --> 04:23:36.060 align:start position:0%
can't support this amendment
 
04:23:38.389 --> 04:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Vice chair
 
04:23:40.490 --> 04:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
anyone else want to weigh in on the
 
04:23:45.290 --> 04:23:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:48.410 --> 04:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
I know I've come late to the party but I
 
04:23:49.849 --> 04:23:49.859 align:start position:0%
just had a couple of questions and maybe
 
04:23:51.769 --> 04:23:51.779 align:start position:0%
they were already answered and I and I
 
04:23:53.929 --> 04:23:53.939 align:start position:0%
apologize if they were
 
04:23:56.570 --> 04:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
um how can it be determined whether a
 
04:24:00.170 --> 04:24:00.180 align:start position:0%
lobster was taken from a trap or not
 
04:24:03.469 --> 04:24:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:05.450 --> 04:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
do you mean
 
04:24:07.910 --> 04:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
that a diver took a lobster from a trap
 
04:24:10.969 --> 04:24:10.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:14.689 --> 04:24:14.699 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony from uh a large
 
04:24:16.370 --> 04:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
portion of the diving Community saying
 
04:24:17.750 --> 04:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't do that because it's
 
04:24:20.450 --> 04:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
not sporting and and they are not
 
04:24:22.490 --> 04:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
there to steal and that like any other
 
04:24:24.170 --> 04:24:24.180 align:start position:0%
community there may be some bad apples
 
04:24:25.910 --> 04:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
but that the majority of them are
 
04:24:28.309 --> 04:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
concerned about the
 
04:24:31.250 --> 04:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
Ocean's floor and they're down there for
 
04:24:33.170 --> 04:24:33.180 align:start position:0%
the sport and that the catching of the
 
04:24:34.610 --> 04:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
Lobster by stealing it from someone
 
04:24:36.710 --> 04:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
else's pot is not sporting and they
 
04:24:38.750 --> 04:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do it we heard testimony on the
 
04:24:41.030 --> 04:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
other side from uh fish and game saying
 
04:24:42.290 --> 04:24:42.300 align:start position:0%
that they can't see any of that and they
 
04:24:44.570 --> 04:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
can't they can't tell whether that is
 
04:24:46.189 --> 04:24:46.199 align:start position:0%
enforceable or not
 
04:24:58.729 --> 04:24:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:01.130 --> 04:25:01.140 align:start position:0%
as far as uh you know there are no
 
04:25:04.070 --> 04:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
they're responsible and they wouldn't do
 
04:25:05.870 --> 04:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
that and there's you know well I would
 
04:25:08.990 --> 04:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
also point out that currently uh divers
 
04:25:10.670 --> 04:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
are allowed to die for crab and they're
 
04:25:12.650 --> 04:25:12.660 align:start position:0%
allowed to die for scallops
 
04:25:15.170 --> 04:25:15.180 align:start position:0%
and if they need to be checked they get
 
04:25:16.309 --> 04:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
checked when they come out of the water
 
04:25:17.450 --> 04:25:17.460 align:start position:0%
not while they're in the water
 
04:25:17.460 --> 04:25:22.969 align:start position:0%
not while they're in the water
underwater

04:25:22.969 --> 04:25:22.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:24.710 --> 04:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey
 
04:25:26.809 --> 04:25:26.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:25:28.309 --> 04:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
um I won't be supporting this bill
 
04:25:28.319 --> 04:25:29.469 align:start position:0%
um I won't be supporting this bill
either

04:25:29.469 --> 04:25:29.479 align:start position:0%
either
 
04:25:34.309 --> 04:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
my main objection to it is the cost that
 
04:25:37.429 --> 04:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
it's going to incur on to fish and game
 
04:25:39.830 --> 04:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
this is my seventh year on this
 
04:25:41.809 --> 04:25:41.819 align:start position:0%
committee it's my first choice all of
 
04:25:45.649 --> 04:25:45.659 align:start position:0%
those years I am very much in support of
 
04:25:47.570 --> 04:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
our Fish and Game Commission they do a a
 
04:25:49.729 --> 04:25:49.739 align:start position:0%
wonderful job
 
04:25:52.630 --> 04:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
um with the the resources that they have
 
04:25:57.170 --> 04:25:57.180 align:start position:0%
and if you look at lines 27 through 31
 
04:26:01.250 --> 04:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
on the third page this is asking them to
 
04:26:04.309 --> 04:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
set up a registration system for the
 
04:26:06.050 --> 04:26:06.060 align:start position:0%
taking of lobsters which they don't have
 
04:26:08.389 --> 04:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
right now and we heard Colonel Jordan
 
04:26:10.370 --> 04:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
say that they've been working on an
 
04:26:13.250 --> 04:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
online registration for two years for
 
04:26:13.260 --> 04:26:14.170 align:start position:0%
online registration for two years for
your

04:26:14.170 --> 04:26:14.180 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:26:17.090 --> 04:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
off-road vehicle and that
 
04:26:19.490 --> 04:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
so far it hasn't even happened yet but
 
04:26:21.590 --> 04:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
so far that expense has been thirty
 
04:26:22.969 --> 04:26:22.979 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
04:26:25.849 --> 04:26:25.859 align:start position:0%
I know from my seven years here on Fish
 
04:26:27.229 --> 04:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
and Game
 
04:26:29.929 --> 04:26:29.939 align:start position:0%
the commission doesn't have thirty
 
04:26:33.349 --> 04:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars just laying around for
 
04:26:36.110 --> 04:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
um these kinds of purposes and they
 
04:26:38.149 --> 04:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
don't get money from the general fund to
 
04:26:39.170 --> 04:26:39.180 align:start position:0%
fund these kind of things there's
 
04:26:40.969 --> 04:26:40.979 align:start position:0%
nothing in here that
 
04:26:43.189 --> 04:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
um alludes to them getting any money to
 
04:26:45.110 --> 04:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
take care of some of these unfunded
 
04:26:48.050 --> 04:26:48.060 align:start position:0%
mandates that's just one of them but I
 
04:26:49.610 --> 04:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
know that there were many others that we
 
04:26:52.610 --> 04:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
heard as the morning progressed of other
 
04:26:54.769 --> 04:26:54.779 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandates and
 
04:26:57.769 --> 04:26:57.779 align:start position:0%
um you know I just know from my time
 
04:27:00.170 --> 04:27:00.180 align:start position:0%
being on this committee fishing game
 
04:27:02.750 --> 04:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
just doesn't have that kind of money to
 
04:27:02.760 --> 04:27:03.950 align:start position:0%
just doesn't have that kind of money to
be

04:27:03.950 --> 04:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:27:05.689 --> 04:27:05.699 align:start position:0%
um spending on these kind of projects
 
04:27:09.610 --> 04:27:09.620 align:start position:0%
and I think we as legislators need to be
 
04:27:12.830 --> 04:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
conscious of that we need to be aware of
 
04:27:14.870 --> 04:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
that and we need to be respectful of
 
04:27:17.510 --> 04:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
that and not keep asking them to do more
 
04:27:19.370 --> 04:27:19.380 align:start position:0%
and more and more with less and less and
 
04:27:19.380 --> 04:27:20.450 align:start position:0%
and more and more with less and less and
less

04:27:20.450 --> 04:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
less
 
04:27:22.790 --> 04:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
um so just from a financial standpoint
 
04:27:24.370 --> 04:27:24.380 align:start position:0%
as as
 
04:27:26.630 --> 04:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
along with all of the other things that
 
04:27:28.429 --> 04:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
are wrong with this scale but just from
 
04:27:30.889 --> 04:27:30.899 align:start position:0%
a financial standpoint it's just not a
 
04:27:33.170 --> 04:27:33.180 align:start position:0%
bill that we should be supporting thank
 
04:27:33.180 --> 04:27:35.030 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman
 
04:27:49.790 --> 04:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
I also cannot support this amendment the
 
04:27:52.309 --> 04:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
way it was amended
 
04:27:57.889 --> 04:27:57.899 align:start position:0%
I I heard the passionate testimony from
 
04:28:00.590 --> 04:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
the chief law uh enforcement officer
 
04:28:02.149 --> 04:28:02.159 align:start position:0%

regulations very successfully we heard
 
04:28:28.429 --> 04:28:28.439 align:start position:0%
that if this one passes is going to
 
04:28:30.590 --> 04:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
disrupt their whole department because
 
04:28:32.349 --> 04:28:32.359 align:start position:0%
they don't have enough money not enough
 
04:28:36.349 --> 04:28:36.359 align:start position:0%

thank you representative representative
Rosner

04:29:38.809 --> 04:29:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:41.830 --> 04:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
um I am going to not support this bill
 
04:29:45.170 --> 04:29:45.180 align:start position:0%
for many of the aforementioned reasons
 
04:29:47.809 --> 04:29:47.819 align:start position:0%
especially considering that we have so
 
04:29:50.990 --> 04:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
many unfunded mandates that are being
 
04:29:53.090 --> 04:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
proposed with this amendment in this
 
04:29:56.269 --> 04:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
bill let alone the
 
04:30:00.050 --> 04:30:00.060 align:start position:0%
I feel like the verbiage uh whether it
 
04:30:02.750 --> 04:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
is confusing or not thoroughly defined I
 
04:30:05.149 --> 04:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
think puts an unnecessary burden on Fish
 
04:30:07.250 --> 04:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
and Game to not only put this into
 
04:30:09.170 --> 04:30:09.180 align:start position:0%
effect but then to continue to try and
 
04:30:11.330 --> 04:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
enforce these regulations
 
04:30:13.250 --> 04:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
um I find that that's going to be not
 
04:30:13.260 --> 04:30:14.750 align:start position:0%
um I find that that's going to be not
only

04:30:14.750 --> 04:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
only
 
04:30:17.990 --> 04:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
um a waste of our resources in time but
 
04:30:19.790 --> 04:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
also in money
 
04:30:22.250 --> 04:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
um I think that the issues that this
 
04:30:24.710 --> 04:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to address are are very
 
04:30:26.870 --> 04:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
positive and I wish I could support it
 
04:30:29.330 --> 04:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
but I don't feel that the text here is
 
04:30:31.969 --> 04:30:31.979 align:start position:0%
actually going to accomplish the end
 
04:30:34.849 --> 04:30:34.859 align:start position:0%
goals that it has destined it has
 
04:30:38.450 --> 04:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
determined to try and resolve
 
04:30:41.570 --> 04:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
thank you representative rosener anybody
 
04:30:43.790 --> 04:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
else I'm going to let people haven't
 
04:30:46.149 --> 04:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
spoken yet first speak if that's okay
 
04:30:49.130 --> 04:30:49.140 align:start position:0%
representative Hill
 
04:30:51.950 --> 04:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:30:54.469 --> 04:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
in full disclosure you'll see my name at
 
04:30:56.510 --> 04:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
the top of this amendment
 
04:30:56.520 --> 04:30:57.889 align:start position:0%
the top of this amendment
um

04:30:57.889 --> 04:30:57.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:00.590 --> 04:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
don't let that influence you
 
04:31:03.649 --> 04:31:03.659 align:start position:0%
um some of these some of the comments
 
04:31:06.590 --> 04:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
that were made earlier I would like to
 
04:31:10.849 --> 04:31:10.859 align:start position:0%
to point out and I think it's
 
04:31:13.429 --> 04:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
I have seen quite a few bills in my time
 
04:31:16.130 --> 04:31:16.140 align:start position:0%
here since 2010
 
04:31:19.790 --> 04:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
that sitting on enrolled bills that
 
04:31:22.490 --> 04:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
we've had to change a number of things
 
04:31:25.070 --> 04:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
or a number of wordings when when
 
04:31:28.849 --> 04:31:28.859 align:start position:0%
language has been um used in different
 
04:31:32.750 --> 04:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
places but is synonymous I think some of
 
04:31:34.610 --> 04:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
those would be occurring here if we
 
04:31:37.309 --> 04:31:37.319 align:start position:0%
don't fix them in in some of the other
 
04:31:39.530 --> 04:31:39.540 align:start position:0%
stages we have before we get to that
 
04:31:39.540 --> 04:31:40.750 align:start position:0%
stages we have before we get to that
point

04:31:40.750 --> 04:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:31:43.670 --> 04:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
first one I can point out I think is
 
04:31:45.590 --> 04:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
actually a typographical error if I look
 
04:31:48.490 --> 04:31:48.500 align:start position:0%
at the at the original
 
04:31:51.110 --> 04:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
not typographical what's the word I'm
 
04:31:52.550 --> 04:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
looking for when they put in a different
 
04:31:54.830 --> 04:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
different word than what we had asked
 
04:31:57.110 --> 04:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
for I don't know
 
04:32:01.610 --> 04:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
thank you so uh the word two online
 
04:32:07.370 --> 04:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:10.550 --> 04:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
so I think that
 
04:32:12.349 --> 04:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
helps a little bit I really don't want
 
04:32:15.110 --> 04:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
to go Point by Point here but there are
 
04:32:18.410 --> 04:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
a couple of things that were that are
 
04:32:20.689 --> 04:32:20.699 align:start position:0%
merely I don't know
 
04:32:22.969 --> 04:32:22.979 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether it was a
 
04:32:26.750 --> 04:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
translation era or a fact that we were
 
04:32:26.760 --> 04:32:27.769 align:start position:0%
translation era or a fact that we were
dealing

04:32:27.769 --> 04:32:27.779 align:start position:0%
dealing
 
04:32:31.070 --> 04:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
um with someone unfamiliar with the
 
04:32:33.590 --> 04:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
language and fish and game when we got
 
04:32:35.990 --> 04:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
to writing the amendment but some of
 
04:32:38.710 --> 04:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
these things are are more just
 
04:32:41.750 --> 04:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
terminology that is currently used I
 
04:32:43.670 --> 04:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
think I made a note
 
04:32:45.950 --> 04:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
while Colonel Jordan was speaking
 
04:32:49.550 --> 04:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
earlier in testimony that there was a
 
04:32:53.510 --> 04:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
word that's generally used
 
04:32:53.520 --> 04:32:54.229 align:start position:0%
word that's generally used
um

04:32:54.229 --> 04:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:57.110 --> 04:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
and not used in this bill and and he
 
04:33:00.590 --> 04:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
pointed that out I made notes of uh of
 
04:33:00.600 --> 04:33:01.510 align:start position:0%
pointed that out I made notes of uh of
all

04:33:01.510 --> 04:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:33:04.910 --> 04:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
yeah that was the that was the one Plain
 
04:33:07.310 --> 04:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
Sight thank you Mr chairman
 
04:33:07.320 --> 04:33:08.269 align:start position:0%
Sight thank you Mr chairman
um

04:33:08.269 --> 04:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:10.609 --> 04:33:10.619 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of those things
 
04:33:13.250 --> 04:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
um so I I'm if anything I'm going to
 
04:33:15.470 --> 04:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
blame uh the fact that they're
 
04:33:18.109 --> 04:33:18.119 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar with pure efficient game
 
04:33:21.051 --> 04:33:21.061 align:start position:0%
terms maybe that went in here
 
04:33:23.449 --> 04:33:23.459 align:start position:0%
um there's a couple of other places that
 
04:33:26.269 --> 04:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
uh you know I did look up those rsas
 
04:33:28.910 --> 04:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
that were mentioned by the Vice chair
 
04:33:31.849 --> 04:33:31.859 align:start position:0%
um I don't understand why those were
 
04:33:34.250 --> 04:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
included but it would be something that
 
04:33:35.570 --> 04:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
I'd certainly want to talk to the
 
04:33:38.510 --> 04:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
attorney about at um
 
04:33:41.510 --> 04:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
in OLS because they weren't part of the
 
04:33:44.631 --> 04:33:44.641 align:start position:0%
original conversation here
 
04:33:44.641 --> 04:33:45.769 align:start position:0%
original conversation here
um

04:33:45.769 --> 04:33:45.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:48.369 --> 04:33:48.379 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
04:33:51.590 --> 04:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
page three line 27 where it talks about
 
04:33:54.109 --> 04:33:54.119 align:start position:0%
the electronic or paper registration
 
04:33:54.119 --> 04:33:55.609 align:start position:0%
the electronic or paper registration
system

04:33:55.609 --> 04:33:55.619 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:33:59.390 --> 04:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
I recall in a prior session we had and
 
04:34:01.250 --> 04:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
it may have been just the the original
 
04:34:01.260 --> 04:34:02.990 align:start position:0%
it may have been just the the original
bill

04:34:02.990 --> 04:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:34:03.000 --> 04:34:04.250 align:start position:0%
bill
um

04:34:04.250 --> 04:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:06.650 --> 04:34:06.660 align:start position:0%
the divers I think had mentioned that
 
04:34:06.660 --> 04:34:07.910 align:start position:0%
the divers I think had mentioned that
they

04:34:07.910 --> 04:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:34:07.920 --> 04:34:08.510 align:start position:0%
they
um

04:34:08.510 --> 04:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:11.330 --> 04:34:11.340 align:start position:0%
they know they've seen where these are
 
04:34:14.631 --> 04:34:14.641 align:start position:0%
located and and I think it was the chief
 
04:34:16.789 --> 04:34:16.799 align:start position:0%
biologist of the fish and game that said
 
04:34:19.131 --> 04:34:19.141 align:start position:0%
well why aren't they reporting them to
 
04:34:22.429 --> 04:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
us we have nothing from them
 
04:34:22.439 --> 04:34:24.470 align:start position:0%
us we have nothing from them
well

04:34:24.470 --> 04:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:34:26.631 --> 04:34:26.641 align:start position:0%
when you put it in here to say that they
 
04:34:28.070 --> 04:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
shall do that
 
04:34:31.849 --> 04:34:31.859 align:start position:0%
um and then hear that these don't exist
 
04:34:34.131 --> 04:34:34.141 align:start position:0%
um it kind of you have to kind of
 
04:34:36.189 --> 04:34:36.199 align:start position:0%
scratch ahead and decide
 
04:34:38.750 --> 04:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
where which line you're you want to
 
04:34:41.269 --> 04:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
believe do you want to believe that they
 
04:34:44.090 --> 04:34:44.100 align:start position:0%
they should have done it previously or
 
04:34:46.070 --> 04:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
that they can't do it because it's now
 
04:34:48.410 --> 04:34:48.420 align:start position:0%
going to cost a whole lot more money to
 
04:34:51.109 --> 04:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
implement some kind of system like that
 
04:34:53.330 --> 04:34:53.340 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
04:34:56.150 --> 04:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know how to go with that
 
04:34:59.810 --> 04:34:59.820 align:start position:0%
um I I do think I would perhaps although
 
04:35:01.910 --> 04:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
I think it's a good idea to have shall
 
04:35:05.449 --> 04:35:05.459 align:start position:0%
on that because this was put in in order
 
04:35:05.459 --> 04:35:06.830 align:start position:0%
on that because this was put in in order
to

04:35:06.830 --> 04:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:35:09.131 --> 04:35:09.141 align:start position:0%
in order to alleviate
 
04:35:14.390 --> 04:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
concerns down the road with this program
 
04:35:18.349 --> 04:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
for reporting to take place it was also
 
04:35:20.769 --> 04:35:20.779 align:start position:0%
a way for
 
04:35:23.570 --> 04:35:23.580 align:start position:0%
to alleviate some of the concern that
 
04:35:27.410 --> 04:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
that the lobsterman brought forth to say
 
04:35:29.570 --> 04:35:29.580 align:start position:0%
um you know how much of the of our catch
 
04:35:32.150 --> 04:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
are they going to take well unless you
 
04:35:34.131 --> 04:35:34.141 align:start position:0%
report this stuff
 
04:35:36.830 --> 04:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
how are you going to ever know if they
 
04:35:39.349 --> 04:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
are taking enough to affect your
 
04:35:39.359 --> 04:35:40.490 align:start position:0%
are taking enough to affect your
livelihood

04:35:40.490 --> 04:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
livelihood
 
04:35:41.990 --> 04:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
quite frankly
 
04:35:44.990 --> 04:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
the best information that we have or
 
04:35:48.590 --> 04:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
that I've seen has come from those that
 
04:35:51.410 --> 04:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
state closest to us Massachusetts that
 
04:35:53.410 --> 04:35:53.420 align:start position:0%
has the existing system
 
04:35:57.289 --> 04:35:57.299 align:start position:0%
and they also have a reporting system
 
04:36:00.650 --> 04:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
as does Maine and I just read that Maine
 
04:36:02.869 --> 04:36:02.879 align:start position:0%
was going to a hundred percent reporting
 
04:36:02.879 --> 04:36:03.709 align:start position:0%
was going to a hundred percent reporting
system

04:36:03.709 --> 04:36:03.719 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:36:07.250 --> 04:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
so if these things exist on either side
 
04:36:09.470 --> 04:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
of us I don't know why it is that it's
 
04:36:11.750 --> 04:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
such a great leap that we can't have
 
04:36:15.830 --> 04:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
such a thing a reporting system here
 
04:36:18.830 --> 04:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
um if nothing else they have paved the
 
04:36:21.470 --> 04:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
way and maybe there is a system that we
 
04:36:23.269 --> 04:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
don't have to design from scratch and
 
04:36:25.369 --> 04:36:25.379 align:start position:0%
maybe we can use their system I don't
 
04:36:25.379 --> 04:36:26.929 align:start position:0%
maybe we can use their system I don't
know

04:36:26.929 --> 04:36:26.939 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:36:29.769 --> 04:36:29.779 align:start position:0%
um but I will say that Massachusetts has
 
04:36:34.869 --> 04:36:34.879 align:start position:0%
much better reporting and recording than
 
04:36:39.670 --> 04:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
any other state I've seen as far as
 
04:36:42.830 --> 04:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
permits either based in this chart by
 
04:36:45.709 --> 04:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
trap only by diver and Trap by diver
 
04:36:49.131 --> 04:36:49.141 align:start position:0%
only by a number of traps that are
 
04:36:51.890 --> 04:36:51.900 align:start position:0%
fished number of hours that diving has
 
04:36:53.990 --> 04:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
taken place
 
04:36:56.869 --> 04:36:56.879 align:start position:0%
all of that helps us decide whether this
 
04:36:59.631 --> 04:36:59.641 align:start position:0%
is viable or not in New Hampshire and
 
04:37:01.910 --> 04:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
and this comes down to their numbers
 
04:37:05.150 --> 04:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
saying less than one Lobster per hour
 
04:37:07.570 --> 04:37:07.580 align:start position:0%
per diver
 
04:37:10.369 --> 04:37:10.379 align:start position:0%
that's all that's possible based on the
 
04:37:12.349 --> 04:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
currents that are around here the
 
04:37:15.349 --> 04:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
visibility that's around here the fact
 
04:37:17.689 --> 04:37:17.699 align:start position:0%
that you can't do this night night time
 
04:37:20.090 --> 04:37:20.100 align:start position:0%
it's only during daylight hours
 
04:37:21.650 --> 04:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:37:22.789 --> 04:37:22.799 align:start position:0%
um we're talking
 
04:37:26.269 --> 04:37:26.279 align:start position:0%
we're talking less than a lobster per
 
04:37:28.849 --> 04:37:28.859 align:start position:0%
hour of diving this is nothing that's
 
04:37:30.890 --> 04:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
going to interfere with anyone's
 
04:37:33.551 --> 04:37:33.561 align:start position:0%
livelihood or the amount of commercial
 
04:37:36.709 --> 04:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
catch that's taken place
 
04:37:36.719 --> 04:37:37.730 align:start position:0%
catch that's taken place
um

04:37:37.730 --> 04:37:37.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:43.090 --> 04:37:43.100 align:start position:0%
I can't I can't understand why this
 
04:37:48.109 --> 04:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
this little drop in a teacup is uh is
 
04:37:50.689 --> 04:37:50.699 align:start position:0%
causing the consternation that it is
 
04:37:53.330 --> 04:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
secondly when you get into the fact of
 
04:37:56.631 --> 04:37:56.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:59.090 --> 04:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
the numbers are staggering and I think
 
04:38:01.310 --> 04:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
it's only because it's under the surface
 
04:38:04.490 --> 04:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
of the water that that no one can see it
 
04:38:06.769 --> 04:38:06.779 align:start position:0%
I think if there was a similar process
 
04:38:09.230 --> 04:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
where Hunters were losing shopping carts
 
04:38:13.730 --> 04:38:13.740 align:start position:0%
in our Great Woods there would be people
 
04:38:16.970 --> 04:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
picketing the state house here and and
 
04:38:19.070 --> 04:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
that's virtually what we have these are
 
04:38:22.551 --> 04:38:22.561 align:start position:0%
the size of shopping carts out here the
 
04:38:26.570 --> 04:38:26.580 align:start position:0%
book that I had provided here with ghost
 
04:38:27.970 --> 04:38:27.980 align:start position:0%
trap pictures
 
04:38:32.449 --> 04:38:32.459 align:start position:0%
were taken by a diver last week
 
04:38:32.459 --> 04:38:33.590 align:start position:0%
were taken by a diver last week
um

04:38:33.590 --> 04:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:35.750 --> 04:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
in 30-minute dive
 
04:38:37.490 --> 04:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
and took
 
04:38:39.769 --> 04:38:39.779 align:start position:0%
um I think there's only 10 or 12
 
04:38:43.010 --> 04:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
pictures in there but um but it did it
 
04:38:45.830 --> 04:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
in a 30 minute time period from the UNH
 
04:38:45.840 --> 04:38:46.849 align:start position:0%
in a 30 minute time period from the UNH
Pier

04:38:46.849 --> 04:38:46.859 align:start position:0%
Pier
 
04:38:49.730 --> 04:38:49.740 align:start position:0%
so it's not
 
04:38:53.590 --> 04:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:57.410 --> 04:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
difficult to create a scenario where
 
04:39:01.189 --> 04:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
there's uh trash and garbage in our
 
04:39:03.830 --> 04:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
in our Waters and I'm kind of shocked
 
04:39:05.269 --> 04:39:05.279 align:start position:0%
and surprised that people would be
 
04:39:07.910 --> 04:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
willing to vote against something that
 
04:39:10.250 --> 04:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
is going to clean up our Waters to this
 
04:39:10.260 --> 04:39:11.349 align:start position:0%
is going to clean up our Waters to this
extent

04:39:11.349 --> 04:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
extent
 
04:39:14.090 --> 04:39:14.100 align:start position:0%
you need the divers we've heard how
 
04:39:16.910 --> 04:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
little money that that fish and game has
 
04:39:19.310 --> 04:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
or that anyone else has
 
04:39:22.929 --> 04:39:22.939 align:start position:0%
these are these are volunteer
 
04:39:25.910 --> 04:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire that are
 
04:39:27.890 --> 04:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
willing to put their time and effort
 
04:39:31.189 --> 04:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
into marking where these are and and
 
04:39:34.429 --> 04:39:34.439 align:start position:0%
facilitate the removal of them it will
 
04:39:37.010 --> 04:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
take years and at the time that they're
 
04:39:40.448 --> 04:39:40.458 align:start position:0%
taking them out more are being created
 
04:39:42.948 --> 04:39:42.958 align:start position:0%
you can argue whether it's ten percent
 
04:39:47.090 --> 04:39:47.100 align:start position:0%
that that is the right number take five
 
04:39:49.310 --> 04:39:49.320 align:start position:0%
percent I don't care what the magic
 
04:39:51.410 --> 04:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
number is of how many traps are lost
 
04:39:54.410 --> 04:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
it's a huge number
 
04:39:56.330 --> 04:39:56.340 align:start position:0%
um the fellow I was walking out with was
 
04:39:58.730 --> 04:39:58.740 align:start position:0%
from oceanwide he just told me about a
 
04:40:01.010 --> 04:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
trap that they just pulled up in the
 
04:40:04.130 --> 04:40:04.140 align:start position:0%
fall that was from 1999 that had
 
04:40:07.250 --> 04:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
embedded itself in the in the
 
04:40:11.390 --> 04:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
um sea floor and he said underneath what
 
04:40:14.630 --> 04:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
was buried was as good as it was uh the
 
04:40:16.190 --> 04:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
day it was put in the water the first
 
04:40:16.200 --> 04:40:17.030 align:start position:0%
day it was put in the water the first
time

04:40:17.030 --> 04:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:40:21.410 --> 04:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
so this stuff exists and and we're crazy
 
04:40:25.310 --> 04:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
to uh to not think about picking it up
 
04:40:27.948 --> 04:40:27.958 align:start position:0%
then you go into the park I think the
 
04:40:30.230 --> 04:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
first picture in there shows a card
 
04:40:33.590 --> 04:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's caught in that trap
 
04:40:33.600 --> 04:40:34.250 align:start position:0%
that's that's caught in that trap
um

04:40:34.250 --> 04:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:36.590 --> 04:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
beyond the pictures beyond the maps
 
04:40:36.600 --> 04:40:38.030 align:start position:0%
beyond the pictures beyond the maps
there

04:40:38.030 --> 04:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:40:40.850 --> 04:40:40.860 align:start position:0%
um that there's no way that cod's coming
 
04:40:43.490 --> 04:40:43.500 align:start position:0%
out of that trap I don't care whether
 
04:40:47.810 --> 04:40:47.820 align:start position:0%
you have Escape vents or not that Cod is
 
04:40:50.930 --> 04:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
going to die in that trap and it is
 
04:40:50.940 --> 04:40:52.250 align:start position:0%
going to die in that trap and it is
illegal

04:40:52.250 --> 04:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
04:40:55.250 --> 04:40:55.260 align:start position:0%
for the diver that took that picture to
 
04:40:57.350 --> 04:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
open that trap up and let that caught
 
04:40:57.360 --> 04:41:00.110 align:start position:0%
open that trap up and let that caught
out

04:41:00.110 --> 04:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:01.610 --> 04:41:01.620 align:start position:0%
you would be
 
04:41:01.620 --> 04:41:03.230 align:start position:0%
you would be
heartless

04:41:03.230 --> 04:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
heartless
 
04:41:03.240 --> 04:41:04.010 align:start position:0%
heartless
um

04:41:04.010 --> 04:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:06.650 --> 04:41:06.660 align:start position:0%
to to to vote against something that's
 
04:41:09.350 --> 04:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
going to eliminate what
 
04:41:11.270 --> 04:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
what's going on with under the water
 
04:41:13.368 --> 04:41:13.378 align:start position:0%
with these traps as far as I can see
 
04:41:17.030 --> 04:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
this is an ongoing situation
 
04:41:19.850 --> 04:41:19.860 align:start position:0%
um these traps collect that's why they
 
04:41:21.830 --> 04:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
call them traps
 
04:41:24.708 --> 04:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
um they are they are catching things
 
04:41:28.550 --> 04:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
they are those things are dying and they
 
04:41:32.270 --> 04:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
that dying flesh becomes bait for the
 
04:41:34.850 --> 04:41:34.860 align:start position:0%
next series so
 
04:41:39.170 --> 04:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
um how how we can walk away from what we
 
04:41:41.510 --> 04:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
have here whether it means we cross out
 
04:41:43.730 --> 04:41:43.740 align:start position:0%
a few words or even take out a paragraph
 
04:41:46.990 --> 04:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
or two in order to eliminate the idea
 
04:41:54.590 --> 04:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:56.810 --> 04:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
fish and lobsters and other Critters
 
04:41:59.150 --> 04:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
that are living in these things the
 
04:42:01.610 --> 04:42:01.620 align:start position:0%
fellow from Ocean wide I I pushed him on
 
04:42:03.708 --> 04:42:03.718 align:start position:0%
it and he said two-thirds of the traps
 
04:42:07.250 --> 04:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
that they pull up have live animals in
 
04:42:07.260 --> 04:42:07.970 align:start position:0%
that they pull up have live animals in
them

04:42:07.970 --> 04:42:07.980 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:42:12.230 --> 04:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
the others have shells in them
 
04:42:12.240 --> 04:42:14.208 align:start position:0%
the others have shells in them
so

04:42:14.208 --> 04:42:14.218 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:42:16.850 --> 04:42:16.860 align:start position:0%
that mirrors the study from McGill
 
04:42:19.490 --> 04:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
University on the Canadian side that
 
04:42:22.490 --> 04:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
said 60 percent of the traps have
 
04:42:24.890 --> 04:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
um and they they were when so first as
 
04:42:27.650 --> 04:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
far as to say endangered species they
 
04:42:32.590 --> 04:42:32.600 align:start position:0%
had in their traps so I don't know how
 
04:42:37.368 --> 04:42:37.378 align:start position:0%
what has to happen in order to meet some
 
04:42:38.448 --> 04:42:38.458 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:42:42.050 --> 04:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
concerns that uh that the vice chair has
 
04:42:43.510 --> 04:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
and others
 
04:42:46.190 --> 04:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
if it's a Crossing out a shell and
 
04:42:49.670 --> 04:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
putting a May if it's a taking out a two
 
04:42:53.288 --> 04:42:53.298 align:start position:0%
and putting a from I think
 
04:42:55.970 --> 04:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
just the simple fact of being able to
 
04:42:58.510 --> 04:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
clean up our oceans
 
04:43:01.190 --> 04:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
at the same time that more are being
 
04:43:02.750 --> 04:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
added every day
 
04:43:05.208 --> 04:43:05.218 align:start position:0%
is in the fact that we are allowing
 
04:43:07.550 --> 04:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
divers to be able to touch traps and
 
04:43:07.560 --> 04:43:09.368 align:start position:0%
divers to be able to touch traps and
remove

04:43:09.368 --> 04:43:09.378 align:start position:0%
remove
 
04:43:12.770 --> 04:43:12.780 align:start position:0%
endangered animals that are going to die
 
04:43:16.850 --> 04:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
I think is unconscionable so I will be
 
04:43:19.610 --> 04:43:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:22.330 --> 04:43:22.340 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh any other
 
04:43:24.890 --> 04:43:24.900 align:start position:0%
representative naughter
 
04:43:27.470 --> 04:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I had some
 
04:43:29.690 --> 04:43:29.700 align:start position:0%
constituents contact me about this
 
04:43:32.570 --> 04:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
legislation we had some several very
 
04:43:34.670 --> 04:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
long conversations
 
04:43:36.948 --> 04:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
about it it's very important to them and
 
04:43:39.050 --> 04:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
not wanting to let perfect be the enemy
 
04:43:40.910 --> 04:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
of good the good and knowing that
 
04:43:43.390 --> 04:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
there's 24 individuals who will further
 
04:43:45.830 --> 04:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
scrutinize this legislation thoroughly
 
04:43:47.390 --> 04:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
before it ever reaches the corner office
 
04:43:50.270 --> 04:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
I think we should support it
 
04:43:52.070 --> 04:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:43:53.990 --> 04:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to let others who haven't
 
04:43:56.448 --> 04:43:56.458 align:start position:0%
spoken yet speak first it's the same I
 
04:43:58.368 --> 04:43:58.378 align:start position:0%
told device share representative page
 
04:43:58.378 --> 04:44:00.890 align:start position:0%
told device share representative page
please

04:44:00.890 --> 04:44:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:03.288 --> 04:44:03.298 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:44:06.770 --> 04:44:06.780 align:start position:0%
so I was really happy that uh oceanswide
 
04:44:08.690 --> 04:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
came and we got that perspective from
 
04:44:11.270 --> 04:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
our neighbors in Maine I think one of
 
04:44:13.970 --> 04:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
the things that was clear to me
 
04:44:17.030 --> 04:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
was that that program was really a
 
04:44:19.730 --> 04:44:19.740 align:start position:0%
partnership with the lobstering industry
 
04:44:24.110 --> 04:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
and that they built a lot of trust a lot
 
04:44:26.330 --> 04:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
of the kids in that program were the
 
04:44:29.208 --> 04:44:29.218 align:start position:0%
kids of lobstermen you know and so it's
 
04:44:31.490 --> 04:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
a very different kind of thing I agree
 
04:44:34.430 --> 04:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
it's a success story I agree with the
 
04:44:36.470 --> 04:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
problem you know I don't think we should
 
04:44:38.448 --> 04:44:38.458 align:start position:0%
be leaving this derelict gear on the
 
04:44:40.368 --> 04:44:40.378 align:start position:0%
bottom of the ocean I think we probably
 
04:44:42.590 --> 04:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
can all agree on that but this bill
 
04:44:44.930 --> 04:44:44.940 align:start position:0%
isn't just that
 
04:44:47.090 --> 04:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
um it's a lot of different pieces put
 
04:44:47.100 --> 04:44:48.470 align:start position:0%
um it's a lot of different pieces put
together

04:44:48.470 --> 04:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:44:50.208 --> 04:44:50.218 align:start position:0%
um I think the other piece that stood
 
04:44:52.128 --> 04:44:52.138 align:start position:0%
out to me is it wasn't really a
 
04:44:54.170 --> 04:44:54.180 align:start position:0%
legislative solution
 
04:44:56.628 --> 04:44:56.638 align:start position:0%
you know they were they were doing that
 
04:44:59.208 --> 04:44:59.218 align:start position:0%
as a partnership and the question is is
 
04:45:02.150 --> 04:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
this are is it our is it the are we the
 
04:45:04.368 --> 04:45:04.378 align:start position:0%
best solution here for that derelict
 
04:45:06.590 --> 04:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
gear problem I think is a is a is a
 
04:45:08.510 --> 04:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
piece that we should consider
 
04:45:11.208 --> 04:45:11.218 align:start position:0%
I also heard in talking about the
 
04:45:13.750 --> 04:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
derelict gear problem a lot more
 
04:45:16.788 --> 04:45:16.798 align:start position:0%
receptivity from the community from the
 
04:45:18.948 --> 04:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
lobstering community
 
04:45:21.650 --> 04:45:21.660 align:start position:0%
um then I had anticipated frankly we had
 
04:45:23.510 --> 04:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
a couple people say yeah this is this is
 
04:45:25.128 --> 04:45:25.138 align:start position:0%
a problem we think maybe you're
 
04:45:26.448 --> 04:45:26.458 align:start position:0%
exaggerating the scale of the problem
 
04:45:27.708 --> 04:45:27.718 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire because you're
 
04:45:29.690 --> 04:45:29.700 align:start position:0%
comparing us to other states but this is
 
04:45:31.070 --> 04:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
a problem we agree we don't want trash
 
04:45:32.208 --> 04:45:32.218 align:start position:0%
in our ocean
 
04:45:35.270 --> 04:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
so I don't sense a lot of resistance to
 
04:45:36.650 --> 04:45:36.660 align:start position:0%
the idea that this is something that
 
04:45:38.390 --> 04:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
could be worked on
 
04:45:42.230 --> 04:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
so the solution I feel should involve
 
04:45:45.650 --> 04:45:45.660 align:start position:0%
into the industry and
 
04:45:47.270 --> 04:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
um I I applaud oceans-wide I think it's
 
04:45:49.610 --> 04:45:49.620 align:start position:0%
incredible yeah let's do it here in New
 
04:45:51.230 --> 04:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but I don't think this bill is
 
04:45:53.208 --> 04:45:53.218 align:start position:0%
necessarily the pathway or this this
 
04:45:56.270 --> 04:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
amendment is necessarily the pathway I
 
04:45:58.550 --> 04:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
also think we're really dealing with two
 
04:46:00.410 --> 04:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
totally separate bills you know we've
 
04:46:03.230 --> 04:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
tethered two two things together
 
04:46:05.868 --> 04:46:05.878 align:start position:0%
um and so I feel I feel like we might be
 
04:46:07.250 --> 04:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
having a very different conversation
 
04:46:11.090 --> 04:46:11.100 align:start position:0%
with the lobstering community if we were
 
04:46:12.708 --> 04:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
here just talking about the derelict
 
04:46:14.810 --> 04:46:14.820 align:start position:0%
gear issue and maybe we could do that in
 
04:46:16.250 --> 04:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
a future year
 
04:46:17.990 --> 04:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
um so just putting that out there out
 
04:46:19.610 --> 04:46:19.620 align:start position:0%
there for everyone as we as we consider
 
04:46:21.890 --> 04:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
how I vote on this thank you thank you
 
04:46:21.900 --> 04:46:24.010 align:start position:0%
how I vote on this thank you thank you
representative

04:46:24.010 --> 04:46:24.020 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:46:27.650 --> 04:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
and rep Ford
 
04:46:30.770 --> 04:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman uh I've talked to a
 
04:46:32.628 --> 04:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
lot of folks in this room and folks who
 
04:46:34.610 --> 04:46:34.620 align:start position:0%
came to testify for the past two
 
04:46:34.620 --> 04:46:35.810 align:start position:0%
came to testify for the past two
hearings

04:46:35.810 --> 04:46:35.820 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
04:46:37.788 --> 04:46:37.798 align:start position:0%
um I'm still on I still don't know what
 
04:46:38.868 --> 04:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
to do
 
04:46:40.490 --> 04:46:40.500 align:start position:0%
um and how I will vote for this
 
04:46:43.310 --> 04:46:43.320 align:start position:0%
particular bill and I I hear all the all
 
04:46:47.208 --> 04:46:47.218 align:start position:0%
the pieces and I I see this as a kid
 
04:46:49.250 --> 04:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
walking up to the fountain soda machine
 
04:46:51.708 --> 04:46:51.718 align:start position:0%
at the at the restaurant right and they
 
04:46:53.690 --> 04:46:53.700 align:start position:0%
just put their cup under all these
 
04:46:55.730 --> 04:46:55.740 align:start position:0%
different spigots and they think it's
 
04:46:57.230 --> 04:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
going to be delicious but actually it's
 
04:46:59.628 --> 04:46:59.638 align:start position:0%
going to be quite disgusting and I know
 
04:47:01.368 --> 04:47:01.378 align:start position:0%
for a fact it will be discussing as I've
 
04:47:03.230 --> 04:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
done it as an adult
 
04:47:06.050 --> 04:47:06.060 align:start position:0%
um and so I think representative page is
 
04:47:08.330 --> 04:47:08.340 align:start position:0%
correct when he says that
 
04:47:10.490 --> 04:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
um there are good pieces in this in this
 
04:47:12.650 --> 04:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
bill there are really good pieces that I
 
04:47:12.660 --> 04:47:13.670 align:start position:0%
bill there are really good pieces that I
think

04:47:13.670 --> 04:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:47:16.850 --> 04:47:16.860 align:start position:0%
um non-partisan bipartisan support could
 
04:47:19.730 --> 04:47:19.740 align:start position:0%
come after on each of the pieces of this
 
04:47:19.740 --> 04:47:21.050 align:start position:0%
come after on each of the pieces of this
bill

04:47:21.050 --> 04:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:47:23.090 --> 04:47:23.100 align:start position:0%
um but I'm also a foot in the door type
 
04:47:25.610 --> 04:47:25.620 align:start position:0%
of guy and is this a foot in the door to
 
04:47:29.030 --> 04:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
the bigger conservation p pieces
 
04:47:31.448 --> 04:47:31.458 align:start position:0%
um reforming lobstering fishermen
 
04:47:34.128 --> 04:47:34.138 align:start position:0%
supporting our fish and game department
 
04:47:36.948 --> 04:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
all those pieces there and is this a
 
04:47:38.150 --> 04:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
foot in the door
 
04:47:39.890 --> 04:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
like I said at the beginning of this I
 
04:47:41.510 --> 04:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
still don't know the answer to that and
 
04:47:43.670 --> 04:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that
 
04:47:46.368 --> 04:47:46.378 align:start position:0%
um we do not
 
04:47:49.670 --> 04:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
Bank our this decision in this vote on
 
04:47:53.390 --> 04:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
the filtering of the Senate and the
 
04:47:55.490 --> 04:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
whole house and
 
04:47:56.868 --> 04:47:56.878 align:start position:0%
um another committee if it needs to go
 
04:47:59.390 --> 04:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
through that to make this bill better
 
04:48:02.390 --> 04:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
because a good bill is a good bill but
 
04:48:04.010 --> 04:48:04.020 align:start position:0%
can we make it better
 
04:48:06.590 --> 04:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
I think this Bill yes but also it's a
 
04:48:08.330 --> 04:48:08.340 align:start position:0%
it's a good opportunity to get our foot
 
04:48:10.970 --> 04:48:10.980 align:start position:0%
in the door to say let's get the ball
 
04:48:12.530 --> 04:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
rolling because guess what the ball's
 
04:48:14.150 --> 04:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
not rolling at all
 
04:48:15.650 --> 04:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
um right now so how do we get the ball
 
04:48:15.660 --> 04:48:17.030 align:start position:0%
um right now so how do we get the ball
rolling

04:48:17.030 --> 04:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
rolling
 
04:48:17.040 --> 04:48:17.628 align:start position:0%
rolling
um

04:48:17.628 --> 04:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:20.030 --> 04:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
I said all that to say I still don't
 
04:48:21.948 --> 04:48:21.958 align:start position:0%
know what I'm doing and I appreciate you
 
04:48:24.230 --> 04:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
chairman for the opportunity
 
04:48:27.350 --> 04:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:48:29.208 --> 04:48:29.218 align:start position:0%
um you have not yet had a chance to
 
04:48:31.010 --> 04:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
speak Jonah go for it thank you Mr
 
04:48:33.830 --> 04:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
chairman I I support the amendment and
 
04:48:35.930 --> 04:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
will be voting out to pass on it um I
 
04:48:38.030 --> 04:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
respect my friends on the other on my
 
04:48:40.550 --> 04:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
side of the aisle but I I uh frankly
 
04:48:41.690 --> 04:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
just think that we need to be cleaning
 
04:48:43.490 --> 04:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
up our oceans this has been a derelicts
 
04:48:45.708 --> 04:48:45.718 align:start position:0%
problem that has been evident and clear
 
04:48:49.070 --> 04:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
and representatives Hills uh photographs
 
04:48:51.288 --> 04:48:51.298 align:start position:0%
are are pretty Stark and someone who's
 
04:48:52.850 --> 04:48:52.860 align:start position:0%
spent a decent amount of time on our
 
04:48:55.208 --> 04:48:55.218 align:start position:0%
oceans I know that this is a problem
 
04:48:59.750 --> 04:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
allowing divers to pick up uh loose
 
04:49:02.330 --> 04:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
crates I think is perfectly reasonable
 
04:49:04.490 --> 04:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
um and unfunded to the point of unfunded
 
04:49:07.250 --> 04:49:07.260 align:start position:0%
mandates this is a policy committee and
 
04:49:10.610 --> 04:49:10.620 align:start position:0%
uh the pricing the funding of this
 
04:49:12.350 --> 04:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
legislation is up to the finance
 
04:49:14.050 --> 04:49:14.060 align:start position:0%
committee and I would hope that we don't
 
04:49:17.628 --> 04:49:17.638 align:start position:0%
vote down a good policy because of uh
 
04:49:19.788 --> 04:49:19.798 align:start position:0%
something that finance will have to deal
 
04:49:19.798 --> 04:49:20.930 align:start position:0%
something that finance will have to deal
with

04:49:20.930 --> 04:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:49:22.730 --> 04:49:22.740 align:start position:0%
um I think that we need to clean up our
 
04:49:24.350 --> 04:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
oceans and I I'll be supporting the
 
04:49:26.448 --> 04:49:26.458 align:start position:0%
amendment because of that
 
04:49:28.430 --> 04:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
04:49:28.440 --> 04:49:29.570 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative

04:49:29.570 --> 04:49:29.580 align:start position:0%
Thomas
 
04:49:31.310 --> 04:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr chair I just want to
 
04:49:33.350 --> 04:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
put my two cents in worth here that I I
 
04:49:35.208 --> 04:49:35.218 align:start position:0%
agree with the representative across
 
04:49:37.128 --> 04:49:37.138 align:start position:0%
from me representative Ford I think the
 
04:49:39.110 --> 04:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
proper term I would use is don't don't
 
04:49:41.350 --> 04:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
let perfect be be the enemy of the good
 
04:49:45.470 --> 04:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:47.990 --> 04:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
you're too you're over to my I didn't
 
04:49:52.310 --> 04:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:55.010 --> 04:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
uh but no really uh there there may be
 
04:49:56.750 --> 04:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
some things that may have to be tweaked
 
04:49:59.150 --> 04:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
with the bill but we all know that once
 
04:50:00.770 --> 04:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
it gets to the house no matter how
 
04:50:02.510 --> 04:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
perfect this bill is we know the other
 
04:50:04.250 --> 04:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
side is going to they always do
 
04:50:05.990 --> 04:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
something to it so there's another
 
04:50:08.868 --> 04:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity to catch up on some on some
 
04:50:10.850 --> 04:50:10.860 align:start position:0%
you know minor tweaks there as well I
 
04:50:12.110 --> 04:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
certainly will be supporting this bill
 
04:50:14.390 --> 04:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
and I think it's a good thing
 
04:50:17.390 --> 04:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I think we're
 
04:50:21.770 --> 04:50:21.780 align:start position:0%
ready for second rounds and
 
04:50:25.788 --> 04:50:25.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:25.798 --> 04:50:26.868 align:start position:0%
 
here

04:50:26.868 --> 04:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:50:30.350 --> 04:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to say that I concur
 
04:50:33.770 --> 04:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
with my seatmate over here
 
04:50:37.070 --> 04:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
um I think there are a couple of parts
 
04:50:39.948 --> 04:50:39.958 align:start position:0%
to this bill as far as like using the
 
04:50:43.850 --> 04:50:43.860 align:start position:0%
licensing fees for cleanup efforts and
 
04:50:46.250 --> 04:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
um requiring you know the lobster boats
 
04:50:48.830 --> 04:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
to make good effort at retrieving their
 
04:50:51.288 --> 04:50:51.298 align:start position:0%
lost traps and
 
04:50:54.050 --> 04:50:54.060 align:start position:0%
um I you know I like the piece about
 
04:50:56.570 --> 04:50:56.580 align:start position:0%
saving marine life by taking care of
 
04:50:59.628 --> 04:50:59.638 align:start position:0%
these abandoned traps but I wonder if
 
04:51:02.690 --> 04:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
this all these parts should be a
 
04:51:06.650 --> 04:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
separate bill unto itself so that the
 
04:51:10.430 --> 04:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
rest of the bill where a lot of my
 
04:51:12.650 --> 04:51:12.660 align:start position:0%
colleagues here pointed out have real
 
04:51:15.288 --> 04:51:15.298 align:start position:0%
particular issues that are not defined
 
04:51:18.470 --> 04:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
if that should be kept separately and
 
04:51:21.470 --> 04:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
all this conservation piece should be a
 
04:51:23.570 --> 04:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
separate bill unto itself
 
04:51:25.690 --> 04:51:25.700 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
04:51:27.970 --> 04:51:27.980 align:start position:0%
working our way around
 
04:51:30.770 --> 04:51:30.780 align:start position:0%
Vice chair
 
04:51:34.190 --> 04:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I will I just wanted
 
04:51:34.200 --> 04:51:35.448 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I will I just wanted
to

04:51:35.448 --> 04:51:35.458 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:51:35.458 --> 04:51:36.530 align:start position:0%
to
um

04:51:36.530 --> 04:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:38.150 --> 04:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
follow up on a comment that was made
 
04:51:40.368 --> 04:51:40.378 align:start position:0%
earlier first and then I have a couple
 
04:51:42.350 --> 04:51:42.360 align:start position:0%
other things to say
 
04:51:45.170 --> 04:51:45.180 align:start position:0%
um was that this bill was brought
 
04:51:45.180 --> 04:51:46.910 align:start position:0%
um was that this bill was brought
forward

04:51:46.910 --> 04:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:51:48.530 --> 04:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
with the support of the commercial
 
04:51:50.930 --> 04:51:50.940 align:start position:0%
lobsterment that is correct the original
 
04:51:54.470 --> 04:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
bill was with the section in it that
 
04:51:57.288 --> 04:51:57.298 align:start position:0%
stated specifically the use of State
 
04:51:59.030 --> 04:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
resources is prohibited no State
 
04:52:00.890 --> 04:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
resource or fund should be used to
 
04:52:02.390 --> 04:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
enforce lobstering regulations in
 
04:52:04.368 --> 04:52:04.378 align:start position:0%
federal water that has been removed in
 
04:52:06.350 --> 04:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
this amendment so it is no longer
 
04:52:08.270 --> 04:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
supported by those commercial fishermen
 
04:52:09.948 --> 04:52:09.958 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure that's clear
 
04:52:11.868 --> 04:52:11.878 align:start position:0%
that they don't support this they
 
04:52:15.110 --> 04:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:15.120 --> 04:52:20.570 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:52:20.570 --> 04:52:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:23.270 --> 04:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
one point I want to make is
 
04:52:25.788 --> 04:52:25.798 align:start position:0%
the effective date on this shall take
 
04:52:31.490 --> 04:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:33.470 --> 04:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
anyone who's been around
 
04:52:37.490 --> 04:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
state government long enough knows that
 
04:52:38.930 --> 04:52:38.940 align:start position:0%
when you read this and you hear about
 
04:52:42.288 --> 04:52:42.298 align:start position:0%
all the procedures that have to be done
 
04:52:44.750 --> 04:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
to provide for recreational diving
 
04:52:44.760 --> 04:52:46.490 align:start position:0%
to provide for recreational diving
licenses

04:52:46.490 --> 04:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
04:52:49.070 --> 04:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
and all the rules that go before it
 
04:52:52.610 --> 04:52:52.620 align:start position:0%
60 days is not nearly enough time to get
 
04:52:54.470 --> 04:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
through Joker
 
04:52:56.510 --> 04:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
won't happen
 
04:52:58.730 --> 04:52:58.740 align:start position:0%
so this won't happen 60 days upon
 
04:52:58.740 --> 04:52:59.868 align:start position:0%
so this won't happen 60 days upon
Passage

04:52:59.868 --> 04:52:59.878 align:start position:0%
Passage
 
04:53:06.050 --> 04:53:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:08.510 --> 04:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
and with that being said I mean the only
 
04:53:13.128 --> 04:53:13.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:15.650 --> 04:53:15.660 align:start position:0%
I've always been at the Assumption here
 
04:53:17.448 --> 04:53:17.458 align:start position:0%
in this house and I know a lot of my
 
04:53:19.970 --> 04:53:19.980 align:start position:0%
colleagues have is
 
04:53:22.910 --> 04:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
we don't pass legislation that's not
 
04:53:25.310 --> 04:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time just to move it
 
04:53:25.320 --> 04:53:27.110 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time just to move it
forward

04:53:27.110 --> 04:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:53:30.350 --> 04:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be the policy
 
04:53:32.810 --> 04:53:32.820 align:start position:0%
we should do our work make it correct
 
04:53:35.390 --> 04:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
before sending it on there's no
 
04:53:37.070 --> 04:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
guarantee you'll have a chance to get a
 
04:53:41.090 --> 04:53:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:43.670 --> 04:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
04:53:43.680 --> 04:53:47.030 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
Harvey

04:53:47.030 --> 04:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:50.570 --> 04:53:50.580 align:start position:0%
um yes and I think I said this when
 
04:53:52.550 --> 04:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
Colonel Jordan was here as I was reading
 
04:53:54.410 --> 04:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
this I actually thought I was reading
 
04:53:57.170 --> 04:53:57.180 align:start position:0%
two different bills and I think that
 
04:54:00.410 --> 04:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
they need to be separated as well
 
04:54:02.830 --> 04:54:02.840 align:start position:0%
um they're the conservation effort about
 
04:54:05.990 --> 04:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
lobster traps should be an entirely
 
04:54:08.448 --> 04:54:08.458 align:start position:0%
different conversation than rather we
 
04:54:11.150 --> 04:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
allow scuba divers to take lobsters I
 
04:54:13.670 --> 04:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
have a hard time putting the two
 
04:54:13.680 --> 04:54:15.110 align:start position:0%
have a hard time putting the two
together

04:54:15.110 --> 04:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:54:17.090 --> 04:54:17.100 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:54:20.990 --> 04:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
um I definitely agree that in my short
 
04:54:22.490 --> 04:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
time I've only been in the legislator
 
04:54:25.250 --> 04:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
seven years I've heard over and over and
 
04:54:28.190 --> 04:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
over again that you know we we should
 
04:54:31.550 --> 04:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
pass good legislation and I know
 
04:54:34.250 --> 04:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
um when we were talking about this the
 
04:54:35.868 --> 04:54:35.878 align:start position:0%
representative used the word I don't
 
04:54:38.990 --> 04:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
know a lot and if you're using the word
 
04:54:42.170 --> 04:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
I don't know then this bill isn't ready
 
04:54:45.530 --> 04:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
it it's an I don't know yet bill it
 
04:54:48.050 --> 04:54:48.060 align:start position:0%
needs to be it needs to be fixed I I
 
04:54:49.310 --> 04:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
don't think it's something that we can
 
04:54:50.890 --> 04:54:50.900 align:start position:0%
do at three o'clock in the afternoon
 
04:54:53.868 --> 04:54:53.878 align:start position:0%
after spending many hours listening to
 
04:54:56.690 --> 04:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
it it there's Parts in it that just need
 
04:55:00.708 --> 04:55:00.718 align:start position:0%
to be corrected cleaned up and and then
 
04:55:03.530 --> 04:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
perhaps sent on so I think it should be
 
04:55:07.090 --> 04:55:07.100 align:start position:0%
two separate bills I think it should be
 
04:55:09.650 --> 04:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
cleaned up so that we pass a good bill
 
04:55:12.830 --> 04:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee that anybody else
 
04:55:15.708 --> 04:55:15.718 align:start position:0%
will fix the things that we want fixed
 
04:55:18.890 --> 04:55:18.900 align:start position:0%
the way we want them to be fixed just
 
04:55:21.050 --> 04:55:21.060 align:start position:0%
because we pass them on
 
04:55:23.868 --> 04:55:23.878 align:start position:0%
um and I didn't see where you said that
 
04:55:26.090 --> 04:55:26.100 align:start position:0%
60 days because I was looking for it too
 
04:55:27.350 --> 04:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
because that that's not going to happen
 
04:55:30.890 --> 04:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
the other question I had was I maybe I
 
04:55:33.590 --> 04:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
missed it in this bill but this the
 
04:55:35.330 --> 04:55:35.340 align:start position:0%
scuba divers are not pulling the traps
 
04:55:35.340 --> 04:55:36.350 align:start position:0%
scuba divers are not pulling the traps
up

04:55:36.350 --> 04:55:36.360 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:55:39.590 --> 04:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
as I understand it they're marking that
 
04:55:42.110 --> 04:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
with a GPS which we know doesn't work
 
04:55:42.120 --> 04:55:43.128 align:start position:0%
with a GPS which we know doesn't work
underwater

04:55:43.128 --> 04:55:43.138 align:start position:0%
underwater
 
04:55:45.170 --> 04:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
so that somebody can come back and get
 
04:55:48.050 --> 04:55:48.060 align:start position:0%
that trap but they're not actually
 
04:55:51.288 --> 04:55:51.298 align:start position:0%
pulling the Trap up and and disposing of
 
04:55:54.770 --> 04:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
it so um so it
 
04:55:57.590 --> 04:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
if we could Market maybe that would be a
 
04:55:59.750 --> 04:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
good thing but we just heard many times
 
04:56:02.390 --> 04:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
that underwater GPS just doesn't work so
 
04:56:03.470 --> 04:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know how they're going to even
 
04:56:06.770 --> 04:56:06.780 align:start position:0%
Mark that but again it even if you pass
 
04:56:09.110 --> 04:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
one on the beach it says every person
 
04:56:12.530 --> 04:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
shall so next time I'm at Hampton Beach
 
04:56:14.330 --> 04:56:14.340 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be looking for lobster
 
04:56:16.490 --> 04:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
traps to report
 
04:56:16.500 --> 04:56:17.470 align:start position:0%
traps to report
um

04:56:17.470 --> 04:56:17.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:20.510 --> 04:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think anybody in here going
 
04:56:22.910 --> 04:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
against this bill is heartless I think
 
04:56:25.910 --> 04:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
we are just confused by the language I
 
04:56:27.948 --> 04:56:27.958 align:start position:0%
think we're confused why the two
 
04:56:30.470 --> 04:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
subjects are cobbled together in the
 
04:56:33.110 --> 04:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
same bill and I think all of us feel
 
04:56:36.288 --> 04:56:36.298 align:start position:0%
that there's some really good points but
 
04:56:37.910 --> 04:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
it could be
 
04:56:37.920 --> 04:56:39.470 align:start position:0%
it could be
better

04:56:39.470 --> 04:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
better
 
04:56:41.690 --> 04:56:41.700 align:start position:0%
and we need to make it better before we
 
04:56:46.970 --> 04:56:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:49.310 --> 04:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
one second you haven't had a chance to
 
04:56:51.650 --> 04:56:51.660 align:start position:0%
speak yet
 
04:56:53.810 --> 04:56:53.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair to be fair you hadn't
 
04:56:55.910 --> 04:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
asked yet exactly
 
04:57:00.050 --> 04:57:00.060 align:start position:0%
um so a wise wiser more experienced
 
04:57:03.170 --> 04:57:03.180 align:start position:0%
person than me said this morning okay I
 
04:57:07.010 --> 04:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
was rep Harvey she she said
 
04:57:09.170 --> 04:57:09.180 align:start position:0%
um that she was told as a freshman
 
04:57:11.990 --> 04:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
legislator to make sure that whatever
 
04:57:14.330 --> 04:57:14.340 align:start position:0%
Bill we're passing which is going to
 
04:57:18.230 --> 04:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
become a law is enforceable
 
04:57:21.350 --> 04:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
um and we've heard many times that this
 
04:57:23.930 --> 04:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
as it is written in this bill right now
 
04:57:26.930 --> 04:57:26.940 align:start position:0%
is not enforceable so
 
04:57:28.610 --> 04:57:28.620 align:start position:0%
um I just want to remind the committee
 
04:57:28.620 --> 04:57:29.690 align:start position:0%
um I just want to remind the committee
that

04:57:29.690 --> 04:57:29.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:57:33.050 --> 04:57:33.060 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here has effects
 
04:57:34.670 --> 04:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
that are then not going to be
 
04:57:34.680 --> 04:57:35.990 align:start position:0%
that are then not going to be
enforceable

04:57:35.990 --> 04:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
enforceable
 
04:57:40.610 --> 04:57:40.620 align:start position:0%
out in the real world I think it yeah it
 
04:57:44.330 --> 04:57:44.340 align:start position:0%
it needs reworking at least
 
04:57:46.730 --> 04:57:46.740 align:start position:0%
um and I agree completely with everyone
 
04:57:48.410 --> 04:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
else who has pointed out that these do
 
04:57:51.350 --> 04:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
seem to be two different bills I am all
 
04:57:53.570 --> 04:57:53.580 align:start position:0%
in favor of separating them especially
 
04:57:55.570 --> 04:57:55.580 align:start position:0%
to work on the dellar elect gear problem
 
04:57:59.330 --> 04:57:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:00.708 --> 04:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
um don't believe that anyone in this
 
04:58:02.750 --> 04:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
room is heartless so
 
04:58:04.910 --> 04:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
I know there's an issue with Daryl gear
 
04:58:06.470 --> 04:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
and I'd love to see it clean up I just
 
04:58:08.930 --> 04:58:08.940 align:start position:0%
think rolling it into this one bill on
 
04:58:11.330 --> 04:58:11.340 align:start position:0%
two totally different topics is not
 
04:58:13.670 --> 04:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate at this time thank you
 
04:58:15.830 --> 04:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
04:58:15.840 --> 04:58:17.510 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
Khan

04:58:17.510 --> 04:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
Khan
 
04:58:20.030 --> 04:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman once again
 
04:58:23.690 --> 04:58:23.700 align:start position:0%
once again that I was very confused also
 
04:58:25.310 --> 04:58:25.320 align:start position:0%
but two different theme in the bill
 
04:58:27.708 --> 04:58:27.718 align:start position:0%
there is nobody in this room who does
 
04:58:30.590 --> 04:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
not support to clean up our ocean it is
 
04:58:32.628 --> 04:58:32.638 align:start position:0%
very important we need to do it either
 
04:58:35.330 --> 04:58:35.340 align:start position:0%
do it today or do it tomorrow we all
 
04:58:37.850 --> 04:58:37.860 align:start position:0%
support that we can come back next year
 
04:58:40.850 --> 04:58:40.860 align:start position:0%
we can have a bill for ocean cleanup and
 
04:58:42.948 --> 04:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
we can talk about it but this one is not
 
04:58:45.230 --> 04:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
about the ocean cleanup please do not
 
04:58:48.170 --> 04:58:48.180 align:start position:0%
confuse get confused this is all about
 
04:58:51.890 --> 04:58:51.900 align:start position:0%
taking Lobster from the ocean floor
 
04:58:55.250 --> 04:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
where those Lobster was feeded by our
 
04:58:58.190 --> 04:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
fishermen for their livelihood they have
 
04:59:01.250 --> 04:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
their families their children they are
 
04:59:04.190 --> 04:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
mortgage they are car payment we are
 
04:59:07.910 --> 04:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
bringing this law to disrupt their life
 
04:59:11.830 --> 04:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
and livelihood we make good legislation
 
04:59:15.530 --> 04:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
also we need to think about what is good
 
04:59:17.690 --> 04:59:17.700 align:start position:0%
what is bad this is a bad legislation
 
04:59:20.930 --> 04:59:20.940 align:start position:0%
that is not enforceable
 
04:59:24.530 --> 04:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
um also I come from uh coastal town
 
04:59:29.510 --> 04:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
called Seabrook I am a 15-year member of
 
04:59:32.030 --> 04:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
the Seabrook Board of slackman we
 
04:59:34.190 --> 04:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
support our fishermen our Lobster men
 
04:59:37.910 --> 04:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
for many years Yankee Fisher fishermen
 
04:59:41.150 --> 04:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
co-op in our town land we give them
 
04:59:43.670 --> 04:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
almost for free which are them one
 
04:59:47.030 --> 04:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
dollar for a year we support them big
 
04:59:49.250 --> 04:59:49.260 align:start position:0%
time their livelihood is a declining
 
04:59:51.110 --> 04:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
industry they have a lot of regulations
 
04:59:55.070 --> 04:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
we as a legislator we need to support
 
04:59:57.770 --> 04:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
them and they need our support
 
05:00:00.170 --> 05:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
what is going to happen you all know
 
05:00:02.270 --> 05:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
probably and if you do not know I'm
 
05:00:05.510 --> 05:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
going to tell you that Seabrook Beach is
 
05:00:08.330 --> 05:00:08.340 align:start position:0%
the town on beach the seabook beach does
 
05:00:11.270 --> 05:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
not own by state of New Hampshire we
 
05:00:15.590 --> 05:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
clean up we do we maintain it and our
 
05:00:17.570 --> 05:00:17.580 align:start position:0%
town is going to do everything possible
 
05:00:20.930 --> 05:00:20.940 align:start position:0%
that this bill does not affect our
 
05:00:20.940 --> 05:00:22.368 align:start position:0%
that this bill does not affect our
fishermen

05:00:22.368 --> 05:00:22.378 align:start position:0%
fishermen
 
05:00:24.170 --> 05:00:24.180 align:start position:0%
and you know we'll do everything
 
05:00:27.170 --> 05:00:27.180 align:start position:0%
possible you know if it is passes thank
 
05:00:27.180 --> 05:00:28.368 align:start position:0%
possible you know if it is passes thank
you

05:00:28.368 --> 05:00:28.378 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:00:31.190 --> 05:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I'm going to
 
05:00:32.690 --> 05:00:32.700 align:start position:0%
take a moment of privilege myself now
 
05:00:34.128 --> 05:00:34.138 align:start position:0%
since I haven't had a chance to speak
 
05:00:37.610 --> 05:00:37.620 align:start position:0%
because I was reminded of uh something
 
05:00:39.530 --> 05:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
by by what the good representative from
 
05:00:42.350 --> 05:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
Seabrook uh just mentioned and I had a
 
05:00:44.090 --> 05:00:44.100 align:start position:0%
problem with some testimony that I heard
 
05:00:46.690 --> 05:00:46.700 align:start position:0%
earlier but uh it is our job to listen
 
05:00:49.670 --> 05:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
and not to debate with those citizens
 
05:00:52.490 --> 05:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
who come in however I found it almost
 
05:00:56.170 --> 05:00:56.180 align:start position:0%
egregious that a citizen who came in
 
05:01:00.230 --> 05:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
would liken the allowing of divers to
 
05:01:02.890 --> 05:01:02.900 align:start position:0%
take some lobsters from the ocean
 
05:01:06.410 --> 05:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
to a landowner in Northern koas County
 
05:01:08.690 --> 05:01:08.700 align:start position:0%
with a thousand acres of land having
 
05:01:12.230 --> 05:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
someone go on his property and cut trees
 
05:01:15.530 --> 05:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
because that comparison implies that the
 
05:01:17.390 --> 05:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
divers believe they own all the lobsters
 
05:01:19.550 --> 05:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
oh that the the lobstermen believe they
 
05:01:21.170 --> 05:01:21.180 align:start position:0%
own all the lobsters and then a diver
 
05:01:24.410 --> 05:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
going in is stealing their lobsters
 
05:01:27.410 --> 05:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry but those are a resource
 
05:01:30.050 --> 05:01:30.060 align:start position:0%
for everyone the better comparison would
 
05:01:32.690 --> 05:01:32.700 align:start position:0%
have been if a landowner in koas County
 
05:01:35.930 --> 05:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
with a thousand acres believes that he
 
05:01:38.390 --> 05:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
should stop a deer hunter from taking a
 
05:01:40.310 --> 05:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
deer on his property
 
05:01:42.890 --> 05:01:42.900 align:start position:0%
that's the more accurate comparison
 
05:01:45.650 --> 05:01:45.660 align:start position:0%
and if the dive the landowner in co-auth
 
05:01:47.810 --> 05:01:47.820 align:start position:0%
wants to post all his property all
 
05:01:50.208 --> 05:01:50.218 align:start position:0%
Thousand Acres sure
 
05:01:51.890 --> 05:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
stop him from taking a deer on your
 
05:01:53.990 --> 05:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
property but I bet you that one deer
 
05:01:56.150 --> 05:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
isn't gonna hurt as much as walking
 
05:01:58.368 --> 05:01:58.378 align:start position:0%
around and maintaining those signs on a
 
05:02:01.310 --> 05:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:03.708 --> 05:02:03.718 align:start position:0%
nobody owns those lobsters they are a
 
05:02:05.448 --> 05:02:05.458 align:start position:0%
resource to the state
 
05:02:07.970 --> 05:02:07.980 align:start position:0%
so we all own them
 
05:02:10.128 --> 05:02:10.138 align:start position:0%
and any comparison that we heard today
 
05:02:12.170 --> 05:02:12.180 align:start position:0%
that makes it sound like the lobstermen
 
05:02:14.330 --> 05:02:14.340 align:start position:0%
feed those lobsters raise those lobsters
 
05:02:16.970 --> 05:02:16.980 align:start position:0%
and own those lobsters needs to be
 
05:02:18.530 --> 05:02:18.540 align:start position:0%
stricken from our minds right away
 
05:02:21.110 --> 05:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
because they may put the bait out in the
 
05:02:21.120 --> 05:02:22.070 align:start position:0%
because they may put the bait out in the
traps

05:02:22.070 --> 05:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
traps
 
05:02:25.128 --> 05:02:25.138 align:start position:0%
it's part of their job that they've
 
05:02:26.930 --> 05:02:26.940 align:start position:0%
chosen as a profession
 
05:02:29.208 --> 05:02:29.218 align:start position:0%
it's not true aquaculture they're not
 
05:02:32.708 --> 05:02:32.718 align:start position:0%
raising those lobsters in a seclu secure
 
05:02:35.628 --> 05:02:35.638 align:start position:0%
protected environment we see some
 
05:02:38.330 --> 05:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
aquaculture being done for
 
05:02:38.340 --> 05:02:39.170 align:start position:0%
aquaculture being done for
um

05:02:39.170 --> 05:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:41.448 --> 05:02:41.458 align:start position:0%
oysters right now in the Great Bay Area
 
05:02:44.208 --> 05:02:44.218 align:start position:0%
and and I'll tell you the people who put
 
05:02:46.970 --> 05:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
those out there depend on
 
05:02:49.490 --> 05:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
keeping their stuff
 
05:02:51.948 --> 05:02:51.958 align:start position:0%
isolated nobody's got access to it
 
05:02:53.628 --> 05:02:53.638 align:start position:0%
they're the ones putting the seeds in
 
05:02:54.948 --> 05:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
there and getting them growing and
 
05:02:56.990 --> 05:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
providing the environment
 
05:02:59.090 --> 05:02:59.100 align:start position:0%
uh they're just using our Waterway to
 
05:03:01.670 --> 05:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
grow their their oysters so it's much
 
05:03:03.288 --> 05:03:03.298 align:start position:0%
different with free roaming lobsters
 
05:03:04.670 --> 05:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
that are roaming around there all
 
05:03:04.680 --> 05:03:05.750 align:start position:0%
that are roaming around there all
together

05:03:05.750 --> 05:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
together
 
05:03:07.730 --> 05:03:07.740 align:start position:0%
just like nobody could say they own the
 
05:03:09.650 --> 05:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
Cod and nobody can say they own the The
 
05:03:09.660 --> 05:03:10.910 align:start position:0%
Cod and nobody can say they own the The
Flounder

05:03:10.910 --> 05:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
Flounder
 
05:03:14.150 --> 05:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
so I want to make it clear
 
05:03:15.890 --> 05:03:15.900 align:start position:0%
the comparison that's appropriate in
 
05:03:18.830 --> 05:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
that case is deer hunting not cutting
 
05:03:20.570 --> 05:03:20.580 align:start position:0%
the trees that somebody personally owns
 
05:03:22.010 --> 05:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
on their property
 
05:03:23.570 --> 05:03:23.580 align:start position:0%
and so I just wanted to put that out
 
05:03:25.788 --> 05:03:25.798 align:start position:0%
there as a distinction
 
05:03:27.890 --> 05:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
um before anybody gets
 
05:03:30.050 --> 05:03:30.060 align:start position:0%
further involved in the whole lobsterman
 
05:03:31.670 --> 05:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
on the lobsters at lobsterman feed the
 
05:03:33.350 --> 05:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
lobsters they're the lobsterman's
 
05:03:33.360 --> 05:03:34.368 align:start position:0%
lobsters they're the lobsterman's
lobsters

05:03:34.368 --> 05:03:34.378 align:start position:0%
lobsters
 
05:03:36.948 --> 05:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
they're all of our lobsters I don't have
 
05:03:40.368 --> 05:03:40.378 align:start position:0%
a boat so I can buy the five pot but I
 
05:03:41.750 --> 05:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
think the colonel will yell at me if I
 
05:03:43.070 --> 05:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
go out and start throwing the pots in
 
05:03:45.470 --> 05:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
from off the shore I'd have to go out in
 
05:03:47.810 --> 05:03:47.820 align:start position:0%
a boat first and drop them in
 
05:03:51.050 --> 05:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
um that's all I had
 
05:03:54.230 --> 05:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
I'll recognize rep Smith
 
05:03:56.090 --> 05:03:56.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair we've heard some
 
05:03:58.670 --> 05:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
great testimony I think we beat this to
 
05:04:00.770 --> 05:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
death can I ask to move the question on
 
05:04:00.780 --> 05:04:01.550 align:start position:0%
death can I ask to move the question on
this

05:04:01.550 --> 05:04:01.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:04:03.350 --> 05:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
no I don't think it's appropriate at
 
05:04:04.610 --> 05:04:04.620 align:start position:0%
this time we still have some vigorous
 
05:04:06.530 --> 05:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
discussion going on but it will be very
 
05:04:08.510 --> 05:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
very soon here uh because I think we're
 
05:04:10.910 --> 05:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
down to our last two people okay I just
 
05:04:13.788 --> 05:04:13.798 align:start position:0%
I see like two people left uh I'll go
 
05:04:15.770 --> 05:04:15.780 align:start position:0%
with you Jonah for one quick thing thank
 
05:04:18.230 --> 05:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I just really quickly
 
05:04:19.490 --> 05:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
want to say in response to what
 
05:04:23.090 --> 05:04:23.100 align:start position:0%
representative Khan said sometimes
 
05:04:25.250 --> 05:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
interests conflict and what's best for
 
05:04:26.990 --> 05:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
the industry may not be best for our
 
05:04:29.690 --> 05:04:29.700 align:start position:0%
oceans and the industry has been putting
 
05:04:32.990 --> 05:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
crates with no recourse whatsoever into
 
05:04:35.628 --> 05:04:35.638 align:start position:0%
our oceans and leaving them as
 
05:04:38.270 --> 05:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
representative Hill said as early as in
 
05:04:41.750 --> 05:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
some cases 1999 so I think requiring the
 
05:04:44.690 --> 05:04:44.700 align:start position:0%
industry to keep track of those and
 
05:04:46.670 --> 05:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
making a good and make and having them
 
05:04:48.530 --> 05:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
make a good faith effort to recover them
 
05:04:50.510 --> 05:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
is exactly what we need to be doing and
 
05:04:52.368 --> 05:04:52.378 align:start position:0%
sometimes what's best for Industries and
 
05:04:53.810 --> 05:04:53.820 align:start position:0%
what's best for the state
 
05:04:55.610 --> 05:04:55.620 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and I think
 
05:04:57.470 --> 05:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
it'll take you representative Hill is
 
05:04:59.930 --> 05:04:59.940 align:start position:0%
the last question or comment
 
05:05:02.288 --> 05:05:02.298 align:start position:0%
is there thank you
 
05:05:04.730 --> 05:05:04.740 align:start position:0%
did you need something to represent Rome
 
05:05:07.430 --> 05:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
okay let's let Brown go first he's not
 
05:05:08.510 --> 05:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
spoken much and he's been taking our
 
05:05:10.788 --> 05:05:10.798 align:start position:0%
notes so vigorously
 
05:05:12.890 --> 05:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair I wanted to
 
05:05:14.510 --> 05:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
address what uh representative Harvey
 
05:05:16.010 --> 05:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
said for those that weren't here earlier
 
05:05:18.590 --> 05:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
today just to be clear you can't take a
 
05:05:20.390 --> 05:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
GPS underwater and locate something
 
05:05:22.368 --> 05:05:22.378 align:start position:0%
that's correct well one of the divers
 
05:05:23.990 --> 05:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
said was they would pop up a water
 
05:05:26.628 --> 05:05:26.638 align:start position:0%
bottle on a line or a buoy of some
 
05:05:28.490 --> 05:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
nature on a line that would Mark where
 
05:05:30.550 --> 05:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
the plot was in the bottom and then
 
05:05:33.530 --> 05:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
potentially GPS it or let the lobsterman
 
05:05:35.510 --> 05:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
know where fish and game know that that
 
05:05:36.830 --> 05:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
buoy was there
 
05:05:39.650 --> 05:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and now we'll go to
 
05:05:41.208 --> 05:05:41.218 align:start position:0%
representative Hill to finish us off
 
05:05:43.490 --> 05:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
before we take the role thank you uh
 
05:05:45.170 --> 05:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
representative Brown had me cross off
 
05:05:47.510 --> 05:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
one thing off my list
 
05:05:50.150 --> 05:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to point out that uh that
 
05:05:52.310 --> 05:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
these divers that came to speak to you
 
05:05:52.320 --> 05:05:53.390 align:start position:0%
these divers that came to speak to you
today

05:05:53.390 --> 05:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:05:56.270 --> 05:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
um are New Hampshire residents and
 
05:05:58.190 --> 05:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
following along somewhat with the
 
05:06:00.410 --> 05:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
Chairman's um
 
05:06:03.410 --> 05:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
uh discussion point on the fact that uh
 
05:06:06.110 --> 05:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
no one owns the lobsters
 
05:06:09.470 --> 05:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
um there's just um people that generate
 
05:06:11.628 --> 05:06:11.638 align:start position:0%
their livelihood for it from it but
 
05:06:16.128 --> 05:06:16.138 align:start position:0%
these people are looking for a way of of
 
05:06:18.350 --> 05:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
doing what every other state with the
 
05:06:20.208 --> 05:06:20.218 align:start position:0%
exception of Maine on the East Coast
 
05:06:22.430 --> 05:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
currently does
 
05:06:22.440 --> 05:06:23.150 align:start position:0%
currently does
um

05:06:23.150 --> 05:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:25.850 --> 05:06:25.860 align:start position:0%
it's it's kind of
 
05:06:28.970 --> 05:06:28.980 align:start position:0%
amusing to listen to uh some of the
 
05:06:32.570 --> 05:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
online uh scuba diving areas and and
 
05:06:34.788 --> 05:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
people cannot believe what New Hampshire
 
05:06:37.128 --> 05:06:37.138 align:start position:0%
is doing in this regard
 
05:06:39.350 --> 05:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
um they do understand Maine however I
 
05:06:41.030 --> 05:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
don't understand that part but that's
 
05:06:42.948 --> 05:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
you're right I do use understand I don't
 
05:06:45.110 --> 05:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
understand but here's something I do
 
05:06:47.208 --> 05:06:47.218 align:start position:0%
understand we have in our application
 
05:06:47.218 --> 05:06:48.610 align:start position:0%
understand we have in our application
for

05:06:48.610 --> 05:06:48.620 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:06:52.610 --> 05:06:52.620 align:start position:0%
licenses for lobster and crab in New
 
05:06:54.708 --> 05:06:54.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have
 
05:06:57.590 --> 05:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
um a checkoff box for whether you are a
 
05:07:00.170 --> 05:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
resident or a non-resident
 
05:07:02.750 --> 05:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
um and you are able to get a
 
05:07:04.670 --> 05:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
non-resident commercial license a
 
05:07:07.250 --> 05:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
limited commercial license a part-time
 
05:07:10.250 --> 05:07:10.260 align:start position:0%
uh commercial license
 
05:07:13.128 --> 05:07:13.138 align:start position:0%
um and even a no I guess you can't get a
 
05:07:16.250 --> 05:07:16.260 align:start position:0%
lobster helper license is a non-resident
 
05:07:19.190 --> 05:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
but but for six hundred dollars this
 
05:07:21.350 --> 05:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
says with the asterisk that you belong
 
05:07:23.930 --> 05:07:23.940 align:start position:0%
to a a state that has reciprocal
 
05:07:27.050 --> 05:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
agreements which we have with Maine and
 
05:07:28.788 --> 05:07:28.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:07:30.890 --> 05:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
um for six hundred dollars they can get
 
05:07:32.530 --> 05:07:32.540 align:start position:0%
a non-resident
 
05:07:36.350 --> 05:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
commercial license that entitles them I
 
05:07:39.610 --> 05:07:39.620 align:start position:0%
believe to a thousand traps
 
05:07:44.628 --> 05:07:44.638 align:start position:0%
so we are willing to allow New Hampshire
 
05:07:47.868 --> 05:07:47.878 align:start position:0%
um to sell to non-residents
 
05:07:47.878 --> 05:07:49.070 align:start position:0%
um to sell to non-residents
um

05:07:49.070 --> 05:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:53.270 --> 05:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
Lobster Lobster licenses and not allow
 
05:07:53.280 --> 05:07:54.050 align:start position:0%
Lobster Lobster licenses and not allow
um

05:07:54.050 --> 05:07:54.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:57.650 --> 05:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
divers from uh who wherever in New
 
05:08:00.530 --> 05:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the opportunity to take three
 
05:08:03.410 --> 05:08:03.420 align:start position:0%
lobsters for their own personal loose
 
05:08:06.050 --> 05:08:06.060 align:start position:0%
use as a as a sport I don't understand
 
05:08:09.590 --> 05:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
that at all secondly
 
05:08:09.600 --> 05:08:10.190 align:start position:0%
that at all secondly
um

05:08:10.190 --> 05:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:13.430 --> 05:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
we yet we it is true we are a policy
 
05:08:15.170 --> 05:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
committee here
 
05:08:18.230 --> 05:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
um those of you that sit on it full time
 
05:08:18.240 --> 05:08:19.128 align:start position:0%
um those of you that sit on it full time
um

05:08:19.128 --> 05:08:19.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:23.270 --> 05:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
I am pledging to you as the sponsor and
 
05:08:26.690 --> 05:08:26.700 align:start position:0%
as a co-sponsor of the amendment
 
05:08:29.570 --> 05:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
um you do have the ability to have uh
 
05:08:32.750 --> 05:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
influence on how this bill changes as it
 
05:08:34.850 --> 05:08:34.860 align:start position:0%
goes through the process I can't
 
05:08:37.730 --> 05:08:37.740 align:start position:0%
remember a single bill in my time here
 
05:08:42.590 --> 05:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
since 2010 that the bill that was seen
 
05:08:45.530 --> 05:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
by the initial policy committee was the
 
05:08:47.208 --> 05:08:47.218 align:start position:0%
bill that came out of the sausage
 
05:08:49.250 --> 05:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
machine at the other end without any
 
05:08:50.628 --> 05:08:50.638 align:start position:0%
changes in it
 
05:08:54.410 --> 05:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
um it it constantly has something in
 
05:08:56.448 --> 05:08:56.458 align:start position:0%
there I am telling you that I'm
 
05:08:59.628 --> 05:08:59.638 align:start position:0%
available anytime that anybody wants to
 
05:09:02.810 --> 05:09:02.820 align:start position:0%
change anything in this bill and we'll
 
05:09:06.230 --> 05:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
have a discussion about it we do have uh
 
05:09:08.628 --> 05:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
I don't know how any two or three or
 
05:09:11.330 --> 05:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
four more
 
05:09:13.868 --> 05:09:13.878 align:start position:0%
I hate the phrase but bites at the Apple
 
05:09:16.250 --> 05:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
we have the ability to make these
 
05:09:20.090 --> 05:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
changes throughout the process so I
 
05:09:23.530 --> 05:09:23.540 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem listening to anyone
 
05:09:27.410 --> 05:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
in in any of these uh issues that were
 
05:09:29.750 --> 05:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
brought up that includes fish and game
 
05:09:32.270 --> 05:09:32.280 align:start position:0%
if they would like to uh contact me
 
05:09:35.570 --> 05:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
which I've never had happen
 
05:09:37.788 --> 05:09:37.798 align:start position:0%
um with that I think I'll end my
 
05:09:40.730 --> 05:09:40.740 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'll go from there thank
 
05:09:43.070 --> 05:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
you and representative Khan if it's new
 
05:09:44.868 --> 05:09:44.878 align:start position:0%
ground I'd be willing to entertain the
 
05:09:46.610 --> 05:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
comment because it seems like we're
 
05:09:48.170 --> 05:09:48.180 align:start position:0%
starting to churn the same things and I
 
05:09:49.610 --> 05:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
don't want to continue with that process
 
05:09:52.250 --> 05:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you I just want to
 
05:09:53.990 --> 05:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that everybody's in the same
 
05:09:56.448 --> 05:09:56.458 align:start position:0%
page we heard the testimony from
 
05:09:59.930 --> 05:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
licensing Authority that Outsider a
 
05:10:02.750 --> 05:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
visitor or another State's residents
 
05:10:04.730 --> 05:10:04.740 align:start position:0%
cannot have any license in New Hampshire
 
05:10:07.070 --> 05:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
I want to have that on the record that
 
05:10:09.590 --> 05:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
that is true or not
 
05:10:12.890 --> 05:10:12.900 align:start position:0%
no no can we hear from the licensing
 
05:10:15.708 --> 05:10:15.718 align:start position:0%
Authority Mr chairman
 
05:10:18.590 --> 05:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
we can quickly hear that I believe
 
05:10:20.270 --> 05:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
though I could probably save her walking
 
05:10:22.910 --> 05:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
up because I believe that uh her comment
 
05:10:24.590 --> 05:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
was that no other state is giving us
 
05:10:26.868 --> 05:10:26.878 align:start position:0%
reciprocity at this time so therefore
 
05:10:28.850 --> 05:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
it's a moot point and we can't sell the
 
05:10:30.770 --> 05:10:30.780 align:start position:0%
license because of the requirement that
 
05:10:33.708 --> 05:10:33.718 align:start position:0%
we sell to a reciprocal state so
 
05:10:35.390 --> 05:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
although we have the license category
 
05:10:37.910 --> 05:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
and the license category is listed and
 
05:10:40.310 --> 05:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
purchasable the purchase is dependent
 
05:10:42.490 --> 05:10:42.500 align:start position:0%
upon the other state also having a
 
05:10:44.810 --> 05:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
reciprocal out of state commercial
 
05:10:47.030 --> 05:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
Lobster license that does not currently
 
05:10:47.040 --> 05:10:48.530 align:start position:0%
Lobster license that does not currently
exist

05:10:48.530 --> 05:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
exist
 
05:10:48.540 --> 05:10:49.970 align:start position:0%
exist
so

05:10:49.970 --> 05:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:10:51.830 --> 05:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
does that stop you from having to walk
 
05:10:53.810 --> 05:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
up thank you I'm glad I have a good
 
05:10:53.820 --> 05:10:55.550 align:start position:0%
up thank you I'm glad I have a good
memory

05:10:55.550 --> 05:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
memory
 
05:10:58.610 --> 05:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
and I will just very quickly hit rep
 
05:11:00.230 --> 05:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
forward as long as again it's new ground
 
05:11:01.788 --> 05:11:01.798 align:start position:0%
that we haven't touched already because
 
05:11:04.190 --> 05:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
I'd like to move us forward I just want
 
05:11:07.550 --> 05:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
to know just to make clear the OTP was
 
05:11:10.330 --> 05:11:10.340 align:start position:0%
on the amendment and the bill correct
 
05:11:13.610 --> 05:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
so the way that this goes because you're
 
05:11:15.230 --> 05:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
a freshman I'll explain and there's more
 
05:11:16.730 --> 05:11:16.740 align:start position:0%
freshmen here
 
05:11:18.470 --> 05:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
um you have to move the amendment to be
 
05:11:20.510 --> 05:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
able to amend it it has to be a positive
 
05:11:22.310 --> 05:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
movement on the amendment on the I mean
 
05:11:24.590 --> 05:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
the bill so the bill was moved OTP to
 
05:11:26.208 --> 05:11:26.218 align:start position:0%
allow it to be open for an amendment the
 
05:11:29.030 --> 05:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
amendment was then put forward as OTP so
 
05:11:30.890 --> 05:11:30.900 align:start position:0%
that we could discuss the amendment the
 
05:11:33.530 --> 05:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
vote currently is on the amendment when
 
05:11:36.050 --> 05:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
we finish we will then have a vote on
 
05:11:43.310 --> 05:11:43.320 align:start position:0%

in the committee while you're here and
 
05:17:05.090 --> 05:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
even I guess the substitutes because
 
05:17:07.730 --> 05:17:07.740 align:start position:0%
you'll be jealous we are working on two
 
05:17:10.010 --> 05:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
field trips for the committee we want to
 
05:17:12.170 --> 05:17:12.180 align:start position:0%
go to owls Brook
 
05:17:15.470 --> 05:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
uh Al Brook and we're also working with
 
05:17:17.810 --> 05:17:17.820 align:start position:0%
uh representative Brown here who used to
 
05:17:21.470 --> 05:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
be a member of Des to uh survey the area
 
05:17:23.868 --> 05:17:23.878 align:start position:0%
where the the Senate has decided to put
 
05:17:25.730 --> 05:17:25.740 align:start position:0%
a bill in to ask us to build a boat ramp
 
05:17:28.128 --> 05:17:28.138 align:start position:0%
and then to also take a tour on the Des
 
05:17:30.470 --> 05:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
boat to see some of the areas that we do
 
05:17:32.330 --> 05:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
for cleanup and what the process is on
 
05:17:33.708 --> 05:17:33.718 align:start position:0%
our shorelines
 
05:17:36.350 --> 05:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
