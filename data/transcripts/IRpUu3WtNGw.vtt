all of the matters that we lobby on are
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
based on our legislative
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%

our staff does not direct policy and i
 
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
think that's important so the positions

that we take
 
00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
on certain legislation is based on those
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
principles and policies that our members
 
00:26:45.279 --> 00:26:46.070 align:start position:0%
principles and policies that our members
adopted

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
and directed us to take positions on
 
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
our primary concerns when it comes to
 
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
our advocacy
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
unsurprisingly include unfunded mandates
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
or any legislation that increases
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
municipal costs
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
state preemption of already existing
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
municipal authority
 
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
as well as any legislation that would
 
00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:06.789 align:start position:0%
as well as any legislation that would
make

00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:06.799 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
local government more difficult or more
 
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:09.830 align:start position:0%
local government more difficult or more
efficient

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
efficient
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
and so generally we are here and in
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
other committees supporting legislation
 
00:27:16.149 --> 00:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
that enables local government to operate
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
more efficiently
 
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
to save money to serve its citizens so
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
that's an overview of nhma who we are
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
and what we do
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
um and i'd like to just turn it over to
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
cordell and nate to talk a little bit
 
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.269 align:start position:0%
cordell and nate to talk a little bit
about

00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
municipal government
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%

insanely
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
short presentation about
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
municipal government and uh forgive us
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
if we if we are
 
00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
being too simple i know some of you have
 
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh extensive experience in municipal
 
00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:13.669 align:start position:0%
uh extensive experience in municipal
government

00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
and you know all this stuff but some of
 
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.430 align:start position:0%
and you know all this stuff but some of
you

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
are relatively new to municipal
 
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
government so
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
as i say this is going to be extremely
 
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
brief and extremely
 
00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:28.470 align:start position:0%
brief and extremely
elementary

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
the basic question that i think we
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
all need to understand is what is a
 
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.669 align:start position:0%
all need to understand is what is a
municipality

00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
uh and very simply a municipality
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
is a political subdivision of the state
 
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
it is it it's a it's an area
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
that has been incorporated um by the
 
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:49.430 align:start position:0%
that has been incorporated um by the
state

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
and has been given authority to to act
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
um there are other political
 
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
subdivisions counties
 
00:28:59.590 --> 00:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
school districts village districts
 
00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
but we represent municipalities and
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
municipalities there are two
 
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
two types there are cities and towns and
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
those those are who we represent there
 
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
is no such thing in new hampshire as a
 
00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.549 align:start position:0%
is no such thing in new hampshire as a
township

00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
township
 
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
there's many years ago a member of this
 
00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.590 align:start position:0%
there's many years ago a member of this
committee

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
frequently talked about townships and it
 
00:29:19.269 --> 00:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
always made me cringe
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
there's no such thing we have cities and
 
00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.549 align:start position:0%
there's no such thing we have cities and
towns

00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
nh in a few minutes is going to talk
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
about the basic difference between
 
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
cities and towns
 
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh much of what this uh committee deals
 
00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.110 align:start position:0%
uh much of what this uh committee deals
with

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
or pretty much everything this committee
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
deals with are
 
00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:39.039 align:start position:0%
uh are the laws governing political
 
00:29:39.039 --> 00:29:41.029 align:start position:0%
uh are the laws governing political
subdivisions

00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
subdivisions
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
and a very fundamental thing that that
 
00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:44.870 align:start position:0%
and a very fundamental thing that that
everyone

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:29:47.669 --> 00:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
needs to understand is that new
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire is not a home rule state
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
which means that cities and towns do not
 
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
have inherent authority to make laws
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
they have only the authority that the
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
state gives them
 
00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
in in the form of enabling statutes
 
00:30:06.789 --> 00:30:06.799 align:start position:0%
so for example there's a statute that
 
00:30:06.799 --> 00:30:07.590 align:start position:0%
so for example there's a statute that
says

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
a city or town can adopt a zoning
 
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
ordinance without that statute
 
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
a municipality could not enact a zoning
 
00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.110 align:start position:0%
a municipality could not enact a zoning
ordinance

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
and most most cities and towns have
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
adopted zoning ordinances there are a
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
few that have not
 
00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
there's a statute that says you can you
 
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
can have a
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
police department you're not required to
 
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
and there are a few towns that don't
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
have police departments
 
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
there's statutes that say that cities
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
in the absence of a statute like that
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
you can't do it
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
for example if a city or town wanted to
 
00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:46.470 align:start position:0%
for example if a city or town wanted to
require

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
drivers or passengers passengers to wear
 
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
a seat belt
 
00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
they can't do that they don't have that
 
00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919 align:start position:0%
authority they don't have the authority
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
for example to impose an income tax or a
 
00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
sales tax
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
and so a lot of a lot of times in
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
this committee we're dealing with issues
 
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.110 align:start position:0%
this committee we're dealing with issues
where

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
there's a question does the municipality
 
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
have the authority to do this
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
should we give them this a short
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
authority should we take away this
 
00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.269 align:start position:0%
authority should we take away this
authority

00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
should we modify it in some in some
 
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
respect and you'll hear us
 
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
often talking talking about a statute
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
being enabling
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
it enables municipalities to to
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
um adopt certain ordinances or to take
 
00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:27.669 align:start position:0%
um adopt certain ordinances or to take
certain

00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
certain
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
actions um
 
00:31:33.269 --> 00:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
there are also uh certain statutes that
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
create mandates
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
these are things that cities and towns
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
must do
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
um uh we don't have any choice about
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
them and a few examples
 
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
are that municipalities must conduct
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
state elections when every two years
 
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
when the state has an election
 
00:31:51.669 --> 00:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
the municipalities are in charge of
 
00:31:53.669 --> 00:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
administering those and they have to do
 
00:31:53.679 --> 00:31:53.990 align:start position:0%
administering those and they have to do
it

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
and they have to follow state law in
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities must provide for disposal
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
of solid waste
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
in some way or another whether it's by
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
having a
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
transfer station um collecting
 
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
trash and and uh hauling it to
 
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
a to a transfer station or uh or a
 
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
landfill somewhere
 
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
in some manner municipalities must
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
provide for uh solid waste
 
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
um they must provide assistance to the
 
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
indigent what is commonly referred to as
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
local welfare and there are a number of
 
00:32:30.559 --> 00:32:31.269 align:start position:0%
local welfare and there are a number of
other

00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh mandates things that cities and towns
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
are required to do
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
um we generally like to resist
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
the creation of any additional state
 
00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:42.710 align:start position:0%
the creation of any additional state
mandates

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
especially if they are going to require
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities to spend money
 
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
unless the state is going to
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
provide the money to to implement those
 
00:32:53.039 --> 00:32:53.909 align:start position:0%
provide the money to to implement those
mandates

00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
so we will be uh sometimes in this
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
committee and sometimes in other
 
00:32:58.159 --> 00:32:59.190 align:start position:0%
committee and sometimes in other
committees

00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh lobbying against things that would
 
00:33:01.679 --> 00:33:02.230 align:start position:0%
uh lobbying against things that would
impose

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
impose
 
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
additional mandates and especially
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
expensive mandates on municipalities
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
and another uh another thing is
 
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
preemption um where
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
the the state has given municipalities
 
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
authority to do something
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
but then take some of that authority
 
00:33:21.519 --> 00:33:22.470 align:start position:0%
but then take some of that authority
away

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
for example i talked i talked about
 
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
zoning municipalities are
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
enabled to adopt zoning ordinances
 
00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
however the state crete has partially
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
preempted that
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh for example the state says that um
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
a municipality although you can regulate
 
00:33:41.909 --> 00:33:41.919 align:start position:0%
the use of land
 
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
you can't prohibit uh agriculture
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
with your zoning ordinance that is
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
preempted you you can't prohibit
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
people from having accessory dwelling
 
00:33:53.039 --> 00:33:53.430 align:start position:0%
people from having accessory dwelling
units

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
units
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
that is preempted so those are those are
 
00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
uh some of the things we'll be talking
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
about regularly in this committee
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
enabling statutes mandates preemption
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
the division of authority between the
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
state and the cities and towns
 
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
um and now nation is just going to talk
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
for a few minutes about the forms of
 
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
municipal government the forms of cities
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
and towns
 
00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
well thank you cordell and as mentioned
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
i'm nate grays
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
um so one of the complications with
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
what all of you are going to do over the
 
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
next couple years is
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
deal with the forms of municipal
 
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
government there are 13 cities and 221
 
00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:35.839 align:start position:0%
towns in the state and
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
i guess to begin with it's good to begin
 
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
with an analogy
 
00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
um so typically a town
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
consists of the legislative body so the
 
00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
voters of the town
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
and then a governing body which is often
 
00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
the select board
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
but there are variations you might have
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
a charter town
 
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
which has uh eliminates the board of
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
selectmen and you have
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
essentially a the equivalent of a city
 
00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.630 align:start position:0%
essentially a the equivalent of a city
council

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
council
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
and on the city side of things often
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
what you have
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
is you have the the voters elect a body
 
00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
either the aldermen or the city council
 
00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:13.510 align:start position:0%
either the aldermen or the city council
and

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
they serve as the legislative body much
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
as you you do for the state
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
so they make the determinations about
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
what the rules should be the ordinances
 
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
the policies and then that's implemented
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
by some some sort of
 
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
administrative officer that could be a
 
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.510 align:start position:0%
administrative officer that could be a
mayor

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
mayor
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
or it could be a mayor city manager
 
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
type situation now because there are all
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
these options
 
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
you often you often have to deal with
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
the nuances
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
of how this functions but the good news
 
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:44.790 align:start position:0%
of how this functions but the good news
is

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
is when we looked up where everyone on
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
this committee came from
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
um you have at least one member
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
from each type of of local government
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
so there there is that expertise
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
on this committee which i think will be
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
very useful
 
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
um because you'll be very familiar
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
you're obviously very familiar with with
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
the places you represent
 
00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
well probably one of the other
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
complicating factors
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
that you'll hear a lot of talk about um
 
00:36:15.119 --> 00:36:16.230 align:start position:0%
that you'll hear a lot of talk about um
because

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
it is often at issue is the division
 
00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.150 align:start position:0%
it is often at issue is the division
between

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
sb2 towns or what's called sb2 towns and
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
traditional towns
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
and so just to summarize traditional
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
towns have a town meeting
 
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
where the select board and other
 
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
local officials are voted on by ballot
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
and then they have a business session
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
afterwards in the business session
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
determines things like
 
00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
town budget um and and other items
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
sp2 towns are different in that they
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
begin with a deliberative session
 
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh and at that session is when all the
 
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
warrant articles
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
are debated so basically everything
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's going to come up all the
 
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.670 align:start position:0%
that's that's going to come up all the
legislation

00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
and then they have their official ballot
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
voting day where everything is voted on
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
so you know whether it's a citizen
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
petition or whether it's something the
 
00:37:05.839 --> 00:37:06.390 align:start position:0%
petition or whether it's something the
governing

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
governing
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
governing body wants to discuss it's all
 
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
voted on by ballot
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh and one of the things that has been a
 
00:37:14.069 --> 00:37:14.079 align:start position:0%
big issue
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
uh in the past couple years has been um
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
town meeting uh postponement obviously
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
we're in the middle of covid
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh so that has been a big issue as local
 
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
officials have really struggled to make
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
as we go forward into town meeting
 
00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:31.589 align:start position:0%
as we go forward into town meeting
season

00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:31.599 align:start position:0%
season
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
that they can do so uh safely and so i
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
imagine you'll
 
00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
hear from us again on what the
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
unfortunately named
 
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
um new uh sb2
 
00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
for 2021 which involves
 
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
sort of postponing postponing town
 
00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:50.710 align:start position:0%
sort of postponing postponing town
meeting

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
due to covet that's really a
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
very brief summary of the types of forms
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
of government
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
cordow i don't know if you want to add
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
i don't want to add anything other than
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
to say we have some uh background some
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh information um
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh some publications that we can make
 
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:13.910 align:start position:0%
uh some publications that we can make
available

00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
available

services committee for a number of years
 
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
and really enjoyed
 
00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
that for the last three terms and
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
because i'm uh
 
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
a selectman again uh i served uh
 
00:51:16.309 --> 00:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
nine years and i went off my wife got
 
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
sick and
 
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
i lost her and then we came back
 
00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh so i'm happy to be on this committee
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
and hope i can
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
contribute uh as i said i lost my wife i
 
00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
was lucky to
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh fortunate to find a lovely lady
 
00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
second time around
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
uh so we're enjoying our late retirement
 
00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
okay so like i mentioned we're going to
 
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
spend the rest of the meeting
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh talking about really the sausage
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
making of the committee there's a there
 
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
are a lot of details i'm going to try to
 
00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:53.829 align:start position:0%
are a lot of details i'm going to try to
skip

00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
skip
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
some of these details for example the
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
the rules and expectations about how we
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
do subcommittees i don't
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's necessary to get
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
into that today when we have our first
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we can talk about
 
00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
things like that then but i'm just going
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
give you an overview of what the
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
expectations are and what the
 
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
what the rules are and where i have
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
discretion and where i don't and if you
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
have questions during this please
 
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
exercise the
 
00:52:25.589 --> 00:52:25.599 align:start position:0%
raise your hand button down below on the
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
bottom of your screen and
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
and christina will help me manage that
 
00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
okay for uh one of the things that i'll
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
be doing
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
is uh and we've been asked to do is try
 
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
to organize the bills that we're going
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
to be reviewing
 
00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
by subject matter uh and try to group
 
00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
bills together that that that relate to
 
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
each other
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
so we'll be we'll be doing that and that
 
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
and and that will help
 
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
uh when you think about the bills that
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
we have in front of us
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh which are about uh somewhere between
 
00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
40 and 50 at this point
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
the last time i checked i i counted up
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
39 but there was still several bills to
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
be assigned to
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
committees so i'm not exactly sure what
 
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
the number is today
 
00:53:13.109 --> 00:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
but it's it is substantially less than
 
00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
it was last year
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
i can say that i think last year we we
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
did about 75 bills
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
and a good portion of them ended up
 
00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
lying on the table
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh as covet hit us and
 
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
a good a good number of them died so
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
we'll see some of those bills come back
 
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
the whole issue about pink cards and
 
00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
blue cards and people testifying
 
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
we won't talk about that because we're
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
not going to have a lot of in-person
 
00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.309 align:start position:0%
not going to have a lot of in-person
testimony

00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh as far as quorums go
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's not necessary for us to have a
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
quorum in a meeting like this
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
or uh where we're taking uh public
 
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
testimony the only time we have to have
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
a quorum is when we have an executive
 
00:53:55.359 --> 00:53:57.589 align:start position:0%
a quorum is when we have an executive
session

00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
as far as decorum goes i would ask you
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
to treat everybody
 
00:54:07.109 --> 00:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
that especially people on the committee
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh with us or people that are about to
 
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh with with the respect
 
00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
please address your fellow committee
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
members as representative
 
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
dolan or representative piamonte
 
00:54:25.109 --> 00:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
and when we're in front of the public i
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
would ask you to try to avoid
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
referring to each other by your first
 
00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
names uh as that
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
will help us with our decorum but there
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
is a rule about no food or drinks
 
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
other than water being consumed when the
 
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
public is present
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
my discretion on that is i would i will
 
00:54:47.829 --> 00:54:47.839 align:start position:0%
i'll enforce the no food
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
but i will interpret water as
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
as water in its dark form
 
00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the color of coffee or
 
00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:57.270 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the color of coffee or
tea

00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
tea
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
so if you have water in that form i
 
00:55:04.829 --> 00:55:04.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:04.839 --> 00:55:08.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
when you ask uh people questions uh
 
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
during public testimony people who are
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
testifying before us
 
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
please please make sure you use that
 
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
time to get
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
answers to your questions that is not a
 
00:55:22.079 --> 00:55:22.630 align:start position:0%
answers to your questions that is not a
time

00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
for for uh arguing with people that come
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
before us
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
or uh to make statements you
 
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
you when you when you converse with a
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
with someone giving testimony it really
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
should be in the form of a question
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
to get information about whatever the
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
topic is
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
and if if if you decide you want to make
 
00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
a speech
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
about something one of us myself or tony
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
will stop you and
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
ask you to rethink that and see if you
 
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
now as i mentioned before we will need a
 
00:56:04.079 --> 00:56:05.589 align:start position:0%
now as i mentioned before we will need a
quorum

00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
quorum
 
00:56:08.549 --> 00:56:08.559 align:start position:0%
to move forward with executive session
 
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
now we have a we have a 10 to 9
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
population in our in our committee 10

republicans nine democrats so
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
we're pretty it doesn't get much more
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
even than that and
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%

00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
in a bipartisan way uh and i agree with
 
00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.230 align:start position:0%
in a bipartisan way uh and i agree with
that

00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
but let's let's let's be clear there
 
00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
from time to time those bills that come
 
00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
up that will be partisan in nature and
 
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
ex we should expect that from time to
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
time there will be partisan votes
 
00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
uh hopefully that is not uh
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
very often but it would be i think
 
00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:55.839 align:start position:0%
uh wrong of me not to tell you to that
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
your expectation would be that that will
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
happen once
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
during during executive session that is
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
a time
 
00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:13.829 --> 00:57:13.839 align:start position:0%
only on rare occasions would i recognize
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
a member of the public during an
 
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
executive session if there's a specific
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
issue that the committee is stuck on
 
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
and then needs clarification uh and a
 
00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
public member is present
 
00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
then i might i might recognize remember
 
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
from the public but
 
00:57:30.549 --> 00:57:30.559 align:start position:0%
you should expect that will be a rare
 
00:57:30.559 --> 00:57:31.990 align:start position:0%
you should expect that will be a rare
thing

00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
in executive session tabling is not
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
allowed so if someone makes a motion to
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
table a bill
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
an executive session that will be ruled
 
00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
when you are voting an executive session
 
00:57:49.589 --> 00:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
or when you are petitioning
 
00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
you may vote on a motion uh only if
 
00:57:56.799 --> 00:57:57.430 align:start position:0%
you may vote on a motion uh only if
you're

00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
present when the question was put in
 
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
other words if you're out of the room
 
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559 align:start position:0%
either in the bathroom
 
00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
or taking a call or testifying in some
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
other committee
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
if the question is put to the to the
 
00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:10.799 align:start position:0%
committee uh
 
00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
and you return uh you will not be
 
00:58:14.309 --> 00:58:14.319 align:start position:0%
allowed to vote
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
on that particular bill unless you're
 
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
there when the
 
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
when the uh uh motion is uh was made
 
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
if there's a conflict you you if you're
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
there for the entire
 
00:58:28.789 --> 00:58:28.799 align:start position:0%
motion and you're in the room you will
 
00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
be required to vote
 
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
in executive session unless you have
 
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
come forth before the meeting and
 
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
filed a form with the clerk
 
00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
giving your intention not to vote for
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
whatever specific reason you have
 
00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:47.510 align:start position:0%
whatever specific reason you have
identified

00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
we will have amendments from time to
 
00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:52.970 align:start position:0%
time an executive session on bills
 
00:58:52.970 --> 00:58:54.230 align:start position:0%
time an executive session on bills
[Music]

00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
there can be as many as many amendments
 
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
as as members submit
 
00:59:01.349 --> 00:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
however coming out of committee we only
 
00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
can have one amendment
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
so that that means that if there are
 
00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:06.799 align:start position:0%
multiple amendments they will have to
 
00:59:06.799 --> 00:59:07.510 align:start position:0%
multiple amendments they will have to
become

00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
become
 
00:59:11.829 --> 00:59:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh customarily uh
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
the vice chair when we take a roll call
 
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
vote the vice chair will vote first and
 
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
the chair will vote last
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
that's by custom
 
00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
and any member of the committee can
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
change your vote
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
before the final vote is announced so if
 
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
you vote
 
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
okay to proceed and then later decide
 
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
you want to change that
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
to an itl vote an expedient to legislate
 
00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:45.760 align:start position:0%

01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
so the last point before before i leave
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
that just make sure you know
 
01:00:59.670 --> 01:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
that if you vote in executive session
 
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
to pass a bill or to kill a bill you can
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
change your vote
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's up that's up to you to um make it
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
that wish
 
01:01:08.829 --> 01:01:08.839 align:start position:0%
known to me and then we can change your
 
01:01:08.839 --> 01:01:11.589 align:start position:0%
known to me and then we can change your
vote

01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
now there are committee reports that um
 
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
that have to be uh published after each
 
01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:20.799 align:start position:0%
executive session vote
 
01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh the the slang for that used to be
 
01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:25.349 align:start position:0%
uh the the slang for that used to be
blurbs

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
blurbs
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
but we try not to use the that term
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
anymore but
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
that makes you more comfortable i
 
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
understand that's what it's about
 
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
now the committee report is supposed to
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
be clear concise
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
summary of the legislation and remember
 
01:01:40.079 --> 01:01:40.710 align:start position:0%
summary of the legislation and remember
that

01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
if any of this legislation ends up in
 
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
court the court tends to look at those
 
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
committee reports as legislative intent
 
01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
so they are important and if they're
 
01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.549 align:start position:0%
so they are important and if they're
argumentative

01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
argumentative
 
01:01:55.829 --> 01:01:55.839 align:start position:0%
or inappropriate uh the speaker will
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
when they get to his office he'll call
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
them out for example if you're
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
in a in a minority uh writing a minority
 
01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:04.309 align:start position:0%
in a in a minority uh writing a minority
report

01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
and you put put something down like
 
01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
you know why why is this not a good
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation well the
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
the legislators just lost their mind and
 
01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
just voted on something stupid that that
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
won't be allowed to be published
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
uh as you would suspect so it asks you
 
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
thoughtful uh write a short paragraph or
 
01:02:31.589 --> 01:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
or three or four lines whatever you're
 
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
most comfortable with but be
 
01:02:36.309 --> 01:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
clear concise and
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:47.039 align:start position:0%
okay one other thing i wanted to mention
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
was a couple of things
 
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
one about weapons you know that was a
 
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
rule that was
 
01:02:54.290 --> 01:02:54.300 align:start position:0%
recently changed
 
01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:57.270 align:start position:0%
recently changed

we'll deal with that
 
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh tech experts uh
 
01:04:06.549 --> 01:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
right now uh christina is
 
01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
this zoom meeting for us uh but
 
01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine with the number of
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
zoom meetings being held
 
01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
the number of folks that can manage them
 
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
for us
 
01:04:24.549 --> 01:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
is really stretched so i'm gonna
 
01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:27.039 align:start position:0%
throw it out for you to think about if
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
any of you
 
01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:29.790 align:start position:0%
feel technically
 
01:04:29.790 --> 01:04:31.029 align:start position:0%
feel technically
[Music]

01:04:31.029 --> 01:04:31.039 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
competent enough to take over
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
a zoom meeting like this and we can free
 
01:04:39.829 --> 01:04:39.839 align:start position:0%
up christina to do other things
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
or if she's busy if she's got multiple
 
01:04:43.829 --> 01:04:43.839 align:start position:0%
meetings on multiple committees to try
 
01:04:43.839 --> 01:04:44.230 align:start position:0%
meetings on multiple committees to try
to

01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
to manage we can run these uh meetings
 
01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
ourselves with the
 
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
if if you if any of you feel technically
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
competent to do that and we can
 
01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
certainly give some some short training
 
01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
to get that done but
 
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
i know some some of of you struggle to
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
to dial your phone on one end of the
 
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
spectrum and others
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
are very capable uh with computers
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
and uh and software such as this so i'll
 
01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
let you think about that
 
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
and and let me know if you'd like to be
 
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
considered as a tech expert to
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
to administer one of these zoom meetings
 
01:05:24.789 --> 01:05:24.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
if you're going to be absent you don't
 
01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
but i would appreciate a quick email
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
or a text telling me you're not going to
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
be able you're not going to attend
 
01:05:37.829 --> 01:05:37.839 align:start position:0%
it's none of my business if it's for a
 
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
health reason but
 
01:05:43.589 --> 01:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
i would just request that courtesy so
 
01:05:43.599 --> 01:05:44.390 align:start position:0%
i would just request that courtesy so
that

01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
if i'm holding a meeting or the start of
 
01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
a meeting looking for
 
01:05:49.589 --> 01:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
attendance of a certain number of people
 
01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
if i know you're not coming
 
01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
then we can move forward and not and not
 
01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:54.870 align:start position:0%
then we can move forward and not and not
wait

01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
wait
 
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
so please let me know if it's a if it's
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
an executive session
 
01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
absence uh each caucus has
 
01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
substitutes of how you how you would
 
01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
engage your caucus about identifying
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
your absence and
 
01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
whether or not a substitute will be
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
provided to the committee for that
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
so uh i would refer you
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
refer the democrats to representative
 
01:06:25.839 --> 01:06:26.789 align:start position:0%
refer the democrats to representative
porter

01:06:26.789 --> 01:06:26.799 align:start position:0%
porter
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
that if if you're going to be absent i
 
01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
would suspect she'll want
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
to know ahead of time and then and then
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
she can
 
01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
uh decide about finding a a
 
01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
with her caucus finding a substitute the
 
01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:40.950 align:start position:0%
with her caucus finding a substitute the
same

01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
same thing with uh with the republicans
 
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:44.549 align:start position:0%
same thing with uh with the republicans
if

01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to be absent please let uh
 
01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
in my case let tony fiamante know and uh
 
01:06:55.589 --> 01:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
we'll work about getting a substitute
 
01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%

01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
premature in asking this question um and
 
01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:07.670 align:start position:0%
premature in asking this question um and
i

01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
i very much appreciate you are very
 
01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
clear laying out
 
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
of the rules and how it goes but i'm
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
wondering if you're anticipating
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
our committee meeting in person any time
 
01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
okay great question because that was my
 
01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
next topic goes
 
01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
segway there you go thanks uh
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
right right now uh there is
 
01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh policy still in flux
 
01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh and i ask you to be flexible with
 
01:08:38.709 --> 01:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
that i know there are a lot of people
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
that are concerned about meeting in
 
01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.749 align:start position:0%
that are concerned about meeting in
person

01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:45.759 align:start position:0%
given the state of the virus and the
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
state of the vaccinations and
 
01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
and so forth so
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
what we're going to be doing is is
 
01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
typically in the past we've had
 
01:08:59.269 --> 01:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
committee meetings tuesday and wednesday
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
and sometimes on thursday if it wasn't a
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
general session
 
01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
i understand we're going to have
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
committee meetings now monday through
 
01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:08.229 align:start position:0%
committee meetings now monday through
friday

01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
friday
 
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
that that will not mean that you'll be
 
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
asked to meet more often you than you
 
01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
had in the past
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
it just means that the lob will be open
 
01:09:19.510 --> 01:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
monday through friday because of the
 
01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
you know that those of you familiar with
 
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
the lob
 
01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
there are dividers there are hard
 
01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
dividers between
 
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
committee rooms and when you pull those
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
dividers back
 
01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
the the committee rooms become double
 
01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:37.349 align:start position:0%
the the committee rooms become double
wide

01:09:37.349 --> 01:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
wide
 
01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh and uh and so
 
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have we would have committee
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
meetings with those dividers pulled back
 
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
to to uh promote social distancing
 
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
but when you do that then
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
only half the committees can meet at
 
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
this at the same time if their committee
 
01:09:57.510 --> 01:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
room is gone because it's
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
the other half is being used by another
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
committee so in order to
 
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
fill those slots they're gonna we're
 
01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
gonna have to have
 
01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
like we might be meeting for example
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
mondays and tuesdays
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
instead of tuesdays and thursdays or
 
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
thursdays and fridays
 
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
but there will be there will be a couple
 
01:10:17.189 --> 01:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
of days assigned to us so we
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
we won't be meeting monday through
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
friday it's just that the lob will be
 
01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:21.270 align:start position:0%
friday it's just that the lob will be
open

01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
open
 
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
for meetings now as far as uh
 
01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
meetings like this means uh where we're
 
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
going to have hearings public hearings
 
01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh my understanding is that
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh that this will be primarily zoom
 
01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:38.310 align:start position:0%
uh that this will be primarily zoom
meetings

01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
that those wishing to testify will
 
01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:42.070 align:start position:0%
that those wishing to testify will
testify

01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
through uh electronic uh means
 
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
that's going to be that is going to be
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
difficult i'm not sure exactly how
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's going to work or
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
where they're going to go to to to zoom
 
01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.790 align:start position:0%
where they're going to go to to to zoom
in

01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
but some of us may be in
 
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
the lob but you won't be required to
 
01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:02.310 align:start position:0%
the lob but you won't be required to
come

01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
come
 
01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
the uh if you don't want to come to
 
01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
those meetings you can
 
01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
you'll be able to zoom into those
 
01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
meetings uh
 
01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
as far as executive session goes
 
01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
the early discussion has been that
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
that will be different that because
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
you'll actually be voting during
 
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
executive session and making policy and
 
01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:25.510 align:start position:0%
executive session and making policy and
making

01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
making
 
01:11:28.229 --> 01:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
tough decisions that the original
 
01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
thought was
 
01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
that that those meetings should be in
 
01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
person and
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
uh people who don't want to come would
 
01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
have to ask for a substitute
 
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh for their absence now that's not hard
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
policy yet that's still in flux i
 
01:11:43.199 --> 01:11:43.990 align:start position:0%
policy yet that's still in flux i
suspect

01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
suspect
 
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to we're going to have an
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
option for a blended
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
type of meeting where people can come in
 
01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:52.550 align:start position:0%
type of meeting where people can come in
person

01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
or they can or they can choose to uh
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
zoom in
 
01:11:59.350 --> 01:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
but that i can tell you that that
 
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
that decision hasn't been made yet it
 
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
has a lot to do with the
 
01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
from what i understand the technology
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's being uh put in place in the lobs
 
01:12:12.149 --> 01:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
right now that technology
 
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
consists of some air circulation filters
 
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
that have hepa filters and have uvc
 
01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:21.030 align:start position:0%
that have hepa filters and have uvc
lights

01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
lights
 
01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
in them there's what i've been told
 
01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to
 
01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
cleanse the air in the room three times
 
01:12:32.229 --> 01:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
an hour and
 
01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
when with those rooms opened up with
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
those partitions pulled down
 
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
that there's room to be seated
 
01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
at least uh six feet apart it'd be every
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
other chair or every third chair
 
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
so but again that is policy that is
 
01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
i'm still under development and uh
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
i don't think we've had a i don't think
 
01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
the speaker's had a readout yet on the
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
on the technology that they're employing
 
01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
and how well it's going to work and all
 
01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
that stuff so i would ask you to stay
 
01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
flexible with that
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been yet made yet and as far
 
01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.229 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been yet made yet and as far
as

01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
our process i don't see us
 
01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
having having a need to meet for the
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
next few weeks
 
01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh so we we still have some time to uh
 
01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
to let this policy uh uh settle in
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
and i'll certainly keep you posted as to
 
01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
how it works out but
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
i suspect that uh
 
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
hearings are going to be generally zoom
 
01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:36.470 align:start position:0%
hearings are going to be generally zoom
meetings

01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
01:13:39.189 --> 01:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
and executive sessions will be blended
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
that's my expectation
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
but uh we'll we'll see i'm i'm not the
 
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
decision maker
 
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
i'm just passing on what i've heard mr
 
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
chair thank you very much for your
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
your long and um
 
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
interesting answer i'm just going to
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
tell you right up front right now
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
you will not be seeing me in person
 
01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
until i've been vaccinated twice
 
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
that's all okay so
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
i i understand i'm i am eagerly awaiting
 
01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:09.189 align:start position:0%
i i understand i'm i am eagerly awaiting

my
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
vaccination too anyone else ever have a
 
01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
question and you have uh
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative maggiore and
 
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
representative porter with their hands
 
01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:18.310 align:start position:0%
representative porter with their hands
raised

01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%

01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
okay representative imaginary thank you
 
01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
um i just and i appreciate uh i
 
01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate the difficulty in trying to
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
navigate through all this and uh the
 
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
questions may not have
 
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
full answers so i appreciate all that
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
you're doing right now i'm curious
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
if you have right now a a uh a
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
target for when we might have our first
 
01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
hearing or when we're gonna begin our
 
01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:42.470 align:start position:0%
hearing or when we're gonna begin our
work

01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
good question i i am thinking two to
 
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
and uh well we'll certainly uh put put a
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
notice out
 
01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna i want to wait until we see
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
what what bills
 
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
are coming our way uh first so uh
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
and then we can group them uh by subject
 
01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:05.350 align:start position:0%
and then we can group them uh by subject
matter

01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
matter
 
01:15:08.709 --> 01:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
there is until these policies settle
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
down a little bit
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
i think it's i think it makes sense for
 
01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
us to wait
 
01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh and and not try to rush things uh and
 
01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:19.510 align:start position:0%
uh and and not try to rush things uh and
also

01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
especially in the face of some of the
 
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
concern that people have about the virus
 
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh was it uh

who are restricted by their doctors
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
from being in in a
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
public situation like this and would not
 
01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
be able to attend executive sessions in
 
01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:55.669 align:start position:0%
be able to attend executive sessions in
person

01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
um so i just want i know you're in a
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
difficult situation i just

want to make you aware of that um as i'm
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
sure you already
 
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
are but i just want to make sure some of
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
us just can't come
 
01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
due to living situations or health
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
situations if we're in person
 
01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
um so it would make us heart make it
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
hard for us to do our jobs
 
01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
okay no thank you i am aware of that and
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
i do appreciate it
 
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
and uh representative manjuputi
 
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
yeah this is in regards to being in
 
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:28.790 align:start position:0%
yeah this is in regards to being in
person

01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
i am a diabetic and my doctor
 
01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
strictly prohibits me from going into
 
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
any uh in-person meeting and i
 
01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
also my husband is a public school
 
01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:41.910 align:start position:0%
also my husband is a public school
teacher

01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
and he goes he's in person
 
01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
and so i have to be very diligent and
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
quarantine myself
 
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of my possible exposure so
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
that would put a lot of constraints and
 
01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:57.590 align:start position:0%
that would put a lot of constraints and
um

01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
so i just want to let you know it's not
 
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
i want i don't want to work but
 
01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of medical and
 
01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
situational constraints
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
for me to be in person right i
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%

i have to stay alive to represent so
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
yeah special elections are expensive
 
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
that's a bad uh
 
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh if we have any anybody else uh
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
any questions does anybody have any
 
01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
questions about what i mentioned about
 
01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:21.030 align:start position:0%
questions about what i mentioned about
the

01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
what i call the sausage making or
 
01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:25.210 align:start position:0%
weapons or
 
01:18:25.210 --> 01:18:27.030 align:start position:0%
weapons or
[Music]

01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
how we deal with those testifying and
 
01:18:33.510 --> 01:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
yeah i had target at 11 15 to try to
 
01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
wrap this thing up and
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
and we're about 11 20 so uh if anybody
 
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any final questions
 
01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
representative powers put her hand up
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
and then uh representative mention okay
 
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
president powers
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
power thank you um chairman dolan
 
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
the question that i have as a freshman
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
and i was just curious to know when we
 
01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:57.430 align:start position:0%
and i was just curious to know when we
do

01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
have hearings and executive sessions
 
01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
typically how what's the duration of
 
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
either type of um meeting thank you
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
well that's a good question there is
 
01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
there is a uh
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
there is a rule change uh or i don't
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
know if it was a rule or a custom change
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh that to try to move things along a
 
01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
little quicker this year because we have
 
01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
so many things that
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
that are going to slow us down like like
 
01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
this meeting in person
 
01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
probably would be uh probably
 
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
not more than half of the length of time
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
because it is longer when you go through
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
these zoom meetings
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
but the in executive session
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
we typically will schedule
 
01:19:47.669 --> 01:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
in my judgment how much time it's going
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
to take to go through
 
01:19:53.669 --> 01:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
each bill and
 
01:19:56.670 --> 01:19:56.680 align:start position:0%
we can we'll often schedule them
 
01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:57.830 align:start position:0%
we can we'll often schedule them
[Music]

01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
15 to 30 minutes apart per bill
 
01:20:03.669 --> 01:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
but the the rule change or the custom
 
01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
change that is authorized during this
 
01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:06.950 align:start position:0%
change that is authorized during this
session

01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
is that in the previous session
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
we always wanted to put at least one day
 
01:20:16.149 --> 01:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
between executive sessions and hearings
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
but this year we are authorized to
 
01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
conduct an immediate executive session
 
01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:23.990 align:start position:0%
conduct an immediate executive session
if

01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
if the uh situation warrants
 
01:20:30.550 --> 01:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
for example i was talking to
 
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
representative porter about this
 
01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh offline if we if we see a
 
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
it's apparent to us that the committee
 
01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:40.390 align:start position:0%
it's apparent to us that the committee
is

01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
pretty unanimous one way or the other
 
01:20:44.830 --> 01:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
either to kill a bill or to
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
um support a bill
 
01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
that to wait it to wait a day
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh or to wait another week uh so that it
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
can be published the fact that i think
 
01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
01:20:59.189 --> 01:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
that's what we did last year we waited
 
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
usually the next week
 
01:21:03.430 --> 01:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
so because we wanted it to be in the
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
calendar a certain number of days
 
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh just to come back and
 
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
and to vote on something we already knew
 
01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
was pretty much unanimous uh
 
01:21:16.149 --> 01:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
the rule change this year is that we can
 
01:21:18.149 --> 01:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
go ahead and do the executive session
 
01:21:18.159 --> 01:21:19.669 align:start position:0%
go ahead and do the executive session
immediately

01:21:19.669 --> 01:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
i i don't think that's going to be that
 
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
many bills but
 
01:21:27.270 --> 01:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
if it if it appears like that's
 
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
available to us and it speeds things up
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
then we can do that does that answer
 
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:40.709 --> 01:21:40.719 align:start position:0%
um in in part thank you um but i was
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
more looking for
 
01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
when we do have an executive session um
 
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
is it typically typically gonna um
 
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
will we meet for like three hours during
 
01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
that day or
 
01:21:56.550 --> 01:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
is it the total length of the meeting uh
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
it that's really going to be driven by
 
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
the number of bills we have to exact
 
01:22:05.189 --> 01:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
uh that that in our past that has gone
 
01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
from one bill
 
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh that that for some reason uh
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
lagged or or was was left
 
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
to kind of clean up and we we would meet
 
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
for 20 minutes and be done
 
01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh in other cases we've met for four
 
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
hours so
 
01:22:24.149 --> 01:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
it really depends on the workload uh
 
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
and uh and what's before us so i'll
 
01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
before the uh before the meeting well
 
01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
before the meeting i'll i'll try to give
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
you a
 
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
an idea of of you know the opening and
 
01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
the closing of the
 
01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
of the total meeting time uh but i would
 
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
suspect that
 
01:22:41.830 --> 01:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
if if we're going to come to an
 
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
that i'm going to really try hard not to
 
01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
call a meeting and
 
01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
especially if we're at a point where
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
we're meeting in person
 
01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
to bring people all the way to concord
 
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
for for 15 or 20 minutes uh
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
try to make sure that we're going to
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
have a meeting it'll be a substantial
 
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:00.790 align:start position:0%
have a meeting it'll be a substantial
meeting

01:23:00.790 --> 01:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative gilman has her hand up
 
01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh i was just think
 
01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:12.950 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh i was just think
uh

01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
asking you to consider sometimes we get
 
01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of a lot of written testimony
 
01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:20.719 align:start position:0%
and it takes a little while to read
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
through it
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
so having an executive session
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
immediately after
 
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
a regular session is sometimes um
 
01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
we may miss something i guess so i don't
 
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:32.709 align:start position:0%
we may miss something i guess so i don't
disagree

01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
disagree
 
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
and uh representative porter and i spoke
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
about about this that
 
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't if it's not appropriate
 
01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:39.750 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't if it's not appropriate
especially

01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
especially
 
01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh if there are multiple amendments and
 
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
there are other things that are
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
happening a written testimony like you
 
01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh if it's not if it's not appropriate
 
01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
then we won't do it
 
01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:54.639 align:start position:0%
it just gives us a little more freedom
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
than we had before
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean we have to exercise that
 
01:24:02.629 --> 01:24:02.639 align:start position:0%
very often we can exercise it when it's
 
01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
only appropriate
 
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
exercises thank you representative
 
01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
mitchell poody yeah um when do we
 
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
when can we expect what days would be
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
allocated i know you said monday through
 
01:24:16.229 --> 01:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
friday but
 
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
what day how soon can we
 
01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
get that kind so that we can plan
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
yeah no i i appreciate that i was hoping
 
01:24:27.189 --> 01:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
i'd have that for this meeting to share
 
01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
with you
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
so i'm expecting that uh in the next few
 
01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:31.030 align:start position:0%
so i'm expecting that uh in the next few
days

01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh but again i i i'm not the decision
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
maker i i'm waiting
 
01:24:40.229 --> 01:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
to hear uh as with the the death of the
 
01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
of the speaker and the new speaker
 
01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
election there's been
 
01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
a juggling of of assignments
 
01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
and the speaker's staff you may if
 
01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
you've seen
 
01:24:54.070 --> 01:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
the public notice so a lot of people a
 
01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
new job so
 
01:24:58.149 --> 01:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
that hasn't helped making some of these
 
01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
early decisions
 
01:25:03.189 --> 01:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
that i was hoping to get but hopefully
 
01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
as they get settled in
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll be those these decisions
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
more readily apparent and imminent
 
01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i'll say about
 
01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
meeting in person i
 
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
i i learned an awful lot and
 
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
and developed
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
great relationships i think with members
 
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
01:25:39.669 --> 01:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
in the uh in the cafeteria off the
 
01:25:39.679 --> 01:25:41.189 align:start position:0%
in the uh in the cafeteria off the
tunnel

01:25:41.189 --> 01:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
tunnel
 
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh and so i'm gonna miss that not
 
01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
meeting in person sitting across the
 
01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
table and
 
01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
and uh sharing lunch with with a lot of
 
01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:48.709 align:start position:0%
and uh sharing lunch with with a lot of
you

01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
so hopefully as we can put this virus
 
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
behind us
 
01:25:55.669 --> 01:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
we can get back to a more collegiate uh
 
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
and uh and i i look forward to that
 
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
so any final questions before we uh
 
01:26:10.709 --> 01:26:10.719 align:start position:0%
we end the meeting uh representative
 
01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
amanda putin has her hand up
 
01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:15.760 align:start position:0%

um mr chair i don't have a question but
 
01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
i have a comment
 
01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh i think that you've done
 
01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
a superb job of leading us on our first
 
01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
zoom meeting and i look forward to your
 
01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
continued leadership my one worry is
 
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
that i have to call representative pia
 
01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:40.390 align:start position:0%
that i have to call representative pia
monte

01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
monte
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative pia monte and not just
 
01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
pia monty
 
01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:45.280 align:start position:0%

01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:47.430 align:start position:0%
couldn't couldn't i get dispensation on
that

01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:47.440 align:start position:0%

thank you for your great work
 
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
well if he if he puts his hat on he
 
01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
becomes much more intimidating looking
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
so i think that's why not wearing it
 
01:26:58.629 --> 01:26:58.639 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:27:01.270 --> 01:27:01.280 align:start position:0%

okay so
 
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
so that that's much less intuitive but
 
01:29:07.110 --> 01:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh you have to kind of memorize that if
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
you want if you're
 
01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:09.920 align:start position:0%

the state and you're zooming in just
 
01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
over your
 
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
over your telephone you can still raise
 
01:29:20.149 --> 01:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
your hand but it's star six and i think
 
01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
