to be fair
 
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:23.680 align:start position:0%

republican leadership and even i'm not

budget it's not everything that i
 
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily like every little thing but
 
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:17.680 align:start position:0%

together on with some
 
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
discussion give and take compromise and
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
i think it's a great budget to send to
 
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
the floor
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%

20 to zero yay thank you very much
 
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
i i this is a joke any objection to
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
consent calendar
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh unfortunately we cannot do that
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
because it is a budget bill
 
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
um we have tried it in the past and
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
never worked
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
so we're not even gonna try try
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
but as i said earlier to before we
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
started the official meeting to a couple
 
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
of the members who are on
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
um i have asked the speaker to move this
 
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
to the start of the session on uh
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
april 7th um hopefully we can do that to
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
be the first bill up
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
maybe set a cordial tone in the house
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
before we start our
 
00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:36.799 align:start position:0%
um debates on house bill one and two
 
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
um and just be able to do that
 
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
um as i
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
look at the calendar i had
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
scheduled a meeting and it will be in
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
the calendar
 
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
for house bill 25 executive session
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
on monday the 29th if necessary
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
obviously it is not necessary but there
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
were some
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
concerns on my part you know if the
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
public couldn't have access then
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
um we would had to reschedule and
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
if we had hit a snag with something
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
wrong with the amendment
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
we would have had to reschedule either
 
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
late keep it open and
 
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
come back in a few hours on this so you
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
can disregard that
 
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
when you get the notice that there's a
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
um a meeting of
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
uh public works and highways next monday
 
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
we will not be meeting at all next week
 
00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.950 align:start position:0%
we will not be meeting at all next week
um

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
and i do not intend to meet until
 
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.430 align:start position:0%
and i do not intend to meet until
sometime

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
sometime
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%

00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
fourth one dealing with the highway plan
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
will be coming to us it was
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
inadvertently sent to transportation
 
00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
i none of them are
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
early bills and we can work them all at
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
the same time
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
the bills if you're interested in what
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
are listed under public works committee
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:17.440 align:start position:0%

um i do as i said at the very beginning
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
of this session
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
that the members are not here
 
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
see us because we're not going to be
 
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.190 align:start position:0%
see us because we're not going to be
here

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
so i thank you all
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
it's been a challenge i think for all of
 
00:21:46.149 --> 00:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
us to try to do this
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
via either hybrid or totally remote
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
usually it's easier to talk across that
 
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
u-shaped table in
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
room 201 about some of these issues
 
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
whereas we've had to do it
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh either on paper or or talking across
 
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
the zoom platform it has been
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
rewarding but we also haven't got to
 
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
know each other
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
and there are a lot of new members on
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
the committee that i've met
 
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
at the last house session and that's
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
been about it other than
 
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%
on here so um hopefully
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
by may we'll be back doing things a
 
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
little more normally
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes to arrange for a debate if we
 
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
have to have a debate
 
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
i will be defending the the committee's
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
recommendation but if there's somebody
 
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
who is going to speak against it if
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
somebody could just let me know i'm not
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
going to try to talk them out and not
 
00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
doing it that's their right to
 
00:24:20.789 --> 00:24:20.799 align:start position:0%
dispute what a community does but it
 
00:24:20.799 --> 00:24:21.350 align:start position:0%
dispute what a community does but it
helps

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
helps
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
structure debates and time
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
and it does really help the speaker and
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
the clerk to
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
um figure out how long we're going to
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
have to be there but uh wednesday
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
thursday and friday of that week
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
to all of you if you hear anything
 
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.039 align:start position:0%
just let me know and if they are going
 
00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
to speak they need to let the clerk know
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%

john cloudier if
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
if this could be a model for
 
00:25:33.269 --> 00:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
state government or national government
 
00:25:36.149 --> 00:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
it would be certainly welcome as far as
 
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned
 
00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
is seeing what can be accomplished with
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
cooperation in what really is
 
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.390 align:start position:0%
cooperation in what really is
bipartisanship

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
bipartisanship
 
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you well let's not all of us get
 
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
too carried away we still have
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
bills later in this year and bill's next
 
00:25:55.679 --> 00:25:56.390 align:start position:0%
bills later in this year and bill's next
year

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh but we shall see but we work towards
 
00:25:59.909 --> 00:25:59.919 align:start position:0%
that you know that
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh mike abbott uh representative mills
 
00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
there we go thank you mr chair i wanted
 
00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:20.149 align:start position:0%
there we go thank you mr chair i wanted
to

00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
ask our representative clutier a
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
question in
 
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
because as far as i can remember he's
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
been on this committee the longest
 
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
in my memory the last five terms this is
 
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
the at least the fifth time that house
 
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
bill 25 has gone to the floor
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
on a unanimous vote i think
 
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
and it stands to show how well run this
 
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
committee is
 
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
and how well we get cohesive and
 
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
standing behind all this so
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
mr cloudy can you can you add anything
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
to that uh representative yeah
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i think it's unanimous again i mean
 
00:26:59.350 --> 00:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
yeah five well of course i've been here
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
i i maybe in my early term there might
 
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
have been one or two
 
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
opposing the capital budget but usually
 
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
we send it to the floor
 
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
and uh usually there's not a lot of
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
debate i mean we might have a roll call
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
vote like we did last turn uh
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
term when i was chair but there are only
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
a few votes in opposition it passed
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
overwhelming and i just basically took
 
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.710 align:start position:0%
overwhelming and i just basically took
questions

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
so hopefully it's going to be that way
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
term as well there'll be no debate on
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
the floor and we can pass it on a voice
 
00:27:27.679 --> 00:27:28.149 align:start position:0%
the floor and we can pass it on a voice
vote

00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
or at least a division or roll call with
 
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
little or no debate
 
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
but again yeah we're one of the better
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
committees as far as we don't
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
especially on things like the capital
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
budget and 10-year plan we don't usually
 
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
have a lot of opposition i
 
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
from what i i experience and a lot
 
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
maybe in the earlier days there were a
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
few controversies more on other bills i
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
think usually the capital budget
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
and 10-year plan are something we can
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
you know unite on even if we don't
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
totally get our way on everything
 
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you seeing
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
no other hands raised um
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
again thank you all um
 
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
i will let you um know
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
when i schedule these bills my intention
 
00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:19.039 align:start position:0%
is to try to do as many of them
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
in one day as possible so that we're not
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
take up an hour here an hour there on
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
zoom time
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
because once all the senate bills come
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
over we're once again
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
into the okay who's got the license for
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
the zoom
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
on what days um so if we can do it
 
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
a couple of them are naming bills and so
 
00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
we'll go
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%

else come in and see that we
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
how we do our work so thank you
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
um unless the vice chair or the clerk
 
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
has any administrative
 
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:34.630 align:start position:0%
has any administrative
things

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:34.640 align:start position:0%

guess
 
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559 align:start position:0%
um that is the danger of trying to do
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
things at home
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
