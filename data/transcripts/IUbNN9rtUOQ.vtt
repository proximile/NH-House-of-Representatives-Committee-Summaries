amendment uh that is 20
 
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.150 align:start position:0%
amendment uh that is 20
20249

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
20249
 
00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
02h um and I I asked um to go first
 
00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:10.919 align:start position:0%
really to set the stage for how we got
 
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:14.120 align:start position:0%
to where we are today um this is doing a
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
non- gerine Amendment like this is uh
 
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
although not unprecedented is a little
 
00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
bit unusual um in the summertime last
 
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
year uh we at New Hampshire housing
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
convened a group of stakeholders upon
 
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
request of some of those stakeholders
 
00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:35.479 align:start position:0%
to uh discuss issues related to the in
 
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
particular the local permitting of uh
 
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.510 align:start position:0%
particular the local permitting of uh
recovery

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
recovery
 
00:07:42.869 --> 00:07:42.879 align:start position:0%
residences and what we learned from
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
those stakeholders was that um people
 
00:07:48.749 --> 00:07:48.759 align:start position:0%
seeking to establish recovery residences
 
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh to help people who are well
 
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
recovering from addiction from substance
 
00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:54.990 align:start position:0%
recovering from addiction from substance
use

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
disorder uh we're having a very
 
00:07:59.710 --> 00:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
difficult time uh because because of
 
00:08:02.909 --> 00:08:02.919 align:start position:0%
some ambiguities in the law uh some lack
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
of clarity in the law uh and uh also
 
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:09.800 align:start position:0%
because of U hostility to the the notion
 
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
of recovery residences uh
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
generally uh so we sought to work on
 
00:08:17.629 --> 00:08:17.639 align:start position:0%
things that would clarify the law and
 
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
also provide a path for permitting of uh
 
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
these types of of uses of
 
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
property so the bill really is divided
 
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
into two sections uh the first section
 
00:08:34.029 --> 00:08:34.039 align:start position:0%
uh section one uh addresses the current
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
definition of recovery house which is in
 
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
the fire code RSA
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
153 uh these uh changes are intended to
 
00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
align uh the statutory definition with
 
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:51.160 align:start position:0%
changes that are also currently pending
 
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
in the fire code and also in the
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
building code which is uh in RSA
 
00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.750 align:start position:0%
building code which is uh in RSA
155a

00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
155a
 
00:09:03.069 --> 00:09:03.079 align:start position:0%
uh so working with uh the Fire Marshall
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
and with um a representative of the
 
00:09:07.949 --> 00:09:07.959 align:start position:0%
building officials Association and
 
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
others were able to come up with with
 
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
this language which fits those two codes
 
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
uh but also provides Clarity in the
 
00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
statute uh so for example the the change
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
on line eight uh something that is
 
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
changing the word residence to primarily
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
non-transient dwelling or dwelling unit
 
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
that is language that is consistent with
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
both the fire code and with the the
 
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.590 align:start position:0%
both the fire code and with the the
building

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:37.720 align:start position:0%
code um removing in online on online a
 
00:09:39.949 --> 00:09:39.959 align:start position:0%
safe and safe healthy family like
 
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
because of the subjectivity of that
 
00:09:46.269 --> 00:09:46.279 align:start position:0%
language um living as a single household
 
00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
on line 10 is shows the intention of
 
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
really how recovery
 
00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:53.959 align:start position:0%
residences work that they are and this
 
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
is one of the reasons why the the the
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
Fire Marshall uh is supportive of this
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
this change and he's not here he's on
 
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
vacation he has sent us a letter saying
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
so yes I I saw that as well thank you
 
00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:11.079 align:start position:0%
madam Sher um but what he said to to us
 
00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:14.519 align:start position:0%
was um the people who live in recovery
 
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
houses are all looking after one another
 
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
as a family would um so that's the
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
notion of living as a single
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
household um the language on line 11 is
 
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
not changed uh and this is intended to
 
00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:35.720 align:start position:0%
mirror what is in federal law uh with
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
the um uh and samsa leg samsa regulation
 
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
that says centered on peer support and a
 
00:10:45.389 --> 00:10:45.399 align:start position:0%
connection to services that promote
 
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
long-term recovery so that is to be
 
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
consistent remain consistent with
 
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
federal law and then finally uh on line
 
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
12 in this change of the definition um
 
00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
boarding house or rooming house that is
 
00:10:59.629 --> 00:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
these are
 
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
are not uh uh to be uh this definition
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
does not cover those situations where
 
00:11:07.629 --> 00:11:07.639 align:start position:0%
you have something that is operating as
 
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
a boarding house or rooming
 
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
house so those are the changes to the
 
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
current statutory definition section two
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
of the bill uh deals with the local
 
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
permitting uh by planning boards and
 
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:25.160 align:start position:0%
zoning boards of adjustment which has uh
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
been a great source of difficulty for um
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh people seeking to establish recovery
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
residences and what this does is it
 
00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
provides uh clear direction to
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities to planning boards and to
 
00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:40.839 align:start position:0%
zoning boards that uh recovery
 
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
residences are to be treated as
 
00:11:45.389 --> 00:11:45.399 align:start position:0%
residential uses so if it's in a one
 
00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:47.720 align:start position:0%
family house then you treat it you do
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
the permitting as if it were a one
 
00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:50.959 align:start position:0%
family house because that's what it is
 
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
if it's a duplex you treat it like a
 
00:11:55.389 --> 00:11:55.399 align:start position:0%
duplex if it's a multif family house you
 
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
treat it like a multif family house uh
 
00:11:59.710 --> 00:11:59.720 align:start position:0%
not as something that is separate and
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
distinct and different um and in fact on
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
lines 20 and 21 you see the use of an
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
existing multif family structure as a
 
00:12:13.389 --> 00:12:13.399 align:start position:0%
recovery house under this paragraph
 
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
shall not require site plan review if it
 
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
were new then it would because
 
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
multifam uh structures do require site
 
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
plan review uh by planning boards um so
 
00:12:29.189 --> 00:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
but if it's an existing multi family
 
00:12:31.629 --> 00:12:31.639 align:start position:0%
then it's just the perpetuation of that
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
multif family multif family use so um
 
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
these are the changes that got proposed
 
00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:40.279 align:start position:0%
but because of the time it took for us
 
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
to work through this uh it was many
 
00:12:45.069 --> 00:12:45.079 align:start position:0%
months of work we missed the filing
 
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:47.720 align:start position:0%
deadline uh and we're seeking a vehicle
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
to get this introduced as a non- gerain
 
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment and that is why we are here
 
00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:54.279 align:start position:0%
today and we thank you for that I'd be
 
00:12:56.189 --> 00:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions but I'll note
 
00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
that there are a lot of people behind me
 
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
who with far greater expertise in the
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
actual establishment and operation of
 
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:05.240 align:start position:0%
recovery residences than I my I've
 
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:08.800 align:start position:0%

recovery houses in Claymont uh hope to
 
00:14:37.749 --> 00:14:37.759 align:start position:0%
Freedom recovery homes and I want to
 
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
stress that the city of
 
00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
clamont I'm very grateful for they
 
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
worked with us they helped us they
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
taught us they guided us along with you
 
00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:49.480 align:start position:0%
know NH core which the executive
 
00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
director Kim is behind me uh we've had a
 
00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
lot of help and a lot of
 
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
support with zoning planning and all
 
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
this stuff I had to learn as I went cuz
 
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
I didn't know my goal was to just open a
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
recovery house and help people like
 
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:11.240 align:start position:0%
me that's why I get emotional I always
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
cry and you
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
know so I ended up in clamont with a
 
00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:21.560 align:start position:0%
multif family and I started with four as
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
we call them beds so I was able to help
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
four people and it was it was three
 
00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
Apartments I lived in one there was four
 
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
four beds in one apartment and I had
 
00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
regular tenants in in another apartment
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
but when those tenants left I was able
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
to turn the upstairs apartment
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
into part of the recovery housing so it
 
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
was four beds in one floor and five beds
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
upstairs so if you go
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
above eight residents then you have to
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
get a a either a sprinkler system and
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
then you might be able to get a variance
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
from the Fire Marshall but it knocks it
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
down to
 
00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
a fire monitoring system now these fire
 
00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
monitoring systems are about
 
00:16:07.389 --> 00:16:07.399 align:start position:0%
$115,000 we worked with the state fir
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
Master's office and the coding office
 
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
and they said that we can use a
 
00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
residential home monitoring system but
 
00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:19.160 align:start position:0%
the deputy fight Chief and clamon was
 
00:16:20.829 --> 00:16:20.839 align:start position:0%
still a little confused because he was
 
00:16:20.839 --> 00:16:22.069 align:start position:0%
still a little confused because he was
going

00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
on forgive me for not knowing the terms
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
like the Old Law or the old bill or
 
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
whatever was in there and it took months
 
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
and months and months for us to figure
 
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
it out and yes yet again the city
 
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
definitely worked with us and so that's
 
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
one house so they're working with us and
 
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
we're just helping people and we're
 
00:16:42.269 --> 00:16:42.279 align:start position:0%
going on and we're living life and then
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
I get the opportunity to open a female
 
00:16:48.269 --> 00:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
house it is a single family house and
 
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
here's where the lengthy process started
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
so we had to go in front of the zoning
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
board for seven months because it is a
 
00:17:00.749 --> 00:17:00.759 align:start position:0%
single family so at recovery housing if
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
you go above five residents that are not
 
00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:06.799 align:start position:0%
blood related you have to get permission
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
from the zoning board and the city and
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
whoever else has their hand in this and
 
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
what happened was we were teaching each
 
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
other we were learning you know we
 
00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
everything was good and we were proving
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
that we're a solid recovery house but it
 
00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
took s months so in the meantime of that
 
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
seven months people probably died
 
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
go my girlfriend and I got multiple
 
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
calls from people are you open yet are
 
00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
you open yet my daughter needs a place
 
00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
to go are you open yet my mother needs a
 
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
place to go we're not open yet we're
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
still going in front of the zoning board
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
we're still going in front of the
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
planning board and I always want to
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
stress they definitely helped us along
 
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
but they didn't know they were going on
 
00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
the old bill and what was in the on the
 
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
books and uh not to mention neighbors
 
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
they were thinking that a recovery house
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
is a rehab which it's not they were
 
00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
thinking it's a boarding house which
 
00:18:11.149 --> 00:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
it's not so that lengthened the process
 
00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
of going in front of the zoning board
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
now all for the most part the zoning
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
board was was on board uh of letting us
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
and allowing us to run a recovery house
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
but we had to figure everything out and
 
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
I want to stress the fact that most
 
00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
likely people ended up home
 
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
people ended up relapsing and probably
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
someone ended up dying statistically
 
00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
speaking because they didn't have a
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
place to
 
00:18:35.679 --> 00:18:38.510 align:start position:0%
place to
go

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
um the main thing I want to stress is
 
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
the family environment I grew up in the
 
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
projects with my mother you know my
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
mother has four other children with
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
different fathers so I never had a solid
 
00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:55.240 align:start position:0%
structured house to call home I didn't
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
realize what a home was until I started
 
00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
getting older and that's what we provide
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
at a recovery house you know I could
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
have chose to call it hope to Freedom
 
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
know because the recovery home that I
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
went to was called the recovery home and
 
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
it and it helped me save my life so I
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
asked the owner why do you call it a
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
recovery home instead of sober living
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
and he said because we do recover that's
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
what we do here and when I was in that
 
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
house in Littleton I said that's what
 
00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:30.799 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do I'm going to copy you
 
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
and and do
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
that and like we have those
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable conversations in the
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
recovery house why did you miss your
 
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
meeting why did you not go can we help
 
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
you with a therapist like why are you
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
exhibiting these behaviors why are you
 
00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
late three days in a row um you know why
 
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
did you not go to work like we help
 
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
these individuals grow as a family and
 
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
that's what happens in the recovery
 
00:19:59.630 --> 00:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
house it isn't just going to groups and
 
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
meetings we're like the
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
last the last
 
00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
uh we're basically their last chance
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
because we teach them basic life skills
 
00:20:11.789 --> 00:20:11.799 align:start position:0%
some of these guys come here and the
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
woman come here they don't know how to
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
sweep a
 
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
floor they don't know how to live life
 
00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
they they get high they smoke crack they
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
shoot heroin they prostit prostitute
 
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
themselves and then they end up in rehab
 
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
and then they end up with us in a
 
00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
recovery home and that's where the real
 
00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.149 align:start position:0%
recovery home and that's where the real
work

00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
starts there's other work but when you
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
leave treatment now you have to go get a
 
00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
job now you have to fight for your kids
 
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
again now you got to go to court you got
 
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
to get a license you got to get an ID
 
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
you got to get insurance you know you
 
00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
have to do all these things you have to
 
00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:42.919 align:start position:0%
go to meetings you have to go to your
 
00:20:45.149 --> 00:20:45.159 align:start position:0%
12-step meetings and work your 12 steps
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
in order to survive another day and when
 
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
all that's not working and you come home
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
you have a roommate or someone else in
 
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:54.200 align:start position:0%
the house that's going to help you and
 
00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
support you get through that night so
 
00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
you don't use and you don't end up on
 
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
the streets again that's the difference
 
00:21:03.149 --> 00:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
so once
 
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
again it took 7 months and I'm very very
 
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:08.360 align:start position:0%
grateful we have a great relationship
 
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:10.360 align:start position:0%
with the city of clamont but the thing
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
is it took seven months I don't know how
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
many people died in that seven
 
00:21:19.149 --> 00:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
months um I think that's it for me thank
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%

questions are there any
 
00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:33.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:38.269 --> 00:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
I I'm acting in the unaccustomed role of
 
00:21:41.549 --> 00:21:41.559 align:start position:0%
clerking uh so you said something about
 
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:43.640 align:start position:0%

Andrews thanks for having me here this
 
00:22:16.029 --> 00:22:16.039 align:start position:0%
morning I am Cheryl Andrews I am the
 
00:22:18.269 --> 00:22:18.279 align:start position:0%
executive director at the dismus home of
 
00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester we are a level four certified
 
00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
home by New Hampshire Corp that means we
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
are a
 
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
treatment program
 
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
along with a re-entry program we serve
 
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
specifically Justice involved women with
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
substance misuse and co-occurring mental
 
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
illness they can stay with us for up to
 
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
10 months is in that
 
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
timeline like Sean said we teach them
 
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
basic skills home life skills we treat
 
00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
them for the trauma that
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
they had when they were much younger
 
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
which caused them to begin this journey
 
00:22:59.269 --> 00:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
of addiction and they must be Justice
 
00:23:01.269 --> 00:23:01.279 align:start position:0%
involved when they come with us come to
 
00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:03.559 align:start position:0%
us that could be from directly from a
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
prison or a jail they could be coming
 
00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:07.799 align:start position:0%
from drug court they could be uh on
 
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
parole or probation but they must have
 
00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
some level of Justice involvement to be
 
00:23:15.149 --> 00:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
eligible for the dismiss home program
 
00:23:17.549 --> 00:23:17.559 align:start position:0%
I've been asked to talk today because we
 
00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:19.799 align:start position:0%
yes we are a recovery home yes we are
 
00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:21.919 align:start position:0%
looking to expand because any given day
 
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
there is approximately 500 women in the
 
00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
system in New Hampshire and we want to
 
00:23:28.029 --> 00:23:28.039 align:start position:0%
be able to help more of them and reduce
 
00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:30.919 align:start position:0%
the rate of recidivism here in the state
 
00:23:34.029 --> 00:23:34.039 align:start position:0%
so as part of our expansion this year we
 
00:23:34.039 --> 00:23:35.110 align:start position:0%
so as part of our expansion this year we
recently

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
recently
 
00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.470 align:start position:0%
recently
experienced

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:37.480 align:start position:0%
experienced
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
um a zoning board meeting that lasted
 
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:40.870 align:start position:0%
um a zoning board meeting that lasted
three

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:43.799 align:start position:0%
hours uh and it it was clear that the
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
city was very interested in helping us
 
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
because the the the argument back and
 
00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
forth was not between us and the zba but
 
00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
it was between the neighbors who were
 
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
very clear about um
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
it's all really great work you're doing
 
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
just don't do it in our neighborhood and
 
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:04.360 align:start position:0%
they were very clear about that I mean
 
00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:06.440 align:start position:0%
they actually use those words it was
 
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
kind of shocking and for a three-hour
 
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
meeting to end up with an approval I
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
think that this bill would help them
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
help the zba and the planning
 
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
board make their decisions quicker and
 
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
clearer and disregard
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
the comments from the peanut
 
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
gallery on both sides that they not
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the setting or the the
 
00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.269 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the setting or the the
program

00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:24:35.789 --> 00:24:35.799 align:start position:0%
itself I think that
 
00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
um having the standard provided by the
 
00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment helps legitimate
 
00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:44.200 align:start position:0%
homes like dismiss home as well as our
 
00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
cities and towns by addressing the fear
 
00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
and the concerns caused by
 
00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:51.799 align:start position:0%
misinformation that's pretty much what I
 
00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%

neighbors since you've been in operation
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
so our current neighborhood at 1024th
 
00:27:45.549 --> 00:27:45.559 align:start position:0%
Street actually is a very quiet Dead End
 
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
Street and we had letters of support
 
00:27:49.509 --> 00:27:49.519 align:start position:0%
from our neighbors on Fourth Street
 
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
saying we've been wonderful neighbors
 
00:27:53.509 --> 00:27:53.519 align:start position:0%
we've been helpful in our neighborhood
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
we keep the cutest house it's all pretty
 
00:27:57.870 --> 00:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
so we've had great support from our
 
00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
current neighbors since we've been in
 
00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
operation since
 
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
2016 you're welcome okay anyone else
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're
 
00:28:21.149 --> 00:28:21.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
Hansen good morning members of the
 
00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
committee my name is anina Hansen I'm
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
from Peterboro in the Manan
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
agent I'm a person in recovery from
 
00:28:33.789 --> 00:28:33.799 align:start position:0%
alcoholism and once upon a time I fell
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
in love with another person in recovery
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
from alcohol and heroin
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
addiction Phil had sobered up several
 
00:28:42.509 --> 00:28:42.519 align:start position:0%
years before in prison and when he was
 
00:28:44.029 --> 00:28:44.039 align:start position:0%
released he knew he didn't stand a
 
00:28:46.029 --> 00:28:46.039 align:start position:0%
chance of staying clean without a safe
 
00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:48.440 align:start position:0%
and supportive place to live fortunately
 
00:28:50.509 --> 00:28:50.519 align:start position:0%
he found a bed in a sober house here in
 
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire when he needed it it was
 
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
such a life-saving measure for him he
 
00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
went on to found two sober houses of his
 
00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
own giv giving scores of men a safe
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
place to start
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
again now recovery housing is not a
 
00:29:05.149 --> 00:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
magical guarantee it's just the first
 
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
step in a long journey over time Phil
 
00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
started a successful business he bought
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
his own home he met me and we built a
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
life together but covid happened his
 
00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
mental health issues went untreated for
 
00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
too long and at 5 years sober he
 
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
relapsed and died of a fentol
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
overdose until you've lost someone to
 
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
overdose you cannot fully understand the
 
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
absolute irredeemable futility of it it
 
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
is a pointless and preventable death
 
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
every single person who dies of overdose
 
00:29:39.149 --> 00:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
on any substance is someone who with
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
more time and more support may have
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
kicked their addiction and built a
 
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
stable life this is why a safe
 
00:29:47.669 --> 00:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
environment for early recovery is
 
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
crucial whenever someone substance
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
dependent makes the attempt to live
 
00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
substance-free the risk of relapse is
 
00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
highest by far in the beginning
 
00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:00.200 align:start position:0%
being surrounded by like-minded people
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
who offer support empathy and
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
accountability can be the difference
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
between becoming a success story or a
 
00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:10.120 align:start position:0%
statistic Phil used to say my guys are
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
like any other group of adults who
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
choose to live together we are a family
 
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
by choice exactly as was mentioned
 
00:30:19.029 --> 00:30:19.039 align:start position:0%
earlier and we deserve the rights of a
 
00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
family and certainly the rights of any
 
00:30:24.509 --> 00:30:24.519 align:start position:0%
group of housemates non-clinical
 
00:30:26.509 --> 00:30:26.519 align:start position:0%
recovery housing is simply a group of
 
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
men or women choosing to split expenses
 
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
by sharing a home like lots of people do
 
00:30:34.029 --> 00:30:34.039 align:start position:0%
living as a single household as was
 
00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned with the added benefit that
 
00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
this single household creates
 
00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
life-saving support for an issue we're
 
00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
always talking about wanting to
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
mitigate anything we do to make sober
 
00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:49.559 align:start position:0%
housing easier to access not harder
 
00:30:52.509 --> 00:30:52.519 align:start position:0%
saves lives and those lives go on to
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
save more lives Phil's sober houses in
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
lonia are still operational and some men
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
have been there for years now still
 
00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
craving the stability and Community they
 
00:31:04.509 --> 00:31:04.519 align:start position:0%
enjoy there but most eventually reach
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
the point where they're ready to move on
 
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
one of Phil's former residents became a
 
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
firsttime home buyer this winter another
 
00:31:13.389 --> 00:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
is running his own successful
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
landscaping business these guys help
 
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
their communities raise their kids pay
 
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
their taxes in anyone's book they are
 
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
recovery success stories but they didn't
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
get here by accident in those fraught
 
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
early days of recovery they found a soft
 
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
place to land because a guy named Phil
 
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
was willing to struggle over the hurdles
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
to open a Recovery House think how many
 
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
more lives can be transformed if those
 
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
hurdles are
 
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
removed we talk a lot about our state's
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
addiction problems one of the answers is
 
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
sober housing if we want fewer addiction
 
00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
related statistics we need more recovery
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
housing I urge you to take the simple
 
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
yet powerful step of passing this
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
amendment that will make it more
 
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
straightforward to open more sober
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
houses and help more people start over
 
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
substance-free and stay that way thank
 
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%

and she still runs them in lonia so and
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
and do are is there some kind of a state
 
00:32:51.029 --> 00:32:51.039 align:start position:0%
organization that
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
overseas facilitates that's the next
 
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
person testifying okay yeah let me defer
 
00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:57.750 align:start position:0%
person testifying okay yeah let me defer
then

00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
okay but you how long have you been in
 
00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
the business so to speak um my
 
00:33:05.909 --> 00:33:05.919 align:start position:0%
affiliation with it is what about four
 
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
years now of just seeing it at one step
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
removed but seeing the
 
00:33:14.629 --> 00:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
obstacles that were opposed
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
by difficulty around different zoning
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
ordinances but also seeing the huge
 
00:33:21.269 --> 00:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
success when we get past those obstacles
 
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
and a sober house is allowed to
 
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
open so so you just have a home of your
 
00:33:29.629 --> 00:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
own someplace else correct in in
 
00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:31.720 align:start position:0%
Peterboro is it that's where I am now
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
yes yeah yes but the home you've been
 
00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:38.120 align:start position:0%
talking about is where lonia lonia okay
 
00:33:41.629 --> 00:33:41.639 align:start position:0%
thank you all right any else thank you
 
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.470 align:start position:0%
 
Bach

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
Bach
 
00:33:59.350 --> 00:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Kim Bach I'm the
 
00:34:00.509 --> 00:34:00.519 align:start position:0%
executive director with the New
 
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Coalition of recovery
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
residences um thank you for the
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify on behalf of NH
 
00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
core um in support of this
 
00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:13.399 align:start position:0%
amendment the reason why this whole
 
00:34:16.109 --> 00:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
thing came about is because NH cor has
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
partnered with many organizations
 
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
throughout the state we partnered first
 
00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
with the state far Marshall Sean Tumi
 
00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
Tumi and um New Hampshire building
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
official Association President Bill
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
McKinny um at in the very early stages
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire Legal Assistant was
 
00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:35.720 align:start position:0%
involved and then we got together with
 
00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
the St ansam Center for ethics they run
 
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
a program on the housing we need in New
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they decided that recovery
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
housing ought to be a piece of that and
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
a discussion in that
 
00:34:50.669 --> 00:34:50.679 align:start position:0%
platform so they hosted a seminar that
 
00:34:52.829 --> 00:34:52.839 align:start position:0%
was directed at Town
 
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
officials and it was to listen to find
 
00:34:56.829 --> 00:34:56.839 align:start position:0%
to give them some information
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
information but really the point of that
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
seminar was to listen and it was for us
 
00:35:02.829 --> 00:35:02.839 align:start position:0%
to discover what are the true barriers
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
we had assumptions about what the
 
00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:05.560 align:start position:0%
barriers were but what were the true
 
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
barriers that the towns were facing and
 
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
if we knew the true barriers if they
 
00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
were because of misconceptions of what
 
00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
recover recovery housing is then we
 
00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
could help with education and if there
 
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
were other barriers maybe we could
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
address those barriers there's a report
 
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
on S Anam Center for ethics website
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
about what are what the findings were
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
from that day 100 people
 
00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079 align:start position:0%
attended there were 10 or 12 tables set
 
00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
up and they were the people at each
 
00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
table consisted of um Town officials but
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
also of people who run recovery houses
 
00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
people who run rcos um so there was a a
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
good smattering of of knowledge there
 
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
were First Responders at the
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
tables and we had presentations and we
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
had um scripted questions to go through
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
as discussions within the tables say
 
00:35:58.750 --> 00:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
transim Center for ethics compiled all
 
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
of the information at the end and put
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
together the report what we found
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
resoundingly was that the town officials
 
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
said we need guidance there's no
 
00:36:12.349 --> 00:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
definition of recovery residents in the
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
statutes in the codes and so we're left
 
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
trying to figure this out we're left
 
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
trying to decide is a congregate housing
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
is it a is it a boarding home is it um
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
transitional housing what what is it
 
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
and they resoundingly said if we had
 
00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
more guidance a clearer pathway through
 
00:36:36.349 --> 00:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
the code a clearer Pathway to do our
 
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
work then it would answer a lot of
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
questions and it would be incredibly
 
00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
helpful and that's when New Hampshire
 
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
housing stepped in to offer assistance
 
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
and they pulled together all of the
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
organizations that you can think of
 
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
DHHS um everyone was at the table trying
 
00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
to put in input into bringing this
 
00:36:59.190 --> 00:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
particular Amendment
 
00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
forward and it did take a long time
 
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
because there were a lot of voices at
 
00:37:05.309 --> 00:37:05.319 align:start position:0%
the table we all had opinions me
 
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
especially um in
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
addition NH core has participated we
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
will go and speak about recovery housing
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
at any zoning board planning board
 
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
meeting if that would be helpful and so
 
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
we've participated in many of
 
00:37:23.309 --> 00:37:23.319 align:start position:0%
them what I see is Town officials who
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
want to do the best for their towns
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
they're there volun giving up their
 
00:37:28.589 --> 00:37:28.599 align:start position:0%
nights with their families they're
 
00:37:28.599 --> 00:37:29.910 align:start position:0%
nights with their families they're
working

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
hard they really do want to do the best
 
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
for their
 
00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
town and they struggle and they hear an
 
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
hour and a half and and I went with
 
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
dismiss home um for their hearing and
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
that was not the first time I've been
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
involved in a hearing like that it was
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
the first time I felt uneasy about my
 
00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:49.640 align:start position:0%
safety but it was not the first time
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
that I've been involved in a hearing
 
00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
like that in that particular
 
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.950 align:start position:0%
like that in that particular
Town

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
Town
 
00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
um Town officials need some guidance
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's distressing to see them try and
 
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
struggle with where should they stand
 
00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
without that guidance between what they
 
00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
think is right what they think they
 
00:38:10.109 --> 00:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
should be doing for Recovery housing
 
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
what they think that the federal laws
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
say and with what the the um the public
 
00:38:17.069 --> 00:38:17.079 align:start position:0%
is saying and with how emotional the
 
00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
it um I have a letter for you and I can
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
tell you that the
 
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
voices in the room are loud and
 
00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:31.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes very
 
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
aggressive um I think the town officials
 
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:37.640 align:start position:0%
would greatly benefit from this
 
00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
amendment it would give them the
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
guidance that they need to more easily
 
00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
navigate that pathway forward with
 
00:38:47.069 --> 00:38:47.079 align:start position:0%
recovery housing so and I'd ask you to
 
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
recall you're hearing people that that
 
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
are more closely involved with recovery
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
housing than I am telling you about how
 
00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:56.680 align:start position:0%
people do succeed and what happens when
 
00:38:58.309 --> 00:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
houses when it takes a long time for
 
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
houses to get established that lives are
 
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
lost but remember that some people that
 
00:39:06.309 --> 00:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
enter recovery housing have a 60%
 
00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
greater chance of achieving remission
 
00:39:12.589 --> 00:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
from addiction than people that don't
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
go so I thank you for your time today
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%

also a family member of somebody who's
 
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
in recovery from um opiates um my
 
00:40:51.069 --> 00:40:51.079 align:start position:0%
husband fell off a roof back in 201940
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
ft and he lived through it um and it's
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
been a long road for him a lot of
 
00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
surgeries and and that's where addiction
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
kind of hit our family pretty hard um
 
00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
I'd say I grew up thinking that bad
 
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
people did drugs I mean it was just the
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
message that I got in my family through
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
dare and and other programs so my coming
 
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
to find Addiction in my immediate family
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
was pretty shocking and a huge learning
 
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
curve for me um the level of stigma my
 
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
family faced um was was very sporadic I
 
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
would say um because so many people knew
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
like our story in our hometown like
 
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
First Responders were awesome my kids
 
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
had friends that were super supportive
 
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
and um we've just been through a lot as
 
00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
a as a family um in
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
2015 I work also as a pastor of a church
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
and uh we were seeing just so much
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
addiction affecting so many different
 
00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
families and everybody was afraid to
 
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
talk about it um because of the
 
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
treatment that you get you know and um
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
how you looked at kind of as a pariah in
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
a way sometimes what I found is I I
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
worked for somebody named Karen wiford
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
who was awesome as a home visitor doing
 
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
family support work work that's how I
 
00:41:59.390 --> 00:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
got into this field um and she sent me
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
to so much training because I had a huge
 
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
amount to learn about what addiction was
 
00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:05.720 align:start position:0%
as as disease model and how um people's
 
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
physiology do not respond to medications
 
00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
thinking oh I want to be somebody
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
addicted to this stuff and let it ruin
 
00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
my life um that's not how it was for my
 
00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
family but it could have been um I was
 
00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:19.079 align:start position:0%
fortunate because I got a lot of
 
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
Education pretty quickly and um was able
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
to be that supportive family for my
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
husband when he overdosed my son had
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
been trained and using Naran and was him
 
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
and his girlfriend like brought my
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
husband back so he's still alive today
 
00:42:33.069 --> 00:42:33.079 align:start position:0%
he's been in recovery now for a couple
 
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
years um just went through another
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
surgery last October and did not take
 
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
home pay meds after a hip revision um
 
00:42:41.549 --> 00:42:41.559 align:start position:0%
that's how um solid his recovery is
 
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
today um but there were times where I
 
00:42:46.589 --> 00:42:46.599 align:start position:0%
could not stand living with him as the
 
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
wife um because of you know the
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
emotional regulation and stuff on both
 
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
of our sides because of the pain of what
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
I saw him go through being suicidal
 
00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
crying for Jesus to take him home at
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
night um how painful it was but also the
 
00:43:02.109 --> 00:43:02.119 align:start position:0%
stress of having to keep my household
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
together um my daughter graduated from
 
00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
snhu last year and um my son has is a
 
00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
master um doing his master's electrician
 
00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:12.599 align:start position:0%
license now and and like that fell to me
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
and I was angry at him for that um but
 
00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:17.480 align:start position:0%
it was misplaced by us because he does
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
have the brain disease of addiction it
 
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
was not something he chose it chose him
 
00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
as a result of the medications he was
 
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
prescribed from Dartmouth um what I know
 
00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
now like as um um a director basically
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
of of these recovery centers when people
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
come through our door there are families
 
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
that were like me my stinking thinking
 
00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:38.839 align:start position:0%
about what addiction was um caused an
 
00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
environment for my husband um that maybe
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
wasn't safe for his recovery because I
 
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to blame him and shame him for a
 
00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:48.079 align:start position:0%
disease that he carried and it was just
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
wrong thinking and a lot of people think
 
00:43:53.069 --> 00:43:53.079 align:start position:0%
that way um the people that we support
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes do not have somebody at home
 
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
that is an asset to their recovery
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
recovery because they just want things
 
00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
fixed you know and and healing takes
 
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
time and when a guy can go into a
 
00:44:04.549 --> 00:44:04.559 align:start position:0%
recovery house or a woman can go into a
 
00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
recovery host and have people understand
 
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
how hard it is what they've been through
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
have those Supportive Services like what
 
00:44:12.829 --> 00:44:12.839 align:start position:0%
Sean's talking about to help them get on
 
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
their feet it is sometimes very much
 
00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:17.839 align:start position:0%
beneficial even for the family at home
 
00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:19.839 align:start position:0%
the kids at home that people don't see
 
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
that get affected by this stuff um you
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
know I am so thankful because he my
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
husband actually spent time at Phoenix
 
00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:28.280 align:start position:0%
house um when when there was recovery
 
00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
housing in Tilton um and that month of
 
00:44:34.589 --> 00:44:34.599 align:start position:0%
helping him kind of get separation from
 
00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
um his misuse of substances after after
 
00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
one of his surgeries um gave us peace in
 
00:44:41.829 --> 00:44:41.839 align:start position:0%
our home for a month so we were ready
 
00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
for him to come home when he came home
 
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
this last time as I as I mentioned when
 
00:44:49.829 --> 00:44:49.839 align:start position:0%
he um came home he was fine with with no
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
pay meds the time before he got into
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
trouble with pay meds he's he's had 16
 
00:44:56.549 --> 00:44:56.559 align:start position:0%
surgeries I think since the accident
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
um and it was done in community in the
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
context of community he didn't have to
 
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
go to recovery housing you know we had
 
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
the education and the support Health
 
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
First provided Vivitrol to him for a
 
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:07.480 align:start position:0%
month to get separation from his time in
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
the hospital and it made a huge
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
difference but um you know the benefit
 
00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
of having a recovery home is that we
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
we've been moving away from an acute
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
care model for a long time in in
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
substance to support services it's so
 
00:45:22.549 --> 00:45:22.559 align:start position:0%
necessary for people to have a safe
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
place to go where they can continue
 
00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
their healing and and continue to have
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
support from people who get it because
 
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
so often families are hit with this
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
stuff and they don't get it I didn't you
 
00:45:35.309 --> 00:45:35.319 align:start position:0%
know until it hit my family so I I
 
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
strongly support this bill because um it
 
00:45:40.589 --> 00:45:40.599 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be up to neighbors to tell
 
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
people they can't live in their own
 
00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:43.589 align:start position:0%
people they can't live in their own
communities

00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:45:46.829 --> 00:45:46.839 align:start position:0%
um these houses provide that family
 
00:45:48.549 --> 00:45:48.559 align:start position:0%
context when families can't do it there
 
00:45:51.309 --> 00:45:51.319 align:start position:0%
are so many reasons why we need them and
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
I'd love to hear potentially in every
 
00:45:56.109 --> 00:45:56.119 align:start position:0%
County um it is important so I
 
00:45:59.150 --> 00:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time thank you are there
 
00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:00.710 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time thank you are there
any

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
questions okay not seeing any excuse
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt thank you madam
 
00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
chair so uh perhaps you could tell me uh
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
so I suppose it's not uniform or
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
standard but uh are these recovery
 
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
houses run by the people who live there
 
00:46:23.349 --> 00:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
or do they have uh some kind of a
 
00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:26.839 align:start position:0%
director or whatever does it vary what
 
00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
what is your experience so my experience
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
is when we refer to houses we we
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
generally vet them and know who are
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
there most often they are responsible
 
00:46:38.069 --> 00:46:38.079 align:start position:0%
house managers that live on site very
 
00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
often they are people in recovery that
 
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
have lived at a home impr proving their
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
leadership skills over time one of my
 
00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
Center managers actually um the Franklin
 
00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:49.880 align:start position:0%
Center has been at one of our recovery
 
00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
homes that we refer to for many years
 
00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
and he's just outstanding like as an
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
individual and um he he actually manages
 
00:46:59.630 --> 00:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
all of our data for our you know four
 
00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
centers at this point um so and and
 
00:47:05.309 --> 00:47:05.319 align:start position:0%
generally that's what happens within the
 
00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
houses that we refer to um and they're
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
supervised all the time you know oh
 
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
thank you followup so uh the the person
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh that that manages the house are they
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
there throughout the day uh because I I
 
00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
I would imagine it would be difficult if
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
there's if the person has to go away uh
 
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
for for an
 
00:47:37.309 --> 00:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
regular standard employment away from
 
00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
the home uh and now the home is
 
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
potentially empty or somebody there that
 
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
is I maybe not in the best of shape to
 
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
be left on their own well generally
 
00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
speaking by the time somebody enters
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
Recovery House they've already been
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
through treatment you know so they are
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
safe you you know to be be home alone um
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
but it's going to vary house by house
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
what their parameters are for the
 
00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
program mhm and maybe Kim Vach can
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
probably speak thankk to that better and
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
on your card I see it says representing
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
archways that's the name of the
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
organization that you work for or are R

the folks in the back of me um the
 
00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:01.839 align:start position:0%
shortage of recovery housing facilities
 
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
is one of the ma the major obstacles
 
00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
that it continues to face individuals uh
 
00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
uh impacted by substance use disorder
 
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
and our state as we work to overcome uh
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
the ongoing addiction crisis um our
 
00:49:14.589 --> 00:49:14.599 align:start position:0%
communities so many of them really seem
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
to recognize the value of uh of recovery
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
houses and they they really want to be
 
00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
helpful Partners in the development but
 
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
the the fact is there was a lot of
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
misconceptions out there or
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings about uh what recovery
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
housing is what it is not and that that
 
00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:31.079 align:start position:0%
really infringes Upon Our communities
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
our cities and towns abilities uh to
 
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
support uh the increase increase access
 
00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
to this invaluable resource so um this
 
00:49:41.069 --> 00:49:41.079 align:start position:0%
amendment really just seeks to clarify
 
00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh again what recovery housing is as a
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
it is a residential facility it is not a
 
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
Health Care Organization there is no
 
00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
health care provided on premises and
 
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
therefore it really should be uh uh
 
00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
subject to the same uh fire and safety
 
00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
codes and zoning regulations as other
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
residential facilities we believe
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
strongly that providing this kind of
 
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
clarity again will provide important
 
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
guidance to our communities and really
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
help them as they want to do to achieve
 
00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
um to to help the development of these
 
00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:09.640 align:start position:0%
uh critical resources uh and I will
 
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:12.839 align:start position:0%
point out that again this bill uh the I
 
00:50:14.109 --> 00:50:14.119 align:start position:0%
don't recall which line but it does
 
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
refer to uh houses that are either
 
00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:18.440 align:start position:0%
certified by New Hampshire Corps or in
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
the process of being certified so again
 
00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
these are are houses that are already in
 
00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:25.960 align:start position:0%
the process of uh uh achieving
 
00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
all of these established uh health and
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
safety codes as defined by core and the
 
00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
their National Affiliates so um with
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to take any questions so
 
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:40.549 align:start position:0%
 
consideration

00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
