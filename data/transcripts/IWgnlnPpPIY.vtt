amendment and i'd like to go through
 
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
a couple of the key points briefly for
 
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.829 align:start position:0%
a couple of the key points briefly for
you

00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:11:17.839 --> 00:11:19.590 align:start position:0%
you
first

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page one
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
i think one of the key points is that
 
00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:27.590 align:start position:0%
i think one of the key points is that
if

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.630 align:start position:0%
the uh
co-op

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
co-op
 
00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:31.839 align:start position:0%
school board
 
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
has a representative from a particular
 
00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:36.389 align:start position:0%
has a representative from a particular
town

00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
not the entire cooperative school board
 
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
will be voting for the
 
00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
member from one individual town
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
it'll be up to the voters in that town
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
to elect their representative to the
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
school board
 
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.069 align:start position:0%
school board
apportionment

00:12:02.069 --> 00:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
apportionment
 
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
apportionment of school
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
cooperative school board members shall
 
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
be done on the basis of population
 
00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:14.959 align:start position:0%
based on one person one vote doctrine
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
so that if you had
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
a large town
 
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
and three smaller towns
 
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
the large town might have three
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
members to the cooperative board and the
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
smaller three towns would have one
 
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
member each um and i think a speaker
 
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
following me will have some examples of
 
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
how that works out uh form some existing
 
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:46.090 align:start position:0%
over on the top of page two
 
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:47.190 align:start position:0%
over on the top of page two
[Music]

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
pretty much the existing languages
 
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
maintained in that
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
if the cooperative school board
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
wants to come up with a different
 
00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.790 align:start position:0%
wants to come up with a different
member

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
member
 
00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
selection process
 
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh they still have the ability to
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
present that
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
to the state board of education for
 
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of timing
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
the composition of the school board
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
shall be put in place in accordance with
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
this section by july 1 2025
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:13:29.839 --> 00:13:31.509 align:start position:0%
so that
no

00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:31.519 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
members who were just elected let's say
 
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.670 align:start position:0%
members who were just elected let's say
this

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.550 align:start position:0%
this
past

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
march or
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
some and maybe maybe in a few weeks
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
would be affected
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
but if
 
00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:47.519 align:start position:0%
a member's term does expire prior to
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
that july 1 2025 date
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
um they would be elected pursuant to
 
00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
this uh section and that the members of
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
at least me the voters in their town
 
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
would elect them
 
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
then at the
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
lines 20-23
 
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.269 align:start position:0%
lines 20-23
apportionment

00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
apportionment
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
will be reviewed and possibly updated
 
00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959 align:start position:0%
every 10 years
 
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
in accordance with the
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
federal census
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
just as
 
00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:24.150 align:start position:0%
just as
we

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
are redistrict and reapportioned
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
based on the census every 10 years
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
i think that that
 
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
very fair
 
00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.509 align:start position:0%
very fair
process

00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
to cooperative school board membership
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
and a very key one also in that
 
00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
as we've seen with some of these uh
 
00:14:45.279 --> 00:14:46.790 align:start position:0%
as we've seen with some of these uh
agreements

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
agreements
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
and some of these
 
00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:51.350 align:start position:0%
and some of these
boards

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
population shifts have occurred
 
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
but no change has been made to the way
 
00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
members are elected
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
and it's i think an unfair process to
 
00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:03.509 align:start position:0%
and it's i think an unfair process to
everyone

00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:03.519 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
um so i think those are the
 
00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:06.949 align:start position:0%
um so i think those are the
three

00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
i think that others behind me might have
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
some more information as i sample some
 
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
good examples of how this would work for
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
existing districts
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
cordelli are there questions of the
 
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
representative yes representative miler
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
two questions first of all
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh where does that why does this arise
 
00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
at this point in time is my first
 
00:15:40.959 --> 00:15:42.310 align:start position:0%
at this point in time is my first
question

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
the second question is
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
we have two other
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
bills that are on study
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
regarding cooperative districts
 
00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
and why wouldn't we put this issue
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
with that study
 
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
to deal with the whole issue of
 
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
cooperative districts because it's a
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
it's a complicated
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
concept that we're dealing with here
 
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
and they're trying to deal with it in an
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
isolated way rather than trying to put
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
it in to the
 
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
total study that we already have
 
00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
committed to so those two are my two
 
00:16:16.639 --> 00:16:17.670 align:start position:0%
committed to so those two are my two
questions

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
as you've said this has been a
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
complicated issue and every year
 
00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
it seems we have bills related to
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
cooperative school boards a lot of which
 
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
has been centered on
 
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
funding and withdrawal of cooperative
 
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
school board
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
in a number of districts
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
it really became apparent
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
small towns
 
00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.030 align:start position:0%
small towns
being

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
really denied a say in their
 
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
representatives the cooperative school
 
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.350 align:start position:0%
representatives the cooperative school
board

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
because of the a larger district
 
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
dominating the vote because basically
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
the entire district votes for that one
 
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
towns member
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
i for instance
 
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.079 align:start position:0%
you know living in tufts borough um
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
really have
 
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
little knowledge of the candidates
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
running in effingham a small
 
00:17:25.439 --> 00:17:27.590 align:start position:0%
running in effingham a small
town

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
and i don't think it's fair to the
 
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
people running in effingham that i
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
should have a vote
 
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
on who is going to represent effingham
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
so i think that that
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
really spurred a lot of the discussion
 
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.350 align:start position:0%
really spurred a lot of the discussion
about

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
membership and in an attempt to do uh
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
something related to membership um
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
uh irregardless of of where
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh study committees go and where the
 
00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
whole process of withdrawal and funding
 
00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.110 align:start position:0%
whole process of withdrawal and funding
um

00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you are there fo are other further
 
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
questions yes reps and tanner
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:18:09.679 --> 00:18:10.549 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh when you say a number
 
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
of cooperative districts could you uh
 
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
tell me
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
like in a ballpark figure of who you've
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
heard from which cooperative not which
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
clock the districts but
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh have there been other just you know
 
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
how many out of this number have
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
actually approached you and said that
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
they are upset with how things are i i
 
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
think a number of districts have
 
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
approached different members um of the
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
house um i was uh
 
00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.270 align:start position:0%
house um i was uh
most

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
most
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
interested in uh one of my local
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
districts which is a cooperative school
 
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
board um and that's the uh one i
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned in terms of effingham um
 
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
members of being elected to the school
 
00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:53.510 align:start position:0%
members of being elected to the school
board

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
so there's there's one can you i need a
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
ballpark figure like zero to five five
 
00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
to ten
 
00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
i i don't know how relevant that is um i
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
just know that uh different members of
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
the house have been um approached uh on
 
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
this subject um and i've heard from
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
several of them
 
00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
i just
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
just as a follow-up i just um the reason
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
i want to know the number
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
is that you know in my area that the
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
cooperative district is pretty settled
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
it's been settled there for 55 years now
 
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.750 align:start position:0%
it's been settled there for 55 years now
and

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
i just uh you know we don't make
 
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.750 align:start position:0%
i just uh you know we don't make
legislation

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:32.799 align:start position:0%
based on one or two instances and we
 
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
have a number a large number of
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
cooperative districts and so i wanted to
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
know you know the the reason i'm
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
pressing this is i want to know
 
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
a ballpark figure are we are we
 
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
legislating for just one or two
 
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
cooperative districts that are
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
disgruntled or are we
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
trying to make a
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
legislation that's going to affect all
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
the cooperative districts
 
00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
um and and a lot of you know the
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
majority of them are settled and i want
 
00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
to remain settled i i think that uh over
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
the years we've heard from
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
many people
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
many many members of this house who are
 
00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:12.470 align:start position:0%
many many members of this house who are
disgruntled

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
disgruntled
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
with the way the cooperative school
 
00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.750 align:start position:0%
with the way the cooperative school
boards

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
boards
 
00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:17.919 align:start position:0%
work and the whole concept
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
so i think this is nothing new but this
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
is an attempt to
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
address one aspect of cooperative school
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
boards that being the membership
 
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
representative luno no answer
 
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thank you
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
very much representative cordelli um for
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward and for taking my
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
question uh i want to go to the top of
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
page two
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
and explore what you mean by um
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
which reads such other methods of
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
selection of cooperative school board
 
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
members as maybe approved by the state
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
board of education and i was wondering
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
if you could explore that um what
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
what other methods
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
could be in your mind
 
00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.270 align:start position:0%
could be in your mind
um

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
this basically is existing language in
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
the statute now no no no
 
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative it's not
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
existing language because you you've
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
struck compatible with proportional
 
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
representation one man one vote if if i
 
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
if i could finish i can mention that um
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
yes we uh struck that one portion out
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
because we feel that that's covered
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
in previous section
 
00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.630 align:start position:0%
in previous section
a

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
the proportional representation
 
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
so this could
 
00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.149 align:start position:0%
so this could
address

00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
existing districts who maybe have an
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
at-large member or multiple at-large
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
members if they wanted to keep that
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
method of selection
 
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
they could
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
send that to the state board of
 
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
education for approval that would be one
 
00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.950 align:start position:0%
education for approval that would be one
example

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up quality chair so um so just to
 
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
be clear
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
in um in in the amendment here
 
00:22:05.039 --> 00:22:05.990 align:start position:0%
in um in in the amendment here
um

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.270 align:start position:0%
um
to

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%
195 19a
 
00:22:09.919 --> 00:22:10.710 align:start position:0%
195 19a
uh

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
roman one
 
00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.070 align:start position:0%
roman one
uh

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
roman one now consists of according to
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
based on the amendment consists of two
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
parts an a or a b
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
so what's covered in a
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily covered in b and
 
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
covered what's in b
 
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily bound by what's an a
 
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
because your choice is a or b
 
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
so so looking at b
 
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
let me give you an example and tell me
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
where and be
 
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
it would not be authorized let's say the
 
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner of education
 
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
selects the cooperative school board
 
00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:54.630 align:start position:0%
selects the cooperative school board
members

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh if i understand your question you're
 
00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.710 align:start position:0%
uh if i understand your question you're
um

00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh proposing that the commissioner of
 
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
education is gonna choose the school
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
board members for a cooperative school
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
board is that the question so i'm not
 
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
proposing it but let's say the secretary
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of education
 
00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:14.559 align:start position:0%
decided to select the um the school
 
00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:15.919 align:start position:0%
board members
 
00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:18.799 align:start position:0%
um where in b would would that be
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
prevented from happening
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh i think that is a uh
 
00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.549 align:start position:0%
uh i think that is a uh
uh

00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
i'll say hypothetical um but i i think
 
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
is uh very extreme that uh i think is um
 
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.549 align:start position:0%
is uh very extreme that uh i think is um
uh

00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
way out there and but
 
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
hold on hold on one one more follow-up
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
any approve any a board
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
cooperative school board plan
 
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
would be approved by the state board of
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
education i think that uh it has to come
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
from the cooperative school board um to
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
be approved by the state so let's say it
 
00:23:58.149 --> 00:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
comes from the chair of the cooperative
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
board and the chair the chair of the
 
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
board would like to select um uh who's
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
on the the school board with her would
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
that be allowed under b and if not could
 
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
you please explain how a and b a or b
 
00:24:15.669 --> 00:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
um i'm sorry how b would prevent that
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
um it would have to be approved by the
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
state board of education and i'm sure
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
that they would look into
 
00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:25.039 align:start position:0%
the existing situation and
 
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
the uh wishes of the cooperative school
 
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.269 align:start position:0%
the uh wishes of the cooperative school
board

00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
as a whole not just one person being the
 
00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.830 align:start position:0%
as a whole not just one person being the
chair

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
oh you add your one follow-up
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
i i have a question for you and it's a
 
00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:41.919 align:start position:0%
referencing the same section of law on
 
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
the on the second page there at the top
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
on lines one through three i'm in a
 
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
cooperative district myself right now
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
and if we decide that that district
 
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
is fine and functioning well
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
um then we could petition the
 
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner or the state board for
 
00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
approval to continue and would not have
 
00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
to abide by other
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
sections that are in this law is that
 
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:08.950 align:start position:0%
sections that are in this law is that
correct

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
yes that is uh the way that the uh
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
legislation was uh drafted and that is
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
the intent as well
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
yes representative woodcock
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um chairman thank you
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh two if i may one to follow up to
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
shamrock ladd's question is the opposite
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh equally uh accurate that the
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
commissioner could say
 
00:25:32.799 --> 00:25:34.149 align:start position:0%
commissioner could say
no

00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
it's the state board who has approval
 
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
because they both say no
 
00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
yes i imagine so if
 
00:25:42.549 --> 00:25:42.559 align:start position:0%
for instance um if i could finish uh if
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
for instance um a
 
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
a proposal came from just one member of
 
00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:48.549 align:start position:0%
a proposal came from just one member of
the

00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:48.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:51.039 align:start position:0%
cooperative school board uh i would
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
anticipate that the state board
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
might well uh say no well i was my
 
00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.510 align:start position:0%
might well uh say no well i was my
attempt

00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
attempt
 
00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
just trying to be clear rather than
 
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
cordelia and representative ladd's
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
comment he if i understood it right he
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
was saying we have a robert school board
 
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
everything's running terrifically
 
00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
everybody's happy
 
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
and they petition could the whoever the
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
charge here the state board could say no
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
we want all the school boys to be the
 
00:26:15.039 --> 00:26:16.230 align:start position:0%
we want all the school boys to be the
same

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
under this raw
 
00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
is that accurate
 
00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.630 align:start position:0%
is that accurate
um

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
i would say it's possible not um
 
00:26:26.559 --> 00:26:27.669 align:start position:0%
i would say it's possible not um
likely

00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
likely
 
00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
but um okay that's fine yep one more
 
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
you had two well i was follow up on
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
yours representatives
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna follow up on my own i got
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
it's a general question rather than
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
quinelli to which i don't know the
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
these school boards if reapportionment
 
00:26:49.919 --> 00:26:51.029 align:start position:0%
these school boards if reapportionment
occurs

00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
occurs
 
00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
does that change
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
the financial mechanism for
 
00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
reimbursement within the district no
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
had no impact on financial markets no
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you everyone appreciate
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%

over here to turn his microphone off man
 
00:27:09.279 --> 00:27:10.470 align:start position:0%
over here to turn his microphone off man
just

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
touch the uh no no the daisy chain no no
 
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
will not
 
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative for taking
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
my question so
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
for my own sense of clarity
 
00:27:24.549 --> 00:27:24.559 align:start position:0%
page two line one
 
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
such other method of selection of
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
cooperative school board members
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%

as may be approved by the state board of
education

education
so

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
the state board of education
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
should this pass would be given the
 
00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.909 align:start position:0%
should this pass would be given the
authority

00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:41.919 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
of approving a selection method for
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
school board members
 
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.750 align:start position:0%
school board members
that

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
does not involve
 
00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
voting for those school board members
 
00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
they could be appointed as opposed to
 
00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
being voted in
 
00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:00.870 align:start position:0%
being voted in
i

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
i think that's another hypothetical
 
00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
that's uh very likely uh
 
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
very unlikely to occur um the uh intent
 
00:28:12.789 --> 00:28:12.799 align:start position:0%
is that uh as i
 
00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:16.559 align:start position:0%
laid out um initially is that uh
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
members within the town elect
 
00:28:19.279 --> 00:28:20.310 align:start position:0%
members within the town elect
their

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
member to represent them at the
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
cooperative school board that's the uh
 
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
underlying principle um that we have in
 
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
in this follow-up mr chair yes um right
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't debate what you're
 
00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
saying about the proportional uh
 
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
assignment of the number of school board
 
00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
members what i'm saying is that that's a
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
totally separate issue than the state
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
board of education being given the
 
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
authority to appoint school board
 
00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.430 align:start position:0%
authority to appoint school board
members

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.389 align:start position:0%
members
um

00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
and so i'm wondering
 
00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
to representative luna's you you know
 
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
highlighting of the word or
 
00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.669 align:start position:0%
highlighting of the word or
um

00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
where is the need for this where where i
 
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
i understand that people from effingham
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
may want their own represent
 
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
representative on the school board
 
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:08.799 align:start position:0%
but who from
 
00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
effingham came forward and said
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
gee i think we ought to include a
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
section that says that if the state
 
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
board wants to use an alternative
 
00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799 align:start position:0%
method they can
 
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
the state board can
 
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
have an alternate method approved
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
currently in statute
 
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that has happened in the
 
00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.669 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that has happened in the
uh

00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:31.679 --> 00:29:33.510 align:start position:0%
uh
um

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
60 plus years of cooperative school
 
00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.029 align:start position:0%
60 plus years of cooperative school
boards

00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
boards
 
00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:39.039 align:start position:0%
um but that's
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
existing statute that they have that
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
ability we do have a number of other
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
people on testosterone just one more um
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
i i would have absolutely uh been with
 
00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.110 align:start position:0%
i i would have absolutely uh been with
you

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli until the
 
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
portion where compatible with
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
proportional representation one man one
 
00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
vote was stricken from
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions of
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli thank you very
 
00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.269 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli thank you very

much
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for the record before
 
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
you head out of here i'm going to need a

card from you you got one right there
 
00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
oh he just gave up
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah welcome
 
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record uh statement
 
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
proud of me uh rockingham 19 stratham
 
00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.870 align:start position:0%
proud of me uh rockingham 19 stratham
so

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
obviously education's not my area i'm a
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
ways and means guy but
 
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
you know when when the
 
00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
uh when uh the house bill
 
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
that was tabled that you all voted for
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
19 to nothing
 
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh i started my conversation with the
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
chair and the vice chair about this
 
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
and we started to look into this whole
 
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
issue and we dug out a lot of the
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to find the actual
 
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh agreements that
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
exist around the state there's like 30
 
00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:07.830 align:start position:0%
exist around the state there's like 30
30

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
30
 
00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
co-op boards
 
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
and we dug out a lot of them to see what
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
their makeup is and all of that
 
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
so we did a lot of research in the last
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
month or so since that that tabling
 
00:31:17.519 --> 00:31:18.950 align:start position:0%
month or so since that that tabling
occurred

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.549 align:start position:0%
occurred
so

00:31:20.549 --> 00:31:20.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
you know on that a and b thing let me
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
just address that
 
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
only if
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
a school board doesn't
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
comply with the the tenants of this bill
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
that they have an alternative
 
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
that they can go to the
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
board and
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
and plead their case
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
so they have all they have to do is say
 
00:31:48.399 --> 00:31:49.350 align:start position:0%
so they have all they have to do is say
look

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
look
 
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
we have a a a complicated situation here
 
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh we can't meet all the tenants
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
and here's why so it's an effect they're
 
00:32:00.389 --> 00:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
acting like a court saying yeah
 
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
we agree with you
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
you you have a special situation here
 
00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:04.789 align:start position:0%
you you have a special situation here
and

00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
you know but you have to have an
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
argument you have to have a reason why
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
you can't comply and when i show you
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
some of the examples in a minute
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
in my handout uh that should become
 
00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
become clear
 
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
so again
 
00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.110 align:start position:0%
so again
it

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
you know there's two pieces of the bill
 
00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.990 align:start position:0%
you know there's two pieces of the bill
really

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
you know do we want do we want
 
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
apportionment to be
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
fair of the the number of seats per
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh existing there's different language
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
in the bill but in the bill and current
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
statutes but existing districts
 
00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
which really in effect means towns
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
okay uh the the individual towns or in
 
00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:45.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
versus the co-op district okay
 
00:32:47.919 --> 00:32:49.190 align:start position:0%
versus the co-op district okay
so

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:51.029 --> 00:32:51.039 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't it make sense to
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
at least take a look at it and i and i
 
00:32:54.549 --> 00:32:54.559 align:start position:0%
looked at a whole bunch of them and in
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
10 minutes i said you know something
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
their districts make sense in terms of
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
the the allocation of seats to the
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
district so i don't think this is a big
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
going to be a big burden on on the towns
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
to to go through the exercise and i'll
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
again i'll show you some examples to to
 
00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
show you that but the second piece of
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
the build that's apportionment the
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
second piece of the bill really is about
 
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't shouldn't towns pick
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
their own
 
00:33:19.279 --> 00:33:21.269 align:start position:0%
their own
uh

00:33:21.269 --> 00:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:21.279 --> 00:33:22.950 align:start position:0%
uh
representation

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh there are many examples and one
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
another question was asked because are
 
00:33:27.279 --> 00:33:28.070 align:start position:0%
another question was asked because are
there

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
other other towns i know obviously i say
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
16 my town my district uh i was meeting
 
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
with some folks in winneconne district
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
uh the other day they had some real
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
concerns about how the voting is done
 
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
there's got to be many other examples as
 
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
well of that i know people in my town
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
say well
 
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
why am i why am i voting for somebody
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
three times away
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
i don't know who they are i've been
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
saying this for a year my years myself
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
so when i saw this amendment i said well
 
00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
bro good we got a solution to this why
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
am i why am i voting for somebody i have
 
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
no idea who they are
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm being asked to vote for them
 
00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.590 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm being asked to vote for them
so

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:09.919 align:start position:0%
again this this solves that problem okay
 
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
so that's the two pieces of the bill
 
00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.510 align:start position:0%
so that's the two pieces of the bill
uh

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
and then then we talk about
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
in the bill it like every every town or
 
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
existing district should get at least
 
00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919 align:start position:0%
one seat
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
okay and you know something when i
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
looked at at
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
at a lot of the the town a lot of the
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
districts that already exists
 
00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:31.839 align:start position:0%
so you'll see that in examples
 
00:34:31.839 --> 00:34:32.629 align:start position:0%
so you'll see that in examples
uh

00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
you know even even at the federal level
 
00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:37.599 align:start position:0%
you look at alaska vermont and wyoming
 
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
all have populations under uh
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
762 0169 which equals one seat
 
00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
and we give them a seat anyway
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
they get even though
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
they don't have the population to
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
warrant one seat we give them seats so
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
the same thing here and a lot of towns
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
do that right now
 
00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:57.829 align:start position:0%
do that right now
uh

00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
and then proportionality
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
and you're going to see in one example i
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
could have shown other examples that not
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
every town have the seats
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
allocated proportionally
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
based on the population i think that's a
 
00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.109 align:start position:0%
based on the population i think that's a
reasonable

00:35:13.109 --> 00:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh a reasonable thing that we should be
 
00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
be doing
 
00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:17.910 align:start position:0%
be doing
uh

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
again an example
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
and but you have to round you have to
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
round up you have to round down to the
 
00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
nearest whole number
 
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh but i'll give an example the federal
 
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
level uh for state rep uh state reps for
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
federal seats
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh idaho is eligible for 2.42 seats and
 
00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:38.079 align:start position:0%
rhode island is eligible for 1.44 seats
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
and they both get two seats
 
00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:41.839 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
i i mean
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
you have to have a little finesse here
 
00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:46.950 align:start position:0%
you have to have a little finesse here
but

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's got to be in at least in the
 
00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
ballpark in the range
 
00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.069 align:start position:0%
ballpark in the range
um

00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
and again i i'll show you example of one
 
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
that has no doesn't have proportionality
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
in my mind we we should try to get
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
rid of as many of the large seats
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
as we can because those those seats can
 
00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:12.079 align:start position:0%
i'll show an example here where we can
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
allocate those seats to the towns
 
00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.589 align:start position:0%
allocate those seats to the towns
proportionally

00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
proportionally
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
why are we gonna why are we making
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
people vote
 
00:36:19.119 --> 00:36:20.230 align:start position:0%
people vote
for

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
for for at large people who
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
it does it does it doesn't make sense so
 
00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:28.550 align:start position:0%
it does it does it doesn't make sense so
uh

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
you know in 19 in the 1990s when it came
 
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
to state rep seats
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
for those who have been around you
 
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
remember we used to have big seat big my
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
my example is when i first got elected i
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
had three towns that i had to represent
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
and we had eight reps representing those
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
eight towns but in the 1990s we had a
 
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional change
 
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
that said
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we're gonna have smaller
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
smaller districts to the town level and
 
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
so now i i'm one of two in my town
 
00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
a lot easier to campaign a lot easier to
 
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
communicate with my constituents
 
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
representing just my town and not all
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
the other the other towns that were
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
one was exeter which is much larger than
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
my town
 
00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.910 align:start position:0%
my town
so

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
so i mean the same principles here
 
00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.470 align:start position:0%
so i mean the same principles here
um

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
i'm going with my notes in this handout
 
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
by the way
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh five
 
00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.150 align:start position:0%
uh five
uh

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
so candidates
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
another tenant of this of this amendment
 
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
which is is consistent with
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
existing in terms of you have to be
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh domiciled
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
in the town that you're running in that
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't change but you should
 
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
be elected by those domiciled in that
 
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
district so that's the thing and there's
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
so many reasons why
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
i think it was mentioned earlier it
 
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.510 align:start position:0%
i think it was mentioned earlier it
prevents

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
prevents
 
00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
we have in my district we have one town
 
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
that represents 47 of the vote
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
so how is my little town of newfields
 
00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079 align:start position:0%
gonna compete how are they gonna
 
00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
they can be outvoted every time in terms
 
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
of their selected candidate being
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
selected by another town uh
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
this will ensure that the that the
 
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
town's choice
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
of a candidate wins
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
the bill ensures that the town can vote
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
for someone they know
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
and not not vote as i was saying earlier
 
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
for some stranger in another town
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
and here's the real issue
 
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
the cost and time it's going to take
 
00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
for somebody running
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
in new fields for a seat
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
and his thirty four thousand citizens
 
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
new fails is a couple of thousand
 
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
and we have to compete and i have to i
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
have to spend money put signs up in in
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
six towns
 
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh and and go out and campaign in six
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
towns does it make sense
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
to get elected in newfalls
 
00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:50.710 align:start position:0%
to get elected in newfalls
so

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:57.510 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
and then once
 
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
once elected
 
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
you know have your your true true
 
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
representative government so the new
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
fields person relates to the new phil
 
00:39:09.359 --> 00:39:10.150 align:start position:0%
fields person relates to the new phil
uh

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
citizens as they call them with with
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
house bill 1046 about sullivan county
 
00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.310 align:start position:0%
house bill 1046 about sullivan county
commissioners

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.589 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
they they have three i guess it's three
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
but they have multiple commissioners
 
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
and right now
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
it's voted
 
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
that everybody in that in that county
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
votes for all three commissioners and we
 
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:44.870 align:start position:0%
votes for all three commissioners and we
all

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
not all of us but some of us voted
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
to say that doesn't make sense because
 
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
seven seven other counties
 
00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:52.550 align:start position:0%
seven seven other counties
have

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
all their commissioners voted by
 
00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
the commissioner domiciled in their
 
00:39:59.589 --> 00:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
district and only voted only by
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
the uh voters in their district so this
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
is a similar thing that we're talking
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
about here
 
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
and again seven counties already do that
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
and this would be they would be the
 
00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.349 align:start position:0%
and this would be they would be the
eighth

00:40:09.349 --> 00:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
eighth
 
00:40:09.359 --> 00:40:16.470 align:start position:0%
eighth
um

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
so what we wanted to do is also have a a
 
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
road map they have to develop a plan if
 
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
there has to be a change
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
the bill has a plan you have to develop
 
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
a plan
 
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
people who
 
00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.109 align:start position:0%
people who
were

00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
you know you have to get from here to
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
there if we change seat this seat goes
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
from this town to that town now
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
the person in the seat doesn't get
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
removed there's a there's a glide path
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
so that that person would stay in a seat
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
until it turns up
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
and then once that occurs that's why
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
there's a three-year period in which you
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
can phase in this that existing board
 
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
members would not be impacted by any of
 
00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.710 align:start position:0%
members would not be impacted by any of
this

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
and of course we maintain
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
the 15 seat
 
00:40:56.319 --> 00:40:57.270 align:start position:0%
the 15 seat
limit

00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
limit
 
00:40:59.430 --> 00:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
for co-ops the three-year term limit for
 
00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:00.470 align:start position:0%
for co-ops the three-year term limit for
co-ops

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
co-ops
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh in other words up to three you can
 
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
pick you can have two year terms three
 
00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
of terms
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
that doesn't change and the odd number
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
seat requirement
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
also applies
 
00:41:14.069 --> 00:41:14.079 align:start position:0%
i gave an example my first example if
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
you go to the if you just really want to
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
look at this
 
00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.309 align:start position:0%
look at this
um

00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
this is the uh contouriquet
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
valley and i think so i think we have
 
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
somebody here from kentucky
 
00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:28.550 align:start position:0%
somebody here from kentucky
uh

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
but it's kentucky valley uh
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
school district
 
00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:35.839 align:start position:0%
and they pretty much already
 
00:41:35.839 --> 00:41:36.950 align:start position:0%
and they pretty much already
are

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
their numbers are right on on beam with
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
all what i just said so if you go to the
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
first example it says example one
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
so there's the populations based on the
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
2020 census they have 18 900 voters
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
so what's the percent of the voters
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
peterborough 34 all the way to sharon
 
00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
1.9 percent
 
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
and i and theoretically
 
00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
if you multiply that the 34 times 18
 
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
1800 18 900 it says they require 14.42
 
00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:10.470 align:start position:0%
1800 18 900 it says they require 14.42
seats

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
seats
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
but on the other side
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
and then sharon require 0.25 seats
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
but what's their current seat allocation
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
four for peterborough two for atrium etc
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
and one from everybody else
 
00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.510 align:start position:0%
and one from everybody else
13.

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
13.
 
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
and it as it turns out
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
if we if we take the uh percentage
 
00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
of of seats in other words they were
 
00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:36.470 align:start position:0%
of of seats in other words they were
rounding

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
rounding
 
00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
so they rounded from 4.42 to four which
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
is a proper rounding
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
but then we rounded up for sharon
 
00:42:45.359 --> 00:42:46.069 align:start position:0%
but then we rounded up for sharon
so

00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
they have 34 percent of of the
 
00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
population but they have 30.77 percent
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
of the seats which is okay
 
00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.150 align:start position:0%
of the seats which is okay
okay

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.990 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
so if if if the child was re-looking at
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
their numbers based on the current
 
00:42:59.599 --> 00:43:00.630 align:start position:0%
their numbers based on the current
census

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
census
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
i don't see any change in the
 
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
apportionment it would still be four two
 
00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
one one one one and equal thirteen now
 
00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
they could choose any time you can
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
choose to have up to fifteen
 
00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:13.839 align:start position:0%
but no less than three
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
basically because you're not gonna have
 
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
one and it has to be odd number
 
00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.790 align:start position:0%
one and it has to be odd number
so

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
so so they're already there
 
00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:22.790 align:start position:0%
so so they're already there
now

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
governor wentworth
 
00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:25.670 align:start position:0%
governor wentworth
is

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
and i know i know
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
i know bro brodie desais is here and
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
he's the one who pulled the bill off the
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
of consent so i have this one this has
 
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
to do with both borosphere and all those
 
00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
so there's an example
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
if you look at the current use they have
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
18 000
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh census as well
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
and wolfe
 
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
wolfborough clearly is the larger player
 
00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
and ossipee comes behind
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
and this is their current they chose
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
years ago to go 1-1 everybody has one
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
and then go three
 
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
three at large
 
00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:59.990 align:start position:0%
three at large
so

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
so i'm here's an example of
 
00:44:02.319 --> 00:44:03.589 align:start position:0%
so i'm here's an example of
why

00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
you know if i if i'm uh
 
00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
if i'm brookfield
 
00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
how do i
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
how do i
 
00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
aren't i being dominated by wolfeboro in
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
my head i i think they are i mean they
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
could they could out maneuver them and
 
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
they could pick somebody they like to to
 
00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
represent them in brookfield
 
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
so what this does is
 
00:44:29.349 --> 00:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
it says brookfield gets to pick their
 
00:44:29.359 --> 00:44:30.230 align:start position:0%
it says brookfield gets to pick their
own

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
they're given one
 
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
and then the numbers work out three two
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
one one one one to the nine now again
 
00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
they could change how many they want
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
they can have more or they can have less
 
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
but uh that's up to them
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
so there's a there's a very easy
 
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
solution turns out representative chase
 
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
is from wolfeboro he's one of the
 
00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.710 align:start position:0%
is from wolfeboro he's one of the
at-large

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
at-large
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
he would at the end of this
 
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
his term he'd probably still we could
 
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
get reelected
 
00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:57.750 align:start position:0%
get reelected
because

00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:44:59.829 --> 00:44:59.839 align:start position:0%
there's two more seats in wolfeboro that
 
00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:01.839 align:start position:0%
he can run for so it's to me it's not a
 
00:45:01.839 --> 00:45:03.190 align:start position:0%
he can run for so it's to me it's not a
problem

00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
now the one that i'll the last example
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
is merrimack valley
 
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:08.950 align:start position:0%
is merrimack valley
uh

00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
this one stood out to me uh that
 
00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.230 align:start position:0%
this one stood out to me uh that
again

00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
we have now this is a district this is a
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
district with 14 000
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh citizens
 
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh the numbers are a lot smaller but
 
00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:22.550 align:start position:0%
uh the numbers are a lot smaller but
it's

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
louden and and the bosque are the are
 
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
the largest
 
00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:27.829 align:start position:0%
the largest
but

00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:29.839 align:start position:0%
they chose
 
00:45:29.839 --> 00:45:30.790 align:start position:0%
they chose
again

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
when they formed as a district they
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
chose two two two two
 
00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:35.829 align:start position:0%
chose two two two two
which

00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
and then it had to be it had to be
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
odd number so i'm assuming i don't know
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
this but i'm assuming to make that work
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
they had to pick another person to make
 
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
to make it an odd number of seats
 
00:45:51.359 --> 00:45:52.470 align:start position:0%
to make it an odd number of seats
um

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.270 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
here we go
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
right now to me
 
00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
in in compliance with the current
 
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
statutes because it's not proportional
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
these numbers are not proportional
 
00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh to the population
 
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
but again if you do
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
you do a little rounding
 
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
you know basically loudoun should have
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
four boss one should have three webster
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
should have two and and salisbury and p
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
and pinnacock should have one
 
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh to equal the 11. again they could
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
change what they want so
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:46:27.599 --> 00:46:29.190 align:start position:0%
i think
again

00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.150 align:start position:0%
again
that

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
but again i i guess it's a it's
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
philosophical more than anything else
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
i i just think that
 
00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
people in their town should vote for the
 
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
people they know in their town
 
00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh they do that with our state reps they
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
do that with the federal congress they
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
they we don't we have two two
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
congressional districts we don't we
 
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
don't vote
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
for i'm in district one i don't vote for
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
who's in district two
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
and i think it just you think we're
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
going to get better better candidates
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
to run
 
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
especially in the smaller town if they
 
00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:03.910 align:start position:0%
especially in the smaller town if they
know

00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
that they only have to run in their town
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
to get elected
 
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh just makes sense
 
00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:10.470 align:start position:0%
uh just makes sense
and

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
let me tell you this big money coming in
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
we all and i always
 
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
you know i always assume that
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh local elections are local
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
and that school board elections were
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
were local
 
00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
and that there wasn't big money involved
 
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
well that's changing
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
they've become partisan now
 
00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:29.910 align:start position:0%
they've become partisan now
and

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
i think we could take some of the
 
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
partisanship out of this by by
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
saying look
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
small towns have a chance here you you
 
00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
pick who you want and we'll keep the
 
00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
partisanship out which equals
 
00:47:43.829 --> 00:47:43.839 align:start position:0%
partisanship equals bigger money into
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
these elections
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
which we shouldn't have so that's why i
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
support this amendment and uh
 
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
i got a few minutes for questions so i'm
 
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:53.839 align:start position:0%
i have to share a ways of means today so
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
i got about two or three minutes here
 
00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.079 align:start position:0%
thank you very much pat uh
 
00:47:59.910 --> 00:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative moffitt thank you mr
 
00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
thank you represent ryan for all your
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
hard work uh especially being from
 
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
loudoun just noted from your research
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
that loudness 40 percent of the
 
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
population and 18 of the school board
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
representation so that is a is something
 
00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
against my attention but
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
has to do with uh you talked about
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
sharon uh tiny town in the contour clip
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
valley uh i used to be a board member
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
from campton which is part of sau 48
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
penny baker cooperative district ashland
 
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
campton holiness plymouth romney
 
00:48:30.069 --> 00:48:30.079 align:start position:0%
thornton wentworth it's maybe the
 
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
biggest not population-wise but
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
geographically in the state now uh also
 
00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:38.559 align:start position:0%
included in penny baker co-op district
 
00:48:41.589 --> 00:48:41.599 align:start position:0%
uh sau 48 is waterville valley which
 
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
says 243 people by the last census even
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
smaller than sharon but
 
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
there's also ellsworth which uh which
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
its population skyrocketed from 83 to 93
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
in this latest
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
so my question is uh given the model
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
that that we're looking at here uh would
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
a town or a town it's a town ellsworth
 
00:49:06.549 --> 00:49:06.559 align:start position:0%
with 93 people would that rate a full
 
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
board member
 
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
well what i think
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
even with the confines of this bill
 
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
and i i know i have to see whether or
 
00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
not they had a full board number
 
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
again all this is based on the original
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
districts before the co-ops were when
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
the ports are being being created they
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
call them the existing districts there's
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
no reason why you i'm not
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not hundred sure on this but i think
 
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
i think you're allowed to combine towns
 
00:49:35.829 --> 00:49:35.839 align:start position:0%
to create a an existing district
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
that would be larger that you could say
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
you could have one vote
 
00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
that's an option
 
00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
but you as as as as a as a co-op
 
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
district you'd have to make that
 
00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:47.510 align:start position:0%
district you'd have to make that
determination

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
determination
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
and i i think uh representative ladd has
 
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
situations like that in his his area as
 
00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:53.910 align:start position:0%
situations like that in his his area as
well

00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh that's part of the thing so if it's
 
00:49:59.349 --> 00:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
if it's small that's why we have to be
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
there in this
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
that look we can't comply with this you
 
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
know either we want to
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
we want to align a couple of the smaller
 
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
towns together and create a position for
 
00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.030 align:start position:0%
towns together and create a position for
them

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
and argue your case i think it would
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
probably be agreed to
 
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
because once we started looking at this
 
00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:18.559 align:start position:0%
there's so many different permutations
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
of what we find
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
district to district
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's but but
 
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of them will fit the confines
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
of this amendment
 
00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
but we we had to provide a way to to be
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
able to give a district a chance
 
00:50:33.839 --> 00:50:34.630 align:start position:0%
able to give a district a chance
to

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
present its case
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
to say look we tried hard but this
 
00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense and
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
and i i would i would i would argue that
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
the state board of education are
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable people and you give
 
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable arguments that that they
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
would they would uh
 
00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
they would agree that any change you
 
00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
want to make thank you thank you
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative like us
 
00:51:00.069 --> 00:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
yes i have a sort of a two-part single
 
00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:02.559 align:start position:0%
question and my question is in your
 
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:05.839 align:start position:0%
merrimack valley example
 
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:12.549 --> 00:51:12.559 align:start position:0%
if they're happy
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
i guess the first question is
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
if they're happy with it would they be
 
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
able to then bring that
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
to would they be able to use b bring
 
00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
that to the state board of education and
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
say hey we decided on equal
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
representation we like it nobody is
 
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
complaining um can we keep our equal
 
00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.230 align:start position:0%
complaining um can we keep our equal
representation

00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
yeah but i think in this exam yes they
 
00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:41.030 align:start position:0%
yeah but i think in this exam yes they
could

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:51:43.109 --> 00:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
but i i would say that it's it's a
 
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
harder argument because it's it
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
it does violate the one-man one vote but
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
see that's why i'm wondering because you
 
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
crossed out
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
the compatible with proportional
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
representation one-man one-vote
 
00:51:59.349 --> 00:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
principle and so with that crossed out
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
it seems that they would be able to keep
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
what they have if they want it and so
 
00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
that was the other part if we put that
 
00:52:08.309 --> 00:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
back in
 
00:52:08.319 --> 00:52:09.190 align:start position:0%
back in
they

00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
my right they then wouldn't be able to
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
keep this agreement and maybe they like
 
00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:16.829 align:start position:0%
keep this agreement and maybe they like
it

00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh we went through a lot of iterations
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
of this amendment
 
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
and i i know we had it in there at some
 
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
point now i'll let the chair and the
 
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
vice chair explain what we did there
 
00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
when you have your work session or
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
discussion about this
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
you're not in compliance
 
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
i mean they're not they're not in
 
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
compliance with even current statute
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
so that's one way because no because no
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
one's monitoring this that's the other
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
reality nobody's monitoring what
 
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
these things
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
and we we're just trying to give a
 
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
little little put a little a little bit
 
00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:53.430 align:start position:0%
little little put a little a little bit
more

00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:54.790 align:start position:0%
more
um

00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:58.390 --> 00:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh contours to the to the the statute
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
we can thank you
 
00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i i've got a
 
00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
question for you i know you got to head
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
out of here
 
00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
i'm cheering today too so that's why be
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
kind to all our bills over there in ways
 
00:53:07.839 --> 00:53:08.790 align:start position:0%
kind to all our bills over there in ways
means

00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
means
 
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
um and looking at the sanborn regional
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
school district asset was foreign back
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
in 1965.
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
it's got kingston and newton
 
00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
of which there's three members from it
 
00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:22.230 align:start position:0%
of which there's three members from it
each

00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
each
 
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
three members representing kingston
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
uh and three from newton
 
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
of which that's populations in these
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
communities are not the same but they
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
also have one at large
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's making seven that odd number needed
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
is it then
 
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
if they decide we're good with what
 
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
we're doing
 
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
in accordance with this bill being put
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
forward could they petition the state
 
00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:49.349 align:start position:0%
forward could they petition the state
board

00:53:49.349 --> 00:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
for approval of their present format
 
00:53:53.349 --> 00:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's why we put that in
 
00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you again
 
00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
if they have a logical
 
00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
explanation why they want to do it it
 
00:54:00.790 --> 00:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a problem
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps santa luna
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and thank
 
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
you very much representative browning um
 
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
you said you did a lot of homework on on
 
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
this and and i appreciate that um the
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
difficulty and the challenges and in
 
00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:16.720 align:start position:0%
collecting a number of the uh the co-op
 
00:54:19.349 --> 00:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
agreements i was wondering though um
 
00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
obviously you know you're familiar with
 
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
the existing law because you've offered
 
00:54:25.109 --> 00:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
this amendment i was wondering in
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
example number three
 
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
which which you testified to
 
00:54:31.829 --> 00:54:31.839 align:start position:0%
towards the end and i think has been the
 
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
subject of a couple other questions
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
this is with respect to
 
00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:38.559 align:start position:0%
their mech valley school district if you
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
could tell me which um part that was um
 
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
um organized under roman one two three
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
or four
 
00:54:49.829 --> 00:54:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
oh geez no i i don't then
 
00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
i'll go i'll go on it's sort of
 
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
rhetorical um it's it's under roman four
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh which reads the members of the
 
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
cooperative school board shall each be
 
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
domiciled in and represent a
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
pre-existing district
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
with each president existing district
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
having at least
 
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
one such resident representative but all
 
00:55:14.069 --> 00:55:14.079 align:start position:0%
members of the cooperative board shall
 
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
be elected at large
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
and and so
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
when looking at example three
 
00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:24.799 align:start position:0%
and and what i just read uh established
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
under the current um roman four
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
um i i'm just i wanna i wanna challenge
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
what you said that it's a violation of
 
00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
the one man one vote and not in
 
00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:37.670 align:start position:0%
the one man one vote and not in
compliance

00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
with current statute um
 
00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:41.510 align:start position:0%
with current statute um
because

00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
current statute does say that all the
 
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
the board shall be elected at large
 
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
um which means ever you know uh loudon
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
gets to vote on
 
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
the seats in other
 
00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:55.589 align:start position:0%
the seats in other
districts

00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
i mean in other towns right it does say
 
00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:58.470 align:start position:0%
i mean in other towns right it does say
that

00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:58.480 --> 00:55:59.190 align:start position:0%
that
but

00:55:59.190 --> 00:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
i i don't see this being proportional
 
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
though okay so a follow up on that mr
 
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
chair so if if
 
00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:07.510 align:start position:0%
chair so if if
if

00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
if merrimack valley wanted to change it
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
under existing law
 
00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
what's wrong with
 
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
what what's currently presented in roman
 
00:56:19.829 --> 00:56:19.839 align:start position:0%
one roman two or roman three
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
with respect to um
 
00:56:22.079 --> 00:56:23.030 align:start position:0%
with respect to um
um

00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh cooperative school board um
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
cooperative school district shall be
 
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
divided into single board member
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
districts according to population with
 
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
its nearly equal population in each
 
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
district as possible that does not
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
require at large voting so each district
 
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
would be able to elect their own
 
00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:42.150 align:start position:0%
would be able to elect their own
resident

00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
resident
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
member or roman three
 
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
both roman two and roman three have been
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
next out um uh also allows uh single or
 
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
multi-member districts which i assume
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
could be divided by town and again not
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
require at large
 
00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:00.069 align:start position:0%
require at large
voting

00:57:00.069 --> 00:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
voting
 
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't
 
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
existing law roman 2 or roman 3 satisfy
 
00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to accomplish with
 
00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
again when we we looked at it we we we
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
concluded it it didn't i and i can't
 
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
recall the exact logic but you know i
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
think it's important that that the
 
00:57:19.359 --> 00:57:20.950 align:start position:0%
think it's important that that the
committee

00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:22.789 align:start position:0%
committee
understand

00:57:22.789 --> 00:57:22.799 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:57:22.799 --> 00:57:24.630 align:start position:0%
understand
why

00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
why roman 2 or roman 3 doesn't doesn't
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
satisfy the option i mean you're using
 
00:57:32.789 --> 00:57:32.799 align:start position:0%
terms like like give the districts the
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
chance let them you know choose an
 
00:57:36.549 --> 00:57:36.559 align:start position:0%
alternative well there's four
 
00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
alternatives that are laid out in
 
00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
current law
 
00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
two of them require at large voting two
 
00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
of them don't require at large voting
 
00:57:47.109 --> 00:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
and uh and do allow for uh single and
 
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
multi-member districts right but i but
 
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
i'm looking to elect their own i look at
 
00:57:53.109 --> 00:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
it this way though i look at loudoun at
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
500 residents in penacook at 1273
 
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
and i see what i see here is that they
 
00:58:03.349 --> 00:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
each have two seats so couldn't and i go
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
how how can that be
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
one more question yeah i got it i really
 
00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
sure but but but but couldn't roman 3
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
and current law provide what you've got
 
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
for proposed seats here yeah and i'm and
 
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
i'm just i'm not prepared to answer that
 
00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:22.549 align:start position:0%
i'm just i'm not prepared to answer that
i i

00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
possibly but i'm not prepared to answer
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
that thank you very much
 
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
right i'll take a very clear question
 
00:58:32.069 --> 00:58:32.079 align:start position:0%
very quickly i just wanted to ask you
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
when you've been approached by different
 
00:58:33.839 --> 00:58:34.789 align:start position:0%
when you've been approached by different
folks

00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
folks
 
00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
knowing how the statute is currently
 
00:58:36.799 --> 00:58:37.829 align:start position:0%
knowing how the statute is currently
written

00:58:37.829 --> 00:58:37.839 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
if anything needs to be changed is that
 
00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:42.559 align:start position:0%
possible though how would they change
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
that by voting would the larger towns
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
still overtake the smaller towns
 
00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
any possible change
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
would be difficult because the larger
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
towns will can outvote
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
the smaller towns and that that's an
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
issue thank you
 
00:58:57.030 --> 00:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
my husband knew you knew your wife also
 
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
um i am no longer a representative um
 
00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
i'm patricia lovejoy and i'm here
 
00:59:17.589 --> 00:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
actually just representing myself
 
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
i am from stratham
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
the same town as the previous speaker
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
i have some background in this and that
 
00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
i served on our regional our cooperative
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
school board for nine years
 
00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
it's been a decade since i did that but
 
00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
i served in the nine years
 
00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:35.190 align:start position:0%
i served in the nine years
and

00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's right i was elected by all six
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
towns in my district
 
00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
and our towns range from
 
00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:45.839 align:start position:0%
being as small as 1600
 
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
as large as a little over 14 000.
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
i think that being elected by all six
 
00:59:55.109 --> 00:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
towns made me a better board member
 
00:59:55.119 --> 00:59:56.069 align:start position:0%
towns made me a better board member
i

00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
every election
 
00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:58.630 align:start position:0%
every election
and

00:59:58.630 --> 00:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:00.549 --> 01:00:00.559 align:start position:0%
even during the term
 
01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
i visited all the towns i
 
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
i took part in every
 
01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
candidate's night i went to
 
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
board meetings of the local boards i
 
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
also went to board meetings for the
 
01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:17.839 align:start position:0%
select board so that i knew the towns
 
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
better and i think that it's
 
01:00:22.309 --> 01:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
when i was representing
 
01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
the entire district i knew the district
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
much better
 
01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
part of my concerns or my biggest
 
01:00:30.789 --> 01:00:30.799 align:start position:0%
problem with this bill
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
is it is doing away with proportional
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
representation and
 
01:00:37.589 --> 01:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
proportional representation is basically
 
01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
what al almost all of our politics our
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
elections are based on with the
 
01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
exception of u.s senate
 
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
everything in new hampshire
 
01:00:49.109 --> 01:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
is based upon proportional
 
01:00:49.119 --> 01:00:50.870 align:start position:0%
is based upon proportional
representation

01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
representation
 
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to go through looking
 
01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:54.870 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to go through looking
at

01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
just the cooperative district that
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
that i live in and that the previous
 
01:01:01.349 --> 01:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
speaker also lives in
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
you would have
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
one person being elected
 
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
by 1700 people
 
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
and another person being elected by
 
01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
um forty seven hundred and you'd be
 
01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
representing forty seven hundred versus
 
01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
seventeen hundred
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
it uh it the proportionality really goes
 
01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
um really goes out the window
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
a couple of things that were mentioned
 
01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
by the last speaker
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
that you know shouldn't town be able to
 
01:01:32.549 --> 01:01:32.559 align:start position:0%
pick their own representation
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
and he specifically mentioned new fields
 
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
which is part of the six towns within
 
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
that district
 
01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
on the school board
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
the representative is required to be
 
01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
from newfields yes they're going to be
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
elected in all six towns but they're
 
01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
required to be in newfield
 
01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
new fields
 
01:01:55.109 --> 01:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
is if we look at the state house
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
new fields
 
01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
is in a district with new market
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
there is no requirement
 
01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
that one of the representation one of
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
the three reps that get elected from new
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
fields and new market have to be from
 
01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
new fields
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
so the way that the cooperative is set
 
01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
up is you know in effect more fair
 
01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
um he also represented uh talked about
 
01:02:24.069 --> 01:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
that county commissioners you know that
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
that this was sort of the same thing as
 
01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
county commissioners but it's it's not
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
even in the county that we're looking at
 
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
going to districts the districts are
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
based upon population
 
01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
and every 10 years you have to
 
01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
potentially reconfigure
 
01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:41.750 align:start position:0%
potentially reconfigure
the

01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
county commissioner districts to be
 
01:02:43.839 --> 01:02:46.950 align:start position:0%
county commissioner districts to be
proportional

01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
i think that's all i had to say
 
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
basically the um proportionality
 
01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:55.039 align:start position:0%
that part of it just really bothers me
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
and i said i have a lot of experience
 
01:02:59.430 --> 01:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
with a cooperative district i'd be
 
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
thank you and it's good to see you back
 
01:03:06.079 --> 01:03:07.430 align:start position:0%
thank you and it's good to see you back
here

01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.549 align:start position:0%
here
um

01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
just one uh do you think that this this
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
non-german amendment uh will make
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
cooperative districts
 
01:03:17.589 --> 01:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
more more cooperative or more
 
01:03:17.599 --> 01:03:21.430 align:start position:0%
more more cooperative or more
uncooperative

01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
you know i having served nine years on
 
01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
that board in three years on another
 
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
school board um i'm not sure that that
 
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
the method of picking people
 
01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
will make it more cooperative or
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
uncooperative there have been times i've
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
been on board so they've been extremely
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
cooperative and i've been
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
on boards
 
01:03:40.559 --> 01:03:41.750 align:start position:0%
on boards
when

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
it has been very
 
01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.190 align:start position:0%
it has been very
uncooperative

01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
uncooperative
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
and it hasn't been based upon which
 
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:03:58.630 --> 01:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
so if i understand your testimony is is
 
01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.069 align:start position:0%
so if i understand your testimony is is
that

01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
by with the current system that we have
 
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
that a candidate
 
01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:07.839 align:start position:0%
can understand
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
the full breadth of the cooperative
 
01:04:10.319 --> 01:04:11.750 align:start position:0%
the full breadth of the cooperative
issues

01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
by being elected and then having
 
01:04:18.549 --> 01:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
served with other districts by looking
 
01:04:18.559 --> 01:04:22.470 align:start position:0%
served with other districts by looking
at

01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
towns etc
 
01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
that you have a much broader perspective
 
01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
than just your own town if you're
 
01:04:30.549 --> 01:04:30.559 align:start position:0%
elected from just that town
 
01:04:32.789 --> 01:04:32.799 align:start position:0%
and feeling that you represent just that
 
01:04:32.799 --> 01:04:33.670 align:start position:0%
and feeling that you represent just that
town

01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
rather than the multiple towns that are
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
within a siu is that your testimony that
 
01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
is my testimony and you know it's it's a
 
01:04:42.789 --> 01:04:42.799 align:start position:0%
little bit similar to a floaterial i
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
guess i've
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
um tended to represent large
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh groups when uh when i was a member of
 
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
this body i was
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
actually from the largest floaterial in
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
the state i represented as a state house
 
01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:57.990 align:start position:0%
the state i represented as a state house
representative

01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
about 36 000 people
 
01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
i had
 
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
a pretty large four district four town
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
district and i represented
 
01:05:07.829 --> 01:05:07.839 align:start position:0%
you know all of the people but i think
 
01:05:07.839 --> 01:05:08.710 align:start position:0%
you know all of the people but i think
that

01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
where with the school board
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
you are you know you're representing you
 
01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
know that the six towns
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:05:18.069 --> 01:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
i think if you take a very parochial
 
01:05:19.589 --> 01:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
view that you're just representing your
 
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
town it it does the school board um a
 
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
disservice so i
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
i always felt i mean i know the first
 
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
time i decided to run for the co-op it's
 
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
like wow i gotta run in all six towns
 
01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:31.670 align:start position:0%
like wow i gotta run in all six towns
but

01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
i you know i i did it i went and met
 
01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
with people in all of the towns and
 
01:05:37.589 --> 01:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
during the nine years that i was on the
 
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
board i fielded questions
 
01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
from people from all six towns i i never
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
said to somebody who called me
 
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
that well why don't you call the rep
 
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
from you know the school board member
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
who lives in your town i
 
01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
spoke with any um
 
01:05:58.470 --> 01:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
any voter or any uh citizen
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
of the six towns so i i do feel like i
 
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
represented all of the all the towns and
 
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
i i cannot remember ever taking a a vote
 
01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
that i was thinking well how would this
 
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
be better for stratum it was
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
what what's best for the students and
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
if i may
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr thank you welcome back
 
01:06:29.029 --> 01:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
um so your testimony seemed to indicate
 
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
that the current system features
 
01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
generally satisfactory uh proportional
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
representation but i want to come back
 
01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
to my town of loudoun which i mentioned
 
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
earlier and which is on the sheet the
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
information yeah i haven't seen that
 
01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
but again as i pointed out uh earlier uh
 
01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
louden has about 40 percent of the
 
01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
population in uh sau 46 and it has 18
 
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
percent of school board now that doesn't
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
seem proportional to me could you speak
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
to how 40 i don't know how yours was set
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
up i mean when ours was set up about a
 
01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:05.839 align:start position:0%
little over 20 years maybe 24 years ago
 
01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
um and they can re you know they can
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
address it if the populations has really
 
01:07:10.079 --> 01:07:11.029 align:start position:0%
address it if the populations has really
changed

01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
changed
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
you know exeter got three seats stratham
 
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
got two and each of the others got one
 
01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:17.839 align:start position:0%
even though
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't if you were looking at um
 
01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
you know actual numbers new fields would
 
01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
have never been entitled to you know one
 
01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh one member one ninth because they
 
01:07:29.829 --> 01:07:29.839 align:start position:0%
were nowhere close to one-ninth of the
 
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
population but each of the towns
 
01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:34.670 align:start position:0%
population but each of the towns
got

01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
got
 
01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:36.390 align:start position:0%
got
representation

01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
representation
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
based originally on what kind of what
 
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
percent of the population they had and
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
it's in the charter they can if it
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
changes drastically it could potentially
 
01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
end up that
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
brentwood gets to
 
01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
and maybe exeter only gets two and
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
stratum gets to depending upon how the
 
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
population changes but
 
01:08:01.349 --> 01:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
you have to at least in the sau that
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh the cooperative board that i was
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
a member of and i
 
01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
will not say that i'm a expert on
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
anybody else's
 
01:08:12.549 --> 01:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
cooperative districts i mean it was set
 
01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
up that each town was ensured
 
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
that there would be somebody who is a
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
resident of that town that's on the
 
01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
board regardless of how small their
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
population may be
 
01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you to
 
01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:44.799 align:start position:0%
the committee for um
 
01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
for for letting me testify this morning
 
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:49.759 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry for being the one who pulled
 
01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
this from consent that is um you know
 
01:08:53.349 --> 01:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
kind of tossed us into the milestone of
 
01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
all of this so
 
01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
all of this so
um

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:54.930 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:56.470 align:start position:0%
um

01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
let me first say that i am an at large
 
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
board member in the governor wentworth
 
01:09:02.309 --> 01:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
regional uh school district i was
 
01:09:04.789 --> 01:09:04.799 align:start position:0%
elected this past march i mean i
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate all the work that the
 
01:09:08.149 --> 01:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
committee members have put into this and
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
some of the other members and it was
 
01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
not major concerns but some some i feel
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
as if legitimate concerns based on
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
either other state rsas or just based
 
01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
upon some of the issues that have been
 
01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
raised today which is how each school
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
district is very much different than
 
01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
every other school district especially
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
cooperative school districts you have
 
01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
cooperative school districts that range
 
01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
from you know having two towns all the
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
way up to you know as representative
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
moffat mentioned the very large
 
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
cooperative district that he was
 
01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
formerly a member of with campton you
 
01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
know about six or seven towns uh that
 
01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
can range from communities with 93
 
01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
people up to communities with you know
 
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
five six seven eight thousand people and
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
so this can make it kind of tough to try
 
01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
to create a one-size-fits-all solution
 
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
from the state government which you know
 
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
i've been in front of this committee
 
01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
when i've brought forward bills that
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
made that mistake
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
and half you know i'm happy that the
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
board rejected it you know i recognized
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
i aired in a way and so i'm hoping that
 
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
um that sorry the committee so i'm
 
01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
hoping that we can kind of go through
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
this and kind of discuss some of the
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
issues so starting on page one between
 
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
lines 12 and 14
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
the proposed removal of the language
 
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
from state rsa
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
would suggest to state for the first
 
01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
time as nullifying the bylaws and
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
articles of agreements for cooperative
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
school districts established prior to
 
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
august 22nd
 
01:10:27.719 --> 01:10:29.590 align:start position:0%
august 22nd
1971.

01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
1971.
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
at least to my understanding this is not
 
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
very orthodox for the state to do uh if
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
they do do it it's on very rare
 
01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:35.669 align:start position:0%
they do do it it's on very rare
occasions

01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
occasions
 
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
and um it's not very supportive local
 
01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:38.709 align:start position:0%
and um it's not very supportive local
controls

01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
controls
 
01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
over local issues between lines 15 and
 
01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
23 on page one we would be removing the
 
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
four current systems for electing school
 
01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
board members in all 40 plus cooperative
 
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
school districts in the state for
 
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
example governor wentworth regional
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
school district uses a system described
 
01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
on lines 21-23 i know the election
 
01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
system that some residents in the exeter
 
01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
region cooperative school district sau16
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
desire is described on lines 18 through
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
20. any voting resident the cooperative
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
school district can have this voting
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
system adopted by putting in a petition
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
warrant article signed by 10 percent of
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
the qualified voters and passing the
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
warrant the school board can also put a
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
warrant on the ballot to do this and as
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier and i'll get to it
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
later but on the top of page two
 
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
the section b that was already existing
 
01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
language any school board can go to the
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
to the um to the board of education and
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
get a change with approval of the board
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
of education so there's three kind of
 
01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
different ways for recourse for school
 
01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
districts to address the reapportionment
 
01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
and the apportionment of their school
 
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
board whether it's their districts if
 
01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
they have multiple districts or the
 
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
apportionment amongst the towns within
 
01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
one large district or amongst all the
 
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
districts within their school district a
 
01:11:51.669 --> 01:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
new section established on lines 24-30
 
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
sounds like a reasonable system and
 
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
seems legally identical to the system
 
01:11:58.149 --> 01:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
described in lines 18 through uh 20.
 
01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
however such a described system might
 
01:12:04.229 --> 01:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
not be possible as pursuant to rsa 195.
 
01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
in quotes quote pursuant to rsa 195 end
 
01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
quote as stated on line 30. it's because
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
cooperative school boards cannot exceed
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
50 members on the bro on their board per
 
01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
rsa1 and e5 colon 19-b this cap on board
 
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
members would make truly proportional
 
01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
representation nearly impossible as in
 
01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
each person's vote truly counting equal
 
01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:26.719 align:start position:0%
to another person's vote um this doesn't
 
01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
mean that would violate the one-person
 
01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
one-vote doctrine it just means that it
 
01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be as proportional it was
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
previously under a um a
 
01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
large district operating for the entire
 
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
district the current language and rsa
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
195 colon 19-b combined with the
 
01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
amendment to the amended rsa 195 colon
 
01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
19-a which is you know lines 24-30
 
01:12:50.709 --> 01:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
makes it impossible for rural corporate
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
school districts to abide by the one
 
01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
person one vote doctrine in some
 
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
specific instances as brought up by
 
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative moffett in the case of
 
01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
ellsworth with only 93 people be very
 
01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
difficult to give them one one board
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
member and then actually you know feels
 
01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
as if that's going to you know properly
 
01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
follow the one person one doctrine
 
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
system 93 people would get one member
 
01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
and to make it truly proportional you'd
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
have to make it so then every other town
 
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
you know for 93 people would get one
 
01:13:17.830 --> 01:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
board member we'd have more school board
 
01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
members and cooperative school boards in
 
01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
the 40 districts you know about 40
 
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
districts and we do state reps i think
 
01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
we have enough state reps i don't know
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
if we need any more cooperative school
 
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
board members
 
01:13:29.189 --> 01:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
there's also the issue in new hampshire
 
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
with disproportionate
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
representation which many have brought
 
01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
up today and an example is again you
 
01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
know i keep picking out representative
 
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
moffett but his school district the
 
01:13:38.709 --> 01:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
merrimack valley regional school
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
district with you know the two people in
 
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
each one his community having 45 percent
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
of the voters and 18 of the seats well
 
01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
one way that we've remedied that in
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
districts like for example that
 
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
ellsworth is in or in the governor
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
wentworth regional school district with
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
a small community like brookfield with
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
700 in a larger community like wolfeboro
 
01:13:57.669 --> 01:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
6400 was to say well let's make sure
 
01:13:59.189 --> 01:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
everyone's vote counts the same so we'll
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
put everyone in the same district and
 
01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
everyone will get the same voice in
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
electing all the members of the board
 
01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
who make all the decisions from taxation
 
01:14:08.709 --> 01:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
to education policy to how the buildings
 
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
are used to which municipalities are
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
allowed to use different school
 
01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
buildings on different days of the years
 
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
for example like voting which is a very
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
common issue we have in the towns of
 
01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
tuftonboro in new durham typically
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
school buildings need to be used and the
 
01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
school board needs to permit those
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities to use those buildings
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
on to page two lines one through three
 
01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
which already exist in state law i think
 
01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
there was some confusion on that that
 
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
already exists in state law minus a
 
01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
struck and out part the only part of
 
01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
state law that's being changed there is
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
they're striking out the um
 
01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
specifically the wording is
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
compatible with proportional
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
representation one-man one-vote
 
01:14:43.199 --> 01:14:44.630 align:start position:0%
representation one-man one-vote
principle

01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
principle
 
01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:47.189 align:start position:0%
principle
um

01:14:47.189 --> 01:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
so there are three concerns i kind of
 
01:14:50.229 --> 01:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
have with the zone it's because the
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
section is very much a blessing i think
 
01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
it's also
 
01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
it could create future issues i'm
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
surprised at this point it hasn't
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
created future issues because
 
01:14:58.159 --> 01:14:58.950 align:start position:0%
created future issues because
um

01:14:58.950 --> 01:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:59.830 --> 01:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
one it doesn't have a very
 
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
well-described system for how school
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
districts would apply to keep their
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
current election system as established
 
01:15:06.149 --> 01:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
in their bylaws and articles of
 
01:15:09.189 --> 01:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
agreement or as adopted per rsa 195
 
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
colon 22
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
in rsa 671 colon 9 which this
 
01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
legislation also addresses so there's
 
01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
not really a specific system i know that
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
you know the board chair after the word
 
01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
votes would petition to the department
 
01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
of education but there's no real
 
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
explanation of the scope of what and you
 
01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
know what kind of parameters the board
 
01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
of education would use it'd be very
 
01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
subjective based on kind of essentially
 
01:15:33.189 --> 01:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
the current governor's administration
 
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
and who they've put on there or previous
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
administrations and what kind of their
 
01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
um their goals are on the board of
 
01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:41.350 align:start position:0%
um their goals are on the board of
education

01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
my second concern is this recourse is
 
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
allowing school districts to keep their
 
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
election systems preserved which is
 
01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
great you know my school district would
 
01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
probably you know be one of the first to
 
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
to um to apply for such a uh for such a
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
um you know preservation but it also
 
01:15:57.430 --> 01:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
could be a loophole used to undermine
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
cooperative school districts um vote to
 
01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
for reapportionment so you could have a
 
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
school district that could reapportion
 
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
and this language basically would allow
 
01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
a school district to petition you know
 
01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
let's say someone put in a petition
 
01:16:10.229 --> 01:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
warrant to reinportion the districts and
 
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
all the voters approved it well
 
01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
theoretically now a school board after
 
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
that reinforcement can say
 
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
well actually the voters made a mistake
 
01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to go to the department of
 
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
um sorry to the board of education get a
 
01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:21.030 align:start position:0%
um sorry to the board of education get a
change

01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
it also could mean that even if you pass
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
this you know some of the issues that
 
01:16:26.229 --> 01:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
we're trying to address like for example
 
01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
in the school district that represent
 
01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
moffett is from his school board could
 
01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
go to the um to the board of education
 
01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
and say
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
you know the state legislature made a
 
01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
mistake i mean you may end up having 40
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
plus cooperative school districts that
 
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
are going to go all basically nullify
 
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
what the legislature just did or at this
 
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
point now it's kind of being brought to
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
light i think they could nullify a
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
petition warren which i think is the
 
01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
best way to address this kind of concern
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
an issue if your school board isn't
 
01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
properly addressing it if you live in a
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
community with either disproportionate
 
01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
representation where you feel your
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
community isn't getting a proper voice
 
01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
on your school board
 
01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
um the fourth kind of one i know i said
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
only had three but i actually have four
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
is we also have the issue that will
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
depend on unelected state board to make
 
01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
these decisions rather than voters and
 
01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
districts and that's my biggest concern
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
of kind of those four
 
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
listed concerns regarding that section
 
01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
is how it currently works is the voters
 
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
are the ones who make the ultimate
 
01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
approval over this election system and
 
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
how they're going to elect the board and
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
how it's ultimately going to operate
 
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
because how you elect your board is very
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
determinative of what kind of culture
 
01:17:23.669 --> 01:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
your school district has your
 
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
cooperative school district and if
 
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
you're going to see all this power to
 
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
state legislators which will turn into a
 
01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
partisan issue all of a sudden if we're
 
01:17:32.709 --> 01:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
going to seat it to an unelected board i
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
don't think that does it justice to our
 
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
constituents at least not my
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
constituents in the governor wentworth
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
regional school district
 
01:17:42.630 --> 01:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
i'm also on page two on lines 9-13 i
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate the amendment giving
 
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
cooperative school districts some
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
control over the transition process this
 
01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
was a huge concern that the school
 
01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
boards association brought up in the
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
previous bill house bill 1646 and
 
01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
allowing for this transition process is
 
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
you know let's say um it's a good part
 
01:17:59.910 --> 01:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
of of this kind of solution um and this
 
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
new section does give school districts
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
the ability to prepare if the amendment
 
01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
actually becomes law because that was a
 
01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
huge issue too i mean at least we'll get
 
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
five years rather than being thrown
 
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
right into it having to solve it on our
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
own now my other issue though is the
 
01:18:14.229 --> 01:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
fact that each school board is going to
 
01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
have to create its own plan without a
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
lot of guidance
 
01:18:18.630 --> 01:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
right it's kind of tough i mean our
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
school board has elected this our board
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
members the same way since we
 
01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
established a district in 1963.
 
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
prior to this you know much of the state
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
statute even existing right and then the
 
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
state statute came about we already you
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
know by chance used one of the election
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
systems as described in rsa 195 colon
 
01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
19-a but it would be a huge change for
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
our district and you know also the um
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
our founding documents for this district
 
01:18:44.229 --> 01:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
to completely change our election system
 
01:18:46.229 --> 01:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
overnight without any approval from our
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
voters without any kind of um you know
 
01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
concerns i've never heard a concern
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
brought up in my community about how
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
we've elected our board members
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
i didn't even know that it was much of a
 
01:18:58.229 --> 01:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
concern elsewhere until house bill 1646
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
came across
 
01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
my eyes the last bit of change
 
01:19:04.149 --> 01:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
proposed to this section of rsa is on
 
01:19:07.189 --> 01:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
lines 19-23 it makes sense to apply this
 
01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
requirement if we plan on ensuring every
 
01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
cooperative school district has proper
 
01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
proportional representation if you know
 
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
that's the ultimate goal of the bill and
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
even if that's not possible for some
 
01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
cooperative school districts in this
 
01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
proposed system which i think there are
 
01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
some districts that quite frankly they
 
01:19:21.669 --> 01:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to have proper
 
01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
proportional representation if this went
 
01:19:24.709 --> 01:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
into law
 
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
um now just kind of three i have a few
 
01:19:29.189 --> 01:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
comments on that you know after walking
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
through the bill is um my first thing is
 
01:19:33.189 --> 01:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
i'm a little bit confused as to why
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
we're taking away the power and the
 
01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
flexibility of cooperative school
 
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
districts to choose their
 
01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
apportionment and have voters approve
 
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
proposed reapportionments to me it seems
 
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
undemocratic and antithetical to the
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
local control that we pride in the state
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire rather than allowing
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
voters and cooperative school districts
 
01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
to make these choices we'll have state
 
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
lawmakers most of whom are not from
 
01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
cooperative school districts make the
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
choice for communities like mine
 
01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
cooperative school districts and their
 
01:19:59.669 --> 01:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
voters will probably forever lose their
 
01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
control over reapportionment which to me
 
01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
has never been something the state of
 
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire likes to do is to take
 
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
away this kind of power from communities
 
01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
i think there's also um my concern also
 
01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
is the fact that we change the rules for
 
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
over 40 cooperative school districts
 
01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
when no school board has officially
 
01:20:22.149 --> 01:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
taken a stance of the need to have the
 
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
state law change no cooperative school
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
board has asked the state to do this
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
i very like i said i've never heard
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
anyone in wolfeboro my district ever
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
complain about how this uh current
 
01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:34.229 align:start position:0%
complain about how this uh current
system

01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:20:34.239 --> 01:20:35.270 align:start position:0%
system
works

01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
works
 
01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
um and even more there already is
 
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
recourse which is probably why school
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
boards have never gone to the state
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
right in the state law as you know i
 
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
just kind of you know explained is if
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
you want to put in a petition warrant or
 
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
your school would want to make the
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
change or your school board wants to go
 
01:20:51.669 --> 01:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
to the to the um board of education
 
01:20:53.669 --> 01:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
you can make those changes
 
01:20:53.679 --> 01:20:55.510 align:start position:0%
you can make those changes
um

01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
i think kind of the the last thing too
 
01:20:58.709 --> 01:20:58.719 align:start position:0%
and i took down some notes based on what
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
people had said was um
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
we have to remember too each board
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
is distinctly different some school
 
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
districts right like to have an entire
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
district elect board members because the
 
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
board should advocate for the entire
 
01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
district as you know the honorable
 
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
lovejoy representative lombjoy mentioned
 
01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
for example in our governor wentworth
 
01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
regional school district board i have to
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
sign a document every year affirming the
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
ethics policy the ethics policy is very
 
01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
explicit i can't speak for the board i
 
01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
can't speak you know before we kind of
 
01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
make a decision on something or you know
 
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
try to do things unilaterally even more
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
when i do anything on the board or the
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
board acts we have to act as a whole and
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
for the entire community i can't act on
 
01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
behalf of wolfeboro i'm an at-large
 
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
member but even still i couldn't say you
 
01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
know even if i was the member from
 
01:21:43.990 --> 01:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
wolfeboro the member from effingham or
 
01:21:45.669 --> 01:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
the member from brookfield it's very
 
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
clear in our ethics policy which is
 
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
binding which can get you censored or
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
even removed from the board for
 
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
violating if you're trying to act on
 
01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
behalf of just one community
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
right the board has a whole process of
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
how they kind of you know maybe do an
 
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
investigation decide what they're going
 
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
to do with the member who is violating
 
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
the ethics policy which has 15 points
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
which is on our um our school district's
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
website so i have a fear that um by
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
making it so then our school district
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
can no longer have one at-large district
 
01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
that elects all our members that we
 
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
would end up creating more sectionalism
 
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
which is already a huge issue that we
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
have in our school district is trying to
 
01:22:21.189 --> 01:22:21.199 align:start position:0%
make it so that people are more unified
 
01:22:22.629 --> 01:22:22.639 align:start position:0%
going in one direction rather than
 
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
pitting towns against each other because
 
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
we're trying we have one common goal
 
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
we're trying to improve public education
 
01:22:29.189 --> 01:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
for every student who goes to the
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
governor wentworth regional school
 
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
district who chooses that's the best
 
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
i think the other thing to remember too
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
is we shouldn't eliminate at-large
 
01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
members from communities for example as
 
01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned by a previous speaker he
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
talked about the governor wentworth
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
regional school district um currently
 
01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
wolfeboro despite having three at-large
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
members on our governor wentworth
 
01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
regional school district we only have
 
01:22:52.629 --> 01:22:52.639 align:start position:0%
two seats right two residents of
 
01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
wolfeboro in seats one in an at-large
 
01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
seat one in a wolfeboro seat
 
01:22:59.110 --> 01:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
if this was adopted and if we couldn't
 
01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639 align:start position:0%
get any recourse from the board of
 
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
education would end up happening with
 
01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
our three at-large seats is
 
01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
essentially two of them would just go to
 
01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
wolfeboro and one of them would go to
 
01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
ossipee the two biggest towns so the
 
01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
bill actually in many ways this
 
01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
amendment i should say
 
01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
would have the exact opposite effect on
 
01:23:16.470 --> 01:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
our community it would end up giving
 
01:23:18.629 --> 01:23:18.639 align:start position:0%
wolfeboro a guaranteed disproportionate
 
01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
voice in ossipee too so theoretically if
 
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
the three wolfeboro members and the two
 
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
ospie members the biggest towns at any
 
01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
time decide to change anything they
 
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
would out rule the other
 
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
four towns which to me is concerning i
 
01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
don't i don't want that to happen in my
 
01:23:34.629 --> 01:23:34.639 align:start position:0%
school district which is why this kind
 
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
of issue is such a um
 
01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
it's not a sensitive issue but it's a
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
complex issue there's a lot of working
 
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
parts when you have 40 different
 
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
cooperative school boards
 
01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
it's kind of tough to create a
 
01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all solution that's going
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
to actually address the culture and the
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
needs of every cooperative school
 
01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:50.229 align:start position:0%
needs of every cooperative school
district

01:23:50.229 --> 01:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:23:52.629 --> 01:23:52.639 align:start position:0%
um i think that's
 
01:23:54.870 --> 01:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
it for all my notes
 
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
but i would be more than thank you very
 
01:23:58.149 --> 01:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
much are there any questions for
 
01:23:58.159 --> 01:24:00.709 align:start position:0%
much are there any questions for
representatives

01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:00.719 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative nelson
 
01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman having been in
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
that small town living in the small town
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
brookfield where there are only 800
 
01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:10.550 align:start position:0%
brookfield where there are only 800
people

01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
which are you say you were my shoes and
 
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
you had 800 people in your town
 
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
do you think and let's make believe
 
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
they're all one party or the other you
 
01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
know they're very conservative town or a
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
very liberal town in their views should
 
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
they be able to have a say at a school
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
board meeting that represents their town
 
01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
you mean the town of brookfield should
 
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
they have let's make that one in town to
 
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
grow people yeah they do they have uh
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
do all people get to vote on that like
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
the people who may be in a very liberal
 
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
all the other towns are liberal or
 
01:24:42.070 --> 01:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
conservative should they pick
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
brookfield's representative
 
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
the way that we voted in our school
 
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
district that's what the voters wanted
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
when they first started the school
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
district in 1963. follow up mr chairman
 
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
yes you think that's fair i mean if i
 
01:24:59.110 --> 01:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
was somebody that was very let's say
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
liberal or whatever word you want to use
 
01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
should the other towns that are very
 
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
conservative block me from ever saying
 
01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
anything because they're all one
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
well i thought should i be able to speak
 
01:25:11.669 --> 01:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
something and give my opinion because i
 
01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
represented little tiny brookfield well
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
i actually in many ways i agree with the
 
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
core tenants and philosophically with
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
what you're saying i just have an issue
 
01:25:22.709 --> 01:25:22.719 align:start position:0%
with the state being the main arbitrator
 
01:25:24.229 --> 01:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
of such and taking away that voice from
 
01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
the voters um and i can understand the
 
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
concern though that you know what would
 
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
happen if you put a petition warrant in
 
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
a town like you know let's say a larger
 
01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
town like wolfeboro without rule the
 
01:25:35.189 --> 01:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
other towns that i mean that's that is a
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
legitimate concern but i think again
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
in a democracy in when when we elect and
 
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
when we make decisions on petition
 
01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
warrants it's it's on us the burdens on
 
01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
us people who feel maybe like the way
 
01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
that you and i feel represented nelson
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
to go to the voters and to explain why
 
01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
this system's better for our school
 
01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
district now i'm not entirely sure that
 
01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
system would be the best way for our
 
01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
school district to go forward um i
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't oppose though a position
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
weren't being put in and you know i
 
01:26:03.030 --> 01:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
would have to really look at it and say
 
01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
is this going to be what's best for our
 
01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
school district
 
01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:26:09.990 --> 01:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
representative uh des we know that
 
01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
there's a number of cooperatives out
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
there 30 32 of them
 
01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
that have not looked at their agreements
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
in many many years
 
01:26:21.870 --> 01:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
some dating back to
 
01:26:26.310 --> 01:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
1963 64 some even going further back
 
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
but the apportionment issue
 
01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
do you agree that in this bill on the
 
01:26:34.149 --> 01:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
very bottom section there 20 through 24
 
01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
on page two is needed where every 10
 
01:26:42.229 --> 01:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
years apportionment would be looked at
 
01:26:44.629 --> 01:26:44.639 align:start position:0%
based upon the census
 
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
of the the us census
 
01:26:50.550 --> 01:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
rather than just continuing as is based
 
01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
upon what happened back in 1960 when
 
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
demographics were different
 
01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:56.229 align:start position:0%
demographics were different
the

01:26:56.229 --> 01:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:58.229 --> 01:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
the economic power of these various
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
communities has changed significantly
 
01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
and that's another issue which is
 
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
in the co-op districts is this uh you
 
01:27:07.110 --> 01:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
know apportionment based upon
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
adm is it based upon total census is it
 
01:27:13.189 --> 01:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
based upon some combination of with
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
the assessment values of in those
 
01:27:17.189 --> 01:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
particular communities
 
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
so do we need to have
 
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
a good healthy look at and do you
 
01:27:23.910 --> 01:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
support this aspect the bottom several
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
lines there of this bill where we'd have
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
to apportion every 10 years based upon
 
01:27:31.350 --> 01:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
census results yeah
 
01:27:32.470 --> 01:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
you know and like i said i think that
 
01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
makes perfect sense with the bill's
 
01:27:35.189 --> 01:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
ultimate and trying to make things
 
01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
proportional i
 
01:27:38.790 --> 01:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
you know and i think even um
 
01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
you know i wouldn't i certainly wouldn't
 
01:27:42.070 --> 01:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
be opposed i think it's good language i
 
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
mean i mentioned you know that language
 
01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
would 100 be necessary for this bill to
 
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
work i think it'd be good just in
 
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
general i think districts should be
 
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
looking at this more often i think it
 
01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
makes more than enough sense that you
 
01:27:53.830 --> 01:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
know a district being forced to look at
 
01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
this to put it to the voters and to have
 
01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
the voters reaffirm it and the voters
 
01:27:59.270 --> 01:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
don't then obviously a board says well
 
01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:00.639 align:start position:0%
we have an issue if people aren't happy
 
01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
with our election system as it currently
 
01:28:04.629 --> 01:28:04.639 align:start position:0%
is um i think the only the only thing
 
01:28:06.070 --> 01:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
though is whether or not you would need
 
01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
to require it also for school districts
 
01:28:09.510 --> 01:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
that elect their members at large
 
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
because technically they're properly
 
01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:12.950 align:start position:0%
because technically they're properly
reapportioned

01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
reapportioned
 
01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
right so i mean that could be something
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
that you could go into and say that
 
01:28:17.430 --> 01:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
every district has to look at it whether
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
or not they have an at-large
 
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
district you know even districts sorry
 
01:28:24.070 --> 01:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
even school boards
 
01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
even saus operating with one at-large
 
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
district that also need to reapportion
 
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
even though technically we're properly
 
01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
reapportioned i mean that's part of the
 
01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
benefit in a rural district where it's
 
01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
kind of tough to make sure everyone's
 
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
vote is equal is when it's one at-large
 
01:28:37.750 --> 01:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
district i know my vote counts the same
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
as anyone else's vote from any community
 
01:28:42.070 --> 01:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
no matter the size right it's one vote
 
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
one vote when i vote for school board i
 
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
vote for what's going to be best not for
 
01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
wolfeboro but what's going to be best
 
01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
for all six towns and for the entire
 
01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
school district and what's going to
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
serve mostly i think about what's going
 
01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
to serve taxpayers best you know in all
 
01:28:58.629 --> 01:28:58.639 align:start position:0%
six towns so you know i think sometimes
 
01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's kind of tough to always assume that
 
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
every person casting a vote is casting
 
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
it just because
 
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
they have a specific interest for their
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
town but i definitely agree with you
 
01:29:08.709 --> 01:29:08.719 align:start position:0%
though mr chairman i think looking at
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
this every at least 10 years and
 
01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
requesting school districts reapportion
 
01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
and even more you know
 
01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
having school districts update these
 
01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
kinds of agreements right especially in
 
01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
the case you know that we keep pointing
 
01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
out of representative moffat school
 
01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
district where that doesn't seem fair at
 
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
all to me that one town has more than 40
 
01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
percent of the population but only 18
 
01:29:29.669 --> 01:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
percent of the voice on a school board
 
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
which i think that's kind of the
 
01:29:33.430 --> 01:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
the biggest thing that this bill should
 
01:29:35.669 --> 01:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
address or this amendment is making sure
 
01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
that every single
 
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
vote is equal to every single other one
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
when casting a ballot in a cooperative
 
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
school district
 
01:29:45.189 --> 01:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
i think that matters a lot
 
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
representative luna
 
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thank you
 
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
very much representative duchess for uh
 
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh joining us this morning um
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh just to your your your prior comment
 
01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
with regards to
 
01:29:59.830 --> 01:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
the um the
 
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
reapportionment language in um in
 
01:30:06.550 --> 01:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
section three of the uh the amendment um
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
if that were to apply to existing
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
the the existing four methods
 
01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:14.719 align:start position:0%
listed in roman one two three and four
 
01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
on page one uh that that reapportionment
 
01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:18.709 align:start position:0%
on page one uh that that reapportionment
part

01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:30:21.110 --> 01:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
would would apply to roman two in roman
 
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
three is that correct because those
 
01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:29.669 --> 01:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
and continue
 
01:30:31.030 --> 01:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
with what you were saying
 
01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
if you're voting out large yeah i know i
 
01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
i agree with you but i think what the
 
01:30:36.149 --> 01:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
what the chairman was kind of alluding
 
01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
to is the fact that forcing school
 
01:30:40.149 --> 01:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
districts that do elect at large to kind
 
01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
of take a close look at it if it's
 
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
really serving what's best for their
 
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
cooperative and their voters which i
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
think is a i think that's more than a
 
01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
fair way to kind of look at it and to i
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
think it's more than fair to you know
 
01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
for school boards to appeal to their
 
01:30:53.910 --> 01:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
voters again especially considering for
 
01:30:55.669 --> 01:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
example i mentioned my school district
 
01:30:57.189 --> 01:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
hasn't updated its voting system since
 
01:30:59.430 --> 01:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
we established in 1963.
 
01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
i think it's more than i'm going to
 
01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
interject here for a second because what
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
chairman lab was driving at okay is that
 
01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
current law says
 
01:31:09.910 --> 01:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
you may apportion you may
 
01:31:12.790 --> 01:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
there's no oversight and requirement
 
01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
that every 10 years you shall apportion
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
and that's my concern that there could
 
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
be a larger district that's satisfied
 
01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
the way things are but there's other
 
01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
districts which are growing
 
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
and there's
 
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
a disregard for taking on that topic of
 
01:31:30.550 --> 01:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
apportioning because somebody's going to
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
lose votes
 
01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:33.270 align:start position:0%
lose votes
so

01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
it's a complicated thing yeah thank you
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
for thank you for clarifying and i would
 
01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
agree with that and to follow up on that
 
01:31:41.030 --> 01:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh mr chair so uh so to representative
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
nelson's concern
 
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
um would uh would another option you
 
01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
know out of existing law be viable
 
01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
to uh to ensure that uh that um that may
 
01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
be a small town that may be politically
 
01:31:59.430 --> 01:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
different than than other member towns
 
01:32:01.110 --> 01:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
of the of the co-op
 
01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:02.470 align:start position:0%
of the of the co-op
um

01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
has a has a vote like for instance would
 
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
would roman 3 under the current options
 
01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:09.430 align:start position:0%
would roman 3 under the current options
um

01:32:09.430 --> 01:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:10.830 align:start position:0%
um
possibly

01:32:10.830 --> 01:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
01:32:16.709 --> 01:32:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean i i think i think the way
 
01:32:21.030 --> 01:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
that the law was originally written to
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding
 
01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
i believe this section of 195 is either
 
01:32:28.229 --> 01:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
from the 90s or it's from earlier in the
 
01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
early 70s kind of right around the time
 
01:32:31.350 --> 01:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
when a lot of these cooperative school
 
01:32:33.030 --> 01:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
districts like mine were being created
 
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
but kind of the idea of what the four
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
systems currently established
 
01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
are was to give
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
school districts i mean this is a lot of
 
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
latitude these four kinds of systems are
 
01:32:44.790 --> 01:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
you know broadly they're kind of the
 
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
four main ways that most um
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
municipalities are kind of electing
 
01:32:50.709 --> 01:32:50.719 align:start position:0%
members of across you know new england
 
01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
and everything so i i think there's a
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of flexibility in the
 
01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
current statute um but i that's not to
 
01:32:59.110 --> 01:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
say that i don't hear the concerns that
 
01:33:01.189 --> 01:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
are brought up by folks and by you know
 
01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
the people bringing forward this
 
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
amendment it's just to say who should be
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
the ultimate arbitrator
 
01:33:06.239 --> 01:33:07.110 align:start position:0%
the ultimate arbitrator
of

01:33:07.110 --> 01:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
making the choice between these three
 
01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
different um these three different
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
styles of apportionment i've always felt
 
01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
it pretty strongly
 
01:33:17.430 --> 01:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
that it should be the voters who elected
 
01:33:19.350 --> 01:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
the members of the boards and the voters
 
01:33:20.709 --> 01:33:20.719 align:start position:0%
who are the ones who live in that
 
01:33:22.709 --> 01:33:22.719 align:start position:0%
district who pay the taxes there that it
 
01:33:24.629 --> 01:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
should be ultimately them and you know
 
01:33:25.830 --> 01:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
it's just one of those things where i
 
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
know i may have upset some people and
 
01:33:29.669 --> 01:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
kick the bees nest and you know kind of
 
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
bring this up and kind of even
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
testifying here but it's something i
 
01:33:34.629 --> 01:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
feel very strongly about so great thank
 
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you very much
 
01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:40.870 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
um when these cooperative school
 
01:33:44.310 --> 01:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
districts were first formed and they
 
01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
were actually uh state sponsored at that
 
01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
time to try to make school districts in
 
01:33:50.719 --> 01:33:51.590 align:start position:0%
time to try to make school districts in
like

01:33:51.590 --> 01:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
effing effingham be a little bit more
 
01:33:56.790 --> 01:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
efficient uh
 
01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
by combining towns together um
 
01:34:02.790 --> 01:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
that they were trying to keep um
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
the feeling of and i think you talked
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
about culture and community the local
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
culture and community that is inherent
 
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
in our um school system whether it's a
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
community or whether it's a cooperative
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
district and so in a in a community uh
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
of a school district whether it's a
 
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
separate town like if wolfeboro was its
 
01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
own town
 
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that town have
 
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
sections of the town that would be
 
01:34:31.110 --> 01:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
conservative and sections of the town
 
01:34:34.229 --> 01:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
that might be liberal and that joining
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
together as the local education
 
01:34:39.510 --> 01:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
association or as a as the elected
 
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
school board don't they represent
 
01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
both those factions and so
 
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
the cooperative districts aren't they
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
just a
 
01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:48.470 align:start position:0%
just a
larger

01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
larger
 
01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
reflection of that
 
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
well i can i can speak to my board i
 
01:34:56.229 --> 01:34:56.239 align:start position:0%
know my board has republicans democrats
 
01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
and undeclared voters on it but when we
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
ultimately look at
 
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
you know when i say republicans it is
 
01:35:03.510 --> 01:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
plural i'm not the only republican on
 
01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
that board i know that for a fact but um
 
01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
when when we look at um
 
01:35:11.189 --> 01:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
when we look at these issues i mean i
 
01:35:14.470 --> 01:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
can't bring my partisanship into it
 
01:35:15.990 --> 01:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
i have to look objectively of what's
 
01:35:18.070 --> 01:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
best for the school district so i i see
 
01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
you're kind of what your question is is
 
01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
is it not true that whether it's one
 
01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
town or you know multiple towns that
 
01:35:25.270 --> 01:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
there's interest you know partisan
 
01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
interest that people have that reflect
 
01:35:29.830 --> 01:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
national issues or state issues that
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
they project on some of the local school
 
01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
issues i mean that's true and they're
 
01:35:35.189 --> 01:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
members of the board who also kind of
 
01:35:36.709 --> 01:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
bring up those concerns too but i think
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
ultimately especially in our school
 
01:35:40.229 --> 01:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
district we try to distance ourselves
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
from that to try to make it so then
 
01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
these these kinds of issues that we're
 
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
talking about with public education are
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
less partisan and that every member of
 
01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
the board and the more abort as a whole
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
could be more approachable right i mean
 
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's kind of our ultimate goal but i
 
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
think the biggest thing that you touched
 
01:35:57.910 --> 01:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
upon though that it's important is um
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
the cooperative school districts and how
 
01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
big of a benefit they are to big and
 
01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
small towns right being able to pull
 
01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
resources for example i wouldn't be able
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
to take ap classes and college classes
 
01:36:08.149 --> 01:36:08.159 align:start position:0%
if it wasn't for the cooperative school
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
district because we wouldn't have enough
 
01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
students to run those classes and be
 
01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
able to take those tests and everything
 
01:36:14.470 --> 01:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
so that's a huge benefit of why the
 
01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
governor of the regional school district
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
was you know able to really set me up
 
01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
for success and to give choice right and
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
a whole host of electives that i was
 
01:36:22.709 --> 01:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
able to take because we have more
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
students and more resources but um even
 
01:36:25.679 --> 01:36:26.470 align:start position:0%
students and more resources but um even
more

01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:26.740 align:start position:0%
more
um

01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:26.750 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:28.550 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
the the point is that we're one
 
01:36:32.229 --> 01:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
community and we don't want to be six
 
01:36:33.510 --> 01:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
different towns that just so happen to
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
be pooling resources together fighting
 
01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
over all those resources are used we
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
want to be one community working
 
01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
together to keep improving public
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
education in that area making it a
 
01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
viable option for every family
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative woodcock
 
01:36:50.470 --> 01:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman i'm not sure if this
 
01:36:52.229 --> 01:36:52.239 align:start position:0%
is for representative de shays or for
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
you um welcome back to the chance thank
 
01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
you uh i was going back to your comment
 
01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
rather than land on the section 20
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
line two
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
page two 21 through 24
 
01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
and comparing it to what i heard
 
01:37:07.510 --> 01:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
represent the shade asking for if i
 
01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
understand this correctly and
 
01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
it may not be correct i'm asking if i
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
understand this correctly when you get
 
01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
down the line 21
 
01:37:16.629 --> 01:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
and 22
 
01:37:20.070 --> 01:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
that says that it will be reapportioned
 
01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
it will be reapportioned after every
 
01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:23.270 align:start position:0%
it will be reapportioned after every
census

01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
census
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
so that that would eliminate the
 
01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:27.270 align:start position:0%
so that that would eliminate the
at-large

01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
at-large
 
01:37:30.870 --> 01:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
depends upon if you're referencing back
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
to statute as it is right now
 
01:37:38.709 --> 01:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
um as statute is right now
 
01:37:40.470 --> 01:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
just prior to the
 
01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
added part you're looking at the
 
01:37:43.590 --> 01:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
sentence above it says
 
01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:44.709 align:start position:0%
sentence above it says
may

01:37:44.709 --> 01:37:44.719 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:37:47.590 --> 01:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
re you know and that may is something
 
01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:48.470 align:start position:0%
re you know and that may is something
which

01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:37:50.149 --> 01:37:50.159 align:start position:0%
i would have to go back and look it's
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
very difficult to look at all these 30
 
01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
co-ops and get a hold of them some of
 
01:37:55.510 --> 01:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
them it's i don't even know if you can
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
find the darn agreements
 
01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
but have they reapportioned
 
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:00.950 align:start position:0%
but have they reapportioned
i

01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
i i can't venture but i would say
 
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
there's some that really haven't
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
in fact some we we got craziness out
 
01:38:09.510 --> 01:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
there in terms of membership in these
 
01:38:12.790 --> 01:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
co-ops my district has two two districts
 
01:38:14.830 --> 01:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
within it but they're not school
 
01:38:17.590 --> 01:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
districts one is a precinct
 
01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
within the town that so
 
01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of dynamics to why
 
01:38:23.189 --> 01:38:23.199 align:start position:0%
that occurred
 
01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
this could be taken care of if every 10
 
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
years you had to look at this issue
 
01:38:31.669 --> 01:38:31.679 align:start position:0%
in regard to everything that preceded it
 
01:38:34.149 --> 01:38:34.159 align:start position:0%
on page one that's been wiped out or
 
01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
whatever or whatever's going to be there
 
01:38:38.550 --> 01:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh i i think it's a good idea that we do
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
have some overarching oversight that you
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
will look at this
 
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
co-ops every 10 years because there's no
 
01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
guarantee that they're going to do it
 
01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
especially if it's controlled by one or
 
01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:51.910 align:start position:0%
especially if it's controlled by one or
two

01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
districts within that co-op to have the
 
01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:54.870 align:start position:0%
districts within that co-op to have the
votes

01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
votes
 
01:38:57.189 --> 01:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
and the bottom line in all this is not
 
01:38:59.030 --> 01:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
always the well-being of student it's
 
01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
what's coming out of my pocketbook
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
and and and the economics and the
 
01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
assessed property values etc so i i
 
01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
think we're looking at a huge topic here
 
01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's very complex probably the best
 
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
bill we ever had here was to get rid of
 
01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:12.790 align:start position:0%
bill we ever had here was to get rid of
maul

01:39:12.790 --> 01:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
maul
 
01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
and and start from scratch and
 
01:39:16.709 --> 01:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli presented that
 
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
earlier and of course we nixed that
 
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh so just clever okay go ahead
 
01:39:24.149 --> 01:39:24.159 align:start position:0%
wherever that represent life yeah
 
01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
clarification but with the striking of
 
01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:27.510 align:start position:0%
clarification but with the striking of
may

01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh and the inclusion of the way 20
 
01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
through 22 is written
 
01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:33.430 align:start position:0%
through 22 is written
it

01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
basically says it will reapportion
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
there's no more me it's not an option
 
01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
you will
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
be reapportioned it doesn't have to be
 
01:39:42.070 --> 01:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
every 10 years would be less frequently
 
01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:42.870 align:start position:0%
every 10 years would be less frequently
but

01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
you will at least every 10 years
 
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
reapportion so if you reapportion that
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
means that would eliminate by
 
01:39:49.669 --> 01:39:49.679 align:start position:0%
understanding correctly that would
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
eliminate any at large options
 
01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
shall review it to apportion means are
 
01:39:58.709 --> 01:39:58.719 align:start position:0%
we going to go ahead and go ahead with
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
change i get that change may not be
 
01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:01.990 align:start position:0%
change i get that change may not be
necessary

01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:40:04.229 --> 01:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
on line 21
 
01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
the fourth word from the end it says and
 
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
reapportioned if necessary based upon
 
01:40:10.709 --> 01:40:10.719 align:start position:0%
the sensitivity okay that yeah that's
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
and of course
 
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
that means law if necessary is not there
 
01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
i know but that's in the amendment we're
 
01:40:17.109 --> 01:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
talking about so back to my point that
 
01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
means that'll be gone right
 
01:40:21.189 --> 01:40:21.199 align:start position:0%
well i think we're getting into what we
 
01:40:22.870 --> 01:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
should be doing in executive session
 
01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:23.750 align:start position:0%
should be doing in executive session
here

01:40:23.750 --> 01:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:40:27.189 --> 01:40:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
do you mind if i answer your question
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
not me i have to go through the chairman
 
01:40:33.270 --> 01:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
i think i think what we'll do is we'll
 
01:40:35.590 --> 01:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
we'll address that yeah when we get to
 
01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
exactly i don't know if it's i don't
 
01:40:38.790 --> 01:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
know if it's really because you're
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
asking boards like i could imagine my
 
01:40:43.109 --> 01:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
board would review it revise an update
 
01:40:44.709 --> 01:40:44.719 align:start position:0%
but our review revised an update with an
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
at-large district might just be well we
 
01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
reviewed we still have an at-large
 
01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
district and everything is properly
 
01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
apportioned there's nothing to really
 
01:40:55.270 --> 01:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
revise and there's no update you know so
 
01:40:57.109 --> 01:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
i mean i guess it kind of depends on how
 
01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
you might construe it i can see how
 
01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
you're looking at it but how i think my
 
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
board would look at it would be
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
we feel as if it works and we'd you know
 
01:41:06.070 --> 01:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
resubmit it i don't know if we'd have to
 
01:41:08.310 --> 01:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
put it to the voters but i assume maybe
 
01:41:10.470 --> 01:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
but i think that's fine thank you um are
 
01:41:11.669 --> 01:41:11.679 align:start position:0%
there any other questions for
 
01:41:13.510 --> 01:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative shea we do have one more
 
01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
pink card here to go through
 
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
representative litchfield
 
01:41:18.550 --> 01:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
question i have a part a and a part b um
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
it sounds like your board does work very
 
01:41:26.229 --> 01:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
well together i'm just curious
 
01:41:27.669 --> 01:41:27.679 align:start position:0%
how long have you been on the board how
 
01:41:29.910 --> 01:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
many board meetings have you been to
 
01:41:32.229 --> 01:41:32.239 align:start position:0%
so i've been to now two board meetings i
 
01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
previously served as a student member
 
01:41:35.590 --> 01:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
for an entire year i've watched the
 
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
meetings for about three years straight
 
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
whether it was on youtube or in person
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
um i formally i mean you know my
 
01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
girlfriend's mother was a chair of the
 
01:41:44.229 --> 01:41:44.239 align:start position:0%
board for 10 years i've been with my
 
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
girlfriend for seven um
 
01:41:48.629 --> 01:41:48.639 align:start position:0%
so i'm just gonna stop so well i'm just
 
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
saying i have a lot of familiarity with
 
01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
our board
 
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:57.430 --> 01:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
i love you my dad's a doctor i can't
 
01:41:59.350 --> 01:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
deliver a baby but he could
 
01:42:02.629 --> 01:42:02.639 align:start position:0%
um do you support the electoral college
 
01:42:02.639 --> 01:42:04.470 align:start position:0%
um do you support the electoral college
yeah

01:42:04.470 --> 01:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:42:06.310 --> 01:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
do you feel this is any different
 
01:42:08.709 --> 01:42:08.719 align:start position:0%
yes i do okay i don't think we're on the
 
01:42:10.629 --> 01:42:10.639 align:start position:0%
topic of this right now we're on
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
cooperative school boards there's a lot
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
of dynamics in the governance of our
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
country yeah
 
01:42:15.119 --> 01:42:16.629 align:start position:0%
country yeah
that

01:42:16.629 --> 01:42:16.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
and that it's
 
01:42:20.229 --> 01:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
we don't want to go there
 
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
so further further questions uh
 
01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:24.870 align:start position:0%
so further further questions uh
representative

01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:42:26.229 --> 01:42:26.239 align:start position:0%
yeah there's two questions here
 
01:42:26.239 --> 01:42:28.229 align:start position:0%
yeah there's two questions here
representative

01:42:28.229 --> 01:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:42:28.239 --> 01:42:29.189 align:start position:0%
representative
tanner

01:42:29.189 --> 01:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
tanner
 
01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
um i guess my my question is uh and it
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
kind of goes to
 
01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
your longevity on the school board is
 
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
that you know i i was a in a cooperative
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
i taught in a cooperative district for
 
01:42:43.189 --> 01:42:43.199 align:start position:0%
35 years
 
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
and they did
 
01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
have periodic times when they reviewed
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
the contract when they reviewed the
 
01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:51.109 align:start position:0%
the contract when they reviewed the
apportionment

01:42:51.109 --> 01:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
apportionment
 
01:42:53.030 --> 01:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm just wondering you know it's
 
01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
what i'm hearing today
 
01:42:58.709 --> 01:42:58.719 align:start position:0%
is kind of they don't do it
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
and um you know your short span on the
 
01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
school board obviously you haven't had
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to be through that but i
 
01:43:07.669 --> 01:43:07.679 align:start position:0%
would be very curious
 
01:43:07.679 --> 01:43:09.350 align:start position:0%
would be very curious
uh

01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
to take a survey of all the cooperative
 
01:43:13.350 --> 01:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
school districts in the state
 
01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
and find out
 
01:43:17.109 --> 01:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
if in fact they did
 
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
look at their their um
 
01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
reapportionment along with their
 
01:43:24.870 --> 01:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
cooperative agreement um and i think
 
01:43:28.149 --> 01:43:28.159 align:start position:0%
most boards probably do at certain times
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
look at that as a as that arises in the
 
01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
community but
 
01:43:34.149 --> 01:43:34.159 align:start position:0%
as you i think you
 
01:43:36.390 --> 01:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
and just to make sure you did say that
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
there is a process right now
 
01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
for boards to for the cooperative school
 
01:43:44.790 --> 01:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
boards to petition right the state
 
01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
there's three processes to change your
 
01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
reapportionment one is for the board to
 
01:43:50.629 --> 01:43:50.639 align:start position:0%
put it on a ballot one is a petition
 
01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
warrant and one is to go to the board of
 
01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
education which i even realized until
 
01:43:56.709 --> 01:43:56.719 align:start position:0%
this amendment came out that it was even
 
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
part of the law that you could go a
 
01:43:59.910 --> 01:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
school board could go to the board of
 
01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:01.189 align:start position:0%
school board could go to the board of
education

01:44:01.189 --> 01:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
and ask for a change too
 
01:44:05.590 --> 01:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
thanks i think that that's an important
 
01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:06.550 align:start position:0%
thanks i think that that's an important
emphasis

01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
emphasis
 
01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
okay uh last question representatives
 
01:44:12.709 --> 01:44:12.719 align:start position:0%
so it seems that
 
01:44:15.030 --> 01:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
you approve and it sounds like a lot of
 
01:44:18.390 --> 01:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
the people here approve of setting up
 
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
school districts school boards
 
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
cooperative school boards like a house
 
01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
of representatives
 
01:44:27.910 --> 01:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
and it looks like merrimack has decided
 
01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
to set theirs up like a senate
 
01:44:32.950 --> 01:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering do you have an
 
01:44:35.590 --> 01:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
objection to that i mean do you see that
 
01:44:38.229 --> 01:44:38.239 align:start position:0%
as a as a viable
 
01:44:39.590 --> 01:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
i have an objection if it was my
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
district but i really support every
 
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
community making their own decision in
 
01:44:45.510 --> 01:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
that way because they
 
01:44:46.950 --> 01:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
merrimack valley school district know
 
01:44:48.390 --> 01:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
what's best for the merrimack valley
 
01:44:49.590 --> 01:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
school district the governor wentworth
 
01:44:50.790 --> 01:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
regional school district knows what's
 
01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
best for it the exeter cooperative knows
 
01:44:54.629 --> 01:44:54.639 align:start position:0%
what's best for the exeter cooperative i
 
01:44:56.149 --> 01:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
think at the end of the day the dynamics
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
are so complex between these towns these
 
01:45:00.070 --> 01:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
agreements are pre-existing and it took
 
01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
a while to create these agreements and
 
01:45:03.669 --> 01:45:03.679 align:start position:0%
it's ongoing and they constantly they
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
can change or sometimes they don't
 
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
change because it's better to stay
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
static but with these kinds of complex
 
01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
dynamics it's hard for us
 
01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
in this room and for 400 legislators to
 
01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
understand the dynamics of every
 
01:45:15.109 --> 01:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
cooperative school district and what's
 
01:45:16.629 --> 01:45:16.639 align:start position:0%
going to bring about the best results
 
01:45:17.910 --> 01:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
for those cooperative school districts
 
01:45:20.070 --> 01:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
and how they elect their members
 
01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:22.159 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much uh with
 
01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
that uh thank you for coming today and
 
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
we'll ask uh bear christina from the
 
01:45:28.709 --> 01:45:28.719 align:start position:0%
school boards association to come
 
01:45:34.870 --> 01:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:36.229 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh good morning chairman lag and morning
 
01:45:39.510 --> 01:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee bear christina
 
01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
school boards association pardon my
 
01:45:43.510 --> 01:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
voice i'm on the the back end of a cold
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
and uh i've had laryngitis the last
 
01:45:47.109 --> 01:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
couple of days
 
01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
um i'm trying to try and be brief i know
 
01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
we've been on this um uh amendment for
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
i'm moving and close to an hour and a
 
01:45:55.669 --> 01:45:55.679 align:start position:0%
half two hours now um i'm not gonna
 
01:45:58.390 --> 01:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of time um we are opposed to
 
01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment um a lot of the reasons
 
01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
why i've already been mentioned by
 
01:46:04.629 --> 01:46:04.639 align:start position:0%
representative des and miss lovejoy um
 
01:46:05.990 --> 01:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
before him
 
01:46:08.070 --> 01:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
um i think a couple of the things that i
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
will want to highlight though some of
 
01:46:12.390 --> 01:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
the broader base policy concerns
 
01:46:14.310 --> 01:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
current law allows for four or five
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
options for a community to select
 
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
methods for a community to select their
 
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
cooperative school board members as i
 
01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
read this amendment there's it's down to
 
01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:22.629 align:start position:0%
read this amendment there's it's down to
one

01:46:22.629 --> 01:46:22.639 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:46:24.629 --> 01:46:24.639 align:start position:0%
we're limiting voter choice we're
 
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
limiting options
 
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
for voters to decide how they want to
 
01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
elect their local officials on our local
 
01:46:32.229 --> 01:46:32.239 align:start position:0%
cooperative school board the second
 
01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
aspect that i would like to make is that
 
01:46:38.229 --> 01:46:38.239 align:start position:0%
we have not heard that this is the
 
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
problem statewide we've heard from one
 
01:46:41.910 --> 01:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
maybe two
 
01:46:44.070 --> 01:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
individuals in particular co-ops who
 
01:46:45.910 --> 01:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
don't like the current method within
 
01:46:47.910 --> 01:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
their community
 
01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:49.679 align:start position:0%
nobody from merrimack valley has come to
 
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
complain about it nobody from conval has
 
01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
come to complain about it nobody from
 
01:46:54.709 --> 01:46:54.719 align:start position:0%
governor wentworth has come to complain
 
01:46:56.950 --> 01:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
about it so i don't understand why we're
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
spending this much time making this
 
01:47:01.830 --> 01:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
drastic of a change limiting voter
 
01:47:03.590 --> 01:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
choice for something that may be a
 
01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:05.189 align:start position:0%
choice for something that may be a
concern

01:47:05.189 --> 01:47:05.199 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
with a couple people here and there and
 
01:47:09.430 --> 01:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
in one particular co-op there are other
 
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
methods within the law that can address
 
01:47:13.590 --> 01:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
some of the challenges that have been
 
01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
addressed so my question would be rather
 
01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:16.790 align:start position:0%
addressed so my question would be rather
than

01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
going through a legislative process that
 
01:47:20.950 --> 01:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
we how many hours have we spent on this
 
01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
both the original bill this bill
 
01:47:25.109 --> 01:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
the imaginations that
 
01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
that occur on the house floor
 
01:47:30.790 --> 01:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
you know my question would be rather
 
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
than changing legislative process that
 
01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:34.390 align:start position:0%
than changing legislative process that
impacts

01:47:34.390 --> 01:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
impacts
 
01:47:36.310 --> 01:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
32 school districts how many knows how
 
01:47:39.669 --> 01:47:39.679 align:start position:0%
many kids across the state
 
01:47:41.590 --> 01:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
was there a petitioned warrant article
 
01:47:43.669 --> 01:47:43.679 align:start position:0%
locally to change the method that's
 
01:47:45.830 --> 01:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
currently allowed in law
 
01:47:47.669 --> 01:47:47.679 align:start position:0%
was that did we go through that process
 
01:47:49.270 --> 01:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
first to see if that would have
 
01:47:51.510 --> 01:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
alleviated some of the concerns
 
01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:52.550 align:start position:0%
alleviated some of the concerns
um

01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:55.109 --> 01:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
so you know we're going from five or six
 
01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
choice whatever four or five choices to
 
01:47:58.870 --> 01:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
as i read it one
 
01:47:58.880 --> 01:47:59.990 align:start position:0%
as i read it one
um

01:47:59.990 --> 01:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:03.189 --> 01:48:03.199 align:start position:0%
so i i just i don't understand
 
01:48:05.109 --> 01:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
why that why i don't understand why this
 
01:48:07.830 --> 01:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
is such a a a concern
 
01:48:09.750 --> 01:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
for this body when we are not hearing
 
01:48:11.830 --> 01:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
these concerns statewide
 
01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:12.950 align:start position:0%
these concerns statewide
um

01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
the other aspect you know uh page two
 
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
again the the mechanics of how this is
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
going to work when some school board
 
01:48:21.669 --> 01:48:21.679 align:start position:0%
members are going to have their seats
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
eliminated presumably
 
01:48:27.189 --> 01:48:27.199 align:start position:0%
page 2 lines 9 through 12 by july 21st
 
01:48:30.149 --> 01:48:30.159 align:start position:0%
2025 so i don't understand what happens
 
01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
to the person that gets elected to a
 
01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
three-year seat in march of 2024
 
01:48:37.109 --> 01:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
they have a three-year seat they're
 
01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:38.639 align:start position:0%
going to be on the board for
 
01:48:40.149 --> 01:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
four months and then suddenly we're
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
changing the process
 
01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
and if we think that
 
01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
communities are going to be able to
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
agree to whatever process comes out
 
01:48:51.430 --> 01:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
locally um i think we're i think we're
 
01:48:54.550 --> 01:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
being naive um the lawyers that
 
01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
represent school districts probably love
 
01:49:01.270 --> 01:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
page 2 line 9 through 13. um the rest of
 
01:49:03.669 --> 01:49:03.679 align:start position:0%
us probably are not going to
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
um another sort of logistical challenge
 
01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
that i don't think is addressed in the
 
01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:08.870 align:start position:0%
that i don't think is addressed in the
bill

01:49:08.870 --> 01:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:09.910 align:start position:0%
bill
um

01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
i'm this is a this is current language
 
01:49:16.870 --> 01:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
in in in while i'm on the first page
 
01:49:19.830 --> 01:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
sort of the introductory paragraph
 
01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
the number composition method selection
 
01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
terms of cooperative school board shelby
 
01:49:26.550 --> 01:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
is provided in the bylaws
 
01:49:27.990 --> 01:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
or the articles of agreement of the
 
01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
cooperative school district okay so we
 
01:49:31.589 --> 01:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
know that the method for which your
 
01:49:33.109 --> 01:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
school board members are elected are
 
01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
contained within the articles of
 
01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:35.830 align:start position:0%
contained within the articles of
agreement

01:49:35.830 --> 01:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:49:38.229 --> 01:49:38.239 align:start position:0%
as the case may be provided however such
 
01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
bylaws and articles of agreement shall
 
01:49:42.550 --> 01:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
be limited to the following and it's
 
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
then it lists out the proposed amendment
 
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
bylaws and articles of agreement within
 
01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
cooperative school districts can only be
 
01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:51.679 align:start position:0%
changed by a vote of the body
 
01:49:53.589 --> 01:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
by a warrant article
 
01:49:57.109 --> 01:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
so what happens then if this bill passes
 
01:49:59.669 --> 01:49:59.679 align:start position:0%
and then we go to annual meetings
 
01:50:03.109 --> 01:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
of march 23 year 24 to somehow implement
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
a new provision with this and the voters
 
01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
reject it
 
01:50:07.830 --> 01:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
they don't they vote not to change the
 
01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement we've got articles
 
01:50:11.030 --> 01:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
of agreement that are in conflict with
 
01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
current law and i don't know how to
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
rectify that short of coming it back to
 
01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
to the voters again or perhaps the state
 
01:50:21.030 --> 01:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
board of steps in and then we get back
 
01:50:22.550 --> 01:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
to the issue of whether or not we want
 
01:50:24.390 --> 01:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
unelected bureaucrats
 
01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
at the state level dictating how local
 
01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
elections are going to occur in our
 
01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
local communities
 
01:50:31.589 --> 01:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
nhsba does not think that's a
 
01:50:34.229 --> 01:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a prudent proposition
 
01:50:35.669 --> 01:50:35.679 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:50:37.589 --> 01:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
with that i think those are the primary
 
01:50:40.950 --> 01:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
concerns nhsba has again um i i do want
 
01:50:42.390 --> 01:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
to thank everybody that's worked on this
 
01:50:44.310 --> 01:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
i understand it's it's an important
 
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
issue for some people and um the report
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
that representative abrami put together
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
presumably with perhaps some other
 
01:50:52.229 --> 01:50:52.239 align:start position:0%
people on this committee if there's an
 
01:50:54.070 --> 01:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
extra copy of that floating around i'd
 
01:50:55.830 --> 01:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
like i'd like to be able to have a copy
 
01:50:57.669 --> 01:50:57.679 align:start position:0%
of um just so i could i could take a
 
01:50:59.830 --> 01:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
look at that i knew you know the time
 
01:51:02.070 --> 01:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
and effort to do that um must have been
 
01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
significant so we certainly appreciate
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
that and
 
01:51:07.510 --> 01:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
respect um you know the work that's done
 
01:51:09.189 --> 01:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
on this to address
 
01:51:10.950 --> 01:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
the perceived concern
 
01:51:13.589 --> 01:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
but nhsba opposes opposes the amendment
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
as we did with the original bill um
 
01:51:18.629 --> 01:51:18.639 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
01:51:22.550 --> 01:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
of the school boards association
 
01:51:24.229 --> 01:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
yes representative woodcock
 
01:51:26.070 --> 01:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you uh i will
 
01:51:29.189 --> 01:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
take my question uh in terms of the
 
01:51:30.629 --> 01:51:30.639 align:start position:0%
uh review
 
01:51:31.750 --> 01:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh it's been
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned here multiple times
 
01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
do does your association uh notify
 
01:51:40.149 --> 01:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
the cooperative school districts in live
 
01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
saying don't forget to do this annually
 
01:51:43.589 --> 01:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
or buy annually whatever it is to remind
 
01:51:45.270 --> 01:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
the people to do that
 
01:51:46.629 --> 01:51:46.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
um representative no i don't think i've
 
01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
had occasion to do that i don't think
 
01:51:53.589 --> 01:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
i've ever been asked to do that um only
 
01:51:55.589 --> 01:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
um in the situations in which a
 
01:51:57.430 --> 01:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
cooperative school district
 
01:51:59.030 --> 01:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
is reviewing the totality of their
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement
 
01:52:03.109 --> 01:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
which is allowed under law um
 
01:52:05.189 --> 01:52:05.199 align:start position:0%
and you know more times than not that's
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
sort of a precursor to one of the
 
01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
communities looking to potentially
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
withdraw or at least study withdrawal
 
01:52:12.149 --> 01:52:12.159 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chairman
 
01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
01:52:15.030 --> 01:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
01:52:16.709 --> 01:52:16.719 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:52:16.719 --> 01:52:17.830 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:19.189 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:52:19.189 --> 01:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:20.709 --> 01:52:20.719 align:start position:0%
i think it was the first year i was on
 
01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
the education committee uh jim grenier
 
01:52:25.669 --> 01:52:25.679 align:start position:0%
was a representative from
 
01:52:27.669 --> 01:52:27.679 align:start position:0%
goshen lobster area and served on the
 
01:52:30.790 --> 01:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
school board and that was a massive uh
 
01:52:33.030 --> 01:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
disturbance of a cooperative district
 
01:52:35.350 --> 01:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
and and it seemed to me that
 
01:52:38.070 --> 01:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
that there was some issue about the
 
01:52:40.470 --> 01:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
the league legality of a cooperative
 
01:52:42.229 --> 01:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
district in the buildings that they
 
01:52:42.239 --> 01:52:43.510 align:start position:0%
district in the buildings that they
owned

01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
owned
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
that for example if there was a building
 
01:52:46.629 --> 01:52:46.639 align:start position:0%
in leimster
 
01:52:48.149 --> 01:52:48.159 align:start position:0%
when they split up and it was part of
 
01:52:50.310 --> 01:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
the cooperative district goshen still
 
01:52:51.750 --> 01:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
had uh
 
01:52:54.229 --> 01:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
some sort of stake in that that
 
01:52:55.750 --> 01:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
particular building it was owned by the
 
01:52:58.629 --> 01:52:58.639 align:start position:0%
district which was considered
 
01:53:01.430 --> 01:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
like a municipality in itself
 
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
um could you just
 
01:53:05.189 --> 01:53:05.199 align:start position:0%
am i remembering that correctly sure
 
01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:07.750 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
representative

01:53:07.750 --> 01:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:53:09.589 --> 01:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
um correct representative jim grenier
 
01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
from lemster served on this committee
 
01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:12.470 align:start position:0%
from lemster served on this committee
for

01:53:12.470 --> 01:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:53:14.790 --> 01:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
eight years maybe representative if i
 
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
recall correctly
 
01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
um and back and i believe was 2016 or 17
 
01:53:20.550 --> 01:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
there was a study commission
 
01:53:22.229 --> 01:53:22.239 align:start position:0%
chaired by representative grenier to
 
01:53:24.550 --> 01:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
look at the withdrawal process
 
01:53:26.870 --> 01:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
at the time representative grenier um or
 
01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
at some point concurrently
 
01:53:31.350 --> 01:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
representative grenier was also a school
 
01:53:32.790 --> 01:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
board member in the goshen lobster
 
01:53:34.629 --> 01:53:34.639 align:start position:0%
cooperative school district
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
um they split i forgot who initiated i
 
01:53:38.830 --> 01:53:38.840 align:start position:0%
believe it was lobster i could be
 
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
mistaken one of the challenges um with
 
01:53:44.870 --> 01:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
that particular withdrawal was that
 
01:53:47.430 --> 01:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
leemster had the facility goshen does
 
01:53:50.229 --> 01:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
not goshen does not operate any schools
 
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
so there were questions as to um
 
01:53:54.709 --> 01:53:54.719 align:start position:0%
there are always questions upon
 
01:53:57.189 --> 01:53:57.199 align:start position:0%
withdrawal over who has to pay for what
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
who retains what property
 
01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
um you know usually if the building is
 
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
within your town or community
 
01:54:07.350 --> 01:54:07.360 align:start position:0%
you you retain it
 
01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:09.750 align:start position:0%
you you retain it
um

01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:12.629 --> 01:54:12.639 align:start position:0%
excuse me one of the other challenges um
 
01:54:14.790 --> 01:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
as i recall with that
 
01:54:17.830 --> 01:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
cooperative school district withdrawal
 
01:54:19.109 --> 01:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
was um
 
01:54:22.229 --> 01:54:22.239 align:start position:0%
they weren't quite sure if the co-op
 
01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
remained as an entity
 
01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
um so if you let's say you have a three
 
01:54:30.070 --> 01:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
town co-op if one town decides to
 
01:54:32.149 --> 01:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
withdraw you still have a corporate
 
01:54:34.709 --> 01:54:34.719 align:start position:0%
entity of the two remaining towns right
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
because this was just two towns and they
 
01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:38.390 align:start position:0%
because this was just two towns and they
split

01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
split
 
01:54:40.149 --> 01:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
the question was does the cooperative
 
01:54:42.550 --> 01:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
school district still carry on as a
 
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
legal formal entity
 
01:54:47.189 --> 01:54:47.199 align:start position:0%
um cooperative by its nature seems to
 
01:54:49.270 --> 01:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
imply more than one so can you have a
 
01:54:52.070 --> 01:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
cooperative school district that is only
 
01:54:54.390 --> 01:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
one district i forgot how that got
 
01:54:55.990 --> 01:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
resolved to some degree it was more
 
01:54:58.149 --> 01:54:58.159 align:start position:0%
academic than anything else
 
01:55:00.790 --> 01:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
um you know related to that and you know
 
01:55:02.310 --> 01:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
representative chairman lad and i've had
 
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
some conversations about nhsba's
 
01:55:07.109 --> 01:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
recommendation again is that we have a
 
01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
two-year-long study commission to study
 
01:55:13.350 --> 01:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
the the totality of rsa 195. we need
 
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
lawyers in we need people from the dra
 
01:55:17.589 --> 01:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
to talk about proportionment we may need
 
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
somebody relative from from like the
 
01:55:20.709 --> 01:55:20.719 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office or the
 
01:55:22.390 --> 01:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
secretary of state to talk about sort of
 
01:55:23.910 --> 01:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
the one man one vote and the
 
01:55:26.470 --> 01:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
proportionality of things of that nature
 
01:55:29.109 --> 01:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
um this sort of patchwork approach does
 
01:55:34.070 --> 01:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
not work to a system that is getting um
 
01:55:36.070 --> 01:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
where their frustration is increasing
 
01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
across the state in certain segments of
 
01:55:39.189 --> 01:55:39.199 align:start position:0%
the community
 
01:55:41.350 --> 01:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
trying to cram everything in and fix
 
01:55:42.870 --> 01:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
this with this committee respectfully
 
01:55:44.550 --> 01:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
you've got a lot of other work is a
 
01:55:46.950 --> 01:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
challenge in in and of itself
 
01:55:48.149 --> 01:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
i hope that answered your question
 
01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
representative so just to be clear you
 
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
would recommend that we we have instead
 
01:55:55.910 --> 01:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
of little bills or bills like this maybe
 
01:55:58.149 --> 01:55:58.159 align:start position:0%
not little but bills like this
 
01:56:00.790 --> 01:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
that we actually have a commission a
 
01:56:02.390 --> 01:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
study committee that
 
01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
my recommendation would be a two-year
 
01:56:05.430 --> 01:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
study commission because this cannot be
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
done in a single year it's way too
 
01:56:09.030 --> 01:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
complex we bring in the lawyers that
 
01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
know the historical aspects and have
 
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
worked with cooperative school districts
 
01:56:14.790 --> 01:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
for 30 or 40 years at no apportionment
 
01:56:17.350 --> 01:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
we bring in again dra to talk about that
 
01:56:18.629 --> 01:56:18.639 align:start position:0%
we bring in some cooperative school
 
01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
board members we bring in some
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
superintendents members of this
 
01:56:23.830 --> 01:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
committee and we and we look at
 
01:56:27.030 --> 01:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
wholesale changes to rsa 195.
 
01:56:28.629 --> 01:56:28.639 align:start position:0%
thank you because we do have two other
 
01:56:28.639 --> 01:56:29.510 align:start position:0%
thank you because we do have two other
bills

01:56:29.510 --> 01:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
that we as an education committee have
 
01:56:34.870 --> 01:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
put into interim study uh about
 
01:56:37.750 --> 01:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
cooperative districts thank you
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:56:40.870 --> 01:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
yes when jim did take over that
 
01:56:43.109 --> 01:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that i asked him to do
 
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
we did get a report but it did not
 
01:56:47.990 --> 01:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
resolve all the itch in fact i'm in a
 
01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
co-op with just one town in the co-op
 
01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:51.750 align:start position:0%
co-op with just one town in the co-op
right

01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:56:55.430 --> 01:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
um and everybody's elected at large
 
01:56:59.189 --> 01:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
uh it's just you know there it's a mess
 
01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
but i do have one question for you here
 
01:57:06.070 --> 01:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:07.350 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:57:08.629 --> 01:57:08.639 align:start position:0%
jim did a good job because he was
 
01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
dealing with in the districts with one
 
01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
or two and there were there was some
 
01:57:14.790 --> 01:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
resolution but not going there with it
 
01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh in regard to this last portion on
 
01:57:18.550 --> 01:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:57:20.070 --> 01:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
is there a need
 
01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
that we have something in law which says
 
01:57:25.189 --> 01:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
reapportionment member uh
 
01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
reapportionment of
 
01:57:29.030 --> 01:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
members of the cooperative school board
 
01:57:30.870 --> 01:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
you could say
 
01:57:32.629 --> 01:57:32.639 align:start position:0%
in in relation to the pre-existing
 
01:57:34.709 --> 01:57:34.719 align:start position:0%
district shall be reviewed revised and
 
01:57:36.830 --> 01:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
updated etc etc
 
01:57:39.669 --> 01:57:39.679 align:start position:0%
um that's not occurring in all these
 
01:57:41.430 --> 01:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
districts right now i know that's not
 
01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
happening correct and it does need to
 
01:57:44.159 --> 01:57:45.510 align:start position:0%
happening correct and it does need to
occur

01:57:45.510 --> 01:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
occur
 
01:57:48.070 --> 01:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
and and would would doing this in
 
01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
conjunction with that 10-year
 
01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
federal census give us the data points
 
01:57:55.189 --> 01:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
in order to accomplish this yeah thank
 
01:57:58.070 --> 01:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
you very much uh chairman ladd um nhsba
 
01:57:59.669 --> 01:57:59.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any specific objection to
 
01:58:01.030 --> 01:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
that provision
 
01:58:02.310 --> 01:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
that is certainly probably a best
 
01:58:04.070 --> 01:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
practice that they should be looking at
 
01:58:06.070 --> 01:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
their at their population numbers every
 
01:58:08.470 --> 01:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
10 years um the one
 
01:58:10.550 --> 01:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
aspect that we need to be mindful of and
 
01:58:12.229 --> 01:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
to some degree i think representative de
 
01:58:13.830 --> 01:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
shays brought this up
 
01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:14.629 align:start position:0%
shays brought this up
um

01:58:14.629 --> 01:58:14.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
reapportionment of members of the
 
01:58:17.189 --> 01:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
cooperative school board shall be
 
01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
reviewed and revised the updated
 
01:58:22.629 --> 01:58:22.639 align:start position:0%
you know does up does updated imply that
 
01:58:24.310 --> 01:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
there has to be a change made because
 
01:58:25.750 --> 01:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
what if they review it at the 10 years
 
01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
and say we think we're okay or we're
 
01:58:29.990 --> 01:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
we're in accordance with the numbers
 
01:58:32.550 --> 01:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
currently so but looking at the numbers
 
01:58:34.470 --> 01:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
every 10 years somehow tying that back
 
01:58:36.790 --> 01:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
in yeah i think that's reasonable yeah
 
01:58:38.470 --> 01:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
not ann but maybe an hour or something
 
01:58:40.229 --> 01:58:40.239 align:start position:0%
something like that yeah thank you yeah

02:40:09.750 --> 02:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:12.150 --> 02:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
to make some progress
 
02:40:14.790 --> 02:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
with cooperative school districts
 
02:40:16.790 --> 02:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
it does not affect funding which has
 
02:40:18.469 --> 02:40:18.479 align:start position:0%
been a large
 
02:40:20.389 --> 02:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
issue that i think will take further
 
02:40:23.429 --> 02:40:23.439 align:start position:0%
work uh but it does i think address
 
02:40:27.190 --> 02:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh membership um and inequities there
 
02:40:27.200 --> 02:40:28.150 align:start position:0%
uh membership um and inequities there
um

02:40:28.150 --> 02:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:31.670 --> 02:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
and you know we've heard uh testimony
 
02:40:33.269 --> 02:40:33.279 align:start position:0%
from the school boards association that
 
02:40:36.389 --> 02:40:36.399 align:start position:0%
there's frustrations increasing around
 
02:40:39.670 --> 02:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
the state so i think that this will
 
02:40:42.950 --> 02:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
help in that regard thank you
 
02:40:46.150 --> 02:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
further discussion representatives
 
02:40:51.030 --> 02:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
i am i just sent down an amendment to
 
02:40:52.469 --> 02:40:52.479 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
02:40:56.870 --> 02:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
which just adds a second after the a
 
02:40:59.269 --> 02:40:59.279 align:start position:0%
a new b that says by a vote of the
 
02:41:01.750 --> 02:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
people in the district to confirm the
 
02:41:03.590 --> 02:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
agreement they already have
 
02:41:06.309 --> 02:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
and then the b changed to c
 
02:41:10.550 --> 02:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
and so if we could wait to vote on this
 
02:41:10.560 --> 02:41:12.070 align:start position:0%
and so if we could wait to vote on this
until

02:41:12.070 --> 02:41:12.080 align:start position:0%

02:41:15.830 --> 02:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
of the other bills that would give us a
 
02:41:17.990 --> 02:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
chance to get that back could you read
 
02:41:19.590 --> 02:41:19.600 align:start position:0%

please
 
02:41:23.830 --> 02:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:26.950 --> 02:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
i'll have to find the exact language
 
02:41:26.960 --> 02:41:27.990 align:start position:0%
i'll have to find the exact language
um

02:41:27.990 --> 02:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:35.030 --> 02:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:37.269 --> 02:41:37.279 align:start position:0%
i said
 
02:41:40.309 --> 02:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
the new bee which says confirm a newbie
 
02:41:40.319 --> 02:41:41.269 align:start position:0%
the new bee which says confirm a newbie
says

02:41:41.269 --> 02:41:41.279 align:start position:0%
says
 
02:41:43.269 --> 02:41:43.279 align:start position:0%
confirmed by a vote of the voters in the
 
02:41:46.309 --> 02:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
co-op district to confirm
 
02:41:46.319 --> 02:41:47.750 align:start position:0%
co-op district to confirm
uh

02:41:47.750 --> 02:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:41:55.030 --> 02:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:57.269 --> 02:41:57.279 align:start position:0%
one more time please yeah well hopefully
 
02:42:00.150 --> 02:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
they will catch the fact that i
 
02:42:02.469 --> 02:42:02.479 align:start position:0%
put in two confirms
 
02:42:04.309 --> 02:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
confirmed by a vote of the voters in the
 
02:42:06.150 --> 02:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
co-op district to confirm the current
 
02:42:06.160 --> 02:42:07.670 align:start position:0%
co-op district to confirm the current
agreement

02:42:07.670 --> 02:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
02:42:08.950 --> 02:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
there should have been a comma in there
 
02:42:11.349 --> 02:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
and there wasn't but
 
02:42:11.359 --> 02:42:13.590 align:start position:0%
and there wasn't but
okay

02:42:13.590 --> 02:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:42:15.190 --> 02:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
is is there any discussion yes
 
02:42:23.349 --> 02:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:24.870 --> 02:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
use your mic please
 
02:42:28.630 --> 02:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
i thought i hit it but it didn't take
 
02:42:30.550 --> 02:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
what they've done your main amendment
 
02:42:32.710 --> 02:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
the issue i see in some cooperative
 
02:42:35.750 --> 02:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
school districts where you may have a
 
02:42:37.349 --> 02:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
big school
 
02:42:39.830 --> 02:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
and a lot of smaller towns around the
 
02:42:41.830 --> 02:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
school districts around it
 
02:42:44.070 --> 02:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
and if every everything is like in
 
02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:45.349 align:start position:0%
and if every everything is like in
somewhere

02:42:45.349 --> 02:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
02:42:47.670 --> 02:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
everybody's at large
 
02:42:49.190 --> 02:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
all it would take
 
02:42:52.389 --> 02:42:52.399 align:start position:0%
is somebody just to campaign in the big
 
02:42:54.389 --> 02:42:54.399 align:start position:0%
school district they wouldn't even have
 
02:42:56.389 --> 02:42:56.399 align:start position:0%
to campaign in their own
 
02:42:56.399 --> 02:42:57.590 align:start position:0%
to campaign in their own
so

02:42:57.590 --> 02:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:43:00.469 --> 02:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
i think you should live and
 
02:43:03.190 --> 02:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
be voted on by the people that
 
02:43:05.590 --> 02:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
you want to represent in your school
 
02:43:07.510 --> 02:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
district in the cooperative school
 
02:43:10.469 --> 02:43:10.479 align:start position:0%
district and not everybody vote for you
 
02:43:14.469 --> 02:43:14.479 align:start position:0%
a good example of that for example is
 
02:43:16.870 --> 02:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
what's bad is the new hampshire senate
 
02:43:18.309 --> 02:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
district we just came out with
 
02:43:19.670 --> 02:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
litchfield is
 
02:43:22.070 --> 02:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
combined with five awards in manchester
 
02:43:23.269 --> 02:43:23.279 align:start position:0%
no way
 
02:43:25.349 --> 02:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
that representative so it's the same
 
02:43:27.590 --> 02:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
type of thing where
 
02:43:29.590 --> 02:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
the people in one in the small town
 
02:43:31.030 --> 02:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
should have
 
02:43:34.230 --> 02:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
their with who they want not who the
 
02:43:37.349 --> 02:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
whole district wants
 
02:43:39.429 --> 02:43:39.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:43:41.590 --> 02:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
represent mullen
 
02:43:45.429 --> 02:43:45.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so what about the
 
02:43:48.950 --> 02:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
towns that are going to lose votes
 
02:43:52.309 --> 02:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
because in uh representative abrami's
 
02:43:52.319 --> 02:43:53.590 align:start position:0%
because in uh representative abrami's
example

02:43:53.590 --> 02:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:43:55.590 --> 02:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh i think it was the merrimack valley
 
02:43:57.349 --> 02:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
school district
 
02:43:59.510 --> 02:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of towns that were
 
02:44:01.990 --> 02:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
actually going to lose votes they
 
02:44:05.110 --> 02:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
currently have two school board members
 
02:44:07.429 --> 02:44:07.439 align:start position:0%
and they're that now going to have one
 
02:44:09.910 --> 02:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
school board member i would like to know
 
02:44:11.830 --> 02:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
how many school districts does this
 
02:44:13.269 --> 02:44:13.279 align:start position:0%
apply to
 
02:44:15.030 --> 02:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
how many cooperative districts does this
 
02:44:17.510 --> 02:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
apply to what the heck kind of response
 
02:44:19.429 --> 02:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
are we going to get from dis
 
02:44:23.910 --> 02:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
from towns that are losing clout in this
 
02:44:27.110 --> 02:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh in this reapportionment i uh
 
02:44:29.030 --> 02:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
i i feel like i was
 
02:44:31.429 --> 02:44:31.439 align:start position:0%
i'm quite surprised at the ought to pass
 
02:44:33.670 --> 02:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
motion quite frankly because i felt like
 
02:44:34.630 --> 02:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
we heard
 
02:44:38.389 --> 02:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
compelling testimony to study this
 
02:44:41.590 --> 02:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
not to impetuously act upon it but to
 
02:44:44.550 --> 02:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
study it after listening to
 
02:44:47.910 --> 02:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
all of the concerns that uh
 
02:44:49.750 --> 02:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
i i did not hear the school boards
 
02:44:51.990 --> 02:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
association say that this was a swell
 
02:44:53.590 --> 02:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
idea and that we ought to move forward i
 
02:44:55.910 --> 02:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
heard them say that we needed to study
 
02:44:57.190 --> 02:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
it uh
 
02:45:00.309 --> 02:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
so i i'm i'm very concerned about the
 
02:45:00.319 --> 02:45:01.510 align:start position:0%
so i i'm i'm very concerned about the
towns

02:45:01.510 --> 02:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
towns
 
02:45:03.190 --> 02:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
that are going to lose their school
 
02:45:05.990 --> 02:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:07.510 --> 02:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
could i respond
 
02:45:10.150 --> 02:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
represent cardelli uh yes i i didn't
 
02:45:11.750 --> 02:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
indicate that they said it was a swell
 
02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
idea i said that the quote was
 
02:45:16.150 --> 02:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
frustrations are increasing across the
 
02:45:16.160 --> 02:45:17.349 align:start position:0%
frustrations are increasing across the
state

02:45:17.349 --> 02:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:45:20.150 --> 02:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
with cooperative schools
 
02:45:22.070 --> 02:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative miller
 
02:45:23.670 --> 02:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:45:26.710 --> 02:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
you know we just spent almost two hours
 
02:45:28.469 --> 02:45:28.479 align:start position:0%
talking about the complexity of this
 
02:45:28.479 --> 02:45:29.510 align:start position:0%
talking about the complexity of this
issue

02:45:29.510 --> 02:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:45:31.110 --> 02:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
and those of us that have been on this
 
02:45:33.910 --> 02:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
committee before understand
 
02:45:35.750 --> 02:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
the dilemma here
 
02:45:38.550 --> 02:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
and rather i i like the impetuousness of
 
02:45:38.560 --> 02:45:39.590 align:start position:0%
and rather i i like the impetuousness of
uh

02:45:39.590 --> 02:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:45:39.600 --> 02:45:40.630 align:start position:0%
uh
uh

02:45:40.630 --> 02:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:45:42.469 --> 02:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
ms mullins uh representing mullen's
 
02:45:43.990 --> 02:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
comments because that's exactly what
 
02:45:45.030 --> 02:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:45:47.030 --> 02:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
we already have set up
 
02:45:50.389 --> 02:45:50.399 align:start position:0%
to study two other comm two other issues
 
02:45:52.870 --> 02:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
regarding co-op districts
 
02:45:55.510 --> 02:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
this to me should be part of that
 
02:45:57.830 --> 02:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
we're talking about eliminating
 
02:46:00.070 --> 02:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh three different options
 
02:46:01.830 --> 02:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
to one option
 
02:46:03.990 --> 02:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
that doesn't seem to be proof to me as
 
02:46:06.230 --> 02:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
we begin to look at this issue
 
02:46:07.910 --> 02:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
we've not heard we've only heard one
 
02:46:09.429 --> 02:46:09.439 align:start position:0%
issue around this
 
02:46:11.429 --> 02:46:11.439 align:start position:0%
as far as the need for this we didn't
 
02:46:13.750 --> 02:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
hear we don't hear any compelling need
 
02:46:16.070 --> 02:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
for this at this point in time from
 
02:46:18.710 --> 02:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
around the around the state so why would
 
02:46:20.790 --> 02:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
we be acting on it now
 
02:46:23.429 --> 02:46:23.439 align:start position:0%
we need to have further input from those
 
02:46:26.389 --> 02:46:26.399 align:start position:0%
co-op co-op districts representatives
 
02:46:29.269 --> 02:46:29.279 align:start position:0%
from them not just from one area
 
02:46:30.790 --> 02:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
i i really would encourage this
 
02:46:34.070 --> 02:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
committee to at least defeat the otp on
 
02:46:35.830 --> 02:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
this and at least throw it into an
 
02:46:37.349 --> 02:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
interim study if that's what you want to
 
02:46:39.750 --> 02:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
do but right now it's it's very
 
02:46:41.990 --> 02:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
important to do it at this point in time
 
02:46:43.830 --> 02:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:46:45.429 --> 02:46:45.439 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:46:47.670 --> 02:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
are we going
 
02:46:47.680 --> 02:46:48.469 align:start position:0%
are we going
from

02:46:48.469 --> 02:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:46:51.429 --> 02:46:51.439 align:start position:0%
to one option or two options we i see an
 
02:46:53.190 --> 02:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
a and a b
 
02:46:54.710 --> 02:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
the b is
 
02:46:56.469 --> 02:46:56.479 align:start position:0%
if you want to continue with your
 
02:47:00.469 --> 02:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
current situation you may
 
02:47:02.790 --> 02:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
ask the state board for approval to do
 
02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:03.830 align:start position:0%
ask the state board for approval to do
so

02:47:03.830 --> 02:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:47:05.110 --> 02:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
so is that
 
02:47:07.269 --> 02:47:07.279 align:start position:0%
likened to a second option
 
02:47:10.790 --> 02:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
that may incorporate those other options
 
02:47:12.070 --> 02:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh that's a question out to the
 
02:47:12.080 --> 02:47:13.590 align:start position:0%
uh that's a question out to the
committee

02:47:13.590 --> 02:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:47:16.389 --> 02:47:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh represent like us
 
02:47:18.309 --> 02:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
i was just gonna say my amendment gives
 
02:47:20.550 --> 02:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
the third option which is confirm the
 
02:47:21.910 --> 02:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
current agreement by a vote of the
 
02:47:27.910 --> 02:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:29.110 --> 02:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:47:31.030 --> 02:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
i believe when we were
 
02:47:32.950 --> 02:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
working on this
 
02:47:35.030 --> 02:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
looking at providing
 
02:47:38.550 --> 02:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
four options that was the intent of b
 
02:47:40.870 --> 02:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
is to use the same process of going
 
02:47:42.870 --> 02:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
through the state board that was the
 
02:47:48.550 --> 02:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:49.910 --> 02:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
represent boom
 
02:47:52.389 --> 02:47:52.399 align:start position:0%
just to remind people we already voted
 
02:47:55.510 --> 02:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
19 to nothing on the similar bill that
 
02:47:57.910 --> 02:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
was tabled on the house floor so
 
02:47:59.269 --> 02:47:59.279 align:start position:0%
i don't know why we have the
 
02:48:02.550 --> 02:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
disagreements now thank you
 
02:48:05.590 --> 02:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock and represent luna
 
02:48:06.870 --> 02:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
02:48:06.880 --> 02:48:07.590 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
um

02:48:07.590 --> 02:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:09.190 --> 02:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
i would go back to
 
02:48:12.070 --> 02:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
item b and i have a different uh take on
 
02:48:14.710 --> 02:48:14.720 align:start position:0%
it than the representative cordelli
 
02:48:16.870 --> 02:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
where it is an option where it says it
 
02:48:18.870 --> 02:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
may be approved by the state board of
 
02:48:21.269 --> 02:48:21.279 align:start position:0%
education i have two thoughts one why
 
02:48:22.309 --> 02:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
should they have to apply if
 
02:48:24.469 --> 02:48:24.479 align:start position:0%
everything's working fine but secondly
 
02:48:25.830 --> 02:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
what happened to the state board of
 
02:48:28.469 --> 02:48:28.479 align:start position:0%
education and says no we have seen times
 
02:48:30.389 --> 02:48:30.399 align:start position:0%
and other pieces of legislation where
 
02:48:31.750 --> 02:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
one person's
 
02:48:34.550 --> 02:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
philosophy overtakes a whole group
 
02:48:36.309 --> 02:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
this this concerns me that we have
 
02:48:38.710 --> 02:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
schools that have to go and ask can we
 
02:48:40.870 --> 02:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
continue to do what we do
 
02:48:42.950 --> 02:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
that we do well and happily and the
 
02:48:45.269 --> 02:48:45.279 align:start position:0%
state boy said nope we want you all to
 
02:48:46.790 --> 02:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
do this
 
02:48:48.710 --> 02:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
so i don't see this as an option at all
 
02:48:50.389 --> 02:48:50.399 align:start position:0%
when you when you give the provision
 
02:48:53.990 --> 02:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
they may say no as well as may say yes
 
02:48:54.950 --> 02:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:48:54.960 --> 02:48:56.389 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

02:48:56.389 --> 02:48:56.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:48:58.389 --> 02:48:58.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair yeah i
 
02:49:01.590 --> 02:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
think um referring back to the um the
 
02:49:04.230 --> 02:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
the bill that was uh that was introduced
 
02:49:06.550 --> 02:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
on this subject and and subsequently
 
02:49:08.790 --> 02:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
tabled on the house floor i don't think
 
02:49:11.910 --> 02:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
a 19-0 committee vote naturally reflects
 
02:49:11.920 --> 02:49:12.710 align:start position:0%
a 19-0 committee vote naturally reflects
um

02:49:12.710 --> 02:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:15.590 --> 02:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
the um i think the substantial work and
 
02:49:17.510 --> 02:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
substantial testimony we heard this
 
02:49:17.520 --> 02:49:18.469 align:start position:0%
substantial testimony we heard this
morning

02:49:18.469 --> 02:49:18.479 align:start position:0%
morning
 
02:49:20.070 --> 02:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
as i recall and i don't have that bill
 
02:49:22.389 --> 02:49:22.399 align:start position:0%
in front of me uh we only heard from mr
 
02:49:24.469 --> 02:49:24.479 align:start position:0%
christina on that bill and it may have
 
02:49:26.550 --> 02:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
been late in the day after uh after a
 
02:49:27.910 --> 02:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
number of bills and i don't think that
 
02:49:30.550 --> 02:49:30.560 align:start position:0%
we had the type of robust discussion and
 
02:49:33.110 --> 02:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
testimony and questioning that uh that
 
02:49:36.710 --> 02:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
we had um uh this morning so uh so i
 
02:49:40.309 --> 02:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
know that uh uh if i knew not if i knew
 
02:49:43.429 --> 02:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
then what i know now i would not have uh
 
02:49:45.910 --> 02:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
been one of the 19 people who um who
 
02:49:48.230 --> 02:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
voted for that bill and i suspect others
 
02:49:50.309 --> 02:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
may may feel that they're in that
 
02:49:53.030 --> 02:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
um same ballpark too but i think the the
 
02:49:54.710 --> 02:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
testimony today
 
02:49:56.790 --> 02:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh representing
 
02:50:00.469 --> 02:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
um i think uh uh certainly a broad
 
02:50:00.479 --> 02:50:01.269 align:start position:0%
um i think uh uh certainly a broad
uh

02:50:01.269 --> 02:50:01.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:50:01.279 --> 02:50:02.389 align:start position:0%
uh
uh

02:50:02.389 --> 02:50:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:50:06.950 --> 02:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
group of uh of of of people i mean um uh
 
02:50:10.389 --> 02:50:10.399 align:start position:0%
former member patty lovejoy said she was
 
02:50:12.790 --> 02:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
representing herself but uh but in fact
 
02:50:14.870 --> 02:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
she is involved with uh with election
 
02:50:14.880 --> 02:50:16.230 align:start position:0%
she is involved with uh with election
law

02:50:16.230 --> 02:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:50:19.190 --> 02:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative des serves on a school
 
02:50:22.870 --> 02:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
board um a co-op school board uh used as
 
02:50:24.710 --> 02:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
one of the examples today
 
02:50:26.950 --> 02:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
and um and then i think um barrett
 
02:50:29.110 --> 02:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
christina representing the school board
 
02:50:31.590 --> 02:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
associate association which many times
 
02:50:34.870 --> 02:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
do not um take a position on these bills
 
02:50:36.469 --> 02:50:36.479 align:start position:0%
but i think he took a very strong
 
02:50:38.389 --> 02:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
position uh for the school board
 
02:50:41.750 --> 02:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
association on this one largely because
 
02:50:45.190 --> 02:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh there's been no complaints um filed
 
02:50:47.349 --> 02:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
with the school boards association based
 
02:50:51.830 --> 02:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
on any need to um to change this law and
 
02:50:54.790 --> 02:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh and at least in a in a quick review
 
02:50:57.030 --> 02:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
of the couple of dozen
 
02:50:59.429 --> 02:50:59.439 align:start position:0%
school board association resolutions
 
02:51:01.349 --> 02:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
that they have online none are related
 
02:51:06.070 --> 02:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
to um to this issue so so um uh so you
 
02:51:08.469 --> 02:51:08.479 align:start position:0%
know so i think for for at least those
 
02:51:08.479 --> 02:51:09.510 align:start position:0%
know so i think for for at least those
reasons

02:51:09.510 --> 02:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
02:51:12.469 --> 02:51:12.479 align:start position:0%
um this uh this could be looked at as is
 
02:51:14.469 --> 02:51:14.479 align:start position:0%
really sort of jumping the gun and i
 
02:51:16.950 --> 02:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
think the unintended consequences
 
02:51:16.960 --> 02:51:17.990 align:start position:0%
think the unintended consequences
of

02:51:17.990 --> 02:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:51:21.030 --> 02:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
of rushing through legislation such as
 
02:51:24.389 --> 02:51:24.399 align:start position:0%
if in a in a co-op district one of the
 
02:51:27.030 --> 02:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
one of the towns has a population of 93
 
02:51:28.710 --> 02:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
and they get one board member and
 
02:51:31.429 --> 02:51:31.439 align:start position:0%
there's 6 000 population in the district
 
02:51:34.070 --> 02:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
then you've got a board of 60 people
 
02:51:36.870 --> 02:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
or 65 people on that on that school
 
02:51:39.190 --> 02:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
board um if you want to comply with the
 
02:51:41.190 --> 02:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
with this law there's just there's
 
02:51:43.030 --> 02:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
there's too many of those
 
02:51:44.630 --> 02:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
sorts of
 
02:51:46.469 --> 02:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
sorts of unintended questions
 
02:51:48.550 --> 02:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
that i think could be answered if we uh
 
02:51:51.750 --> 02:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
if we instead moved forward with what mr
 
02:51:53.670 --> 02:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
christina recommended which is a
 
02:51:56.070 --> 02:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
two-year study commission uh listening
 
02:51:57.750 --> 02:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
to lawyers superintendents school board
 
02:51:59.830 --> 02:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
members members of the public and others
 
02:52:02.230 --> 02:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
associated uh with with hopefully
 
02:52:03.750 --> 02:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
helping to
 
02:52:05.510 --> 02:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
to to
 
02:52:08.630 --> 02:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
identify problems and find
 
02:52:12.150 --> 02:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
resolutions that are workable thank you
 
02:52:14.389 --> 02:52:14.399 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:52:16.230 --> 02:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
we have some districts
 
02:52:18.389 --> 02:52:18.399 align:start position:0%
that have multiple multiple districts
 
02:52:20.550 --> 02:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
within the co-op
 
02:52:22.790 --> 02:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
and there is a limitation you can have
 
02:52:25.190 --> 02:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
no more than 15 members on a cooperative
 
02:52:27.190 --> 02:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
school board it's odd numbers starting
 
02:52:29.590 --> 02:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
at three and working up through
 
02:52:32.950 --> 02:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
if you have a very large large district
 
02:52:36.469 --> 02:52:36.479 align:start position:0%
that's three times the size of the other
 
02:52:39.429 --> 02:52:39.439 align:start position:0%
six or seven
 
02:52:39.439 --> 02:52:40.389 align:start position:0%
six or seven
how

02:52:40.389 --> 02:52:40.399 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:52:42.389 --> 02:52:42.399 align:start position:0%
my question is and i guess it's to
 
02:52:44.230 --> 02:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
represent cordelia or
 
02:52:47.190 --> 02:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
how how do we assure that the
 
02:52:49.750 --> 02:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
the apportionment is based upon
 
02:52:51.190 --> 02:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to have every district
 
02:52:53.349 --> 02:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
having one
 
02:52:54.870 --> 02:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
and then you're going to have a few left
 
02:52:57.750 --> 02:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
over which in the past been either at
 
02:52:59.830 --> 02:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
large or or you know
 
02:53:02.550 --> 02:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
haven't been assigned that way
 
02:53:05.429 --> 02:53:05.439 align:start position:0%
how how do you assure the larger town
 
02:53:06.090 --> 02:53:06.100 align:start position:0%
town a
 
02:53:06.100 --> 02:53:07.269 align:start position:0%
town a
[Music]

02:53:07.269 --> 02:53:07.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:53:08.630 --> 02:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
of that's the
 
02:53:10.469 --> 02:53:10.479 align:start position:0%
lion's share of people they're going to
 
02:53:14.150 --> 02:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
get a proportion number of of members on
 
02:53:20.870 --> 02:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:23.590 --> 02:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
02:53:26.710 --> 02:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
with the examples um from representative
 
02:53:30.389 --> 02:53:30.399 align:start position:0%
abrami he showed that in that
 
02:53:32.550 --> 02:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
the population
 
02:53:32.560 --> 02:53:33.590 align:start position:0%
the population
would

02:53:33.590 --> 02:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:53:36.950 --> 02:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
determine the apportionment and
 
02:53:39.750 --> 02:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
a larger district
 
02:53:42.230 --> 02:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
such as in in one of my districts uh
 
02:53:45.110 --> 02:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
wolf bro would have uh possibly three
 
02:53:48.070 --> 02:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
members um
 
02:53:49.429 --> 02:53:49.439 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:53:51.429 --> 02:53:51.439 align:start position:0%
goes down from there two and one for the
 
02:53:54.710 --> 02:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:57.590 --> 02:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
right now instead they have three at
 
02:54:00.309 --> 02:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
large members but
 
02:54:04.150 --> 02:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
predominantly they're from wolfeboro or
 
02:54:06.150 --> 02:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
ossipee the two larger towns because
 
02:54:08.150 --> 02:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
everyone votes for them so i don't think
 
02:54:12.230 --> 02:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:14.870 --> 02:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm looking at the in the
 
02:54:16.790 --> 02:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
governor wentworth school district right
 
02:54:16.800 --> 02:54:17.990 align:start position:0%
governor wentworth school district right
now

02:54:17.990 --> 02:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:54:21.110 --> 02:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
and there's three at large
 
02:54:24.389 --> 02:54:24.399 align:start position:0%
if you're going to and there's
 
02:54:27.190 --> 02:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
five six seven eight nine nine on it
 
02:54:27.200 --> 02:54:28.550 align:start position:0%
five six seven eight nine nine on it
earlier

02:54:28.550 --> 02:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
02:54:30.950 --> 02:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
you could enlarge that
 
02:54:34.870 --> 02:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
that by your articles of agreement to
 
02:54:37.510 --> 02:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
15 if you wanted to
 
02:54:39.429 --> 02:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
has there been any thought given to that
 
02:54:40.950 --> 02:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of looking at the wentworth
 
02:54:42.309 --> 02:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
this school district here governor
 
02:54:42.319 --> 02:54:43.349 align:start position:0%
this school district here governor
wentworth

02:54:43.349 --> 02:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
wentworth
 
02:54:45.349 --> 02:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
that if you did that
 
02:54:47.670 --> 02:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
would wolfeboro then wolfeboro i would
 
02:54:47.680 --> 02:54:48.870 align:start position:0%
would wolfeboro then wolfeboro i would
assume

02:54:48.870 --> 02:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
assume
 
02:54:53.429 --> 02:54:53.439 align:start position:0%
would get you know several more uh folks
 
02:54:57.030 --> 02:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:59.269 --> 02:54:59.279 align:start position:0%
that's possible but at least they would
 
02:54:59.279 --> 02:55:00.230 align:start position:0%
that's possible but at least they would
be

02:55:00.230 --> 02:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:55:02.469 --> 02:55:02.479 align:start position:0%
elected from wolfeboro
 
02:55:05.910 --> 02:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to having um brookfield
 
02:55:08.469 --> 02:55:08.479 align:start position:0%
and effingham uh representatives get
 
02:55:09.910 --> 02:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
elected by
 
02:55:13.349 --> 02:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
wolfeboro in effect also
 
02:55:13.359 --> 02:55:14.230 align:start position:0%
wolfeboro in effect also
no

02:55:14.230 --> 02:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:55:16.790 --> 02:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
yeah representatives
 
02:55:19.110 --> 02:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't think it mandates at all
 
02:55:21.590 --> 02:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
that there are 65 board members because
 
02:55:23.550 --> 02:55:23.560 align:start position:0%
it said apportionment shall provide
 
02:55:23.560 --> 02:55:25.190 align:start position:0%
it said apportionment shall provide
flexibility

02:55:25.190 --> 02:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
02:55:27.190 --> 02:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
to the cooperative school district in
 
02:55:29.349 --> 02:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
meeting requirements of one person one
 
02:55:30.790 --> 02:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
vote doctrine
 
02:55:33.030 --> 02:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
so you're saying everybody gets at least
 
02:55:33.040 --> 02:55:34.150 align:start position:0%
so you're saying everybody gets at least
one

02:55:34.150 --> 02:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:55:36.389 --> 02:55:36.399 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't say then from that one we
 
02:55:38.790 --> 02:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
have to be fully proportional it says
 
02:55:41.110 --> 02:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
apportionment shall provide flexibility
 
02:55:43.590 --> 02:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
which means then you use common sense
 
02:55:46.070 --> 02:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
you can't have more than 15 how do we
 
02:55:48.550 --> 02:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
apportion the rest so i don't i think
 
02:55:49.910 --> 02:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
that was a
 
02:55:54.870 --> 02:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:58.389 --> 02:55:58.399 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent tanner
 
02:56:01.269 --> 02:56:01.279 align:start position:0%
thank you um i have a few comments i'd
 
02:56:04.950 --> 02:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
like to make one is uh you know i
 
02:56:04.960 --> 02:56:05.830 align:start position:0%
like to make one is uh you know i
i

02:56:05.830 --> 02:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:56:07.590 --> 02:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
worked in kearsarge it's a cooperative
 
02:56:09.990 --> 02:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
district i've spoken about it many many
 
02:56:13.190 --> 02:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
times probably too many times but
 
02:56:14.469 --> 02:56:14.479 align:start position:0%
they're against
 
02:56:17.349 --> 02:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
this kind of you know jolt to their
 
02:56:17.359 --> 02:56:18.309 align:start position:0%
this kind of you know jolt to their
system

02:56:18.309 --> 02:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:56:18.319 --> 02:56:19.190 align:start position:0%
system
um

02:56:19.190 --> 02:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:20.710 --> 02:56:20.720 align:start position:0%
we had
 
02:56:23.429 --> 02:56:23.439 align:start position:0%
in our in our in our testimony back and
 
02:56:25.590 --> 02:56:25.600 align:start position:0%
forth we had a lot of uh things that
 
02:56:27.230 --> 02:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
weren't answered because they were
 
02:56:27.240 --> 02:56:28.950 align:start position:0%
weren't answered because they were
hypotheticals

02:56:28.950 --> 02:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
hypotheticals
 
02:56:28.960 --> 02:56:30.070 align:start position:0%
hypotheticals
and

02:56:30.070 --> 02:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:56:33.349 --> 02:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
i think hypotheticals can easily equal
 
02:56:35.349 --> 02:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences and i think
 
02:56:37.670 --> 02:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
there's many that are
 
02:56:40.230 --> 02:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
fraught in this bill
 
02:56:41.269 --> 02:56:41.279 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:56:43.349 --> 02:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
we need to have a study of how many
 
02:56:45.750 --> 02:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
cooperative districts are dissatisfied
 
02:56:47.830 --> 02:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
with what they have
 
02:56:49.670 --> 02:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know why have a bill
 
02:56:51.110 --> 02:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
for just one
 
02:56:53.349 --> 02:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
one cooperative district
 
02:56:56.469 --> 02:56:56.479 align:start position:0%
that's having issues
 
02:56:57.670 --> 02:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
and i think that
 
02:56:57.680 --> 02:56:58.870 align:start position:0%
and i think that
[Music]

02:56:58.870 --> 02:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:57:00.790 --> 02:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
you know we're in the throes of
 
02:57:03.190 --> 02:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
redistricting right now
 
02:57:03.200 --> 02:57:04.070 align:start position:0%
redistricting right now
and

02:57:04.070 --> 02:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:57:05.190 --> 02:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
the people that worked on the
 
02:57:07.269 --> 02:57:07.279 align:start position:0%
redistricting committee if you talk to
 
02:57:08.429 --> 02:57:08.439 align:start position:0%
them about
 
02:57:11.349 --> 02:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
reapportionment and the different
 
02:57:11.359 --> 02:57:12.389 align:start position:0%
reapportionment and the different
uh

02:57:12.389 --> 02:57:12.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:57:14.710 --> 02:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
parameters and data that they had to
 
02:57:17.349 --> 02:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
work with in order to come up with
 
02:57:19.750 --> 02:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
whatever they had and even though they
 
02:57:22.070 --> 02:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
did that they still have these in
 
02:57:24.790 --> 02:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
particularly in rural areas where rural
 
02:57:26.309 --> 02:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
areas are where cooperative school
 
02:57:28.309 --> 02:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
districts are probably more prevalent
 
02:57:30.389 --> 02:57:30.399 align:start position:0%
but in rural areas even for the house
 
02:57:33.030 --> 02:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
they came up with floatarials again you
 
02:57:34.790 --> 02:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
know and i'm part of a flotarial i
 
02:57:36.550 --> 02:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
represent eight towns
 
02:57:38.950 --> 02:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
and some of those towns are pretty big
 
02:57:41.429 --> 02:57:41.439 align:start position:0%
and some of those towns are pretty small
 
02:57:44.389 --> 02:57:44.399 align:start position:0%
and everybody votes for me in those you
 
02:57:46.389 --> 02:57:46.399 align:start position:0%
know those eight towns so
 
02:57:49.269 --> 02:57:49.279 align:start position:0%
um and i guess the last thing is that
 
02:57:52.230 --> 02:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
the little little plug about those the
 
02:57:52.240 --> 02:57:53.510 align:start position:0%
the little little plug about those the
commissioners

02:57:53.510 --> 02:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
02:57:53.520 --> 02:57:55.030 align:start position:0%
commissioners
um

02:57:55.030 --> 02:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:56.950 --> 02:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
it that's in the senate now and it's
 
02:57:59.269 --> 02:57:59.279 align:start position:0%
been stuffed into interim study so
 
02:58:02.230 --> 02:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's not even an issue uh that
 
02:58:03.269 --> 02:58:03.279 align:start position:0%
we should
 
02:58:05.510 --> 02:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
be should have even been talking about
 
02:58:05.520 --> 02:58:06.389 align:start position:0%
be should have even been talking about
here

02:58:06.389 --> 02:58:06.399 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:58:06.399 --> 02:58:07.110 align:start position:0%
here
so

02:58:07.110 --> 02:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:58:09.030 --> 02:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
02:58:11.110 --> 02:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
the final word from me would be that i
 
02:58:12.870 --> 02:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
would vote for interim study i would
 
02:58:14.230 --> 02:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
vote that this
 
02:58:16.710 --> 02:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
this can go to a study committee as it
 
02:58:18.550 --> 02:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
should a commission like the school
 
02:58:18.560 --> 02:58:19.429 align:start position:0%
should a commission like the school
boards

02:58:19.429 --> 02:58:19.439 align:start position:0%
boards
 
02:58:19.439 --> 02:58:20.550 align:start position:0%
boards
uh

02:58:20.550 --> 02:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:58:22.950 --> 02:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
christina suggested i think that's
 
02:58:24.710 --> 02:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
that's the way to look at cooperative
 
02:58:26.550 --> 02:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
districts i think to throw something
 
02:58:28.550 --> 02:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
like this in a wrench in
 
02:58:28.560 --> 02:58:29.750 align:start position:0%
like this in a wrench in
um

02:58:29.750 --> 02:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:32.950 --> 02:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
particularly when i think my feeling is
 
02:58:35.349 --> 02:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
the majority of cooperative districts
 
02:58:36.950 --> 02:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
are moving along
 
02:58:39.269 --> 02:58:39.279 align:start position:0%
they're supporting their children in the
 
02:58:41.990 --> 02:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
in the in the school district uh and in
 
02:58:43.990 --> 02:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
the various towns they're forming their
 
02:58:46.710 --> 02:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
own culture and and community it's local
 
02:58:46.720 --> 02:58:47.750 align:start position:0%
own culture and and community it's local
control

02:58:47.750 --> 02:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
control
 
02:58:49.510 --> 02:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:58:51.630 --> 02:58:51.640 align:start position:0%
you know for us to to make a
 
02:58:53.830 --> 02:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all here at the
 
02:58:56.469 --> 02:58:56.479 align:start position:0%
at the state level uh and put our foot
 
02:58:59.349 --> 02:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
right on local control again i think it
 
02:59:02.230 --> 02:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
isn't necessary so i'll be voting no on
 
02:59:02.240 --> 02:59:05.349 align:start position:0%
isn't necessary so i'll be voting no on
this

02:59:05.349 --> 02:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:07.750 --> 02:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee
 
02:59:07.760 --> 02:59:11.349 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee
yes

02:59:11.349 --> 02:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:13.030 --> 02:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:59:16.309 --> 02:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
i'm representative lane and i'm a sub so
 
02:59:18.070 --> 02:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
i feel a little out of place maybe
 
02:59:19.830 --> 02:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
commenting but
 
02:59:22.309 --> 02:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
i listen pretty hard to what was said
 
02:59:22.319 --> 02:59:23.510 align:start position:0%
i listen pretty hard to what was said
and

02:59:23.510 --> 02:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:59:25.750 --> 02:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
i'm also a lawyer and i think the
 
02:59:27.910 --> 02:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
gentleman from the new hampshire school
 
02:59:29.510 --> 02:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
board association
 
02:59:31.269 --> 02:59:31.279 align:start position:0%
reminded everyone that there are a lot
 
02:59:33.830 --> 02:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
of legal issues here and there are a lot
 
02:59:37.030 --> 02:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
and i would particularly point to the
 
02:59:38.790 --> 02:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
language in
 
02:59:41.429 --> 02:59:41.439 align:start position:0%
lines 20 to 23
 
02:59:44.230 --> 02:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
on page two of the amendment
 
02:59:46.469 --> 02:59:46.479 align:start position:0%
because they're problematic and they
 
02:59:48.950 --> 02:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
require reapportionment for all the
 
02:59:51.670 --> 02:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
options not just for option a but for
 
02:59:53.750 --> 02:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
all the options and if you have
 
02:59:56.389 --> 02:59:56.399 align:start position:0%
something that is not based
 
02:59:58.790 --> 02:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
if you have at large you are requiring
 
03:00:00.790 --> 03:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
reapportionment and that's what the
 
03:00:04.150 --> 03:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
language says and we're not amending it
 
03:00:04.160 --> 03:00:06.150 align:start position:0%
language says and we're not amending it
um

03:00:06.150 --> 03:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:08.870 --> 03:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
i also am on the redistricting committee
 
03:00:11.510 --> 03:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
and i echo what representative tanner
 
03:00:13.429 --> 03:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
said about the difficulties that you
 
03:00:15.429 --> 03:00:15.439 align:start position:0%
face when you're doing this
 
03:00:17.110 --> 03:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
i'm also concerned that we're throwing
 
03:00:20.309 --> 03:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
out the one-person one-vote theory
 
03:00:22.870 --> 03:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
and i haven't heard anything that says
 
03:00:25.510 --> 03:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
we need to act on this now that this is
 
03:00:28.230 --> 03:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
so important that it has to be done now
 
03:00:30.230 --> 03:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
so why don't we take the time to study
 
03:00:32.790 --> 03:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
it and do it right because we can do it
 
03:00:35.670 --> 03:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
better i think we heard issues we're not
 
03:00:36.950 --> 03:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
saying that those issues aren't
 
03:00:38.630 --> 03:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
important we're just saying
 
03:00:41.269 --> 03:00:41.279 align:start position:0%
one size does not feel fit all and new
 
03:00:43.269 --> 03:00:43.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire is known for local control and
 
03:00:44.870 --> 03:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
i think we should be
 
03:00:46.790 --> 03:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
honest to that goal
 
03:00:49.110 --> 03:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:00:54.389 --> 03:00:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:55.349 --> 03:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to do is i'm going to
 
03:00:57.670 --> 03:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
take about a five minute caucus here
 
03:01:02.710 --> 03:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:11.510 --> 03:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:13.590 --> 03:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
yeah that that's a that's probably a
 
03:01:14.950 --> 03:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
good idea
 
03:01:14.960 --> 03:01:18.710 align:start position:0%
good idea
well

03:01:18.710 --> 03:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:21.429 --> 03:01:21.439 align:start position:0%
no we we the other bills but no we have
 
03:01:23.269 --> 03:01:23.279 align:start position:0%
this well we could
 
03:01:25.190 --> 03:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
pick this up later
 
03:01:27.510 --> 03:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh but um what time do you have to be
 
03:01:33.590 --> 03:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:33.600 --> 03:01:35.190 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:01:35.190 --> 03:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:01:37.429 --> 03:01:37.439 align:start position:0%
how about if we recess this one right
 
03:01:39.830 --> 03:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
now and we'll go on to several the other
 
03:01:41.510 --> 03:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
well we can't get all the bills done
 
03:01:43.429 --> 03:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
anyways because the amendments aren't
 
03:01:45.590 --> 03:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
done yet
 
03:01:47.670 --> 03:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
they're coming back so let me pick a
 
03:01:48.950 --> 03:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
couple of these bills we might be able
 
03:01:52.870 --> 03:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:52.880 --> 03:01:53.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:01:53.750 --> 03:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:57.750 --> 03:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
let's look at uh sb 238 relative special
 
03:01:59.510 --> 03:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
education services in charter public
 
03:01:59.520 --> 03:02:00.469 align:start position:0%
education services in charter public
schools

03:02:00.469 --> 03:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
schools
 
03:02:00.479 --> 03:02:25.830 align:start position:0%
schools
238

03:02:25.830 --> 03:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:28.790 --> 03:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
okay 238 is relative to special
 
03:02:30.389 --> 03:02:30.399 align:start position:0%
education services in charter public
 
03:02:32.150 --> 03:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
schools going to hand the gavel over to
 
03:02:34.550 --> 03:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
03:02:37.269 --> 03:02:37.279 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman uh call on
 
03:02:39.670 --> 03:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
representative vlad for a motion i'd
 
03:02:42.790 --> 03:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
like to move ought to pass on 238
 
03:02:45.750 --> 03:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
and is there a second
 
03:02:47.429 --> 03:02:47.439 align:start position:0%
representative baum
 
03:02:49.990 --> 03:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh discussion do you have uh something
 
03:02:52.309 --> 03:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
further i believe
 
03:02:56.950 --> 03:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:56.960 --> 03:02:59.110 align:start position:0%
 
1765

03:02:59.110 --> 03:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
1765
 
03:02:59.120 --> 03:03:00.070 align:start position:0%
1765
h

03:03:00.070 --> 03:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
h
 
03:03:04.550 --> 03:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:06.950 --> 03:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh discussion on the amendment
 
03:03:09.429 --> 03:03:09.439 align:start position:0%
the amendment deals with and recognizes
 
03:03:11.590 --> 03:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
the need for an mou but i think that the
 
03:03:14.550 --> 03:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment also
 
03:03:16.950 --> 03:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
captures the rationale and reasoning
 
03:03:18.790 --> 03:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
behind it a charter public school and a
 
03:03:20.309 --> 03:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
school district of residence for one or
 
03:03:21.750 --> 03:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
more students of the charter public
 
03:03:24.710 --> 03:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
schools shall enter into a mou to ensure
 
03:03:26.230 --> 03:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
compliance with state and federal law
 
03:03:29.750 --> 03:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
for providing special education services
 
03:03:31.429 --> 03:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
that's in in the bill
 
03:03:34.950 --> 03:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
and it goes on and it keeps part b
 
03:03:37.030 --> 03:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh the the department shall develop
 
03:03:39.269 --> 03:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
that's unchanged but unc prior to the
 
03:03:40.710 --> 03:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
start of a school year the charter
 
03:03:42.070 --> 03:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
public school and the school district
 
03:03:43.990 --> 03:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
shall review and update the mou to
 
03:03:45.590 --> 03:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
ensure compliance with state and federal
 
03:03:47.910 --> 03:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
law and responsibilities to provide
 
03:03:49.190 --> 03:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
services in accordance with
 
03:03:51.750 --> 03:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
individualized education plans it takes
 
03:03:53.110 --> 03:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
away the
 
03:03:55.269 --> 03:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
the time frame of two weeks
 
03:03:57.590 --> 03:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
it says prior to the school year and i
 
03:03:59.590 --> 03:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
think it takes some of this
 
03:04:03.190 --> 03:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
this uh um the specifics that we had
 
03:04:04.870 --> 03:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
there with the uh two week period of
 
03:04:04.880 --> 03:04:05.750 align:start position:0%
there with the uh two week period of
time

03:04:05.750 --> 03:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:04:08.150 --> 03:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
and and makes it more realistic what's
 
03:04:10.389 --> 03:04:10.399 align:start position:0%
going to actually happen
 
03:04:13.910 --> 03:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
and so i'd like to support and and um
 
03:04:15.510 --> 03:04:15.520 align:start position:0%

03:07:14.230 --> 03:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
some discuss we heard in testimony on
 
03:07:15.590 --> 03:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
this bill this is the bill that deals
 
03:07:18.150 --> 03:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
with concurrent dual enrollment where
 
03:07:19.830 --> 03:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
through working with the community
 
03:07:21.830 --> 03:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
college system in new hampshire
 
03:07:23.670 --> 03:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
students can enroll while taking a
 
03:07:23.680 --> 03:07:24.710 align:start position:0%
students can enroll while taking a
course

03:07:24.710 --> 03:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
course
 
03:07:27.590 --> 03:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
either at the premises of the college or
 
03:07:28.630 --> 03:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
at the
 
03:07:31.190 --> 03:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
the residence school
 
03:07:32.550 --> 03:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
and there's certain conditions which
 
03:07:34.150 --> 03:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
they must meet in order to do that
 
03:07:35.349 --> 03:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
that's spelled out in the national
 
03:07:36.630 --> 03:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
alliance for
 
03:07:38.790 --> 03:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment partnerships
 
03:07:41.910 --> 03:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
that they would receive 150 dollars uh
 
03:07:43.670 --> 03:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
support from the state which we
 
03:07:45.590 --> 03:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate each year but they'd be now
 
03:07:46.870 --> 03:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
working directly with the community
 
03:07:48.309 --> 03:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
college system on
 
03:07:50.230 --> 03:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
there was question whether this would be
 
03:07:53.030 --> 03:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
available to students in the private
 
03:07:53.040 --> 03:07:54.550 align:start position:0%
available to students in the private
school

03:07:54.550 --> 03:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:07:56.710 --> 03:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
and then there was concerns about is the
 
03:07:58.150 --> 03:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
student that's attending this private
 
03:08:00.309 --> 03:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
school from the state of new hampshire a
 
03:08:02.389 --> 03:08:02.399 align:start position:0%
resident of new hampshire or a resident
 
03:08:05.349 --> 03:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
of florida attending that private school
 
03:08:06.550 --> 03:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
it could be holderness it could be
 
03:08:08.309 --> 03:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
kimball union academy it could be any of
 
03:08:09.990 --> 03:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
those fine schools which we have in the
 
03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:11.269 align:start position:0%
those fine schools which we have in the
state

03:08:11.269 --> 03:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:08:13.750 --> 03:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
and the concerns were raised that there
 
03:08:15.830 --> 03:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
needs to be an amendment for this so
 
03:08:18.150 --> 03:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
that the award of the 150 is for a
 
03:08:21.750 --> 03:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
student who resides in our state
 
03:08:24.469 --> 03:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
but may attend non-public school public
 
03:08:27.349 --> 03:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
high schools and that the non-public
 
03:08:29.830 --> 03:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
school has looked for you know and
 
03:08:32.070 --> 03:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
entered into a policy statement
 
03:08:35.110 --> 03:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
allowing this to occur um so the
 
03:08:37.990 --> 03:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
language in the amendment does all that
 
03:08:39.750 --> 03:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
and the language has basically been
 
03:08:41.349 --> 03:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
submitted to us now by the community
 
03:08:43.030 --> 03:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
college system new hampshire
 
03:08:44.469 --> 03:08:44.479 align:start position:0%
school board of each school district and
 
03:08:46.230 --> 03:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
governing body of each institution in
 
03:08:48.550 --> 03:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
the case of a non-residential non-public
 
03:08:50.630 --> 03:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
school which opt to participate shall
 
03:08:52.870 --> 03:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
develop and adopt a policy permitting
 
03:08:54.790 --> 03:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
students residing in the district or in
 
03:08:57.110 --> 03:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
attendance at the non-public school who
 
03:08:59.750 --> 03:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
are in grades 10 11 and 12.
 
03:08:59.760 --> 03:09:00.790 align:start position:0%
are in grades 10 11 and 12.
so

03:09:00.790 --> 03:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:09:02.550 --> 03:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
this i think takes care of many of those
 
03:09:04.389 --> 03:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
issues which we were discussing earlier
 
03:09:05.990 --> 03:09:06.000 align:start position:0%

chairman cordelia president ladd this is
 
03:09:21.670 --> 03:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
just a question for my own edification
 
03:09:23.030 --> 03:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
if a
 
03:09:25.110 --> 03:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
student in one of those academies that
 
03:09:27.429 --> 03:09:27.439 align:start position:0%

uh does that school pay the fee
 
03:09:38.309 --> 03:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:39.990 --> 03:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
i would have to
 
03:09:42.150 --> 03:09:42.160 align:start position:0%

03:09:45.830 --> 03:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
community college system

no representative woodcock that in that
 
03:10:02.790 --> 03:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
instance the the program that's
 
03:10:04.790 --> 03:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
established to fund these courses would
 
03:10:07.429 --> 03:10:07.439 align:start position:0%
pay for that this amendment limits the
 
03:10:08.550 --> 03:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
limits the
 
03:10:11.030 --> 03:10:11.040 align:start position:0%

03:10:18.160 --> 03:10:19.269 align:start position:0%
schools
so

03:10:19.269 --> 03:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:10:19.279 --> 03:10:20.550 align:start position:0%

03:10:20.560 --> 03:10:21.349 align:start position:0%
um
the

03:10:21.349 --> 03:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:10:23.269 --> 03:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
state program that appropriates the
 
03:10:25.349 --> 03:10:25.359 align:start position:0%
funding for the
 
03:10:27.190 --> 03:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
to basically pay the students tuition
 
03:10:29.190 --> 03:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
would would pay for those courses does
 
03:10:30.550 --> 03:10:30.560 align:start position:0%

i think so follow up
 
03:10:33.910 --> 03:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you so in representative
 
03:10:36.229 --> 03:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
ladd's example of a youngster from
 
03:10:39.030 --> 03:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
florida who attends the resident
 
03:10:40.469 --> 03:10:40.479 align:start position:0%
non-public school
 
03:10:43.349 --> 03:10:43.359 align:start position:0%
would they be allowed to attend this um
 
03:10:44.710 --> 03:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
the amendment the amended language does
 
03:10:46.950 --> 03:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
not include that student
 
03:10:49.269 --> 03:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
um it for two reasons one the student is
 
03:10:51.190 --> 03:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
not a new hampshire resident but two
 
03:10:53.830 --> 03:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
this amendment online uh let's see line
 
03:10:53.840 --> 03:10:55.110 align:start position:0%
this amendment online uh let's see line
seven

03:10:55.110 --> 03:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
seven
 
03:10:56.870 --> 03:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
line eleven line seventeen talks about
 
03:10:59.030 --> 03:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
non-public and non-residential the
 
03:11:00.710 --> 03:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
intent was to capture those schools that
 
03:11:02.630 --> 03:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
are kind of normally part of uh new
 
03:11:04.710 --> 03:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire's high school ecosystem like
 
03:11:06.469 --> 03:11:06.479 align:start position:0%
the the trinity and the bishop brady and
 
03:11:08.790 --> 03:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing but differentiate
 
03:11:09.990 --> 03:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
those from the schools that are really
 
03:11:10.950 --> 03:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
03:11:12.630 --> 03:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
kind of separate unto themselves but
 
03:11:14.150 --> 03:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
those boarding school environments that
 
03:11:16.070 --> 03:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
really haven't ever been part of this
 
03:11:18.070 --> 03:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
program and and we wouldn't imagine that
 
03:11:18.950 --> 03:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
there'd be
 
03:11:20.710 --> 03:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
um much call for them to become part of
 
03:11:23.670 --> 03:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
the program thank you thank you chairman
 
03:11:27.030 --> 03:11:27.040 align:start position:0%

03:11:29.910 --> 03:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
thank you miss reed
 
03:11:32.469 --> 03:11:32.479 align:start position:0%

03:11:35.670 --> 03:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:39.030 --> 03:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
we'll do a uh hand vote for the uh
 
03:11:41.110 --> 03:11:41.120 align:start position:0%

for the uh amendment
1758

03:11:45.910 --> 03:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:49.030 --> 03:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
looks to be unanimous
 
03:11:50.950 --> 03:11:50.960 align:start position:0%

this act that we're going to pass today
 
03:53:53.429 --> 03:53:53.439 align:start position:0%
and this amendment
 
03:53:56.389 --> 03:53:56.399 align:start position:0%

03:53:57.990 --> 03:53:58.000 align:start position:0%

amendment in front of us and this is not
 
03:54:23.189 --> 03:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
03:54:25.269 --> 03:54:25.279 align:start position:0%
this is a kind of an unusual amendment
 
03:54:26.790 --> 03:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
the way we're doing it
 
03:54:28.870 --> 03:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
it's not sponsored by any specific
 
03:54:31.189 --> 03:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
legislator it's sponsored by the entire
 
03:54:31.199 --> 03:54:33.269 align:start position:0%

03:55:00.389 --> 03:55:00.399 align:start position:0%
this act shall be known as the jason
 
03:55:04.389 --> 03:55:04.399 align:start position:0%
dickey suicide prevention act
 
03:55:06.389 --> 03:55:06.399 align:start position:0%
that's my motion
 
03:55:06.399 --> 03:55:07.910 align:start position:0%
that's my motion
and

03:55:07.910 --> 03:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:55:10.070 --> 03:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
and represent representative miler

03:55:15.349 --> 03:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
i guess there's you know i can read this
 
03:55:18.309 --> 03:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
so that it's it's very succinct and in
 
03:55:20.790 --> 03:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
short but very much to the topic
 
03:55:22.870 --> 03:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
and then when i did some research on
 
03:55:24.389 --> 03:55:24.399 align:start position:0%
this over the last several days i went
 
03:55:27.349 --> 03:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
to the national suicide prevention
 
03:55:29.590 --> 03:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
as listed on and i understand they have
 
03:55:31.990 --> 03:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
a new telephone number too 988 that's
 
03:55:32.000 --> 03:55:33.830 align:start position:0%
a new telephone number too 988 that's
fantastic

03:55:33.830 --> 03:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
fantastic
 
03:55:36.309 --> 03:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
um and also i went and also looked at
 
03:55:38.150 --> 03:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
some of these cards which are being used
 
03:55:40.870 --> 03:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
already elsewhere in the nation at somo
 
03:55:42.630 --> 03:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
states which is also something that
 
03:55:44.389 --> 03:55:44.399 align:start position:0%
hopefully our state will be on top of
 
03:55:45.990 --> 03:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
very shortly here
 
03:55:48.950 --> 03:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
but the act reads short titled this act
 
03:55:50.950 --> 03:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
shall be known as the jason dickey
 
03:55:53.750 --> 03:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
suicide prevention act
 
03:55:55.670 --> 03:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
and what we've been mended the bill by
 
03:55:57.670 --> 03:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
saying the national suicide prevention
 
03:55:59.590 --> 03:55:59.600 align:start position:0%
lifeline shall be labeled on student
 
03:56:01.990 --> 03:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
identification cards and include the
 
03:56:03.910 --> 03:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
telephone number national suicide
 
03:56:09.110 --> 03:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:14.309 --> 03:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:18.150 --> 03:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:20.389 --> 03:56:20.399 align:start position:0%
this is unusual too for the discussion
 
03:56:23.750 --> 03:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:25.429 --> 03:56:25.439 align:start position:0%

taking place during the meeting by the
 
04:02:45.349 --> 04:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
school board
 
04:02:45.359 --> 04:02:46.150 align:start position:0%
school board
so

04:02:46.150 --> 04:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:02:48.070 --> 04:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
04:02:50.309 --> 04:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
says that
 
04:02:53.030 --> 04:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
comment periods shall be provided for
 
04:02:55.429 --> 04:02:55.439 align:start position:0%
public input
 
04:02:57.590 --> 04:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
for the agenda items
 
04:02:59.990 --> 04:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
before board action is taken
 
04:03:02.070 --> 04:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
and she'll also be provided for
 
04:03:05.110 --> 04:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
non-agenda items
 
04:03:08.550 --> 04:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
we had discussion about i think the
 
04:03:10.469 --> 04:03:10.479 align:start position:0%
30-minute provision
 
04:03:12.710 --> 04:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
um in the bill as it came over from the
 
04:03:12.720 --> 04:03:13.670 align:start position:0%
um in the bill as it came over from the
senate

04:03:13.670 --> 04:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
senate
 
04:03:16.070 --> 04:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh so i added that
 
04:03:18.309 --> 04:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
public comment should be no less than 30
 
04:03:20.469 --> 04:03:20.479 align:start position:0%
minutes unless comp
 
04:03:22.550 --> 04:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
comments are completed earlier than that
 
04:03:25.030 --> 04:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
so you don't have to you know wait 30
 
04:03:27.189 --> 04:03:27.199 align:start position:0%
minutes you know if only one person or
 
04:03:29.510 --> 04:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
no people are speaking
 
04:03:31.349 --> 04:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
during that period
 
04:03:37.189 --> 04:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:40.710 --> 04:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the second
 
04:03:42.469 --> 04:03:42.479 align:start position:0%
no thank you
 
04:03:45.110 --> 04:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
open to the committee represent milor uh
 
04:03:47.349 --> 04:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:03:49.990 --> 04:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh this uh
 
04:03:52.150 --> 04:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
kind of falls into the line when we talk
 
04:03:54.469 --> 04:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
about do we need to
 
04:03:57.670 --> 04:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
legislate local issues
 
04:03:59.750 --> 04:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
there's no question in my mind of the
 
04:04:01.269 --> 04:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
need to have
 
04:04:03.030 --> 04:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
public comment
 
04:04:05.030 --> 04:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
the need to have input from parents and
 
04:04:07.030 --> 04:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
from citizens
 
04:04:09.269 --> 04:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
dealing with issues facing school boards
 
04:04:09.279 --> 04:04:10.790 align:start position:0%
dealing with issues facing school boards
but

04:04:10.790 --> 04:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:04:12.950 --> 04:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
this is a local issue
 
04:04:14.469 --> 04:04:14.479 align:start position:0%
this is clearly
 
04:04:17.269 --> 04:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
in the design of the prerogative of
 
04:04:17.279 --> 04:04:18.309 align:start position:0%
in the design of the prerogative of
local

04:04:18.309 --> 04:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
local
 
04:04:20.550 --> 04:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
school districts and school boards
 
04:04:22.790 --> 04:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
to create the policies
 
04:04:24.790 --> 04:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
and the process for that input to take
 
04:04:27.030 --> 04:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
place i don't believe that we need to at
 
04:04:28.870 --> 04:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
the state level
 
04:04:31.110 --> 04:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
to begin mandating
 
04:04:32.870 --> 04:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
what needs to be done at a school board
 
04:04:35.990 --> 04:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
meeting this is their responsibility
 
04:04:38.389 --> 04:04:38.399 align:start position:0%
if people are upset with how it happens
 
04:04:42.550 --> 04:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
they can elect vote them out of office
 
04:04:44.630 --> 04:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
with their vote and so i don't think
 
04:04:46.389 --> 04:04:46.399 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate for us to be making
 
04:04:47.750 --> 04:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
this kind of a
 
04:04:50.469 --> 04:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
mandate from a legislative standpoint
 
04:04:52.070 --> 04:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:04:55.910 --> 04:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
further discussion representatives
 
04:04:57.590 --> 04:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
clearly leaving it up to the school
 
04:05:00.070 --> 04:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
boards has not worked
 
04:05:01.870 --> 04:05:01.880 align:start position:0%
we have seen lots of
 
04:05:01.880 --> 04:05:03.189 align:start position:0%
we have seen lots of
[Music]

04:05:03.189 --> 04:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:05:03.199 --> 04:05:05.269 align:start position:0%
[Music]
issues

04:05:05.269 --> 04:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
issues
 
04:05:07.590 --> 04:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
where school boards did not have public
 
04:05:10.389 --> 04:05:10.399 align:start position:0%
comment or restricted people
 
04:05:13.349 --> 04:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
to just the agenda items and would not
 
04:05:15.269 --> 04:05:15.279 align:start position:0%
put on the agenda things that
 
04:05:17.830 --> 04:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
townspeople were concerned about
 
04:05:19.670 --> 04:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
and consequently
 
04:05:22.309 --> 04:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
parents have become very upset and very
 
04:05:24.630 --> 04:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
distrustful of school boards
 
04:05:24.640 --> 04:05:25.670 align:start position:0%
distrustful of school boards
and

04:05:25.670 --> 04:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:05:28.950 --> 04:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
that is not a situation we want to have
 
04:05:31.110 --> 04:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
what would be much better is just say
 
04:05:33.349 --> 04:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
give a public comment period
 
04:05:35.990 --> 04:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
everybody has their say and then
 
04:05:37.830 --> 04:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
i think people i think
 
04:05:37.840 --> 04:05:39.349 align:start position:0%
i think people i think
um

04:05:39.349 --> 04:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:41.429 --> 04:05:41.439 align:start position:0%
members of the district will be much
 
04:05:44.950 --> 04:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
less likely to get upset and
 
04:05:46.469 --> 04:05:46.479 align:start position:0%
some of the things we've heard about
 
04:05:48.389 --> 04:05:48.399 align:start position:0%
shouting and various other things going
 
04:05:48.399 --> 04:05:49.110 align:start position:0%
shouting and various other things going
on

04:05:49.110 --> 04:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:05:52.309 --> 04:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:53.510 --> 04:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
04:05:53.520 --> 04:05:55.030 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
woodcock

04:05:55.030 --> 04:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
woodcock
 
04:05:57.189 --> 04:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman um
 
04:05:58.870 --> 04:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
the just to
 
04:06:00.870 --> 04:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
clarify or at least uh
 
04:06:02.550 --> 04:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
think about what the president like has
 
04:06:05.189 --> 04:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
just said this amendment doesn't
 
04:06:07.030 --> 04:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
allow public comment
 
04:06:09.590 --> 04:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh verbatim it allows public comment for
 
04:06:11.269 --> 04:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
items that are already on he was talking
 
04:06:12.630 --> 04:06:12.640 align:start position:0%
about there's talk about the amendment
 
04:06:12.640 --> 04:06:13.750 align:start position:0%
about there's talk about the amendment
says

04:06:13.750 --> 04:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
says
 
04:06:16.950 --> 04:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
um lines 13 14 and 15 for action it's
 
04:06:18.630 --> 04:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
already on the agenda it doesn't talk
 
04:06:22.070 --> 04:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
but that wasn't that wasn't my point um
 
04:06:24.229 --> 04:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
this is for reverend cordelia he did the
 
04:06:26.150 --> 04:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
motion of the
 
04:06:28.550 --> 04:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
amendment my question is if i want to
 
04:06:30.710 --> 04:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
make sure i'm reading this correctly or
 
04:06:32.630 --> 04:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps incorrectly
 
04:06:35.110 --> 04:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
um it identifies public comment period
 
04:06:36.710 --> 04:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
the third minute 30 minutes or i think
 
04:06:38.150 --> 04:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
you said less plan so it doesn't if it
 
04:06:40.150 --> 04:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't finish
 
04:06:42.150 --> 04:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
but then it says
 
04:06:43.670 --> 04:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
provided for
 
04:06:46.550 --> 04:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
agenda items before board action is
 
04:06:46.560 --> 04:06:47.670 align:start position:0%
agenda items before board action is
taken

04:06:47.670 --> 04:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
taken
 
04:06:50.070 --> 04:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
a and then again
 
04:06:50.080 --> 04:06:51.189 align:start position:0%
a and then again
before

04:06:51.189 --> 04:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:06:54.790 --> 04:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
non-agenda items so does that mean
 
04:06:54.800 --> 04:06:55.830 align:start position:0%
non-agenda items so does that mean
that

04:06:55.830 --> 04:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:06:58.710 --> 04:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
since there's seven or eight items on a
 
04:07:00.389 --> 04:07:00.399 align:start position:0%
school board agenda
 
04:07:02.950 --> 04:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
right so if i read that if i want to
 
04:07:05.510 --> 04:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
play the flip side that means after each
 
04:07:08.630 --> 04:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
before each item is voted i have a
 
04:07:10.630 --> 04:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
public comment period because this says
 
04:07:13.110 --> 04:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
before board action is taken
 
04:07:15.830 --> 04:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
up on agenda items so
 
04:07:18.229 --> 04:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that that could be
 
04:07:18.239 --> 04:07:19.510 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that that could be
read

04:07:19.510 --> 04:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
read
 
04:07:19.520 --> 04:07:20.229 align:start position:0%
read
to

04:07:20.229 --> 04:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:07:22.150 --> 04:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
that may not be your intent it seems to
 
04:07:23.910 --> 04:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
me it could be ready to say well this
 
04:07:26.309 --> 04:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
says i did before board action is taken
 
04:07:28.870 --> 04:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
so the board individually votes on each
 
04:07:28.880 --> 04:07:29.910 align:start position:0%
so the board individually votes on each
action

04:07:29.910 --> 04:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
action
 
04:07:31.349 --> 04:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
and so we stop
 
04:07:32.950 --> 04:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
would do dialogues then they have public
 
04:07:35.269 --> 04:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
comment then action then the another
 
04:07:37.429 --> 04:07:37.439 align:start position:0%
something comes up board public comments
 
04:07:39.750 --> 04:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
in action is that is that can that be
 
04:07:42.710 --> 04:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
read this way or am i reading it wrong
 
04:07:44.229 --> 04:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh uh how about i'm talking to
 
04:07:47.429 --> 04:07:47.439 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli cordell yes
 
04:07:49.910 --> 04:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um i i do not believe that is
 
04:07:52.229 --> 04:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
the case i i think that um
 
04:07:54.309 --> 04:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
a public comment period
 
04:07:58.229 --> 04:07:58.239 align:start position:0%
um at the beginning or somewhere before
 
04:07:58.239 --> 04:07:59.269 align:start position:0%
um at the beginning or somewhere before
um

04:07:59.269 --> 04:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:59.279 --> 04:08:00.630 align:start position:0%
um
uh

04:08:00.630 --> 04:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:08:02.550 --> 04:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
gen items are discussed
 
04:08:02.560 --> 04:08:03.429 align:start position:0%
gen items are discussed
um

04:08:03.429 --> 04:08:03.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:07.110 --> 04:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
would satisfy this provision
 
04:08:09.030 --> 04:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
if the board wanted to
 
04:08:09.040 --> 04:08:10.870 align:start position:0%
if the board wanted to
have

04:08:10.870 --> 04:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:08:13.750 --> 04:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
a public comment before an agenda item i
 
04:08:15.429 --> 04:08:15.439 align:start position:0%
would think that that would certainly be
 
04:08:17.590 --> 04:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
within their purview for instance if you
 
04:08:17.600 --> 04:08:18.630 align:start position:0%
within their purview for instance if you
were

04:08:18.630 --> 04:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:08:21.269 --> 04:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
talking about several things um proven
 
04:08:23.269 --> 04:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
minutes so forth
 
04:08:25.990 --> 04:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
and then had a
 
04:08:28.309 --> 04:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
discussion period on um
 
04:08:30.309 --> 04:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
new bus routes or something i think it
 
04:08:33.590 --> 04:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
would be totally uh appropriate um and
 
04:08:36.309 --> 04:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh in line with this amendment to have a
 
04:08:38.229 --> 04:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
comment period specifically for that
 
04:08:41.030 --> 04:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
agenda item uh but uh
 
04:08:43.030 --> 04:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that uh it should be
 
04:08:45.910 --> 04:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
read that uh public comment before each
 
04:08:49.349 --> 04:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
agenda item is required
 
04:08:51.670 --> 04:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
mary paul that's true yes jeremy thank
 
04:08:51.680 --> 04:08:52.389 align:start position:0%
mary paul that's true yes jeremy thank
you

04:08:52.389 --> 04:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:08:53.990 --> 04:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
so does
 
04:08:55.510 --> 04:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
i understand what you're glad i
 
04:08:56.550 --> 04:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
understand the intent of what you're
 
04:08:58.630 --> 04:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
saying i think the intent is accurate
 
04:09:01.030 --> 04:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
i'm just still reading it as that is it
 
04:09:03.510 --> 04:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
seems to me this may be quiet we
 
04:09:05.750 --> 04:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
may be required
 
04:09:08.309 --> 04:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh so we do the the bus route thing but
 
04:09:11.670 --> 04:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
now the next thing is on uh uh
 
04:09:13.510 --> 04:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
athletic athletic participation the
 
04:09:15.030 --> 04:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
third thing is on the lunch new price of
 
04:09:17.429 --> 04:09:17.439 align:start position:0%
the lunches so after each thing
 
04:09:18.790 --> 04:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
that i hear
 
04:09:20.149 --> 04:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
are you saying that we're going to start
 
04:09:20.159 --> 04:09:21.110 align:start position:0%
are you saying that we're going to start
the

04:09:21.110 --> 04:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:09:23.110 --> 04:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
board meeting after we get two minutes
 
04:09:24.389 --> 04:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
if you have public comment on any of
 
04:09:26.630 --> 04:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
this stuff that make it now
 
04:09:28.790 --> 04:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
but i read that to say is as
 
04:09:30.710 --> 04:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
provided before each board action so
 
04:09:32.710 --> 04:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
there should be dialogue before the the
 
04:09:34.389 --> 04:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
transportation there should be dialogue
 
04:09:36.309 --> 04:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
before the athletic participation there
 
04:09:38.389 --> 04:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
should be dialogue before the meal price
 
04:09:38.399 --> 04:09:39.349 align:start position:0%
should be dialogue before the meal price
increase

04:09:39.349 --> 04:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
increase
 
04:09:41.750 --> 04:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
um i just i just that's just how i read
 
04:09:41.760 --> 04:09:43.110 align:start position:0%
um i just i just that's just how i read
it

04:09:43.110 --> 04:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:09:45.349 --> 04:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
represent cordelia you want to respond
 
04:09:48.550 --> 04:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
um it says public infor input for agenda
 
04:09:50.309 --> 04:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
items it does not
 
04:09:53.269 --> 04:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
say republican for input for each agenda
 
04:09:53.279 --> 04:10:06.870 align:start position:0%
say republican for input for each agenda
item

04:10:06.870 --> 04:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:08.790 --> 04:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
the same thing happens
 
04:10:10.229 --> 04:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
yeah follow up and thank you
 
04:10:12.229 --> 04:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
representative i apologize thank you for
 
04:10:13.830 --> 04:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
interrupting me the same thing says it
 
04:10:15.590 --> 04:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
shall be for the non-agenda items so it
 
04:10:16.790 --> 04:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
just seems to me that that's each
 
04:10:19.990 --> 04:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
individual item as a line
 
04:10:21.990 --> 04:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
i understand you're good your intent is
 
04:10:23.750 --> 04:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
valid i just think this could make a
 
04:10:28.550 --> 04:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:28.560 --> 04:10:31.110 align:start position:0%
 
representatives

04:10:31.110 --> 04:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
04:10:33.910 --> 04:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
i agree with representative cordelie if
 
04:10:36.070 --> 04:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
they want if he wanted it to be what you
 
04:10:39.269 --> 04:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
say it would say for each agenda item
 
04:10:41.590 --> 04:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
before board action is taken instead it
 
04:10:41.600 --> 04:10:42.469 align:start position:0%
before board action is taken instead it
says

04:10:42.469 --> 04:10:42.479 align:start position:0%
says
 
04:10:45.910 --> 04:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
agenda items so we can talk about all of
 
04:10:48.870 --> 04:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
the agenda items before and you could
 
04:10:51.189 --> 04:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
think of it as any board action is taken
 
04:10:52.389 --> 04:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
so it's not
 
04:10:54.469 --> 04:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
it's not on a particular item it's any
 
04:10:57.429 --> 04:10:57.439 align:start position:0%
board action so before any of the agenda
 
04:10:57.439 --> 04:10:58.710 align:start position:0%
board action so before any of the agenda
items

04:10:58.710 --> 04:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
items
 
04:11:01.349 --> 04:11:01.359 align:start position:0%
are acted on by the board there can be
 
04:11:03.510 --> 04:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
public input and that's basically what
 
04:11:05.830 --> 04:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
it says and then the end shall also be
 
04:11:08.309 --> 04:11:08.319 align:start position:0%
provided for non-agenda items
 
04:11:10.229 --> 04:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
that's why it has
 
04:11:10.239 --> 04:11:11.590 align:start position:0%
that's why it has
multiple

04:11:11.590 --> 04:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
04:11:13.910 --> 04:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
comment sections because the school
 
04:11:15.910 --> 04:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
board could say oh we only had a couple
 
04:11:17.269 --> 04:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
comments on
 
04:11:20.469 --> 04:11:20.479 align:start position:0%
agenda items so people want non-agenda
 
04:11:23.110 --> 04:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
items you can do it now or if there's a
 
04:11:25.429 --> 04:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
lot of comment on agenda items the
 
04:11:27.349 --> 04:11:27.359 align:start position:0%
non-agenda items don't need to be
 
04:11:29.910 --> 04:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
commented on before the agenda items
 
04:11:29.920 --> 04:11:31.189 align:start position:0%
commented on before the agenda items
right

04:11:31.189 --> 04:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:11:33.030 --> 04:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
so at the end
 
04:11:35.110 --> 04:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
that would be the second comment section
 
04:11:38.389 --> 04:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
at the end and then any non-agenda items
 
04:11:40.790 --> 04:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
could be brought up then so it's left
 
04:11:40.800 --> 04:11:42.070 align:start position:0%
could be brought up then so it's left
flexible

04:11:42.070 --> 04:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
flexible
 
04:11:43.910 --> 04:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
so that the school board can figure out
 
04:11:45.750 --> 04:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
based on who shows up and what they want
 
04:11:47.590 --> 04:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
to talk about
 
04:11:49.269 --> 04:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
what order how they're going to do it
 
04:11:51.670 --> 04:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
but i can't see that it could be
 
04:11:53.830 --> 04:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
you would have to have written each
 
04:11:55.750 --> 04:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
agenda item
 
04:11:58.870 --> 04:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
for each board action to to do what
 
04:12:00.309 --> 04:12:00.319 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do
 
04:12:06.149 --> 04:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:07.910 --> 04:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
represent tanner
 
04:12:10.790 --> 04:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i i have uh
 
04:12:12.630 --> 04:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
two things one is
 
04:12:12.640 --> 04:12:13.670 align:start position:0%
two things one is
that

04:12:13.670 --> 04:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:12:16.149 --> 04:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
under what representative lake has just
 
04:12:16.159 --> 04:12:17.510 align:start position:0%
under what representative lake has just
said

04:12:17.510 --> 04:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:12:19.590 --> 04:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
if we had
 
04:12:22.309 --> 04:12:22.319 align:start position:0%
four agenda items on the school board
 
04:12:24.469 --> 04:12:24.479 align:start position:0%
let's say the bus schedule the athletic
 
04:12:28.710 --> 04:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
eligibility and the price of meals
 
04:12:32.389 --> 04:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
under this to have just one comments
 
04:12:34.870 --> 04:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
period you would have to
 
04:12:36.950 --> 04:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
have each one of those items talked
 
04:12:39.110 --> 04:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
about and then at the end of the board
 
04:12:39.120 --> 04:12:40.389 align:start position:0%
about and then at the end of the board
meeting

04:12:40.389 --> 04:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
04:12:44.469 --> 04:12:44.479 align:start position:0%
uh action taken and and the normal way
 
04:12:46.469 --> 04:12:46.479 align:start position:0%
procedure goes into school boards that
 
04:12:48.309 --> 04:12:48.319 align:start position:0%
i've been is that they discuss something
 
04:12:50.790 --> 04:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
like athletic eligibility
 
04:12:54.469 --> 04:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
and then they vote on it and it so then
 
04:12:56.389 --> 04:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
action is taken so
 
04:12:56.399 --> 04:12:57.510 align:start position:0%
action is taken so
if

04:12:57.510 --> 04:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:12:59.990 --> 04:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
if i'm reading this right it says before
 
04:13:01.510 --> 04:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
action is taken
 
04:13:04.950 --> 04:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
so if action is taken on the bus route
 
04:13:06.950 --> 04:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
then there's got to be a comment section
 
04:13:09.030 --> 04:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
and then if action's taken on the
 
04:13:11.269 --> 04:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
athletic eligibility there has to be a
 
04:13:14.070 --> 04:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
comment section and then if the price of
 
04:13:14.080 --> 04:13:15.189 align:start position:0%
comment section and then if the price of
lunch

04:13:15.189 --> 04:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
04:13:17.910 --> 04:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
they take action on that then a comment
 
04:13:19.990 --> 04:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
period has to happen before they take
 
04:13:20.000 --> 04:13:21.269 align:start position:0%
period has to happen before they take
action

04:13:21.269 --> 04:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
action
 
04:13:21.279 --> 04:13:23.030 align:start position:0%
action
um

04:13:23.030 --> 04:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:24.309 --> 04:13:24.319 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
04:13:26.070 --> 04:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
that's what i and the other question i
 
04:13:28.630 --> 04:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
had was there was it seems like the
 
04:13:30.550 --> 04:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
state school board is missing in this
 
04:13:31.750 --> 04:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
like um
 
04:13:33.830 --> 04:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
amendment and also
 
04:13:36.710 --> 04:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
when we uh had discussion on this in the
 
04:13:39.510 --> 04:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
first place there was some comment that
 
04:13:39.520 --> 04:13:40.389 align:start position:0%
first place there was some comment that
um

04:13:40.389 --> 04:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:42.550 --> 04:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
we should include charter schools also
 
04:13:42.560 --> 04:13:43.590 align:start position:0%
we should include charter schools also
because

04:13:43.590 --> 04:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:13:43.600 --> 04:13:44.710 align:start position:0%
because
um

04:13:44.710 --> 04:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:49.590 --> 04:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of not a lot but there was some um
 
04:13:49.600 --> 04:13:50.950 align:start position:0%
a lot of not a lot but there was some um
information

04:13:50.950 --> 04:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:13:53.349 --> 04:13:53.359 align:start position:0%
about charter schools not having a
 
04:13:57.429 --> 04:13:57.439 align:start position:0%
public comment not not not being heard
 
04:13:58.630 --> 04:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:13:59.590 --> 04:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
i'm just
 
04:14:01.349 --> 04:14:01.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to know why school boards were
 
04:14:03.269 --> 04:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
taken out of this the state school board
 
04:14:05.269 --> 04:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
action and also
 
04:14:08.710 --> 04:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
how i see this is written
 
04:14:10.950 --> 04:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
the english language is sometimes uh
 
04:14:13.670 --> 04:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
very difficult to you know read through
 
04:14:16.309 --> 04:14:16.319 align:start position:0%
but on line 12
 
04:14:18.149 --> 04:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
where it says public comment period
 
04:14:20.550 --> 04:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
shall be
 
04:14:22.550 --> 04:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
would it make more
 
04:14:24.710 --> 04:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
would it be easier to really understand
 
04:14:29.030 --> 04:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
if i said ah a public comment period
 
04:14:31.110 --> 04:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
shall be provided for public input for
 
04:14:34.469 --> 04:14:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:36.950 --> 04:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
and so by taking and putting the word a
 
04:14:39.990 --> 04:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
in front and and taking the s off
 
04:14:40.000 --> 04:14:41.510 align:start position:0%
in front and and taking the s off
periods

04:14:41.510 --> 04:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
periods
 
04:14:41.520 --> 04:14:43.590 align:start position:0%
periods
um

04:14:43.590 --> 04:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:47.670 --> 04:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:47.680 --> 04:14:48.469 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:14:48.469 --> 04:14:48.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:50.790 --> 04:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
each public comment period
 
04:14:53.349 --> 04:14:53.359 align:start position:0%
i know that my board meets as a comment
 
04:14:54.790 --> 04:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
at the beginning and at the end of the
 
04:14:56.870 --> 04:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
meeting there's two
 
04:14:59.670 --> 04:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
and but many only have the one
 
04:15:01.429 --> 04:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
either front or the back
 
04:15:01.439 --> 04:15:02.710 align:start position:0%
either front or the back
um

04:15:02.710 --> 04:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:04.469 --> 04:15:04.479 align:start position:0%
would it be wise take the each out a
 
04:15:07.670 --> 04:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
public comment period shall be
 
04:15:10.309 --> 04:15:10.319 align:start position:0%
and and take the each which connotates
 
04:15:12.790 --> 04:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
maybe that there's going to be each for
 
04:15:15.110 --> 04:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
each agenda item
 
04:15:17.670 --> 04:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
um so that i i guess that would be my
 
04:15:19.269 --> 04:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
catch on this right here which would
 
04:15:22.469 --> 04:15:22.479 align:start position:0%
clean it up you know
 
04:15:24.070 --> 04:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
making those maybe those three changes
 
04:15:26.309 --> 04:15:26.319 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chair for
 
04:15:29.750 --> 04:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
taking my um my comment slash question
 
04:15:33.429 --> 04:15:33.439 align:start position:0%
if you're going to do that on line 13
 
04:15:35.349 --> 04:15:35.359 align:start position:0%
where it says
 
04:15:38.229 --> 04:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
provided for public input for agenda
 
04:15:41.670 --> 04:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
items before board action is taken
 
04:15:44.830 --> 04:15:44.840 align:start position:0%
and shall also be provided for
 
04:15:47.990 --> 04:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
non-agenda items that to me sounds like
 
04:15:51.110 --> 04:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
two periods of time one would be the
 
04:15:54.630 --> 04:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
comment period for agenda items and the
 
04:15:57.429 --> 04:15:57.439 align:start position:0%
and shall be provided a
 
04:16:00.070 --> 04:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
meaning a comment period for non-agenda
 
04:16:01.670 --> 04:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
items so
 
04:16:04.070 --> 04:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
um i i just bring that to your attention
 
04:16:06.710 --> 04:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
because i think we're talking about
 
04:16:12.790 --> 04:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:17.269 --> 04:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:19.590 --> 04:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
republican period
 
04:16:20.950 --> 04:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
represent lucas
 
04:16:22.469 --> 04:16:22.479 align:start position:0%
yeah but
 
04:16:25.349 --> 04:16:25.359 align:start position:0%
if nobody shows up for the
 
04:16:27.750 --> 04:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
agenda items and everybody can and the
 
04:16:29.990 --> 04:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
people who came just came for non-agenda
 
04:16:32.389 --> 04:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
items you don't want to
 
04:16:33.910 --> 04:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
you want to let them go ahead and speak
 
04:16:35.189 --> 04:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
in that first
 
04:16:35.199 --> 04:16:36.229 align:start position:0%
in that first
time

04:16:36.229 --> 04:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:16:38.870 --> 04:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
right so you don't want to be specifying
 
04:16:41.670 --> 04:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
what can be spoken in
 
04:16:43.990 --> 04:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
you know the public ones
 
04:16:46.389 --> 04:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
the agenda item ones get take spoken
 
04:16:49.269 --> 04:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
before any agenda item actions are taken
 
04:16:51.910 --> 04:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
and the other ones can be
 
04:16:56.149 --> 04:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:57.670 --> 04:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
you don't want to be specifying they
 
04:16:59.510 --> 04:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
have to wait till the end when nobody
 
04:17:02.950 --> 04:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:04.630 --> 04:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock yeah i get um this
 
04:17:07.670 --> 04:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
chair and the bigger picture i i i would
 
04:17:08.469 --> 04:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
have to
 
04:17:10.710 --> 04:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
as we continue to look at this playing
 
04:17:12.950 --> 04:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
with local school board agendas and how
 
04:17:12.960 --> 04:17:13.670 align:start position:0%
with local school board agendas and how
it's

04:17:13.670 --> 04:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:17:15.750 --> 04:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
developed and who can speak when
 
04:17:18.550 --> 04:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
um i i have to agree with with
 
04:17:20.950 --> 04:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh representative milo this this is out
 
04:17:23.590 --> 04:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
of our daily way let local school boards
 
04:17:25.830 --> 04:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
set their own agenda and if people don't
 
04:17:27.349 --> 04:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
like it they won't elect them if they
 
04:17:28.309 --> 04:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
want to speak they won't elect them
 
04:17:30.229 --> 04:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
that's why the local school boys that
 
04:17:31.670 --> 04:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
that's the meat of it we're just we're
 
04:17:33.990 --> 04:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
trying to tell a local board what to put
 
04:17:35.990 --> 04:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
when how long someone can speak and if
 
04:17:37.750 --> 04:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
it's if it's an agenda item or not a
 
04:17:39.830 --> 04:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
gender item i just think we're going way
 
04:17:42.149 --> 04:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
out of bounds on this one now
 
04:17:43.990 --> 04:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
represent boom and then wrap something
 
04:17:46.309 --> 04:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
often thank you mr chairman as a former
 
04:17:48.870 --> 04:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
member of the school board we had
 
04:17:51.189 --> 04:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
comments before and after and they're
 
04:17:54.070 --> 04:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
open the thing is we've seen over this
 
04:17:55.670 --> 04:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
past year
 
04:17:57.910 --> 04:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
in some districts school boards have
 
04:17:57.920 --> 04:17:58.710 align:start position:0%
in some districts school boards have
been

04:17:58.710 --> 04:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
been
 
04:18:01.429 --> 04:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
deliberately not taking comments
 
04:18:03.590 --> 04:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
deliberately going about getting people
 
04:18:03.600 --> 04:18:05.189 align:start position:0%
deliberately going about getting people
arrested

04:18:05.189 --> 04:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
arrested
 
04:18:07.750 --> 04:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
deliberately only doing their comments
 
04:18:09.110 --> 04:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
at the end
 
04:18:10.790 --> 04:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
and at midnight you can make your
 
04:18:12.950 --> 04:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
comments and that's what school boards
 
04:18:14.389 --> 04:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
have been doing
 
04:18:14.399 --> 04:18:15.110 align:start position:0%
have been doing
so

04:18:15.110 --> 04:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:18:18.070 --> 04:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
the answer to what was said yes school
 
04:18:20.070 --> 04:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
boards can do what they want now and
 
04:18:22.469 --> 04:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
unfortunately they're overstepping their
 
04:18:25.269 --> 04:18:25.279 align:start position:0%
bounds to not listening to the people
 
04:18:27.830 --> 04:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
and waiting for a year for a next
 
04:18:30.309 --> 04:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
election or in some cases maybe two or
 
04:18:33.030 --> 04:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
three years that's not good enough we
 
04:18:34.950 --> 04:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
need school boards start doing their
 
04:18:37.269 --> 04:18:37.279 align:start position:0%
jobs like when i was on the school board
 
04:18:39.110 --> 04:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
and stop being
 
04:18:41.590 --> 04:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
elitist and saying what we think is
 
04:18:44.149 --> 04:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
what's best for everybody we need the
 
04:18:48.469 --> 04:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
public comments be given thank you
 
04:18:50.950 --> 04:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:18:50.960 --> 04:18:52.790 align:start position:0%
further discussion
yes

04:18:52.790 --> 04:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:18:55.189 --> 04:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to put my lawyer hat on if
 
04:18:56.870 --> 04:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to
 
04:18:59.910 --> 04:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
amend it in line 13
 
04:19:02.309 --> 04:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
to me the problematic language is before
 
04:19:04.630 --> 04:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
board action is taken
 
04:19:06.710 --> 04:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
that that implies i think what
 
04:19:09.269 --> 04:19:09.279 align:start position:0%
representative woocock was was alluding
 
04:19:11.830 --> 04:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
to and spoke on so if you're going to
 
04:19:14.469 --> 04:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
change it to a public comment period you
 
04:19:16.950 --> 04:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
still have the issue of before board
 
04:19:19.910 --> 04:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
action is taken if you've got five items
 
04:19:21.750 --> 04:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
that have to have action on them the way
 
04:19:23.590 --> 04:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
i would read that is that you need to
 
04:19:26.229 --> 04:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
have that public public comment period
 
04:19:28.469 --> 04:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
before the action is taken on that
 
04:19:30.550 --> 04:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
agenda item
 
04:19:32.149 --> 04:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
and i know that's not the intent but
 
04:19:34.710 --> 04:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
that's how it's written
 
04:19:34.720 --> 04:19:35.670 align:start position:0%
that's how it's written
so

04:19:35.670 --> 04:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:19:37.189 --> 04:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
the way most are doing it right now
 
04:19:38.710 --> 04:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
there is a public comment period at the
 
04:19:40.389 --> 04:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
very beginning of the meeting so that
 
04:19:43.510 --> 04:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
would be prior to taking action on any
 
04:19:47.910 --> 04:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:50.790 --> 04:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes um then i would suggest
 
04:19:53.429 --> 04:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
that you say before the meeting begins
 
04:19:55.990 --> 04:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
or before the before the you know i
 
04:19:57.510 --> 04:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's a formal term for
 
04:19:59.110 --> 04:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
this school but before the meeting
 
04:19:59.120 --> 04:20:00.550 align:start position:0%
this school but before the meeting
begins

04:20:00.550 --> 04:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
begins
 
04:20:03.110 --> 04:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
or before the item agenda before the
 
04:20:05.429 --> 04:20:05.439 align:start position:0%
meeting agenda
 
04:20:11.349 --> 04:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:13.429 --> 04:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
i i've never been on a school board so i
 
04:20:15.030 --> 04:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
i've attended but i've never been on a
 
04:20:16.469 --> 04:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
school board so i would defer to the
 
04:20:17.910 --> 04:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
people who have been on a school board
 
04:20:19.349 --> 04:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
and know
 
04:20:21.349 --> 04:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
when do you start doing the agenda items
 
04:20:23.429 --> 04:20:23.439 align:start position:0%
and how would you say that
 
04:20:25.429 --> 04:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
in place of those four or five words
 
04:20:27.429 --> 04:20:27.439 align:start position:0%
they're all listed well they're all done
 
04:20:28.790 --> 04:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
differently many of them are following
 
04:20:30.469 --> 04:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
robert's rules
 
04:20:33.429 --> 04:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
and you like new business old business
 
04:20:35.429 --> 04:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
etc and underneath old business you
 
04:20:37.110 --> 04:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
might have something following up that's
 
04:20:38.630 --> 04:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
come from previous
 
04:20:39.990 --> 04:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
but then in a new business you would
 
04:20:42.630 --> 04:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
have a litany of those one through six
 
04:20:44.389 --> 04:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
or seven items that are on the dock for
 
04:20:46.149 --> 04:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
that evening sometimes a whole lot more
 
04:20:47.349 --> 04:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
than that
 
04:20:49.830 --> 04:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
so the board meeting starts when the
 
04:20:51.590 --> 04:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
gavel goes down
 
04:20:51.600 --> 04:20:52.630 align:start position:0%
gavel goes down
and

04:20:52.630 --> 04:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:54.070 --> 04:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
do your roll call and all that
 
04:20:55.750 --> 04:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
everybody's here and you're you're on
 
04:20:57.990 --> 04:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
with it and you you recognize guests if
 
04:20:59.429 --> 04:20:59.439 align:start position:0%
you haven't but then you get into the
 
04:21:00.950 --> 04:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
meat of things when you get the old
 
04:21:00.960 --> 04:21:02.870 align:start position:0%
meat of things when you get the old
business

04:21:02.870 --> 04:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:21:05.670 --> 04:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
maybe you could say before the um agenda
 
04:21:07.590 --> 04:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
items are addressed
 
04:21:12.630 --> 04:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:13.910 --> 04:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
well there's a lot of things on the
 
04:21:13.920 --> 04:21:15.349 align:start position:0%
well there's a lot of things on the
agenda

04:21:15.349 --> 04:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
agenda
 
04:21:18.469 --> 04:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
that are non-action type things
 
04:21:20.389 --> 04:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
that you know you just might have an
 
04:21:22.229 --> 04:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
informational item on there which you're
 
04:21:24.229 --> 04:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
not taking action on imparting to them
 
04:21:27.269 --> 04:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
we're having open house on
 
04:21:28.870 --> 04:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
christmas break as such and such you
 
04:21:28.880 --> 04:21:31.750 align:start position:0%
christmas break as such and such you
know

04:21:31.750 --> 04:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:33.030 --> 04:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
yeah you approve your minutes of the
 
04:21:37.110 --> 04:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:38.870 --> 04:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
i think the wording that is here there
 
04:21:41.510 --> 04:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
there's room for maybe a few tweaks to
 
04:21:43.269 --> 04:21:43.279 align:start position:0%
ensure that we're not talking multiple
 
04:21:45.910 --> 04:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
comment periods like i know when i was
 
04:21:48.149 --> 04:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
on other boards like a zoning board or a
 
04:21:50.229 --> 04:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
planning board you would have a hearing
 
04:21:52.469 --> 04:21:52.479 align:start position:0%
prior to taking action on a new zoning
 
04:21:54.309 --> 04:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
request and you'd open that up to a
 
04:21:55.910 --> 04:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
butters etc
 
04:21:58.309 --> 04:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
so you would then have you know multiple
 
04:21:59.830 --> 04:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
comment periods
 
04:22:02.229 --> 04:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
uh within that that whole
 
04:22:06.710 --> 04:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:08.469 --> 04:22:08.479 align:start position:0%
so open up for comments represent
 
04:22:08.479 --> 04:22:11.110 align:start position:0%
so open up for comments represent
woodcock

04:22:11.110 --> 04:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:12.710 --> 04:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
thank you just a question to further
 
04:22:14.070 --> 04:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
muddy this up
 
04:22:17.349 --> 04:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
in cities in cities when they're doing
 
04:22:18.870 --> 04:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
budget actions
 
04:22:20.630 --> 04:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
the school annual school budget the
 
04:22:21.990 --> 04:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
school board sits there and goes over
 
04:22:24.309 --> 04:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
different line items and votes budget
 
04:22:26.389 --> 04:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
often by line items
 
04:22:28.870 --> 04:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
and cities not small towns in cities so
 
04:22:30.710 --> 04:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
does that mean every time before they
 
04:22:34.070 --> 04:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
have a budget vote on a line item
 
04:22:36.790 --> 04:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
i was on city council yeah for nine
 
04:22:39.110 --> 04:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
years school budget and and so but city
 
04:22:41.990 --> 04:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
council is a larger entity we would have
 
04:22:44.149 --> 04:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
ordinances which would come up and each
 
04:22:46.309 --> 04:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
ordinance would have its own hearing and
 
04:22:47.750 --> 04:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
you'd have a first reading a second
 
04:22:49.269 --> 04:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
reading and then you really we often
 
04:22:52.070 --> 04:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
took action on the third reading but on
 
04:22:53.510 --> 04:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
the school board budget there's hundreds
 
04:22:56.710 --> 04:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
of the line items that they vote on yeah
 
04:22:56.720 --> 04:22:57.590 align:start position:0%
of the line items that they vote on yeah
yeah

04:22:57.590 --> 04:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:22:59.510 --> 04:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
yeah represent mullen
 
04:23:01.269 --> 04:23:01.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i just want to draw
 
04:23:03.510 --> 04:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
attention uh to the fact that unlike
 
04:23:05.990 --> 04:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative bowman my experience in
 
04:23:06.000 --> 04:23:06.710 align:start position:0%
representative bowman my experience in
the

04:23:06.710 --> 04:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:23:09.189 --> 04:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
beautiful bedroom community of bedford
 
04:23:11.750 --> 04:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is that the public comment
 
04:23:14.149 --> 04:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
period this year
 
04:23:15.990 --> 04:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
for most of the year went for three
 
04:23:18.389 --> 04:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
hours before the meeting began the
 
04:23:20.870 --> 04:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
meeting would begin at seven and i kid
 
04:23:23.189 --> 04:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
you not because i was either there or
 
04:23:25.750 --> 04:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
watching that that public comment
 
04:23:28.469 --> 04:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
section would go on and on and on
 
04:23:31.030 --> 04:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
because if hundreds of people show up
 
04:23:31.040 --> 04:23:32.630 align:start position:0%
because if hundreds of people show up
um

04:23:32.630 --> 04:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:34.229 --> 04:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
you know then it's up to the board how
 
04:23:35.910 --> 04:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
they want to handle it so i think that
 
04:23:38.950 --> 04:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
the that it's not true that all boards
 
04:23:40.790 --> 04:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
all school boards are shutting people
 
04:23:42.790 --> 04:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
down because that certainly is not
 
04:23:45.110 --> 04:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
happening in my community
 
04:23:47.510 --> 04:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
i want to draw attention to removing the
 
04:23:49.349 --> 04:23:49.359 align:start position:0%
state board of education from the
 
04:23:52.870 --> 04:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
requirement of uh the 30-minute public
 
04:23:55.910 --> 04:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
comment i i would like to object to that
 
04:23:57.990 --> 04:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
because i would like to see the state
 
04:24:01.110 --> 04:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
board of education be as open to public
 
04:24:02.870 --> 04:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
input and as
 
04:24:05.590 --> 04:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
welcoming to comments as uh we believe
 
04:24:08.229 --> 04:24:08.239 align:start position:0%
our school board should be
 
04:24:11.750 --> 04:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
so i would um i would object to removing
 
04:24:12.950 --> 04:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
that i think they ought to have a
 
04:24:17.830 --> 04:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:21.429 --> 04:24:21.439 align:start position:0%
represent cordelia uh i think we heard
 
04:24:25.590 --> 04:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
from the chair of the state board
 
04:24:27.189 --> 04:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
quite well about
 
04:24:28.469 --> 04:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
the state board
 
04:24:31.189 --> 04:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
trying to provide for public comment and
 
04:24:34.550 --> 04:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
very often have had very long
 
04:24:36.070 --> 04:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
public comment
 
04:24:38.870 --> 04:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
periods as you described in bedford as
 
04:24:38.880 --> 04:24:43.030 align:start position:0%
periods as you described in bedford as
well

04:24:43.030 --> 04:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:44.870 --> 04:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
further representative moffatt
 
04:24:46.149 --> 04:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
thank you miss chair i just wanted to
 
04:24:48.149 --> 04:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
quickly respond to uh representative
 
04:24:50.950 --> 04:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
woodcut and representative miller
 
04:24:52.710 --> 04:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
04:24:52.720 --> 04:24:53.590 align:start position:0%
with regard to
us

04:24:53.590 --> 04:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:24:53.600 --> 04:24:54.950 align:start position:0%
us
looking

04:24:54.950 --> 04:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
looking
 
04:24:54.960 --> 04:24:56.149 align:start position:0%
looking
down

04:24:56.149 --> 04:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
down
 
04:24:56.159 --> 04:24:57.110 align:start position:0%
down
at

04:24:57.110 --> 04:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:24:59.189 --> 04:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
involving ourselves with school local
 
04:25:01.349 --> 04:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
school boards and i certainly are a
 
04:25:03.990 --> 04:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
local control person and i think most
 
04:25:06.550 --> 04:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
school boards are fine i really do to
 
04:25:09.269 --> 04:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
include bedford's and litchfields and
 
04:25:11.510 --> 04:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
but here's the thing um
 
04:25:13.910 --> 04:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
clearly if you're at the hearing there
 
04:25:17.830 --> 04:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
are some onerous a few onerous
 
04:25:19.750 --> 04:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
situations with certain school boards
 
04:25:22.149 --> 04:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
where people are not being heard and
 
04:25:25.429 --> 04:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
that is very troubling and it's our role
 
04:25:28.070 --> 04:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
in our responsibility in my view
 
04:25:29.429 --> 04:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
04:25:31.110 --> 04:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
pay attention to that it's similar to
 
04:25:33.910 --> 04:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
like for example on the federal level
 
04:25:36.389 --> 04:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
sometimes in the south historically
 
04:25:37.990 --> 04:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
there were local
 
04:25:40.870 --> 04:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
school boards or school districts or
 
04:25:43.670 --> 04:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
states or whatever who did not do what
 
04:25:45.429 --> 04:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
they should the right thing
 
04:25:47.510 --> 04:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
and the people had no recourse locally
 
04:25:50.309 --> 04:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
because the the locals in the the south
 
04:25:52.149 --> 04:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
if i can say that
 
04:25:55.590 --> 04:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
it's historic uh needed a higher level
 
04:25:57.830 --> 04:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
of intervention involvement to make the
 
04:26:00.389 --> 04:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
right thing happen so on a more micro
 
04:26:02.550 --> 04:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
level that's how i see this there's a
 
04:26:05.189 --> 04:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
need for us to pay attention to people
 
04:26:07.910 --> 04:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
who are asking for help to be heard and
 
04:26:11.189 --> 04:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
i think that this does that
 
04:26:13.510 --> 04:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
is your definition of south everything
 
04:26:16.950 --> 04:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
below the massachusetts line uh
 
04:26:19.429 --> 04:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
mason dixon i hate to go there but uh
 
04:26:22.070 --> 04:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
don't go there please
 
04:26:22.080 --> 04:26:22.950 align:start position:0%
don't go there please
thanks

04:26:22.950 --> 04:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
04:26:25.349 --> 04:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
are we beyond going beyond the arguments
 
04:26:27.910 --> 04:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
on the or the debate on the differences
 
04:26:27.920 --> 04:26:29.269 align:start position:0%
on the or the debate on the differences
between

04:26:29.269 --> 04:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
between
 
04:26:32.229 --> 04:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
the amendment and
 
04:26:34.630 --> 04:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
410 as it was amended in the senate and
 
04:26:36.149 --> 04:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
came to us
 
04:26:37.830 --> 04:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
because i think you know from what i'm
 
04:26:40.070 --> 04:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
hearing a lot of the a lot of the
 
04:26:41.670 --> 04:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
argument now
 
04:26:43.990 --> 04:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
applies both to the amendment and to the
 
04:26:47.110 --> 04:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh the underlying bill if
 
04:26:48.710 --> 04:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
04:26:50.870 --> 04:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
well i i heard representative mullen
 
04:26:52.630 --> 04:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
make reference to the state board of
 
04:26:55.189 --> 04:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
education which is minus on the
 
04:26:57.349 --> 04:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
amendment right and so i think she was
 
04:26:59.910 --> 04:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
speaking to the amendment saying why you
 
04:27:02.070 --> 04:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
know i can't support it because
 
04:27:03.590 --> 04:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
right but
 
04:27:05.030 --> 04:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking about what say
 
04:27:06.710 --> 04:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative moffatt was just saying
 
04:27:08.229 --> 04:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
which i think applies both to the
 
04:27:14.790 --> 04:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:16.950 --> 04:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
i'll let representative moff you know
 
04:27:19.670 --> 04:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
respond but i i think we're uh speaking
 
04:27:21.830 --> 04:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
to the amendment right now correct yes
 
04:27:24.309 --> 04:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
we are right and my promise was simply
 
04:27:27.349 --> 04:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh in response to some concerns that
 
04:27:27.359 --> 04:27:28.229 align:start position:0%
uh in response to some concerns that
were

04:27:28.229 --> 04:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:27:29.830 --> 04:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
getting involved with local control my
 
04:27:32.229 --> 04:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
point was sometimes we need to
 
04:27:34.710 --> 04:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
and that's speaking to to their
 
04:27:39.349 --> 04:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:43.910 --> 04:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:46.870 --> 04:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
okay we do have a amendment on the floor
 
04:27:48.070 --> 04:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:27:52.790 --> 04:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:54.870 --> 04:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on that
 
04:27:54.880 --> 04:27:57.750 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on that
amendment

04:27:57.750 --> 04:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:00.710 --> 04:28:00.720 align:start position:0%

04:29:25.040 --> 04:29:25.990 align:start position:0%
that's the way it works
uh

04:29:25.990 --> 04:29:26.000 align:start position:0%

04:29:36.309 --> 04:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
rick further discussion yes thank thank
 
04:29:38.710 --> 04:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
you very much mr chair um i'd like to
 
04:29:42.790 --> 04:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
speak uh uh in support of um of 410
 
04:29:45.590 --> 04:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
um my and for just a couple of reasons
 
04:29:47.429 --> 04:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
first of all that that i think it does
 
04:29:51.189 --> 04:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
address the um uh the the point that
 
04:29:52.870 --> 04:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative mullin was making with
 
04:29:55.510 --> 04:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
respect to the state board of education
 
04:29:57.030 --> 04:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:29:58.950 --> 04:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
understand during the pandemic there was
 
04:30:01.030 --> 04:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
there was a lack of
 
04:30:01.040 --> 04:30:01.830 align:start position:0%
there was a lack of
of

04:30:01.830 --> 04:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:30:03.910 --> 04:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
comment during state board meetings i
 
04:30:06.469 --> 04:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
think we heard from the from the chair
 
04:30:08.469 --> 04:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
about some maybe technical reasons why
 
04:30:10.630 --> 04:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
they did that but somehow school boards
 
04:30:12.630 --> 04:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
across the state worked through those
 
04:30:14.870 --> 04:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
technical issues and were able to to
 
04:30:16.710 --> 04:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
take public comment
 
04:30:18.710 --> 04:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
secondly my understanding is that the
 
04:30:21.030 --> 04:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
senate this morning
 
04:30:21.040 --> 04:30:21.830 align:start position:0%
senate this morning
did

04:30:21.830 --> 04:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
did
 
04:30:24.630 --> 04:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
did recommend
 
04:30:27.030 --> 04:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
passage of
 
04:30:29.590 --> 04:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
house bill 1195 which i think origin uh
 
04:30:31.910 --> 04:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
did that origin no that was in that was
 
04:30:33.830 --> 04:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
not in this committee originally
 
04:30:33.840 --> 04:30:34.630 align:start position:0%
not in this committee originally
uh

04:30:34.630 --> 04:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:30:39.269 --> 04:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
uh and um and now it reads uh like uh
 
04:30:42.870 --> 04:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
410 as it as it came to us
 
04:30:44.469 --> 04:30:44.479 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:30:47.030 --> 04:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
and uh uh i believe that was a committee
 
04:30:48.950 --> 04:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
amendment from uh from the house
 
04:30:52.070 --> 04:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
education committee so um so i'm gonna
 
04:30:54.070 --> 04:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna support for
 
04:30:54.080 --> 04:30:55.830 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna support for
410

04:30:55.830 --> 04:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
410
 
04:30:59.510 --> 04:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
as it as it has come to us
 
04:31:01.429 --> 04:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
i think on voice vote and five nothing
 
04:31:04.790 --> 04:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
out of the senate education committee
 
04:31:17.349 --> 04:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:19.269 --> 04:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
representative lekkas
 
04:31:21.269 --> 04:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
so i have a question
 
04:31:24.550 --> 04:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
for those who did not vote for the last
 
04:31:24.560 --> 04:31:26.309 align:start position:0%
for those who did not vote for the last
amendment

04:31:26.309 --> 04:31:26.319 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:31:29.189 --> 04:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
it seems like part of the issue was the
 
04:31:32.710 --> 04:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:34.309 --> 04:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
not being in here
 
04:31:36.870 --> 04:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
my question if we did a real quick
 
04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
amendment that just said
 
04:31:41.750 --> 04:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
that all we changed was the public
 
04:31:43.990 --> 04:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
comment period shall be for no less than
 
04:31:45.590 --> 04:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
on line seven
 
04:31:47.349 --> 04:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
at the beginning
 
04:31:50.149 --> 04:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
and that way
 
04:31:53.269 --> 04:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
the concern that the public session is
 
04:31:55.830 --> 04:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
at the end and people had comments they
 
04:31:57.349 --> 04:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to make
 
04:31:59.910 --> 04:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
about agenda items and the agenda items
 
04:32:01.990 --> 04:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
are voted on and then they consider
 
04:32:04.550 --> 04:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
their comment
 
04:32:06.950 --> 04:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
void or or you know no point in making
 
04:32:09.349 --> 04:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
it you guys have already made the thing
 
04:32:12.710 --> 04:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
would you vote for this if we just put
 
04:32:14.870 --> 04:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
put the at the beginning in there so
 
04:32:16.630 --> 04:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
that it could be done
 
04:32:25.670 --> 04:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:28.389 --> 04:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
well i'll speak up on on the
 
04:32:31.349 --> 04:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
i have a concern with a any kind of a
 
04:32:34.630 --> 04:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
comment period that's designated by
 
04:32:37.750 --> 04:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
x number of minutes no less than 30
 
04:32:37.760 --> 04:32:38.950 align:start position:0%
x number of minutes no less than 30
minutes

04:32:38.950 --> 04:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
04:32:40.630 --> 04:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
i like the other
 
04:32:42.550 --> 04:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
amendment because it said
 
04:32:45.590 --> 04:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
unless comments are completed earlier
 
04:32:47.269 --> 04:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
so you might you know if you're the
 
04:32:49.429 --> 04:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
state board and their meetings go clear
 
04:32:51.189 --> 04:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
to two o'clock three o'clock in the
 
04:32:53.349 --> 04:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
afternoon at times and if you have to
 
04:32:55.269 --> 04:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
spend 30 minutes opening it up and
 
04:32:56.870 --> 04:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
waiting for a public comment period
 
04:32:58.550 --> 04:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
there's nobody there to come you still
 
04:33:00.469 --> 04:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
are in public comment
 
04:33:02.229 --> 04:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
and so it's going to be wasted time
 
04:33:04.949 --> 04:33:04.959 align:start position:0%
downtime in that case could we instead
 
04:33:07.510 --> 04:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
just add the whole section
 
04:33:09.670 --> 04:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
to new section that talks about the
 
04:33:11.670 --> 04:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
state board of education
 
04:33:12.789 --> 04:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
on to
 
04:33:15.349 --> 04:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we just voted on and
 
04:33:16.709 --> 04:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
that way
 
04:33:19.109 --> 04:33:19.119 align:start position:0%
we would have that language cleared up
 
04:33:20.709 --> 04:33:20.719 align:start position:0%
as far as when
 
04:33:22.869 --> 04:33:22.879 align:start position:0%
and then also
 
04:33:24.709 --> 04:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
put the state board of education in
 
04:33:28.789 --> 04:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:32.789 --> 04:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:34.470 --> 04:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if we have time to do it
 
04:33:38.390 --> 04:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:40.070 --> 04:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
even though there were some real simple
 
04:33:41.910 --> 04:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
fixes i thought to the cordelia
 
04:33:41.920 --> 04:33:42.949 align:start position:0%
fixes i thought to the cordelia
amendment

04:33:42.949 --> 04:33:42.959 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:33:44.390 --> 04:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
which would have clarified
 
04:33:46.310 --> 04:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
you know that we're talking about a
 
04:33:48.789 --> 04:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
public comment period instead of public
 
04:33:48.799 --> 04:33:49.670 align:start position:0%
public comment period instead of public
comment

04:33:49.670 --> 04:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
comment
 
04:33:52.310 --> 04:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
public comment periods
 
04:33:52.320 --> 04:33:53.349 align:start position:0%
public comment periods
uh

04:33:53.349 --> 04:33:53.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:33:53.359 --> 04:33:54.310 align:start position:0%
uh
so

04:33:54.310 --> 04:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:33:56.470 --> 04:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know i think we just gotta act
 
04:33:58.070 --> 04:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
on it now i don't think we have the time
 
04:34:04.629 --> 04:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:05.910 --> 04:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
04:34:08.150 --> 04:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
back to your original wording i wonder
 
04:34:09.990 --> 04:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
if you just added the phrase if
 
04:34:10.000 --> 04:34:11.510 align:start position:0%
if you just added the phrase if
requested

04:34:11.510 --> 04:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
requested
 
04:34:13.429 --> 04:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
and lead if it wasn't requested then
 
04:34:15.590 --> 04:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
they could terminate
 
04:34:17.029 --> 04:34:17.039 align:start position:0%
it puts it
 
04:34:19.189 --> 04:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
it puts the responsibility on the person
 
04:34:21.990 --> 04:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
wanting to discuss it to request the
 
04:34:23.670 --> 04:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity one thing we've got to be
 
04:34:26.070 --> 04:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
aware of and very cautious in doing is
 
04:34:26.080 --> 04:34:27.670 align:start position:0%
aware of and very cautious in doing is
that

04:34:27.670 --> 04:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:34:30.390 --> 04:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
when we make these quick fixes
 
04:34:32.709 --> 04:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
in our committee right here
 
04:34:35.029 --> 04:34:35.039 align:start position:0%
20 minutes later if you're you know
 
04:34:37.269 --> 04:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
when i was working with dr ranzuli down
 
04:34:40.150 --> 04:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
uconn on the gift of town and stuff a
 
04:34:41.990 --> 04:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
lot of people don't really engage on a
 
04:34:44.070 --> 04:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
topic until 20 minutes after they get
 
04:34:46.310 --> 04:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
involved into the topic itself and we
 
04:34:48.150 --> 04:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
oftentimes make the
 
04:34:50.230 --> 04:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
change right now and then live to pay
 
04:34:52.310 --> 04:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
the the price later on when in fact
 
04:34:54.390 --> 04:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
somebody's trying to make it work
 
04:34:56.709 --> 04:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
so if we don't have a
 
04:34:59.750 --> 04:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
a real good response right now
 
04:35:01.670 --> 04:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
i think the best thing is just don't
 
04:35:04.629 --> 04:35:04.639 align:start position:0%
mess with it and
 
04:35:09.029 --> 04:35:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:11.910 --> 04:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:15.910 --> 04:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
yes uh to your point mr chair uh about
 
04:35:17.349 --> 04:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:35:18.629 --> 04:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
the time
 
04:35:20.629 --> 04:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
the notion of people sitting around for
 
04:35:23.189 --> 04:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
30 minutes on line 10 it does say
 
04:35:25.189 --> 04:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
nothing in this section shall restrict
 
04:35:27.349 --> 04:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
school boards from establishing
 
04:35:29.670 --> 04:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh reasonable standards for public
 
04:35:32.070 --> 04:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
comment so i think i think that's a
 
04:35:34.070 --> 04:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
little bit of an elastic clause that
 
04:35:34.080 --> 04:35:35.429 align:start position:0%
little bit of an elastic clause that
would

04:35:35.429 --> 04:35:35.439 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:35:37.029 --> 04:35:37.039 align:start position:0%
you know i and i i just have to think
 
04:35:39.590 --> 04:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
that board chairs
 
04:35:41.189 --> 04:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
could uh
 
04:35:43.510 --> 04:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
if there's nobody there
 
04:35:45.670 --> 04:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
right i i think that
 
04:35:47.670 --> 04:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't worry too much about that 30
 
04:35:58.150 --> 04:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:00.470 --> 04:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to address the
 
04:36:02.470 --> 04:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
i agree with what you just said um and
 
04:36:04.310 --> 04:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
regarding the local control just because
 
04:36:07.029 --> 04:36:07.039 align:start position:0%
i've sat on the board for so long
 
04:36:08.551 --> 04:36:08.561 align:start position:0%
especially during what had been
 
04:36:10.470 --> 04:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
happening over the past two years
 
04:36:13.510 --> 04:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
the boards actually were hungry to hear
 
04:36:15.590 --> 04:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
something come down from the state level
 
04:36:18.070 --> 04:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
and whether it was masking or you know
 
04:36:19.830 --> 04:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
remote or whatever they were so
 
04:36:22.150 --> 04:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
frustrated saying they did not give us
 
04:36:22.160 --> 04:36:23.590 align:start position:0%
frustrated saying they did not give us
direction

04:36:23.590 --> 04:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
direction
 
04:36:25.109 --> 04:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
and one thing that i've noticed over the
 
04:36:26.789 --> 04:36:26.799 align:start position:0%
years with public comment i'm one that
 
04:36:26.799 --> 04:36:27.750 align:start position:0%
years with public comment i'm one that
always

04:36:27.750 --> 04:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
always
 
04:36:30.070 --> 04:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
had it at the beginning and at the end
 
04:36:31.590 --> 04:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
and there were many times people in the
 
04:36:33.109 --> 04:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
office of superintendent that would sit
 
04:36:34.310 --> 04:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
with me because we would develop the
 
04:36:37.029 --> 04:36:37.039 align:start position:0%
agenda together and they would say but
 
04:36:39.510 --> 04:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
you don't even have to have it at all
 
04:36:41.429 --> 04:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
right and typically
 
04:36:43.590 --> 04:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
they would revert me back to the new
 
04:36:45.990 --> 04:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire school board association and
 
04:36:48.551 --> 04:36:48.561 align:start position:0%
that is where everybody goes with these
 
04:36:50.070 --> 04:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
boards right you pay your dues that's
 
04:36:51.510 --> 04:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
where you go to see what you should or
 
04:36:53.349 --> 04:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
should not be doing
 
04:36:55.510 --> 04:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
which is a lobbying organization people
 
04:36:58.629 --> 04:36:58.639 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily go to the doe so i
 
04:37:00.390 --> 04:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying about not
 
04:37:03.590 --> 04:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
getting in the weeds but i think that um
 
04:37:04.949 --> 04:37:04.959 align:start position:0%
sometimes we're not able to get out in
 
04:37:07.349 --> 04:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
front of people and educate them of the
 
04:37:09.670 --> 04:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
importance of this or that they can go
 
04:37:11.750 --> 04:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
beyond what the new hampshire school
 
04:37:13.750 --> 04:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
board association is recommending i've
 
04:37:15.990 --> 04:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
heard that quite often so i just wanted
 
04:37:17.429 --> 04:37:17.439 align:start position:0%
to share for whatever reason this
 
04:37:19.349 --> 04:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't make it today
 
04:37:21.189 --> 04:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
i just hope that moving forward you take
 
04:37:24.230 --> 04:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
that into consideration thank you
 
04:37:24.240 --> 04:37:25.990 align:start position:0%
that into consideration thank you
representative

04:37:25.990 --> 04:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:37:28.551 --> 04:37:28.561 align:start position:0%
um i'm still concerned about when it
 
04:37:28.561 --> 04:37:29.670 align:start position:0%
um i'm still concerned about when it
happens

04:37:29.670 --> 04:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
happens
 
04:37:31.830 --> 04:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
that's all i'd still like to see it in
 
04:37:36.070 --> 04:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
the beginning because i know how upset
 
04:37:38.390 --> 04:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh numerous parents were at certain
 
04:37:41.109 --> 04:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
school board meetings because things
 
04:37:42.949 --> 04:37:42.959 align:start position:0%
were voted on before they got a chance
 
04:37:44.869 --> 04:37:44.879 align:start position:0%
to say it and say anything about the
 
04:37:46.551 --> 04:37:46.561 align:start position:0%
things that were voted on
 
04:37:46.561 --> 04:37:48.070 align:start position:0%
things that were voted on
and

04:37:48.070 --> 04:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:37:49.510 --> 04:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
you know that that can be very
 
04:37:49.520 --> 04:37:57.029 align:start position:0%
you know that that can be very
frustrating

04:37:57.029 --> 04:37:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:58.551 --> 04:37:58.561 align:start position:0%

04:41:15.830 --> 04:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
it narrows it to
 
04:41:18.550 --> 04:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
disclosure of information to a
 
04:41:20.948 --> 04:41:20.958 align:start position:0%
contractor consultant volunteer
 
04:41:25.430 --> 04:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
or other party that is acting instead of
 
04:41:25.440 --> 04:41:26.628 align:start position:0%
or other party that is acting instead of
internal

04:41:26.628 --> 04:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
internal
 
04:41:28.788 --> 04:41:28.798 align:start position:0%
services within the district
 
04:41:31.590 --> 04:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
and requires notification to parents in

those instances
 
04:41:36.628 --> 04:41:36.638 align:start position:0%
which was the specific instance
 
04:41:36.638 --> 04:41:38.150 align:start position:0%
which was the specific instance
which

04:41:38.150 --> 04:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:41:41.430 --> 04:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
led me to uh draft an amendment in the
 
04:41:42.948 --> 04:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
first place
 
04:41:42.958 --> 04:41:43.830 align:start position:0%
first place
um

04:41:43.830 --> 04:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:47.270 --> 04:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
it also addresses uh who the
 
04:41:49.430 --> 04:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
notification shall be provided to and i
 
04:41:52.830 --> 04:41:52.840 align:start position:0%
think covers uh all parties
 
04:41:56.550 --> 04:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
um uh attached i think or you should
 
04:41:59.190 --> 04:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
have um the actual statute that i
 
04:42:00.550 --> 04:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
referred to
 
04:42:02.788 --> 04:42:02.798 align:start position:0%
um in um
 
04:42:05.670 --> 04:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
in the amendment in relation to uh
 
04:42:10.230 --> 04:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:13.110 --> 04:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
could you please explain to me how
 
04:42:15.030 --> 04:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
last last time we discussed this there
 
04:42:17.510 --> 04:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
was some concern about a school district
 
04:42:19.990 --> 04:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
submitting information to the department
 
04:42:20.000 --> 04:42:20.948 align:start position:0%

um

04:42:20.948 --> 04:42:20.958 align:start position:0%

04:42:22.470 --> 04:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
how how's this
 
04:42:25.270 --> 04:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
amendment impact that process
 
04:42:27.270 --> 04:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
04:42:31.430 --> 04:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
um it is uh only in the instance um that
 
04:42:33.750 --> 04:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
notification will be required when it's
 
04:42:35.990 --> 04:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
disclosed to a contractor consultant
 
04:42:36.000 --> 04:42:37.270 align:start position:0%
disclosed to a contractor consultant
volunteer

04:42:37.270 --> 04:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
volunteer
 
04:42:41.670 --> 04:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
or other party uh to whom the agency has
 
04:42:45.350 --> 04:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
outsourced services or functions
 
04:42:45.360 --> 04:42:47.830 align:start position:0%
outsourced services or functions
so

04:42:47.830 --> 04:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:50.788 --> 04:42:50.798 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the
 
04:42:50.798 --> 04:42:52.070 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the
attachment

04:42:52.070 --> 04:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
attachment
 
04:42:54.150 --> 04:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
it clearly does not
 
04:42:54.160 --> 04:42:55.430 align:start position:0%
it clearly does not
cover

04:42:55.430 --> 04:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
cover
 
04:43:04.070 --> 04:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:07.270 --> 04:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
how does that impact the uh
 
04:43:07.280 --> 04:43:08.310 align:start position:0%
how does that impact the uh
the

04:43:08.310 --> 04:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:43:11.030 --> 04:43:11.040 align:start position:0%

04:43:37.270 --> 04:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
agency in this in that case is not um
 
04:43:42.150 --> 04:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
acting instead of um district personnel
 
04:43:43.270 --> 04:43:43.280 align:start position:0%

district might disclose information as
 
04:44:00.470 --> 04:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
they contracted with somebody
 
04:44:03.190 --> 04:44:03.200 align:start position:0%

um in the in the situation uh i
discussed

04:44:04.390 --> 04:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
04:44:04.400 --> 04:44:05.750 align:start position:0%
discussed
um

04:44:05.750 --> 04:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:07.270 --> 04:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh earlier
 
04:44:11.030 --> 04:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh they are uh contracting with a third
 
04:44:11.040 --> 04:44:11.990 align:start position:0%
uh they are uh contracting with a third
party

04:44:11.990 --> 04:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
party
 
04:44:14.070 --> 04:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
um and it it's
 
04:44:16.788 --> 04:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
required as part of that contract um
 
04:44:18.310 --> 04:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
04:44:21.350 --> 04:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh district personnel enter
 
04:44:23.590 --> 04:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
confidential student information into a
 
04:44:27.030 --> 04:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
database um from that third party for
 
04:44:30.708 --> 04:44:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:33.110 --> 04:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
and specifically
 
04:44:35.590 --> 04:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
they have identified
 
04:44:37.910 --> 04:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
that third party
 
04:44:37.920 --> 04:44:38.708 align:start position:0%
that third party
as

04:44:38.708 --> 04:44:38.718 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:44:41.430 --> 04:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
performing a special
 
04:44:45.510 --> 04:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
um for the district um
 
04:44:46.788 --> 04:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
yeah i guess what i'm asking
 
04:44:48.550 --> 04:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
representative is what would those
 
04:44:51.590 --> 04:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
functions be what are they contracted to
 
04:44:51.600 --> 04:44:53.910 align:start position:0%
functions be what are they contracted to
do

04:44:53.910 --> 04:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:53.920 --> 04:44:55.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:44:55.430 --> 04:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:57.830 --> 04:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
they are contracted to look at
 
04:45:01.510 --> 04:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
behavioral issues is my understanding
 
04:45:05.270 --> 04:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
and when necessary um
 
04:45:08.628 --> 04:45:08.638 align:start position:0%
offer referral services
 
04:45:10.788 --> 04:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
so that third party is reaching out to
 
04:45:14.310 --> 04:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
others if they feel necessary to offer
 
04:45:16.550 --> 04:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
um referral services to agencies to
 
04:45:16.560 --> 04:45:17.510 align:start position:0%
um referral services to agencies to
address

04:45:17.510 --> 04:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
address
 
04:45:19.270 --> 04:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
behavioral issues or mental health
 
04:45:22.390 --> 04:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
issues um if they do that there is a
 
04:45:25.430 --> 04:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
requirement in my understanding in their
 
04:45:28.310 --> 04:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
contract that they have to have parental
 
04:45:31.030 --> 04:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
notification if they're referring a
 
04:45:35.110 --> 04:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:35.120 --> 04:45:36.868 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

04:45:36.868 --> 04:45:36.878 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:45:40.230 --> 04:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
but there is no requirement um for
 
04:45:43.910 --> 04:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh the parents to be notified in that uh
 
04:45:45.910 --> 04:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
confidential personal information is
 
04:45:48.788 --> 04:45:48.798 align:start position:0%
being released to that uh
 
04:45:51.030 --> 04:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
to that third party to begin with and in
 
04:45:53.590 --> 04:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
the case of this specific instance that
 
04:45:59.590 --> 04:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:01.350 --> 04:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
i'm shaking my head because you and i
 
04:46:03.190 --> 04:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
have had a conversation about this and i
 
04:46:05.350 --> 04:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
really i know you can't share the
 
04:46:08.310 --> 04:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
details with me per se but i really want
 
04:46:10.550 --> 04:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
those details i want to know
 
04:46:12.788 --> 04:46:12.798 align:start position:0%
what happened and who it was and where
 
04:46:16.550 --> 04:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:16.560 --> 04:46:17.670 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:46:17.670 --> 04:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:46:18.830 --> 04:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
follow up on that
 
04:46:21.430 --> 04:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
um uh it is my understanding that it's
 
04:46:23.190 --> 04:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
either six or seven districts in the
 
04:46:25.750 --> 04:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
state um have a contract under this
 
04:46:30.788 --> 04:46:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:33.350 --> 04:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um is it a specific
 
04:46:37.030 --> 04:46:37.040 align:start position:0%

uh
 
04:47:22.310 --> 04:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
if a parent is um enrolling their child

04:47:29.350 --> 04:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
and learning pot of any sorts
 
04:47:30.470 --> 04:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
the parent
 
04:47:33.590 --> 04:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
is uh enrolling their child it's uh it's
 
04:47:36.310 --> 04:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
not um a district function it's a
 
04:47:38.150 --> 04:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
parental function
 
04:47:39.670 --> 04:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:47:39.680 --> 04:47:41.750 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

04:47:41.750 --> 04:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:47:43.270 --> 04:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:47:43.280 --> 04:47:45.910 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

04:47:45.910 --> 04:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:48.150 --> 04:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
i guess one of the concerns i have and
 
04:47:49.510 --> 04:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
there's there's no
 
04:47:51.510 --> 04:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
question in my mind that parents need to
 
04:47:53.990 --> 04:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
be informed
 
04:47:56.470 --> 04:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
but there are there may be situations
 
04:48:00.948 --> 04:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:00.958 --> 04:48:01.750 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:48:01.750 --> 04:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:48:05.990 --> 04:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
the one of the queries i would have is
 
04:48:08.470 --> 04:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
if this is particularly related to a
 
04:48:11.750 --> 04:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
child a student
 
04:48:15.030 --> 04:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
what are the rights of the student
 
04:48:17.830 --> 04:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
for confidentiality
 
04:48:20.550 --> 04:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
in their life as it relates to what's
 
04:48:23.030 --> 04:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
going on in school
 
04:48:24.070 --> 04:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:48:27.270 --> 04:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
the concern that i have with this
 
04:48:29.510 --> 04:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
is that if there is an issue
 
04:48:31.830 --> 04:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
for student confidentiality whether it
 
04:48:35.670 --> 04:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:37.430 --> 04:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
how does this relate to the protection
 
04:48:39.270 --> 04:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
of them
 
04:48:41.910 --> 04:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
because it might be
 
04:48:43.830 --> 04:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
a conflict that they have with their
 
04:48:43.840 --> 04:48:45.990 align:start position:0%
a conflict that they have with their
parent

04:48:45.990 --> 04:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
parent
 
04:48:48.628 --> 04:48:48.638 align:start position:0%
that they're seeking resolution
 
04:48:52.070 --> 04:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
and they don't want their parent to know
 
04:48:53.830 --> 04:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
the conflict that they've got that
 
04:48:57.350 --> 04:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:59.670 --> 04:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
and so i that's the conflict i have with
 
04:49:01.990 --> 04:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
the language here
 
04:49:03.750 --> 04:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
that it seems that it's it's fairly
 
04:49:03.760 --> 04:49:04.868 align:start position:0%
that it seems that it's it's fairly
blatant

04:49:04.868 --> 04:49:04.878 align:start position:0%
blatant
 
04:49:06.868 --> 04:49:06.878 align:start position:0%
that regardless of what the situation
 
04:49:08.868 --> 04:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
might be
 
04:49:10.470 --> 04:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
that the parent would be informed
 
04:49:12.788 --> 04:49:12.798 align:start position:0%
regardless of what whether or not
 
04:49:14.628 --> 04:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
it was specifically the dealing with the
 
04:49:14.638 --> 04:49:15.590 align:start position:0%
it was specifically the dealing with the
student

04:49:15.590 --> 04:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
student
 
04:49:17.110 --> 04:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
and some conflict the student may be
 
04:49:20.948 --> 04:49:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:23.750 --> 04:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm in conflict now with
 
04:49:26.550 --> 04:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
the parental right to have knowledge of
 
04:49:28.430 --> 04:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
what's going on as well as a
 
04:49:30.868 --> 04:49:30.878 align:start position:0%
confidentiality issue
 
04:49:34.788 --> 04:49:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:36.948 --> 04:49:36.958 align:start position:0%
glenn i'm not sure that you can help me
 
04:49:38.868 --> 04:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
with that conflict that i'm having right
 
04:49:38.878 --> 04:49:41.190 align:start position:0%
with that conflict that i'm having right
now

04:49:41.190 --> 04:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:41.200 --> 04:49:42.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:49:42.310 --> 04:49:42.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:43.430 --> 04:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
if i might
 
04:49:43.440 --> 04:49:44.628 align:start position:0%
if i might
um

04:49:44.628 --> 04:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:48.470 --> 04:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not sure if it is in these pages
 
04:49:48.480 --> 04:49:49.910 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not sure if it is in these pages
but

04:49:49.910 --> 04:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:49:53.510 --> 04:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
i believe it is in the contract
 
04:49:55.990 --> 04:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
to my understanding that
 
04:50:01.030 --> 04:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:02.948 --> 04:50:02.958 align:start position:0%
it is required
 
04:50:04.708 --> 04:50:04.718 align:start position:0%
that there be
 
04:50:06.550 --> 04:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
and i can't remember if it's written
 
04:50:06.560 --> 04:50:08.150 align:start position:0%
and i can't remember if it's written
consent

04:50:08.150 --> 04:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
consent
 
04:50:10.230 --> 04:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
if the child is under 18
 
04:50:13.670 --> 04:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
um for the referral or if it's just
 
04:50:15.750 --> 04:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
parental notification
 
04:50:19.830 --> 04:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
but i believe that might be in a federal
 
04:50:23.510 --> 04:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
statute um or certainly in at least the
 
04:50:25.990 --> 04:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
requirements of this federal grant
 
04:50:27.590 --> 04:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
04:50:27.600 --> 04:50:29.430 align:start position:0%
um and uh
um

04:50:29.430 --> 04:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:31.990 --> 04:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't bring it along
 
04:50:33.830 --> 04:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
but i do have
 
04:50:35.190 --> 04:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
more information and there is
 
04:50:38.470 --> 04:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
information on the doe website about
 
04:50:41.190 --> 04:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
the aware program and the districts that
 
04:50:42.550 --> 04:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
are pro
 
04:50:46.070 --> 04:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
partaking in that program
 
04:50:47.910 --> 04:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up
 
04:50:51.350 --> 04:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
do you under do you understand as as the
 
04:50:52.708 --> 04:50:52.718 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this amendment do you
 
04:50:55.030 --> 04:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
understand my concern as it relates to
 
04:50:56.628 --> 04:50:56.638 align:start position:0%
the student
 
04:51:02.310 --> 04:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:05.750 --> 04:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:09.350 --> 04:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
but i i think that um
 
04:51:11.110 --> 04:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
in these cases
 
04:51:13.750 --> 04:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
the uh third party
 
04:51:15.590 --> 04:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
contractor if you will
 
04:51:18.550 --> 04:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
um is taking over a function that would
 
04:51:22.550 --> 04:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
have been uh provided by the district
 
04:51:22.560 --> 04:51:25.110 align:start position:0%
have been uh provided by the district
um

04:51:25.110 --> 04:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:26.830 --> 04:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
so i think it's
 
04:51:26.840 --> 04:51:28.628 align:start position:0%
so i think it's
um

04:51:28.628 --> 04:51:28.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:31.190 --> 04:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
totally justified to let the parent know
 
04:51:34.150 --> 04:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
that information is being released
 
04:51:37.190 --> 04:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
to this third party agency
 
04:51:38.550 --> 04:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
about that
 
04:51:40.948 --> 04:51:40.958 align:start position:0%
and i was
 
04:51:43.350 --> 04:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
shocked to find out that they were
 
04:51:46.230 --> 04:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
providing sacid numbers
 
04:51:52.390 --> 04:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:54.230 --> 04:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
04:51:56.550 --> 04:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:51:58.150 --> 04:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
i will defer to reverend sullivan his
 
04:52:00.390 --> 04:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
hands up first oh i didn't see it go
 
04:52:00.400 --> 04:52:04.948 align:start position:0%
hands up first oh i didn't see it go
ahead

04:52:04.948 --> 04:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:07.430 --> 04:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
with respect uh representative cordelli
 
04:52:09.350 --> 04:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
you seem to be very focused on the aware
 
04:52:10.948 --> 04:52:10.958 align:start position:0%
program and i know that's the the
 
04:52:13.910 --> 04:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
genesis of this uh amendment
 
04:52:16.628 --> 04:52:16.638 align:start position:0%
um but i'm thinking that
 
04:52:19.430 --> 04:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of school districts uh outsource
 
04:52:20.708 --> 04:52:20.718 align:start position:0%
their um
 
04:52:22.550 --> 04:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
psychological services
 
04:52:25.430 --> 04:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of districts do not
 
04:52:27.990 --> 04:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
hire their own psycho psychologist or
 
04:52:28.000 --> 04:52:29.350 align:start position:0%
hire their own psycho psychologist or
psychiatrist

04:52:29.350 --> 04:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist
 
04:52:29.360 --> 04:52:30.310 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist
and

04:52:30.310 --> 04:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:52:33.190 --> 04:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
they would outsource those services
 
04:52:35.510 --> 04:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
and i guess i'm sharing representative
 
04:52:39.670 --> 04:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
miller's uh concern that
 
04:52:41.510 --> 04:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know these types of notifications
 
04:52:44.590 --> 04:52:44.600 align:start position:0%
could create some jeopardy if it is a
 
04:52:47.910 --> 04:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist or psychologist that is the
 
04:52:49.750 --> 04:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
um outsourced
 
04:52:49.760 --> 04:52:51.670 align:start position:0%
um outsourced
service

04:52:51.670 --> 04:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
service
 
04:52:53.510 --> 04:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
can you
 
04:52:57.350 --> 04:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:59.110 --> 04:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
i think that there are
 
04:53:01.350 --> 04:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
quite a few provisions of
 
04:53:01.360 --> 04:53:02.470 align:start position:0%
quite a few provisions of
ferpa

04:53:02.470 --> 04:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
ferpa
 
04:53:05.590 --> 04:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
and pupil protection
 
04:53:05.600 --> 04:53:06.550 align:start position:0%
and pupil protection
rights

04:53:06.550 --> 04:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
rights
 
04:53:06.560 --> 04:53:08.628 align:start position:0%
rights
also

04:53:08.628 --> 04:53:08.638 align:start position:0%
also
 
04:53:12.390 --> 04:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:15.750 --> 04:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:19.270 --> 04:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:23.590 --> 04:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what circumstances um
 
04:53:26.150 --> 04:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
someone who is acting with the
 
04:53:29.110 --> 04:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
department actually the school district
 
04:53:29.120 --> 04:53:30.310 align:start position:0%
department actually the school district
um

04:53:30.310 --> 04:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:32.310 --> 04:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
if the school district is referring
 
04:53:32.320 --> 04:53:33.670 align:start position:0%
if the school district is referring
someone

04:53:33.670 --> 04:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
someone
 
04:53:37.270 --> 04:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
to a psychiatrist let's say or a social
 
04:53:39.110 --> 04:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
worker or anything
 
04:53:41.830 --> 04:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
i think that there are requirements um
 
04:53:44.150 --> 04:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
already in law for that both federally
 
04:53:45.990 --> 04:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
and state
 
04:53:46.000 --> 04:53:47.270 align:start position:0%
and state
that

04:53:47.270 --> 04:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:53:50.310 --> 04:53:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh revolve around parental notification
 
04:53:54.150 --> 04:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
um i think this is um more limited um in
 
04:53:57.030 --> 04:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
in scope um
 
04:53:59.750 --> 04:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
under under ferpa and the exception
 
04:54:04.628 --> 04:54:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:06.788 --> 04:54:06.798 align:start position:0%
for because these exemptions are
 
04:54:09.910 --> 04:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
exemptions from requiring parental
 
04:54:09.920 --> 04:54:11.190 align:start position:0%
exemptions from requiring parental
consent

04:54:11.190 --> 04:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
consent
 
04:54:11.200 --> 04:54:12.948 align:start position:0%
consent
so

04:54:12.948 --> 04:54:12.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:54:15.830 --> 04:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
i'm aware that this does not require
 
04:54:17.590 --> 04:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
parental consent to release this
 
04:54:19.670 --> 04:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
information to the third party
 
04:54:21.510 --> 04:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
but i'm just saying that the parents
 
04:54:23.670 --> 04:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
should be notified that this is
 
04:54:23.680 --> 04:54:26.868 align:start position:0%
should be notified that this is
happening

04:54:26.868 --> 04:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:26.878 --> 04:54:28.708 align:start position:0%
 
representative

i guess
 
04:56:03.830 --> 04:56:03.840 align:start position:0%

04:56:22.948 --> 04:56:22.958 align:start position:0%
okay i'm looking to follow where you are
 
04:56:26.948 --> 04:56:26.958 align:start position:0%
99 31. um in particular um i'm looking
 
04:56:26.958 --> 04:56:27.670 align:start position:0%
99 31. um in particular um i'm looking
at

04:56:27.670 --> 04:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:56:30.470 --> 04:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
b the contractor consultant
 
04:56:32.470 --> 04:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
language that is included in the bill as
 
04:56:32.480 --> 04:56:39.990 align:start position:0%
language that is included in the bill as
well

04:56:39.990 --> 04:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:42.628 --> 04:56:42.638 align:start position:0%
under under b there it further describes
 
04:56:45.670 --> 04:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
under you know one two three etc
 
04:56:47.990 --> 04:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
about that provision
 
04:56:52.310 --> 04:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:53.590 --> 04:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:56:55.270 --> 04:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
represent bone
 
04:56:58.628 --> 04:56:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:01.110 --> 04:57:01.120 align:start position:0%
the parents are responsible for their
 
04:57:03.590 --> 04:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
children they need to know what's going
 
04:57:03.600 --> 04:57:04.390 align:start position:0%
children they need to know what's going
on

04:57:04.390 --> 04:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:57:06.868 --> 04:57:06.878 align:start position:0%
with their children in the case of if it
 
04:57:09.830 --> 04:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
goes to some kind of a psychologist or a
 
04:57:09.840 --> 04:57:11.350 align:start position:0%
goes to some kind of a psychologist or a
medical

04:57:11.350 --> 04:57:11.360 align:start position:0%
medical
 
04:57:13.270 --> 04:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
aren't there medical insurance for the
 
04:57:15.830 --> 04:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
parents probably going to have to pay
 
04:57:18.150 --> 04:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
unless it's dcyf or something like that
 
04:57:21.990 --> 04:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
or abuse then the parents need to know
 
04:57:24.708 --> 04:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
there are other laws which say if it's
 
04:57:26.868 --> 04:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
if their children are being abused there
 
04:57:28.470 --> 04:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
are other laws that take care of that
 
04:57:30.628 --> 04:57:30.638 align:start position:0%
without the parents knowing but the
 
04:57:34.390 --> 04:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
problem is the parents are responsible
 
04:57:36.948 --> 04:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
so they need to know what is going on
 
04:57:39.350 --> 04:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
with their children it is not the
 
04:57:42.550 --> 04:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
school's responsibility to take care of
 
04:57:45.510 --> 04:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
the children the parents all have thank
 
04:57:45.520 --> 04:57:48.150 align:start position:0%
the children the parents all have thank
you

04:57:48.150 --> 04:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:51.270 --> 04:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:53.190 --> 04:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:57:55.670 --> 04:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
the department of education
 
04:57:57.750 --> 04:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
it says in 2022 the new hampshire
 
04:58:00.150 --> 04:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
department of education continues to
 
04:58:01.910 --> 04:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
lead this effort through the office of
 
04:58:04.150 --> 04:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
social emotional wellness it's part of
 
04:58:07.830 --> 04:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
the mtssb the multi-tiered
 
04:58:09.750 --> 04:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
system of
 
04:58:11.510 --> 04:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
behavioral support
 
04:58:11.520 --> 04:58:13.030 align:start position:0%
behavioral support
which

04:58:13.030 --> 04:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:58:15.670 --> 04:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
you all will remember senate bill 135
 
04:58:17.350 --> 04:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
which i think was three years ago four
 
04:58:20.510 --> 04:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
years ago maybe even now um
 
04:58:23.190 --> 04:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
established the bureau of student
 
04:58:25.510 --> 04:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
wellness and the multi-tiered support
 
04:58:28.788 --> 04:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
system there there are four goals listed
 
04:58:31.030 --> 04:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
here and uh the fourth one is to
 
04:58:33.270 --> 04:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
substantially improve the engagement of
 
04:58:33.280 --> 04:58:34.230 align:start position:0%
substantially improve the engagement of
school

04:58:34.230 --> 04:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:58:37.590 --> 04:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
families and youth in decision making
 
04:58:40.310 --> 04:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
policy and practice development
 
04:58:44.070 --> 04:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
and individual needs so they actually
 
04:58:45.670 --> 04:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
there there's a whole strand in here
 
04:58:48.150 --> 04:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
about the focus on the family i think
 
04:58:51.190 --> 04:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
that part of the bureau of student
 
04:58:53.190 --> 04:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
wellness has been to
 
04:58:56.230 --> 04:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
engage the family in the decision making
 
04:58:59.990 --> 04:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
project uh and again it it's reaffirmed
 
04:59:03.670 --> 04:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
in 2022 so uh in collaboration with the
 
04:59:05.830 --> 04:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
04:59:09.030 --> 04:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
so this is something that is well known
 
04:59:09.040 --> 04:59:09.750 align:start position:0%
so this is something that is well known
to

04:59:09.750 --> 04:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:59:11.270 --> 04:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
the doe
 
04:59:13.910 --> 04:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
so if we have questions about whether or
 
04:59:15.830 --> 04:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
not there have been legal challenges or
 
04:59:19.670 --> 04:59:19.680 align:start position:0%

04:59:44.550 --> 04:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
04:59:46.390 --> 04:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
how many people have
 
04:59:47.990 --> 04:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
been in contact with the department of
 
04:59:48.000 --> 04:59:49.110 align:start position:0%
been in contact with the department of
education

04:59:49.110 --> 04:59:49.120 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:59:51.190 --> 04:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
um about this
 
04:59:54.310 --> 04:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
but i am familiar with one particular uh
 
04:59:56.230 --> 04:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
counselor who i have
 
04:59:58.550 --> 04:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
had a great many discussions with i i
 
05:00:01.030 --> 05:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
think we talked about it as well
 
05:00:02.310 --> 05:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
um who
 
05:00:04.830 --> 05:00:04.840 align:start position:0%
um was very concerned about this
 
05:00:07.270 --> 05:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
information being provided having to
 
05:00:09.110 --> 05:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
provide this information to the third
 
05:00:09.120 --> 05:00:10.070 align:start position:0%
provide this information to the third
party

05:00:10.070 --> 05:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
party
 
05:00:13.190 --> 05:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
without the parents knowing about it
 
05:00:15.510 --> 05:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
and that what is what set in motion
 
05:00:17.510 --> 05:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
discussions with department and
 
05:00:20.948 --> 05:00:20.958 align:start position:0%
everything else and unfortunately
 
05:00:23.030 --> 05:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
there's not been a resolution to the
 
05:00:25.110 --> 05:00:25.120 align:start position:0%
satisfaction of this counselor and she
 
05:00:25.120 --> 05:00:25.910 align:start position:0%
satisfaction of this counselor and she
has

05:00:25.910 --> 05:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
has
 
05:00:31.350 --> 05:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:34.150 --> 05:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
prior to getting the doe up here if
 
05:00:36.310 --> 05:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
they're well willing to come i have a
 
05:00:37.990 --> 05:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
question um
 
05:00:39.270 --> 05:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
when i was dealing with high school
 
05:00:41.110 --> 05:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
students we
 
05:00:41.120 --> 05:00:41.910 align:start position:0%
students we
had

05:00:41.910 --> 05:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
had
 
05:00:44.550 --> 05:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
some i went through a couple of not many
 
05:00:45.990 --> 05:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
where we had to write a functional
 
05:00:46.000 --> 05:00:47.350 align:start position:0%
where we had to write a functional
behavioral

05:00:47.350 --> 05:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
behavioral
 
05:00:47.360 --> 05:00:48.708 align:start position:0%
behavioral
assessment

05:00:48.708 --> 05:00:48.718 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
05:00:51.830 --> 05:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
and that's contracted out with a
 
05:00:55.990 --> 05:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
an individual counselor a psychologist
 
05:00:58.310 --> 05:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
or other medical folks that are capable
 
05:01:00.230 --> 05:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
of doing that and then
 
05:01:02.310 --> 05:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
we we follow followed up with a behavior
 
05:01:05.430 --> 05:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
management plan within the school
 
05:01:07.350 --> 05:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
and we have to identify whether the
 
05:01:10.230 --> 05:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
behavior was a manifest of the
 
05:01:13.510 --> 05:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
iep handicapping condition
 
05:01:15.670 --> 05:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
we oftentimes involved health and human
 
05:01:17.910 --> 05:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
services in doing this
 
05:01:17.920 --> 05:01:18.708 align:start position:0%
services in doing this
um

05:01:18.708 --> 05:01:18.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:21.990 --> 05:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
in doing this and we had some situations
 
05:01:22.000 --> 05:01:23.110 align:start position:0%
in doing this and we had some situations
where

05:01:23.110 --> 05:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:01:26.390 --> 05:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
the parent really wasn't available
 
05:01:30.230 --> 05:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
um and they were just sad situations so
 
05:01:33.030 --> 05:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
would we be be holding to this here
 
05:01:34.708 --> 05:01:34.718 align:start position:0%
where we had to do the 10-day
 
05:01:37.430 --> 05:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
notification and
 
05:01:39.830 --> 05:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
before we could get that man uh the the
 
05:01:42.310 --> 05:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
whole process started i i don't think
 
05:01:42.320 --> 05:01:43.270 align:start position:0%
whole process started i i don't think
you

05:01:43.270 --> 05:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:01:45.590 --> 05:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
if you give me the liberty of answering
 
05:01:49.430 --> 05:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:51.350 --> 05:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
somebody is responsible for that child
 
05:01:52.550 --> 05:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
there's no way that a functional
 
05:01:54.868 --> 05:01:54.878 align:start position:0%
behavioral analysis is taking place
 
05:01:54.878 --> 05:01:55.990 align:start position:0%
behavioral analysis is taking place
without

05:01:55.990 --> 05:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
without
 
05:01:56.000 --> 05:01:57.430 align:start position:0%
without
permission

05:01:57.430 --> 05:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
permission
 
05:01:59.270 --> 05:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
because that's part of the special ed
 
05:01:59.280 --> 05:02:00.390 align:start position:0%
because that's part of the special ed
process

05:02:00.390 --> 05:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:02:02.628 --> 05:02:02.638 align:start position:0%
yes yes so uh so that's going to be
 
05:02:05.270 --> 05:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
covered under idea so somebody whether
 
05:02:07.110 --> 05:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
it's dcyf
 
05:02:09.590 --> 05:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
a legal guardian a parent somebody has
 
05:02:13.670 --> 05:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
to give permission for that
 
05:02:16.390 --> 05:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
and this the project aware money is is
 
05:02:18.390 --> 05:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
money that came through
 
05:02:22.150 --> 05:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
samsa which is drug and alcohol
 
05:02:24.070 --> 05:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
treatment programs
 
05:02:26.310 --> 05:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that there are school districts
 
05:02:28.868 --> 05:02:28.878 align:start position:0%
that have been looking for assistance
 
05:02:30.310 --> 05:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
because they have
 
05:02:33.590 --> 05:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
parents who are deeply involved and kids
 
05:02:37.750 --> 05:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
who need help as a result of it but um
 
05:02:38.830 --> 05:02:38.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i
 
05:02:42.628 --> 05:02:42.638 align:start position:0%
uh i certainly believe in the protection
 
05:02:45.590 --> 05:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
of privacy and i also believe uh to
 
05:02:48.150 --> 05:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
representative boehm's point that
 
05:02:51.110 --> 05:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
parents are key to kids mental health
 
05:02:53.590 --> 05:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
but i also know that we have uh
 
05:02:54.628 --> 05:02:54.638 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:02:57.670 --> 05:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
not an insignificant amount of families
 
05:02:58.868 --> 05:02:58.878 align:start position:0%
not just
 
05:03:00.550 --> 05:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
children that people are working with
 
05:03:02.230 --> 05:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
without the knowledge of their moms and
 
05:03:03.830 --> 05:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
dads i mean
 
05:03:06.470 --> 05:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
families that are grateful for the help
 
05:03:08.868 --> 05:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
that's being given to them families that
 
05:03:10.150 --> 05:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
are looking
 
05:03:14.310 --> 05:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
to schools as a purveyor of information
 
05:03:16.788 --> 05:03:16.798 align:start position:0%
on where to go to get help
 
05:03:18.868 --> 05:03:18.878 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:03:20.230 --> 05:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
you know my that's what i did for a
 
05:03:23.110 --> 05:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
living so my experience was
 
05:03:25.110 --> 05:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
very different i'm representative
 
05:03:26.550 --> 05:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
cordelia will tell you that i was
 
05:03:29.590 --> 05:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
horrified at the aspect of
 
05:03:32.150 --> 05:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
some counselor being forced into sharing
 
05:03:34.230 --> 05:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
private information against their
 
05:03:37.030 --> 05:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
professional judgment or
 
05:03:37.040 --> 05:03:37.910 align:start position:0%
professional judgment or
but

05:03:37.910 --> 05:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:03:37.920 --> 05:03:38.868 align:start position:0%
but
i

05:03:38.868 --> 05:03:38.878 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:03:41.190 --> 05:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
don't know that we have
 
05:03:42.948 --> 05:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
i don't know that the need is there
 
05:03:45.750 --> 05:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
again you know this comes back to
 
05:03:49.030 --> 05:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
where are the instances of issue
 
05:03:51.430 --> 05:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
why are we putting something into effect
 
05:03:53.350 --> 05:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
if it has not
 
05:03:56.310 --> 05:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
happened to any degree i mean there's
 
05:03:57.910 --> 05:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
always going to be a
 
05:03:59.430 --> 05:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
a counselor that
 
05:04:01.670 --> 05:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
you know has a questionable call an
 
05:04:04.150 --> 05:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
administrator that does something that
 
05:04:06.150 --> 05:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
someone questions the call
 
05:04:07.990 --> 05:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's going to happen but
 
05:04:10.628 --> 05:04:10.638 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i don't think the solution
 
05:04:14.230 --> 05:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
is to craft laws uh based on individual
 
05:04:14.240 --> 05:04:16.550 align:start position:0%
is to craft laws uh based on individual
situations

05:04:16.550 --> 05:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
situations
 
05:04:17.750 --> 05:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
do you still need to talk to the
 
05:04:17.760 --> 05:04:19.590 align:start position:0%
do you still need to talk to the
department

05:04:19.590 --> 05:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:04:43.030 --> 05:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:44.470 --> 05:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mullen do you
 
05:04:47.030 --> 05:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
have a i do thank you mr chair and thank
 
05:04:48.948 --> 05:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
you attorney fenton for taking the hot
 
05:04:50.788 --> 05:04:50.798 align:start position:0%
seat again
 
05:04:52.708 --> 05:04:52.718 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't miss this opportunity yes i'm
 
05:04:54.390 --> 05:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
sorry that you have to dodge the speaker
 
05:04:57.190 --> 05:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
in order to talk to me but uh
 
05:04:59.830 --> 05:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
so my question are you aware of the the
 
05:05:02.070 --> 05:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
bill and the amendment to this bill
 
05:05:05.350 --> 05:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment to 352 okay
 
05:05:08.868 --> 05:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
so my ques it looks like representative
 
05:05:11.990 --> 05:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
cordelie's concern is that
 
05:05:14.150 --> 05:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
student privacy
 
05:05:16.708 --> 05:05:16.718 align:start position:0%
is both at risk
 
05:05:19.750 --> 05:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
and that somehow or another parents are
 
05:05:22.070 --> 05:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
unaware of the fact that either their
 
05:05:24.948 --> 05:05:24.958 align:start position:0%
kids are participating in this program
 
05:05:24.958 --> 05:05:25.910 align:start position:0%
kids are participating in this program
or

05:05:25.910 --> 05:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:05:28.230 --> 05:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
from my reading what i'm seeing is that
 
05:05:30.788 --> 05:05:30.798 align:start position:0%
it looks like it is a school-wide
 
05:05:33.990 --> 05:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
program but funded through drug and
 
05:05:35.750 --> 05:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
alcohol monies
 
05:05:39.590 --> 05:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
and perhaps targeted to students with
 
05:05:41.670 --> 05:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
significant behavioral and emotional
 
05:05:41.680 --> 05:05:43.350 align:start position:0%
significant behavioral and emotional
challenges

05:05:43.350 --> 05:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
05:05:46.788 --> 05:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
the question is do we need to is
 
05:05:50.070 --> 05:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
are you getting complaints or concerns
 
05:05:50.080 --> 05:05:50.868 align:start position:0%
are you getting complaints or concerns
or

05:05:50.868 --> 05:05:50.878 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:05:54.550 --> 05:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
is there a legal need to do uh
 
05:05:56.708 --> 05:05:56.718 align:start position:0%
what we're proposing here
 
05:05:58.310 --> 05:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
so for the record my name is diana
 
05:05:59.510 --> 05:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
fenton i'm with the department of
 
05:06:02.150 --> 05:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
education um
 
05:06:03.750 --> 05:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
i can't answer the last part of your
 
05:06:06.708 --> 05:06:06.718 align:start position:0%
question is there a legal need um what i
 
05:06:09.510 --> 05:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
can answer is um is the department aware
 
05:06:10.788 --> 05:06:10.798 align:start position:0%
of any
 
05:06:12.788 --> 05:06:12.798 align:start position:0%
lawsuits that we've received pertaining
 
05:06:14.788 --> 05:06:14.798 align:start position:0%
to this particular issue none that i'm
 
05:06:16.150 --> 05:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
05:06:17.910 --> 05:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of any
 
05:06:20.948 --> 05:06:20.958 align:start position:0%
um complaints as it relates to that
 
05:06:23.910 --> 05:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
particular program um the aware program
 
05:06:25.670 --> 05:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
as administered by the office of student
 
05:06:28.868 --> 05:06:28.878 align:start position:0%
wellness um you know
 
05:06:31.110 --> 05:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
presumably i would be made aware of such
 
05:06:33.590 --> 05:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
things but i i don't want to sit here
 
05:06:35.510 --> 05:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
and promise you that there's there's
 
05:06:37.190 --> 05:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
never been a complaint about it but to
 
05:06:39.350 --> 05:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
the best of my knowledge no we have not
 
05:06:44.310 --> 05:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:46.150 --> 05:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee of
 
05:06:48.868 --> 05:06:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:50.470 --> 05:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:06:53.350 --> 05:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
oh you got one rep santana i i can't let
 
05:06:55.430 --> 05:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
diana go without a question
 
05:06:57.430 --> 05:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
um do you feel that
 
05:07:00.310 --> 05:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
parents um
 
05:07:03.670 --> 05:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
right over the student privacy issue is
 
05:07:06.948 --> 05:07:06.958 align:start position:0%
thank you is uh
 
05:07:10.070 --> 05:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
is sufficient at this point
 
05:07:11.270 --> 05:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
without it
 
05:07:11.280 --> 05:07:12.230 align:start position:0%
without it
with

05:07:12.230 --> 05:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:07:13.910 --> 05:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's covered under
 
05:07:16.230 --> 05:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
current law that that if there was a
 
05:07:19.190 --> 05:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
case uh similar to what representative
 
05:07:20.708 --> 05:07:20.718 align:start position:0%
cordelia's talking about that there
 
05:07:22.948 --> 05:07:22.958 align:start position:0%
would be sufficient way to
 
05:07:24.628 --> 05:07:24.638 align:start position:0%
deal with that through
 
05:07:26.310 --> 05:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
legal issues
 
05:07:28.390 --> 05:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh governed by the
 
05:07:30.390 --> 05:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
the ferpa laws
 
05:07:33.750 --> 05:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
i mean i i think that the ferpa laws
 
05:07:35.590 --> 05:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
are sufficient as written but i think
 
05:07:37.750 --> 05:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
there's a reason that this amendment has
 
05:07:40.150 --> 05:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
been brought forward so clearly there is
 
05:07:42.310 --> 05:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
an issue that is not being addressed or
 
05:07:43.750 --> 05:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
else this amendment wouldn't be brought
 
05:07:45.350 --> 05:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
forward the particulars of that
 
05:07:46.788 --> 05:07:46.798 align:start position:0%
obviously lie with representative
 
05:07:48.948 --> 05:07:48.958 align:start position:0%
cordelli but
 
05:07:50.390 --> 05:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
i trust in the constituent that brought
 
05:07:51.910 --> 05:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
it to his attention that there was a
 
05:07:53.750 --> 05:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
need to address it there will always
 
05:07:55.670 --> 05:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
inevitably be
 
05:07:58.868 --> 05:07:58.878 align:start position:0%
loopholes and and inevitable holes in
 
05:08:01.030 --> 05:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
every law um they cannot account for
 
05:08:03.510 --> 05:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
every conceivable fact pattern that will
 
05:08:06.070 --> 05:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
arise is there a process
 
05:08:08.550 --> 05:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh that if someone felt as though rather
 
05:08:09.670 --> 05:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
than come
 
05:08:12.150 --> 05:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
to place something in statute is there a
 
05:08:14.470 --> 05:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
process for a counselor that was in that
 
05:08:18.230 --> 05:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
situation to come to the doe or make a
 
05:08:19.910 --> 05:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
complaint to
 
05:08:22.230 --> 05:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
some sort of federal agency about this
 
05:08:23.510 --> 05:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
05:08:27.270 --> 05:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:29.990 --> 05:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
the state doe receives many complaints
 
05:08:32.948 --> 05:08:32.958 align:start position:0%
on on a whole host of topics um i would
 
05:08:34.390 --> 05:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
like to think that we're a fairly open
 
05:08:35.910 --> 05:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
state agency i know we hear from an
 
05:08:37.670 --> 05:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
enormous number of people and i know
 
05:08:39.110 --> 05:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
we've worked with our counterparts in
 
05:08:41.910 --> 05:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
boston the usdoe and i know that they
 
05:08:43.350 --> 05:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
receive complaints on a variety of
 
05:08:44.390 --> 05:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
issues from people
 
05:08:46.628 --> 05:08:46.638 align:start position:0%
in terms of this particular issue i mean
 
05:08:46.638 --> 05:08:47.510 align:start position:0%
in terms of this particular issue i mean
it's

05:08:47.510 --> 05:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:08:49.350 --> 05:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i don't know all the
 
05:08:51.590 --> 05:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
details and particulars of it
 
05:08:53.670 --> 05:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
um but i'm not aware of anyone who has
 
05:08:55.670 --> 05:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
tried to approach our office
 
05:08:57.590 --> 05:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
as it relates to this
 
05:08:59.510 --> 05:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
exact issue
 
05:09:02.390 --> 05:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
i guess mike what i meant was is there
 
05:09:04.150 --> 05:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
is there
 
05:09:07.270 --> 05:09:07.280 align:start position:0%
if your privacy is being
 
05:09:07.280 --> 05:09:08.470 align:start position:0%
if your privacy is being
breached

05:09:08.470 --> 05:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
breached
 
05:09:10.390 --> 05:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
or the privacy of your child is being
 
05:09:10.400 --> 05:09:11.670 align:start position:0%
or the privacy of your child is being
breached

05:09:11.670 --> 05:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
breached
 
05:09:13.910 --> 05:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
and you find out about it
 
05:09:15.750 --> 05:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
there is legal recourse for that isn't
 
05:09:18.070 --> 05:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
there there is legal recourse and and we
 
05:09:19.670 --> 05:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
have received
 
05:09:22.310 --> 05:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
we have received um
 
05:09:24.868 --> 05:09:24.878 align:start position:0%
concerns as it pertains to ferpa not
 
05:09:27.910 --> 05:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
this exact fact pattern um but i can
 
05:09:29.750 --> 05:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
share with you that that there was a
 
05:09:32.310 --> 05:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
school district just this past week that
 
05:09:35.670 --> 05:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
had a ferpa violation and they reported
 
05:09:38.070 --> 05:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
it to the department of education and
 
05:09:39.430 --> 05:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
they believed it fell within their
 
05:09:41.430 --> 05:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
obligation under the code of conduct
 
05:09:43.430 --> 05:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
they reported us we worked with um they
 
05:09:44.708 --> 05:09:44.718 align:start position:0%
reported to us we worked with that
 
05:09:46.550 --> 05:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
district to make sure that that issue
 
05:09:48.628 --> 05:09:48.638 align:start position:0%
had been remedied the district had
 
05:09:50.788 --> 05:09:50.798 align:start position:0%
already taken care of it taken
 
05:09:53.110 --> 05:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate steps and and we felt that
 
05:09:55.190 --> 05:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
it had been rectified appropriately so
 
05:09:57.190 --> 05:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
05:09:59.110 --> 05:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
districts and individuals will report to
 
05:10:00.070 --> 05:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
us on
 
05:10:00.080 --> 05:10:01.190 align:start position:0%
us on
on

05:10:01.190 --> 05:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:10:05.030 --> 05:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:07.910 --> 05:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
further questions yes represent cordelia
 
05:10:07.920 --> 05:10:09.830 align:start position:0%
further questions yes represent cordelia
um

05:10:09.830 --> 05:10:09.840 align:start position:0%

um for being here um
 
05:10:16.310 --> 05:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh would it be correct that um
 
05:10:18.150 --> 05:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of complaints
 
05:10:21.030 --> 05:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
um a parent would have to know that this
 
05:10:22.390 --> 05:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
was going on
 
05:10:24.868 --> 05:10:24.878 align:start position:0%
before they could uh call the department
 
05:10:26.390 --> 05:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
with a complaint
 
05:10:27.910 --> 05:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
it would be hard for them to report
 
05:10:32.150 --> 05:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:35.110 --> 05:10:35.120 align:start position:0%

for taking my question to the chair i'd
 
05:10:51.350 --> 05:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
just like to respond to a comment that
 
05:10:53.430 --> 05:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative baum you made when you
 
05:10:54.470 --> 05:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
said it's not the school's
 
05:10:55.830 --> 05:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility to take care of the
 
05:10:55.840 --> 05:10:56.948 align:start position:0%
responsibility to take care of the
children

05:10:56.948 --> 05:10:56.958 align:start position:0%
children

me
 
05:11:01.190 --> 05:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
i always thought it was my
 
05:11:02.708 --> 05:11:02.718 align:start position:0%
responsibility to take care of those
 
05:11:05.030 --> 05:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
children and my own children going
 
05:11:06.550 --> 05:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
through the school system when they were
 
05:11:09.110 --> 05:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
at school i expected that the school
 
05:11:11.190 --> 05:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
would take care of my children so i just
 
05:11:14.708 --> 05:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
wanted to respond to that thank you
 
05:11:17.190 --> 05:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
05:11:18.948 --> 05:11:18.958 align:start position:0%
not seeing any
 
05:11:22.948 --> 05:11:22.958 align:start position:0%
so we have a motion on the floor as otp
 
05:11:28.310 --> 05:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:30.830 --> 05:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
madam clerk would
 
05:11:33.830 --> 05:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
you we can either show our hands or
 
05:11:36.150 --> 05:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
either way on this
 
05:11:37.830 --> 05:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
okay may i see a show of hands on
 
05:11:45.110 --> 05:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:45.120 --> 05:11:46.628 align:start position:0%
 
six please

05:11:46.628 --> 05:11:46.638 align:start position:0%
six please
 
05:11:50.708 --> 05:11:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:53.830 --> 05:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
okay it's nine to nine or yeah nine to
 
05:11:53.840 --> 05:11:54.708 align:start position:0%
okay it's nine to nine or yeah nine to
nine

05:11:54.708 --> 05:11:54.718 align:start position:0%
nine
 
05:11:56.948 --> 05:11:56.958 align:start position:0%
all those which were opposed you know we
 
05:11:58.230 --> 05:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
didn't get you to put your hands up but
 
05:12:00.390 --> 05:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
i assume it's the opposite way
 
05:12:02.230 --> 05:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
you can't abstain
 
05:12:04.150 --> 05:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
so we have nine to nine the amendment
 
05:12:10.390 --> 05:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:11.990 --> 05:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
so we're at the main motion right now
 
05:12:14.868 --> 05:12:14.878 align:start position:0%
and that's uh 352 relative substitute
 
05:12:17.430 --> 05:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
teacher criminal history records checks
 
05:12:17.440 --> 05:12:20.470 align:start position:0%
teacher criminal history records checks
check

05:12:20.470 --> 05:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:21.990 --> 05:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
we haven't had a whole lot of discussion
 
05:12:40.948 --> 05:12:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:44.310 --> 05:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of moving it or uh would you
 
05:12:44.320 --> 05:12:45.670 align:start position:0%
in terms of moving it or uh would you
like

05:12:45.670 --> 05:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:12:47.510 --> 05:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
just discussion on it do you is there
 
05:12:47.520 --> 05:12:48.788 align:start position:0%
just discussion on it do you is there
any

05:12:48.788 --> 05:12:48.798 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:12:50.550 --> 05:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
this just discussion okay
 
05:12:53.190 --> 05:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
um yeah i mean i think that the
 
05:12:56.708 --> 05:12:56.718 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill is to streamline
 
05:12:59.030 --> 05:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
for substitute teachers
 
05:13:01.990 --> 05:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
the criminal background check process so
 
05:13:03.350 --> 05:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
that they don't
 
05:13:05.190 --> 05:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
have to uh
 
05:13:07.910 --> 05:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
repeat the criminal the background check
 
05:13:07.920 --> 05:13:10.390 align:start position:0%
repeat the criminal the background check
repeatedly

05:13:10.390 --> 05:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
repeatedly
 
05:13:12.868 --> 05:13:12.878 align:start position:0%
i i don't see a problem with it i know
 
05:13:15.110 --> 05:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
that school districts are having a devil
 
05:13:18.390 --> 05:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
of a time getting substitute teachers so
 
05:13:20.948 --> 05:13:20.958 align:start position:0%
i think that if a substitute teacher
 
05:13:24.150 --> 05:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
passes a criminal background check in
 
05:13:24.160 --> 05:13:25.030 align:start position:0%
passes a criminal background check in
one

05:13:25.030 --> 05:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:13:27.190 --> 05:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
part of the sau then they ought to be
 
05:13:31.110 --> 05:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:34.150 --> 05:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:36.470 --> 05:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
not seeing any the motion was made by

not seeing any further discussion
 
05:13:49.350 --> 05:13:49.360 align:start position:0%

the agenda
 
05:14:48.948 --> 05:14:48.958 align:start position:0%

have come before us
 
05:14:57.110 --> 05:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
so that's 103 from the
 
05:15:00.150 --> 05:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
hb side and from the senate bill side we
 
05:15:03.590 --> 05:15:03.600 align:start position:0%

sixteen bills and i know that's an
 
05:15:36.150 --> 05:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
extraordinary scheduling load mel and i
 
05:15:38.390 --> 05:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
went through it two years ago with about
 
05:15:40.868 --> 05:15:40.878 align:start position:0%
half that number of bills and scheduling
 
05:15:43.750 --> 05:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
half that number of bills is a challenge
 
05:15:45.270 --> 05:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
