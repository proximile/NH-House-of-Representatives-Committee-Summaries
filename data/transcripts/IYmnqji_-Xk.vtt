00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody please take your
 
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
seats we've got to get this show on the
 
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.650 align:start position:0%
seats we've got to get this show on the
road

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 align:start position:0%
Welcome to the
 
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 align:start position:0%
Monday February 6th
 
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
session of the science technology and
 
00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 align:start position:0%
energy committee
 
00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 align:start position:0%
as is our custom we'll Begin by asking
 
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
everyone to rise and join
 
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative Tom closure as he leads
 
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
certainly representative uh Reynolds
 
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.730 align:start position:0%
 
like

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
okay so we have a packed agenda today
 
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 align:start position:0%
we're going to try something new today
 
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
we have scheduled our bills on half hour
 
00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 align:start position:0%
increments instead of one hour
 
00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:45.350 align:start position:0%
increments instead of one hour
increments

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
increments
 
00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 align:start position:0%
and what that likely means is that once
 
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
a public hearing starts for one bill if
 
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
it goes beyond a half hour the next
 
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.590 align:start position:0%
it goes beyond a half hour the next
Bills

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
Bills
 
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
public hearing start will be delayed by
 
00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 align:start position:0%
a small amount
 
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
and so that likely will happen but we'll
 
00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 align:start position:0%
go with this and see how it works and
 
00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:09.409 align:start position:0%
go with this and see how it works and
um

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully we won't miss our lunch
 
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 align:start position:0%
we have an executive schedule section
 
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
session scheduled for one o'clock and
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty hard start so we're
 
00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
going to have to be on time got to keep
 
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
the trains running and to do that for
 
00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 align:start position:0%
the morning session here I'm going to
 
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
turn the gavel over to our vice chair
 
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:06.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
welcome chairman Bose
 
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
thank you for your introducing House
 
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
Bill HB 458 and I will dispense with any
 
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.060 align:start position:0%
other words and saying you're on the
 
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.689 align:start position:0%
other words and saying you're on the
clock

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair and good morning
 
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:25.860 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
the record I'm representative Michael
 
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
those I represent Rockingham District
 
00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:32.759 align:start position:0%
five which is the town of Epping
 
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:35.340 align:start position:0%
and I serve as chair of this committee
 
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
I'm here this morning to introduce house
 
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
bill 458.
 
00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
which is a bill relative to
 
00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
participation in net energy metering by
 
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:48.060 align:start position:0%
small hydroelectric generators
 
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
the Genesis of this bill goes back a
 
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
long ways
 
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
to interconnection problems that have
 
00:07:58.850 --> 00:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
Arisen in the area in the era of net
 
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.189 align:start position:0%
Arisen in the area in the era of net
metering

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
metering
 
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
for some small Legacy hydroelectric
 
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.010 align:start position:0%
for some small Legacy hydroelectric
generators

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
generators
 
00:08:09.409 --> 00:08:09.419 align:start position:0%
these generators frequently had more
 
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
than one Dam
 
00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
that they use to generate electricity
 
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
but they had one interconnection point
 
00:08:18.409 --> 00:08:18.419 align:start position:0%
to the grid
 
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
each individual dams output
 
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
the governing factor and whether or not
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
they could participate in net metering
 
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
and accumulating those
 
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:38.820 align:start position:0%
loads together at the connection Point
 
00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
turned out to be an important issue with
 
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
regard to net metering so that's how it
 
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
all got started
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
we passed legislation last year or the
 
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:50.820 align:start position:0%
year before I can't remember exactly to
 
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.310 align:start position:0%
year before I can't remember exactly to
allow

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
allow
 
00:08:54.829 --> 00:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
Monadnock paper which has three Mills
 
00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
and one interconnection point to
 
00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.150 align:start position:0%
and one interconnection point to
accumulate

00:08:59.150 --> 00:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
accumulate
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
all of its load together
 
00:09:05.449 --> 00:09:05.459 align:start position:0%
to qualify for net metering
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
this bill House Bill 458 does something
 
00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
similar for another
 
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric facility up in Brookfield
 
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.970 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
and

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
um or actually it's owned by a company
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
called Brookfield and I'm not entirely
 
00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
certain exactly where all the dams are
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
located but the folks from Brookfield
 
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
who will testify later will tell you
 
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
exactly where they're all located
 
00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
and what this bill does is something
 
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
similar to what we did for men had not
 
00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:37.019 align:start position:0%
paper it allows the
 
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
output of the dams to be accumulated for
 
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
the purposes of net metering
 
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
the languages is very
 
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:47.700 align:start position:0%
tightly and carefully drawn in this bill
 
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.910 align:start position:0%
tightly and carefully drawn in this bill
to

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:54.620 align:start position:0%
essentially apply only to this one
 
00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric generator
 
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.590 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric generator
and

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
situation for determining just exactly
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
how much power they are putting back
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
onto the grid
 
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
since it's difficult to meter it at a
 
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:25.140 align:start position:0%
this bill provides a facility
 
00:10:27.769 --> 00:10:27.779 align:start position:0%
if you look at lines on page one of the
 
00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:30.959 align:start position:0%
bill lines 26 through 27 the
 
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric generator shall assume
 
00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:35.940 align:start position:0%
liability for monthly meter reads and
 
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
providing all requisite billing
 
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
determinants and other necessary data to
 
00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
the utility for billing purposes
 
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
including issuing net metering credits
 
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
the utility shall Bill according to the
 
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
information received from the
 
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric generator
 
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:56.220 align:start position:0%
but shall not be liable for the accuracy
 
00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
of the meter reads or the ongoing
 
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
maintenance and performance of the meter
 
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
the hydroelectric generator getting
 
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
billed and receiving credits
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
pursuant to this provision shall be
 
00:11:09.889 --> 00:11:09.899 align:start position:0%
subject to periodic audits
 
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:11.700 align:start position:0%
of the documentation and Records
 
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
associated with the meter reading
 
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
process to ensure compliance with all
 
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
statutes rules and tariffs
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
and the department of energy is going to
 
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
be involved here in determining and
 
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.810 align:start position:0%
be involved here in determining and
authorizing

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
authorizing
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
the method by which
 
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.350 align:start position:0%
the method by which
these

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
calculations are made so that's kind of
 
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
the unique aspect of this particular
 
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:40.730 align:start position:0%
the unique aspect of this particular
legislation

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
now I'm sure sure some of you are
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
wondering since this is a small
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
expansion of net metering
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
and I've been on record as saying that I
 
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
don't particularly favor expanding net
 
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.230 align:start position:0%
don't particularly favor expanding net
metering

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
metering
 
00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
why would I support this bill why would
 
00:11:58.610 --> 00:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
I even introduce this bill well
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
I do support modest cautious and careful
 
00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
expansions of net metering I've said
 
00:12:07.569 --> 00:12:07.579 align:start position:0%
this publicly on many occasions
 
00:12:10.009 --> 00:12:10.019 align:start position:0%
particularly when it supports our
 
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric Fleet
 
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
because our hydroelectric Fleet provides
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
run of river base load output
 
00:12:21.769 --> 00:12:21.779 align:start position:0%
and I think that's important to
 
00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
achieving reliability for the our
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
electric grid here in New Hampshire
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
so I think anything we can do to support
 
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:34.200 align:start position:0%
our hydroelectric Fleet is worthwhile
 
00:12:36.769 --> 00:12:36.779 align:start position:0%
provided that we put safeguards in place
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it doesn't get out of
 
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.990 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it doesn't get out of
control

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
I worry about out of control net
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
metering based on the experience of
 
00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:51.959 align:start position:0%
other states for example in California
 
00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
this California Public Utilities
 
00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:55.940 align:start position:0%
Commission just this past December
 
00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
lowered that State's net metering tariff
 
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
by 75 percent
 
00:13:04.129 --> 00:13:04.139 align:start position:0%
because they had determined
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
that net metering cost shifting was
 
00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
raising electric rates in their state to
 
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
the point where it was
 
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
actually harming the state's efforts
 
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.110 align:start position:0%
actually harming the state's efforts
to

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
electrify electrify its vehicle fleets
 
00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
people were turning away from electric
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
vehicles because the cost of electricity
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
was so high
 
00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:29.700 align:start position:0%
and they figured out after doing a lot
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
of studies that they needed to decrease
 
00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:35.220 align:start position:0%
the net metering tariff
 
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
net metering discouraged the purchase of
 
00:13:44.639 --> 00:13:46.790 align:start position:0%
net metering discouraged the purchase of
batteries

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
batteries
 
00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
if it was more lucrative for you to
 
00:13:51.769 --> 00:13:51.779 align:start position:0%
send your excess energy to the grid
 
00:13:55.129 --> 00:13:55.139 align:start position:0%
rather than putting it at a battery
 
00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
and that's what their previous tariff
 
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
did then people would not buy batteries
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
they just shipped their excess output to
 
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
the grid
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
so California said
 
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
for future net metering
 
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
customers you have to buy a battery if
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
you want to qualify for any net metering
 
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
and this is a reasonable policy it will
 
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
provide an incentive for the
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
proliferation of batteries
 
00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
and Battery Technology can provide
 
00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
new ways of doing business such as
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
transactive energy which is something
 
00:14:33.769 --> 00:14:33.779 align:start position:0%
we're going to be talking about later on
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
in this session
 
00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
so that's a long-winded way of
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
explaining why I support this
 
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.850 align:start position:0%
explaining why I support this
legislation

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to introduce it
 
00:14:45.889 --> 00:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
there is similar legislation in the
 
00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:48.660 align:start position:0%
Senate that has already passed and we'll
 
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
be talking about that uh later on when
 
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
we have an exact session on this bill
 
00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:56.839 align:start position:0%
but for now I'm going to stop and
 
00:14:59.090 --> 00:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
accept questions from the committee
 
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
because I know there's a lot of people
 
00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:02.579 align:start position:0%
behind us that want to speak about this
 
00:15:02.579 --> 00:15:03.470 align:start position:0%
behind us that want to speak about this
bill

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:15:05.569 --> 00:15:05.579 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Bose for your
 
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
excellent explanation and presentation
 
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
uh first question goes to representative
 
00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.090 align:start position:0%
uh first question goes to representative
Bernardi

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
Bernardi
 
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair Mr chair are you
 
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
aware of any other hydro small-scale
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
hydro facilities that may be in similar
 
00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
circumstance looking in the future for
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
this type of uh uh special exemption
 
00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:32.519 align:start position:0%
I am not aware of any other facilities
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
that face this problem and could benefit
 
00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
from this solution no
 
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
representative Winnie Thomas
 
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
Bill actually sounds like a pretty good
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
idea I do have one question on page two
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
line six through
 
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
H where it says the utility shall
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
recover the incremental costs for this
 
00:15:56.329 --> 00:15:56.339 align:start position:0%
manual billing process as well as all
 
00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
net meter and credits issued pursuant to
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
this provision from all utility
 
00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
customers my question is do you have an
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
estimation of how much utility bill
 
00:16:06.889 --> 00:16:06.899 align:start position:0%
utility bills would increase because of
 
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
no but that is problematic language and
 
00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:15.290 align:start position:0%
no but that is problematic language and
um

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:17.329 --> 00:16:17.339 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of potential
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
to that issue for example that
 
00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
language could be changed to read the
 
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
utility shall recover the incremental
 
00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
cost for the manual billing process as
 
00:16:35.689 --> 00:16:35.699 align:start position:0%
well as net metering credits pursuant to
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
this provision
 
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:39.180 align:start position:0%
as determined by the commission the
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
commission being the the Public
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission
 
00:16:44.569 --> 00:16:44.579 align:start position:0%
the reason this language is potentially
 
00:16:47.689 --> 00:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
problematic is that it applies only to
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
utility customers and
 
00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:51.860 align:start position:0%
could exclude
 
00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:54.500 align:start position:0%
the community power aggregation
 
00:16:58.730 --> 00:16:58.740 align:start position:0%
customers that soon will be
 
00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
coming on board in
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
fairly substantial numbers so this is
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
something that we're going to take a
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
close look at and when it comes to
 
00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
Executive session time I may be offering
 
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
an amendment to make some changes to
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
this language does that answer your
 
00:17:17.809 --> 00:17:17.819 align:start position:0%
question that does thank you thank you
 
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington
 
00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:21.959 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thank you thank you for taking
 
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
my question just as a follow-up to that
 
00:17:26.449 --> 00:17:26.459 align:start position:0%
when this as it's stated right now it
 
00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
says all utility customers does this
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
mean default service customers only or
 
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
is it anybody that gets a bill from a
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
utility company
 
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
are you talking about the the last part
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
of the line on yeah the one we just
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
discussed in line eight there which is
 
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
from all utility customers is that
 
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
default service customers only or is
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
that everybody who is signed up with a
 
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:50.940 align:start position:0%
utility for distribution services as
 
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
well yes I think that applies to all
 
00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
utility customers and that's the Crux of
 
00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
the issue here so okay all right so I
 
00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:00.380 align:start position:0%
just want to thank you okay
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative muns
 
00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and uh thank you for
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
um the language includes energy storage
 
00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
facilities it seems that's a new new
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
phrase in the in the in the section
 
00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
what's the reasoning for that
 
00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:21.900 align:start position:0%
it's on line six
 
00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
oh yes I see the the reference you're
 
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
and there is further there's language
 
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
further on
 
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.350 align:start position:0%
further on
that

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
says that
 
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
nothing in this provision shall be
 
00:18:54.409 --> 00:18:54.419 align:start position:0%
deemed to approve or allow the
 
00:18:55.789 --> 00:18:55.799 align:start position:0%
participation of energy storage
 
00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
facilities and net energy meeting
 
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
metering unless otherwise approved or
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
Allowed by law or an order or decision
 
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
issued or rule adopted by the department
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
of energy of the Public Utilities
 
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.529 align:start position:0%
of energy of the Public Utilities
Commission

00:19:09.529 --> 00:19:09.539 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
so it permits the use of
 
00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
energy storage as long as that's energy
 
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.450 align:start position:0%
energy storage as long as that's energy
storage

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:16.460 align:start position:0%
storage
 
00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:20.039 align:start position:0%
is carefully determined by the
 
00:19:21.169 --> 00:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
department of energy or the Public
 
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission to be able to
 
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
participate in net energy metering
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh representative
 
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
for your testimony I'd like to uh move
 
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
on to our next presenter which will be a
 
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
calling on Mr Griffin robush the pro
 
00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:43.140 align:start position:0%
Department of energy who has a different
 
00:19:59.650 --> 00:19:59.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
thank you uh chairman Thomas members of
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record Griffin
 
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
Roberge from the New Hampshire
 
00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
Department of energy the department is
 
00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
opposed to House Bill 458 is introduced
 
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:13.980 align:start position:0%
for background the statute permits a
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric generator with a total
 
00:20:18.289 --> 00:20:18.299 align:start position:0%
Peak capacity at or below one megawatt
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
that began operation before July 1 of
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
2021 and shares equipment or facilities
 
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
with other generators or electric
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
utility customers for interconnection
 
00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
shall be able to participate in net
 
00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
energy metering
 
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 458 modifies the statute
 
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
as you'll see in the bolded language but
 
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
uh specifically on lines 12 to 14 it
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
permits those hydroelectric facilities
 
00:20:45.409 --> 00:20:45.419 align:start position:0%
to be eligible as a customer generator
 
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
as a matter of law without regard as to
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
whether such hydroelectric generator is
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
the electric utility customer account of
 
00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:55.860 align:start position:0%
record at the point of interconnection
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
to the electric grid the remaining
 
00:20:59.570 --> 00:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
language spells out a process by which
 
00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
the hydroelectric generator would submit
 
00:21:03.289 --> 00:21:03.299 align:start position:0%
information to the department regarding
 
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
the facility's proposed methodology for
 
00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
reading and documenting meter data
 
00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:10.980 align:start position:0%
um the department understands the
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
Genesis of this bill stems from a couple
 
00:21:15.289 --> 00:21:15.299 align:start position:0%
of hydroelectric facilities owned by
 
00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
Brookfield Renewable that are located
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
behind the meter at White Mountain paper
 
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
in Gorham New Hampshire on paper white
 
00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:24.419 align:start position:0%
Mount the company White Mountain paper
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
is the customer generator as they are
 
00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
the interconnection point for the
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric facilities again located
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
behind the meter how the that Hydro
 
00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
those hydroelectric facilities sell
 
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
their power is outlined in existing
 
00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
power purchase agreement that was
 
00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:41.220 align:start position:0%
reached by consensus amongst both
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
private parties the White Mountain paper
 
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
company and Brookfield Renewable as far
 
00:21:48.289 --> 00:21:48.299 align:start position:0%
as doe understands this is the only
 
00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
arrangement in the state that this bill
 
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
would impact but we are firmly opposed
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
to the proposed language change on lines
 
00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:56.820 align:start position:0%
12 to 4 as it fundamentally undermines
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
the current statute by allowing a
 
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric generator itself to be
 
00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
considered a customer generator in short
 
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
the bill looks to remove the term
 
00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
customer from customer generator despite
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
the Hydra your electric generator being
 
00:22:13.149 --> 00:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
a customer of the utility
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
customer generators within statutory
 
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
limits are allowed to net meter their
 
00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
renewable energy generation back to the
 
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
Grid at the customer level this bill
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
proposes to allow the hydroelectric
 
00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
facility itself a generator that
 
00:22:27.049 --> 00:22:27.059 align:start position:0%
currently exists behind the meter at
 
00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
White Mountain paper to act as a
 
00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:30.860 align:start position:0%
customer generator
 
00:22:33.649 --> 00:22:33.659 align:start position:0%
doe would respectfully contend that any
 
00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:35.460 align:start position:0%
characterization that this bill is a
 
00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:38.039 align:start position:0%
technical fix a minor change or a
 
00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
cleanup from previous legislation is
 
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
wholly inaccurate the bill does not
 
00:22:45.289 --> 00:22:45.299 align:start position:0%
incentivize any new generation or
 
00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
directly lower electric rates the
 
00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
department submits that this bill
 
00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:50.820 align:start position:0%
represents a significant policy change
 
00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
for legislators to consider enacting
 
00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
this change does create a precedent for
 
00:22:57.529 --> 00:22:57.539 align:start position:0%
other facilities to capitalize on the
 
00:22:59.930 --> 00:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
benefits of net energy metering and may
 
00:23:01.549 --> 00:23:01.559 align:start position:0%
open the door for future legislative
 
00:23:03.289 --> 00:23:03.299 align:start position:0%
attempts to slowly chip away at the
 
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
definition of customer generator
 
00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
as previously stated doe believes this
 
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
bill stems from an existing power
 
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
purchase agreement again between two
 
00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
private parties group field renewable
 
00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
and White Mountain paper in Gorham New
 
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire only one party to date
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
Brookfield Renewable has been attending
 
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
public hearings for an amendment that
 
00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
was proposed last year on this issue as
 
00:23:27.049 --> 00:23:27.059 align:start position:0%
well as the legislation currently before
 
00:23:27.059 --> 00:23:28.430 align:start position:0%
well as the legislation currently before
you

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
um it is our understanding that White
 
00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
Mountain paper is just now becoming
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
aware of House Bill 458's existence and
 
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
its proposed changes and I believe they
 
00:23:39.169 --> 00:23:39.179 align:start position:0%
have representation here today who can
 
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
speak to the company's observations of
 
00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
the bill there may be a potential
 
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
non-legislative solution to this issue
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
around customer generator which may be
 
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
addressed through negotiations again
 
00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
through two private parties who reached
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
a who reached an agreement on an
 
00:23:57.049 --> 00:23:57.059 align:start position:0%
existing power purchase agreement this
 
00:23:59.149 --> 00:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
concludes my testimony on this bill and
 
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly willing to answer any
 
00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.690 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly willing to answer any
questions

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:02.700 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:05.820 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr robarge
 
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
seeing one question from representative
 
00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:09.950 align:start position:0%
seeing one question from representative
Summers

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
Summers
 
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman just a quick
 
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:13.980 align:start position:0%
question I I know it doesn't mention in
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
a mountain here but is there any idea of
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
how much the utility Administration
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
costs would add to the rate payers
 
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
expense thank you for the question I
 
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
unfortunately couldn't answer that
 
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
question that might be something to ask
 
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
the utility that overlooks this
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
Arrangement thank you representative
 
00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.070 align:start position:0%
Arrangement thank you representative
Harrington

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
Harrington
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and I think you think my
 
00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
question uh this kind of I'm wondering
 
00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
does this open the door now we're taking
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
uh one particular group here with two
 
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
private individuals as you said and with
 
00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
changing law just to make it life better
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
for at least one of them I guess how
 
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
many other uh examples might be floating
 
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
around out there where we're going to
 
00:24:54.409 --> 00:24:54.419 align:start position:0%
have one or two companies or private
 
00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
individuals that we change the law for
 
00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
in order to make their life better sure
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question as as I
 
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:01.799 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh the department believes
 
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
that this bill as it's currently written
 
00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
would only impact
 
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
um the arrangement between Brookfield
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
Renewable and White Mountain paper we
 
00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:11.940 align:start position:0%
the department just wants to strongly
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
note two policy makers such as such as
 
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
those in this committee that this does
 
00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:19.799 align:start position:0%
open the door for watering down the
 
00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
definition of customer generator
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
it does open the door to give private
 
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
entities the opportunity to maybe submit
 
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
legislation in the future to maybe water
 
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
down current statutory Provisions around
 
00:25:33.409 --> 00:25:33.419 align:start position:0%
customer generator the department wants
 
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:35.220 align:start position:0%
to strongly convey that to this
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
committee that that is an implication
 
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative bones
 
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question and
 
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
I apologize it's it's still early so I'm
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out all this there's a
 
00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
lot to unpack in your in your testimony
 
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
um and what I'm trying to understand is
 
00:26:03.529 --> 00:26:03.539 align:start position:0%
if these two organizations have an
 
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
agreement already why why do why is
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
there a need for this legislation what
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
what is what are they I think that might
 
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
be a question to ask the private parties
 
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
thank you yep that's that's appropriate
 
00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:16.860 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:26:18.769 --> 00:26:18.779 align:start position:0%
see any questions thank you Mr Roberts
 
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:22.140 align:start position:0%
thank you move on to the next presenter
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and members of
 
00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
00:26:45.289 --> 00:26:45.299 align:start position:0%
Heidi Kroll I work at Gallagher kalihana
 
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
gartrell and I'm here today on behalf of
 
00:26:49.549 --> 00:26:49.559 align:start position:0%
both Brookfield Renewable as well as
 
00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
Monadnock paper mills with me is Steve
 
00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
zeretti from Brookfield Renewable
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:26:59.330 --> 00:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
with the government relations uh
 
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
division we are in support of
 
00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 458 and I think we can
 
00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
answer a lot of the questions that have
 
00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
been raised so far in terms of the
 
00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
legislation so
 
00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
um this bill is with respect to
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
existing Hydro facilities it's amending
 
00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:26.460 align:start position:0%
existing law RSA 362 a colon 9 Roman 20.
 
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
um and it's attempting to
 
00:27:30.769 --> 00:27:30.779 align:start position:0%
um amend this law so that it can
 
00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:33.260 align:start position:0%
actually be implemented this law
 
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
originally was passed with passage of SB
 
00:27:42.049 --> 00:27:42.059 align:start position:0%
91 in 2021 that was a bill that had
 
00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support and it was signed at
 
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
a signing ceremony that the governor
 
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
held both for SB 91 and House Bill 315
 
00:27:53.649 --> 00:27:53.659 align:start position:0%
which was the bill that allowed
 
00:27:57.169 --> 00:27:57.179 align:start position:0%
Municipal net metering and again that
 
00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:01.140 align:start position:0%
was back in August of 2021 and as
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative Vos or chairman Vos
 
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned the original intent of SB 91
 
00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:09.140 align:start position:0%
was to try to address
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
the situation that two Hydro facilities
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire have and both
 
00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:16.980 align:start position:0%
Monadnock paper mills and Brookfield
 
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
Renewable have multiple Hydro facilities
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
behind a a meter that's a single
 
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
interconnection point so in the case for
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
example I'll give you Monadnock paper
 
00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
mills first they have three Hydro
 
00:28:36.409 --> 00:28:36.419 align:start position:0%
facilities each are below one megawatt
 
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
they're individually licensed by ferc
 
00:28:40.669 --> 00:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
they're individually certified by the
 
00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
puc to produce Rex by all other measures
 
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
they are Standalone facilities but they
 
00:28:48.909 --> 00:28:48.919 align:start position:0%
interconnect and feed their power
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
through Manana paper mills and then mad
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
knock paper mills is the single point of
 
00:28:57.730 --> 00:28:57.740 align:start position:0%
interconnection to the grid
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
similarly Brookfield Renewable has
 
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
actually six Hydro facilities behind the
 
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
retail meter as you heard it's White
 
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
Mountain paper up there they have six
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
Hydro facilities behind the meter
 
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
four of those Hydra facilities are under
 
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
five megawatts two are above five base
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
slightly above five megawatts
 
00:29:19.679 --> 00:29:20.690 align:start position:0%
slightly above five megawatts
um

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:20.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
so originally when we passed SB 91 it
 
00:29:27.049 --> 00:29:27.059 align:start position:0%
was to address the problem uh eversource
 
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
was looking for clarification
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
um what they were saying is that when we
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
look at the single point of
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
interconnection in the example for
 
00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
example of monadnaught paper mills we
 
00:29:39.409 --> 00:29:39.419 align:start position:0%
can't tell really whether it's three
 
00:29:41.389 --> 00:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
separate separate Hydro facilities that
 
00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:43.380 align:start position:0%
are each under one megawatt and as we
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
know anything under one megawatt
 
00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
qualifies for net metering or does it
 
00:29:51.049 --> 00:29:51.059 align:start position:0%
really kind of looks to us like it might
 
00:29:53.149 --> 00:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
just be one single Hydro facility
 
00:29:54.769 --> 00:29:54.779 align:start position:0%
because it's coming through one single
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
point of interconnection and so they
 
00:29:58.850 --> 00:29:58.860 align:start position:0%
were just looking for clarity
 
00:29:58.860 --> 00:29:59.690 align:start position:0%
were just looking for clarity
um

00:29:59.690 --> 00:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
so we passed uh SB 91 again as I said in
 
00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
2021 again it would it was had
 
00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:08.220 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support and the idea was
 
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
simply to try to level the playing field
 
00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
so that these high two cases of hydro
 
00:30:15.289 --> 00:30:15.299 align:start position:0%
facilities that had this problem could
 
00:30:18.409 --> 00:30:18.419 align:start position:0%
participate in net metering and with the
 
00:30:21.169 --> 00:30:21.179 align:start position:0%
passage of House Bill 315 Municipal
 
00:30:24.169 --> 00:30:24.179 align:start position:0%
group net metering like any other Hydro
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
facility is able to enjoy
 
00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
after the passage of SB 91 both entities
 
00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:34.580 align:start position:0%
approached eversource
 
00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:38.220 align:start position:0%
to start the paperwork if you will in
 
00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
terms of trying to net meter or group
 
00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:44.220 align:start position:0%
net meter and eversource identified an
 
00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
additional problem fair enough
 
00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799 align:start position:0%
um there the additional problem was in
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
the case of Brookfield like I mentioned
 
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
they have the six Hydro facilities four
 
00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
are eligible for net metering and two
 
00:30:57.909 --> 00:30:57.919 align:start position:0%
are not
 
00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
in addition they have as you've heard
 
00:31:02.889 --> 00:31:02.899 align:start position:0%
they have a purchase power
 
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
contract purchase power agreement with
 
00:31:09.529 --> 00:31:09.539 align:start position:0%
Whitefield a white mountain paper and
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
that's a long-term contract and their
 
00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
first and foremost obligation is to have
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
the output of the mill output of the
 
00:31:18.669 --> 00:31:18.679 align:start position:0%
hydro facilities
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
supplying the load of the mill and so
 
00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
again with net metering it's really only
 
00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
excess generation that's not being used
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
use behind the meter that would
 
00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:31.799 align:start position:0%
potentially be eligible for for net
 
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
metering and so and in the case of
 
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
Monadnock paper mill they have in
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
addition to their three Hydro facilities
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
they have a on-site steam turbine runs
 
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
off of waste heat from the mill
 
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
um when the mill is running that steam
 
00:31:48.169 --> 00:31:48.179 align:start position:0%
turbine is running they're using all of
 
00:31:50.269 --> 00:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
their Hydro that needs about 50 percent
 
00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
of their power needs they buy the other
 
00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
50 from the competitive market but at
 
00:31:58.010 --> 00:31:58.020 align:start position:0%
any rate Hydra eversource was looking
 
00:32:00.649 --> 00:32:00.659 align:start position:0%
for a methodology which is spelled out
 
00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:02.580 align:start position:0%
in this piece of legislation a
 
00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
methodology which Oliver simplifying to
 
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
say that is kind of like a fancy
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet where you're metering the
 
00:32:11.149 --> 00:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
output of each Hydro facility
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
um looking at what's being used on site
 
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
and then making sure that anything that
 
00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
is coming out onto the grid any kilowatt
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
hours that um that you're being clear
 
00:32:24.289 --> 00:32:24.299 align:start position:0%
that if it's going to be if those
 
00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours are going to be net
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
metered that they're coming from
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
eligible at net metered eligible
 
00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:31.980 align:start position:0%
facilities so in the case of Brookfield
 
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
screening out any power that's coming
 
00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
from the two facilities that are greater
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
than five megawatts
 
00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.430 align:start position:0%
than five megawatts
um

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
so that is the intent of this
 
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
legislation is to try to address that
 
00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:47.820 align:start position:0%
additional problem that we didn't
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
foresee when SB 91 was passed we did
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
work closely with
 
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
um and as you heard there's there was
 
00:32:57.649 --> 00:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
efforts last year and we worked with a
 
00:32:59.810 --> 00:32:59.820 align:start position:0%
variety of parties eversource doe and
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
the chairman Vos
 
00:33:01.919 --> 00:33:02.630 align:start position:0%
the chairman Vos
um

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
this year as well we went back with
 
00:33:06.889 --> 00:33:06.899 align:start position:0%
eversource and worked through this
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
language so the language that is in
 
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
house bill 458 we did work very closely
 
00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:14.700 align:start position:0%
with eversource on and they are
 
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that language
 
00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:18.049 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that language
um

00:33:18.049 --> 00:33:18.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to mention that as well
 
00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:21.649 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to mention that as well
and

00:33:21.649 --> 00:33:21.659 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
um the other thing I would say
 
00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:26.460 align:start position:0%
um two other things actually one with
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
the net metered power that would be
 
00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:31.019 align:start position:0%
coming from the Brookfield facilities
 
00:33:33.289 --> 00:33:33.299 align:start position:0%
any excess that's not being used to
 
00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
serve White Mountain paper that power
 
00:33:37.789 --> 00:33:37.799 align:start position:0%
would be eligible for the municipal
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
group net metering program again which
 
00:33:43.669 --> 00:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
was passed with bipartisan support and
 
00:33:45.049 --> 00:33:45.059 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor at the signing
 
00:33:47.149 --> 00:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
ceremony in August of 2021 that was
 
00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:50.460 align:start position:0%
House Bill 315 so that's as you know
 
00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions municipalities
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
schools the state counties that are
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
eligible under that program
 
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
final thing I want to say and then I'll
 
00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:04.140 align:start position:0%
turn it over to Steve to add some
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
additional remarks this language has
 
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:11.940 align:start position:0%
been very very narrowly tailored to
 
00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
address these two situations and if you
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
look at the beginning of the law or
 
00:34:20.089 --> 00:34:20.099 align:start position:0%
beginning of the legislation we're
 
00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
talking about a hydroelectric generator
 
00:34:24.109 --> 00:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
with a total Peak generating capacity
 
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
that is at or below the capacity
 
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:28.740 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements set forth
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
already in law so again that's one
 
00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:34.740 align:start position:0%
megawatt or less serving
 
00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:35.450 align:start position:0%
megawatt or less serving
um

00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:37.730 align:start position:0%
um
municipalities

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:37.740 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:39.899 align:start position:0%
um as well and other political entities
 
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:41.940 align:start position:0%
as well as businesses if you're over one
 
00:34:44.329 --> 00:34:44.339 align:start position:0%
megawatt you can only serve under the
 
00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:46.919 align:start position:0%
municipal net metering program and that
 
00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:49.379 align:start position:0%
first became operational before July 1st
 
00:34:52.849 --> 00:34:52.859 align:start position:0%
of 2021 and that shares equipment or
 
00:34:55.129 --> 00:34:55.139 align:start position:0%
facilities with other generators energy
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
storage facilities or electric utility
 
00:34:59.210 --> 00:34:59.220 align:start position:0%
customers for interconnection to the
 
00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
electric grid and so that basically
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
means to say only the two situations
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
that we know of that have this problem
 
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
of sharing a single interconnection
 
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
point with the grid so it is um very
 
00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
narrowly tailored
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll turn it over to Steve
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
thanks Heidi good for the record I'm
 
00:35:22.609 --> 00:35:22.619 align:start position:0%
sorry could you uh say your full name
 
00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
please yep uh good morning Steve zaretti
 
00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
with Brookfield renewal
 
00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:29.940 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'd first reinforce what what
 
00:35:32.569 --> 00:35:32.579 align:start position:0%
Heidi described some questions around
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
the arrangement between Brookfield and
 
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
White Mountain paper without getting
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
into details of a private arrangement I
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
would just reinforce that the intent of
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
this legislation and the entirety of the
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
discussion we've had around it publicly
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
and privately is focused entirely on
 
00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
excess generation unallocated under the
 
00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
PPA so there was no intent on
 
00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:56.700 align:start position:0%
brookfield's part to not continue to
 
00:35:58.910 --> 00:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
serve the mill or to not continue to
 
00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:00.839 align:start position:0%
serve our contractual obligations under
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
that PPA so that is unaffected as part
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
of this we acknowledge that the
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
discussion here and in fact the language
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
described is focused on excess
 
00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.410 align:start position:0%
described is focused on excess
Generation

00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
Generation
 
00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
Um and I think when you look at the the
 
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
language in the proposed legislation
 
00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
where it talks about the methodology
 
00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
energy that would have to be captured
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
with the does input that is really
 
00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:25.140 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that there needs to be an
 
00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:26.349 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that there needs to be an
identified

00:36:26.349 --> 00:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
identified
 
00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
methodology for understanding what is
 
00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
and isn't eligible so what is serving
 
00:36:34.609 --> 00:36:34.619 align:start position:0%
the load as first priority and then what
 
00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:37.740 align:start position:0%
is being exported to the grid and of
 
00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
that exported energy what is coming from
 
00:36:41.569 --> 00:36:41.579 align:start position:0%
the the hydros that are below five
 
00:36:44.089 --> 00:36:44.099 align:start position:0%
megawatts and that would ultimately be
 
00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
eligible and then above five megawatts
 
00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:49.740 align:start position:0%
of course would not so I just want to
 
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
clarify that piece first on the customer
 
00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
generator piece you know that was
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
something that we hadn't anticipated we
 
00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
did work on SB 91 and had expected to
 
00:37:05.329 --> 00:37:05.339 align:start position:0%
enroll a portion of these projects when
 
00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:07.140 align:start position:0%
we worked with eversource we determined
 
00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
or they determined that there would be
 
00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:10.740 align:start position:0%
an issue there and we've worked
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with them since to
 
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
identify language that would work for
 
00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
project enrollment in our view in the
 
00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
absence of that language for
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
participation in the program there's
 
00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
really only a couple ways that we would
 
00:37:26.589 --> 00:37:26.599 align:start position:0%
pursue that which is one would be
 
00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:29.220 align:start position:0%
implementing costly infrastructure to
 
00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
interconnect these stations individually
 
00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:33.660 align:start position:0%
which sort of undermines the intent of
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
the original enabling statute or for
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
Brookfield to take on the customer
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
obligation at the point of
 
00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
interconnection which would be
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
an odd Arrangement as we're an
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
unaffiliated entity from the the mill
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
itself so happy to answer whatever
 
00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:53.700 align:start position:0%
questions but I did just want to clarify
 
00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
those two pieces up front
 
00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
thank you both of you a question from
 
00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.990 align:start position:0%
thank you both of you a question from
representative

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.490 align:start position:0%
representative
Coleman

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
Coleman
 
00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
Carmen sorry
 
00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question I just want to make
 
00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
sure I understand we're talking about
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
four facilities altogether uh but at
 
00:38:13.849 --> 00:38:13.859 align:start position:0%
least 10 megawatts of power of
 
00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
generation power because two of them are
 
00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:17.700 align:start position:0%
at least five megawatts the others are
 
00:38:20.089 --> 00:38:20.099 align:start position:0%
under one so somewhere I don't know 10
 
00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:22.220 align:start position:0%
to 14 total
 
00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:24.780 align:start position:0%
and much of that power is going to be
 
00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
used by White Mountain paper and then
 
00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:31.380 align:start position:0%
the rest would go onto the grid so are
 
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
we anticipating that that amount that
 
00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
goes onto the grid is always going to be
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
under five megawatts or or not so that's
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the point of the language
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
where it defers to the doe to establish
 
00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
a methodology for determining what is
 
00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:49.380 align:start position:0%
and it isn't eligible Supply so there's
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
a couple ways that you you could do that
 
00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
and I won't you know at this point uh
 
00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
assume what the the outcome of that
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
would be but that is the point of that
 
00:39:00.589 --> 00:39:00.599 align:start position:0%
to make sure that nothing that would be
 
00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
eligible for the program is coming from
 
00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:04.740 align:start position:0%
a project that is size greater than the
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
program limit
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative poche
 
00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and thank you for taking
 
00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:13.140 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:14.270 align:start position:0%
my question
um

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:16.980 align:start position:0%
when I first read this
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
I didn't see an issue
 
00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
now with three testimonies
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
I've heard that this would not affect
 
00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.190 align:start position:0%
I've heard that this would not affect
proliferation

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
proliferation
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
I've heard that this might open statutes
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
very strongly
 
00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:35.460 align:start position:0%
suggesting that
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
along with uh
 
00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:41.460 align:start position:0%
another suggestion which is my question
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
the suggestion was that the two parties
 
00:39:48.589 --> 00:39:48.599 align:start position:0%
possibly could come up and solve this
 
00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
issue without legislation
 
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
um well I don't I don't want to
 
00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:00.740 align:start position:0%
discuss sort of a private Arrangement
 
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
publicly and I don't want to speak on
 
00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
behalf of White Mountain paper
 
00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
but in our view that would require some
 
00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
type of amendment to the PPA which has
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
all along been something that we're
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
looking to avoid here we're not looking
 
00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
to make any changes to the existing
 
00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:17.940 align:start position:0%
agreement we want to keep that in place
 
00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
as is and so any changes would either
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
require some type of change to the PPA
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
or some additional administrative burden
 
00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
on White Mountain paper which is also
 
00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
what we would like to not see here so
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
this in our view is the most streamlined
 
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
way of keeping the contract unaffected
 
00:40:38.329 --> 00:40:38.339 align:start position:0%
but enabling what we think was in part
 
00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:40.740 align:start position:0%
the intent of SB 91 to be
 
00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:42.829 align:start position:0%
the intent of SB 91 to be
operationalized

00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
operationalized
 
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Harrington
 
00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:40:49.609 --> 00:40:49.619 align:start position:0%
taking my question a little confused
 
00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
here you seemed like you're saying you
 
00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
went into a voluntary contract between
 
00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
two private parties and now rather than
 
00:40:59.329 --> 00:40:59.339 align:start position:0%
go back and we negotiate the contract
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
you want us to pass a law that among
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
other people requires me to pay a higher
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
electric bill uh because it's all
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
utility customers so why should I pay a
 
00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
higher electric bill because you don't
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
want to negotiate a contract
 
00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
the contract I don't think is
 
00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
necessarily relevant here because the
 
00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
point of this is about the excess
 
00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
generation that's not allocated to the
 
00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:22.490 align:start position:0%
generation that's not allocated to the
contract

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
contract
 
00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:24.540 align:start position:0%
so we're not looking to make a change to
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
the contract we don't think we need to
 
00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
make a change to the contract so that's
 
00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
not the the intent of of this
 
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up would you be open to
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
saying instead of all utility customers
 
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
that the two parties involved pick up
 
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
all the costs associated with this
 
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
rather than passing it on to some
 
00:41:44.569 --> 00:41:44.579 align:start position:0%
retired grandmother in Manchester
 
00:41:44.579 --> 00:41:50.450 align:start position:0%
retired grandmother in Manchester
foreign

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
I think there are a couple things I just
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to kind of be clear so
 
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
first of all with the passage of House
 
00:41:59.690 --> 00:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
Bill 315 we authorize the state
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
authorized Municipal net metering so any
 
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:06.180 align:start position:0%
facility between one megawatt and five
 
00:42:08.089 --> 00:42:08.099 align:start position:0%
megawatt Watts whether it's Hydro or
 
00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
solar or any other renewable can serve
 
00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions as it's defined
 
00:42:20.089 --> 00:42:20.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:20.099 --> 00:42:21.109 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
what Brookfield is looking for under
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
this legislation is the same ability
 
00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
that other Hydro facilities and other
 
00:42:31.609 --> 00:42:31.619 align:start position:0%
renewable generators already have which
 
00:42:35.089 --> 00:42:35.099 align:start position:0%
is to use the excess generation so that
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
the generations that's not already
 
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
earmarked for White Mountain paper under
 
00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
the purchase power agreement
 
00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
what is excess to be able to allocate or
 
00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:48.300 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity for that excess to
 
00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:51.900 align:start position:0%
be used in the municipal net metering
 
00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:53.390 align:start position:0%
be used in the municipal net metering
program

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
um so to the extent that do you think
 
00:42:59.390 --> 00:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
there are costs associated with that
 
00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.470 align:start position:0%
there are costs associated with that
um

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
I think the idea here is just to try to
 
00:43:05.089 --> 00:43:05.099 align:start position:0%
level the playing field so that it this
 
00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
Hydro facility could participate just
 
00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
like others are allowed to
 
00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
um with respect to the
 
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
um well anyway I guess I'll leave it
 
00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
there I don't know if I've answered very
 
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
quickly well
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
um you can have a follow-up when someone
 
00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
else asks questions okay representative
 
00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:24.660 align:start position:0%
uh Reynolds has a question
 
00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:27.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman following up on
 
00:43:29.329 --> 00:43:29.339 align:start position:0%
that question isn't
 
00:43:32.089 --> 00:43:32.099 align:start position:0%
the cost of
 
00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:35.220 align:start position:0%
Counting the comings and the goings the
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours administering net
 
00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:40.740 align:start position:0%
metering already a cost that
 
00:43:43.609 --> 00:43:43.619 align:start position:0%
all of our utilities
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
there and already include
 
00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
in um
 
00:43:50.569 --> 00:43:50.579 align:start position:0%
in customers bills on the principle that
 
00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
net metering renewable energy is a
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
benefit to Consumers
 
00:43:59.630 --> 00:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding yes
 
00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:00.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi
 
00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:07.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair so regarding SB
 
00:44:11.569 --> 00:44:11.579 align:start position:0%
91 uh
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
your written testimony now indicates
 
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839 align:start position:0%
that the Berlin Gorham situation was a
 
00:44:22.849 --> 00:44:22.859 align:start position:0%
driver of that yet in your testimony two
 
00:44:25.309 --> 00:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
years ago it never appeared is never
 
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
mentioned can you explain that
 
00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:29.510 align:start position:0%
mentioned can you explain that
disconnect

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
disconnect
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
um so at least on brookfield's part I
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
can say that we did submit testimony to
 
00:44:37.609 --> 00:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
this committee uh in favor of SB 91 and
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh described the implications for our
 
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:45.650 align:start position:0%
uh described the implications for our
composite

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:50.940 align:start position:0%
oh specifically uh focusing in on Berlin
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
and Gorham it was not mentioned before
 
00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:01.740 align:start position:0%
same answer so we did testify before the
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
committee you may be confusing that with
 
00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
banana paper which was also discussed
 
00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:09.900 align:start position:0%
um in in committee but we did work
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
actually with Monadnock paper on that
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
legislation and testified before the
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
committee thank you yeah we'll take one
 
00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
last follow-up from representative
 
00:45:19.319 --> 00:45:20.329 align:start position:0%
last follow-up from representative
Harrington

00:45:20.329 --> 00:45:20.339 align:start position:0%
Harrington
 
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
and I'll be quick Mr chairman thank you
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned uh uh
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
municipals municipalities in your
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
previous statement uh in response to my
 
00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:29.750 align:start position:0%
previous statement uh in response to my
question

00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
I'm a little confused I thought these
 
00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
are two private parties where which one
 
00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
is Municipal uh so the the point would
 
00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
be to enroll the projects or the access
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
output from the projects into the
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
municipal group net metering program so
 
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
that the the beneficiaries of that
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
enrollment would be municipalities and
 
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
other political subdivisions
 
00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:52.140 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimonies uh
 
00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
well explained I'm going to invite Mr
 
00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:56.150 align:start position:0%
well explained I'm going to invite Mr
koozie

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
koozie
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:21.300 align:start position:0%
uh good morning Mr Vice chair members of
 
00:46:23.329 --> 00:46:23.339 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
David cuzzy with Prospect Hill
 
00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
strategies here in town uh this morning
 
00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:30.060 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of White Mountain Paper
 
00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:31.309 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of White Mountain Paper
Company

00:46:31.309 --> 00:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
Company
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
White Mountain Paper Company at this
 
00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
time does not have a position on the
 
00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.730 align:start position:0%
time does not have a position on the
bill

00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:36.740 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
largely that is because as
 
00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
Mr Roberts mentioned the company
 
00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
just became aware of the legislation I
 
00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:48.180 align:start position:0%
just began working with the company a
 
00:46:49.609 --> 00:46:49.619 align:start position:0%
few weeks ago
 
00:46:54.109 --> 00:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
and as Miss Kroll mentioned all the
 
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that were in discussions
 
00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
going back to last year
 
00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:01.140 align:start position:0%
uh White Mountain paper was not among
 
00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:02.700 align:start position:0%
those even though
 
00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:04.740 align:start position:0%
uh we're a pretty significant
 
00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:06.060 align:start position:0%
stakeholder here which is not a
 
00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:08.220 align:start position:0%
complaint just a statement of fact uh
 
00:47:10.609 --> 00:47:10.619 align:start position:0%
that being the case uh White Mountain
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
paper thinks that uh for all the points
 
00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
of discussion made this morning that it
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
it would maybe make sense to have the
 
00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:19.740 align:start position:0%
benefit of some time
 
00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
so that we can engage with Brookfield
 
00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:26.700 align:start position:0%
and others and also internally
 
00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
decide what uh if any are the impacts
 
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
both in terms of the current agreement
 
00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
but also uh
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
what may be the impact down the road
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
once this agreement which I believe the
 
00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
PPA expires in 2030 I I I make okay uh
 
00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
in 2030 uh obviously that uh that
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
generation is the lifeblood of the mill
 
00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
and so there are there are those
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
implications that the company would like
 
00:47:58.430 --> 00:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
the benefit of of understanding both
 
00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
internally and into discussions with
 
00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
with Brookfield and others so I do know
 
00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
uh as previously mentioned sb40 is
 
00:48:08.809 --> 00:48:08.819 align:start position:0%
already on its way from the Senate which
 
00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
is companion legislation and I would uh
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
respectfully suggest that
 
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
um if that if it's possible that maybe
 
00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:20.220 align:start position:0%
that be the vehicle that is utilized
 
00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:21.780 align:start position:0%
because that will be worked on in the
 
00:48:24.109 --> 00:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
spring that'll give us several weeks a
 
00:48:25.809 --> 00:48:25.819 align:start position:0%
couple months to
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
better determine uh how we feel about
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
this we White Mountain paper feel about
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
this uh and and see if there's a a path
 
00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
to Yes uh on that and with that Mr
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
chairman I thank you uh and happy to
 
00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
answer any questions the best I can yes
 
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
I will I will take Liberty to ask us one
 
00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
question which I'm sure others may ask
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
the same question as before do you
 
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
believe that we need legislation in or
 
00:48:55.309 --> 00:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
can this be worked out offline and thank
 
00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
you for the question Mr Vice chair
 
00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
respectfully I I think I don't I don't
 
00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:00.349 align:start position:0%
respectfully I I think I don't I don't
know

00:49:00.349 --> 00:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
um and so that is why uh at the that is
 
00:49:05.569 --> 00:49:05.579 align:start position:0%
why we don't have a position but why we
 
00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:07.140 align:start position:0%
also think
 
00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:10.500 align:start position:0%
this would benefit from some time
 
00:49:14.329 --> 00:49:14.339 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Corman
 
00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:16.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question could you elaborate a
 
00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
little bit more on how the EPA fits into
 
00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:21.890 align:start position:0%
little bit more on how the EPA fits into
this

00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:21.900 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:24.180 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question I I
 
00:49:26.329 --> 00:49:26.339 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I wouldn't be in a position to
 
00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
uh to elaborate on that I apologize we
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
can we can uh get you that that answer
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative munz thank you Mr chair
 
00:49:38.329 --> 00:49:38.339 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for taking my question
 
00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:40.140 align:start position:0%
um in the research that you've done
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
since becoming aware of this
 
00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:45.420 align:start position:0%
um did you did you find out if there has
 
00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
been any
 
00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:48.540 align:start position:0%
um attempts to address this
 
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
administratively going to the Department
 
00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
of energy to puc you know that type of
 
00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:55.980 align:start position:0%
thing on behalf of white mountain or
 
00:49:58.910 --> 00:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
just just generally generally yeah
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
I I I can only speak to White Mountain
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
we're not aware of uh White Mountain has
 
00:50:07.790 --> 00:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
not been a part of any of those
 
00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
discussions I know
 
00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:10.430 align:start position:0%
discussions I know
um

00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:14.089 --> 00:50:14.099 align:start position:0%
Department of energy also reached out to
 
00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:16.500 align:start position:0%
see if if the company just a matter of
 
00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
uh a week or two ago or something along
 
00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
those lines to see if the company had
 
00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
had a chance to look at the legislation
 
00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
that would be the extent as far as I
 
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:28.260 align:start position:0%
know uh of White Mountains
 
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
administrative exploration I guess for
 
00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:32.339 align:start position:0%
lack of a better way to phrase it
 
00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr kessie for your testimony
 
00:50:38.329 --> 00:50:38.339 align:start position:0%
we're going to move along now thank you
 
00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to call on Mr Michael
 
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:57.069 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:50:57.069 --> 00:50:57.079 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:50:59.329 --> 00:50:59.339 align:start position:0%
for the record Michael Licata
 
00:51:02.569 --> 00:51:02.579 align:start position:0%
representing eversource energy
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
just want to start off by saying that
 
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
eversource is in support of this
 
00:51:11.329 --> 00:51:11.339 align:start position:0%
legislation we do appreciate the
 
00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:13.400 align:start position:0%
Outreach uh
 
00:51:16.849 --> 00:51:16.859 align:start position:0%
to us to to work on the language and get
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
it um to a place that we think uh is
 
00:51:24.049 --> 00:51:24.059 align:start position:0%
really uh narrowly focused on fixing a
 
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
metering issue
 
00:51:29.329 --> 00:51:29.339 align:start position:0%
and making sure that these two Hydro
 
00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:31.640 align:start position:0%
facilities are able to
 
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:34.740 align:start position:0%
participate in state net metering as
 
00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
authorized by SB 91 in in 2021
 
00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
um I guess we we respectfully disagree
 
00:51:45.049 --> 00:51:45.059 align:start position:0%
with our friends at the department of
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
energy that this is a a broader more
 
00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:49.510 align:start position:0%
energy that this is a a broader more
expansive

00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
expansive
 
00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:52.740 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation from the company's
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
perspective the challenge is that
 
00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:00.180 align:start position:0%
um as Miss Kroll described you have two
 
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
facilities with multiple
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
two locations with multiple generating
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
facilities that are located behind the
 
00:52:11.809 --> 00:52:11.819 align:start position:0%
eversource retail meter and in order for
 
00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
them to participate in net metering as
 
00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:17.220 align:start position:0%
previously authorized the company needed
 
00:52:20.089 --> 00:52:20.099 align:start position:0%
to determine how to essentially read
 
00:52:23.089 --> 00:52:23.099 align:start position:0%
those meters those are privately owned
 
00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
meters they're Revenue grade meters
 
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
which means they're they're highly
 
00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:29.700 align:start position:0%
accurate and able to participate in
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
Regional markets but
 
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
the clarity that is being sought by by
 
00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
this legislation is
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
um who owns the meter who reads the
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
meter who maintains the meter who
 
00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:44.940 align:start position:0%
ensures the accuracy of the meter and
 
00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:48.300 align:start position:0%
that really is what uh is sought to be
 
00:52:50.530 --> 00:52:50.540 align:start position:0%
answered by this legislation
 
00:52:54.250 --> 00:52:54.260 align:start position:0%
and so as the legislation contemplates
 
00:52:58.010 --> 00:52:58.020 align:start position:0%
the customers who own the meter uh the
 
00:53:00.049 --> 00:53:00.059 align:start position:0%
generator excuse me who owns the meter
 
00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:03.260 align:start position:0%
would be responsible for for reading it
 
00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
and then submitting that information to
 
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
eversource the utility on a monthly
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
basis in a manner that is agreed to by
 
00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:14.300 align:start position:0%
the department of energy
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
so obviously looking at the on-site
 
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
generation what is excluded from
 
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
uh from net metering because it it might
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
be either a technology that doesn't
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
qualify or the size of the facility that
 
00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
doesn't qualify uh and then the utility
 
00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
uh takes that information as described
 
00:53:36.109 --> 00:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
in the bill and Via a manual process
 
00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:39.059 align:start position:0%
would apply those uh net metering
 
00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
credits to to the accounts and I would
 
00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:42.980 align:start position:0%
just note that
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
all group net metering all Municipal net
 
00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
metering is a manual process for the
 
00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
utility it's all done via spreadsheet by
 
00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
individuals on a monthly basis this
 
00:53:57.890 --> 00:53:57.900 align:start position:0%
would be no different and just uh answer
 
00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
what I imagine is a question that I will
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
get asked about the costs associated of
 
00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
of administering that
 
00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:08.220 align:start position:0%
I don't have that information because
 
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
obviously it depends on the methodology
 
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
and the process that gets approved by
 
00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:14.700 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission by the
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
department of energy however we
 
00:54:20.089 --> 00:54:20.099 align:start position:0%
certainly do not believe that it will be
 
00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
a significant cost driver again you're
 
00:54:25.130 --> 00:54:25.140 align:start position:0%
talking about an individual
 
00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:27.180 align:start position:0%
taking a spreadsheet applying it through
 
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
our Billing System in a manual process
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
that's not big dollars but it was
 
00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:35.540 align:start position:0%
important to us to have that
 
00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:38.220 align:start position:0%
language included in the legislation
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
because this is a unique circumstance
 
00:54:40.319 --> 00:54:41.930 align:start position:0%
because this is a unique circumstance
and

00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
10 years from now 20 years from now uh
 
00:54:47.770 --> 00:54:47.780 align:start position:0%
you know having that legislative
 
00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
record is is important for future future
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
rate cases and future cost recovery so
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
with that I'd be happy to answer any
 
00:54:57.359 --> 00:54:58.510 align:start position:0%

00:54:58.510 --> 00:54:58.520 align:start position:0%

I'm going to call on representative
 
00:55:05.819 --> 00:55:07.130 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call on representative
Harrington

00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:07.140 align:start position:0%
Harrington
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:10.020 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:10.609 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

00:55:10.609 --> 00:55:10.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:12.540 align:start position:0%
I think I got this correct you're going
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to somehow collect all your
 
00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
costs associated with this and as
 
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
written you would then distribute those
 
00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:20.700 align:start position:0%
costs over all the rate payers for
 
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
eversource and couldn't it just as
 
00:55:25.549 --> 00:55:25.559 align:start position:0%
easily be sent to the people benefiting
 
00:55:27.890 --> 00:55:27.900 align:start position:0%
from this uh new law rather than have
 
00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:31.140 align:start position:0%
well have me pay iron electric bill
 
00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:33.230 align:start position:0%
well have me pay iron electric bill
um

00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
so you are correct
 
00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:37.380 align:start position:0%
um the company's interpretation as
 
00:55:39.049 --> 00:55:39.059 align:start position:0%
written is that it would be collected
 
00:55:42.829 --> 00:55:42.839 align:start position:0%
from all distribution uh customers so I
 
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
know the question came up about whether
 
00:55:47.450 --> 00:55:47.460 align:start position:0%
it was a default service or or all
 
00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
customers this would is written um all
 
00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
distribution customers
 
00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:52.609 align:start position:0%
distribution customers
um

00:55:52.609 --> 00:55:52.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:56.089 --> 00:55:56.099 align:start position:0%
you know I it could certainly be written
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
um I think you would need to amend the
 
00:55:59.870 --> 00:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
language though and and make it very
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
specific to the the billing process
 
00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
um right now that includes all net
 
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
metering credits so you know if if the
 
00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
customers were paying for the net
 
00:56:12.349 --> 00:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
metering credits that they received it
 
00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
just sort of cyclical right it doesn't
 
00:56:18.049 --> 00:56:18.059 align:start position:0%
do what it's intended to do
 
00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
um but you know I can't speak to the
 
00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:22.980 align:start position:0%
company uh the two companies
 
00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:26.220 align:start position:0%
um other interest or ability to uh
 
00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
absorb those manual billing costs again
 
00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:40.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:42.410 --> 00:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
see any other questions thank you Mr

00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
just to give the committee an update we
 
00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
are now officially one half hour behind
 
00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:51.549 align:start position:0%
are now officially one half hour behind
schedule

00:58:51.549 --> 00:58:51.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:53.809 --> 00:58:53.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'll do my best to
 
00:58:56.690 --> 00:58:56.700 align:start position:0%
make this very fast then uh fairly
 
00:58:58.490 --> 00:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
simple issue you know if it walks like a
 
00:58:59.809 --> 00:58:59.819 align:start position:0%
duck and quacks like a duck it's
 
00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
probably a duck so if it acts like a tax
 
00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
it probably is a tax what this bill
 
00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:06.180 align:start position:0%
simply says is that if you want to
 
00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:08.460 align:start position:0%
adjust the system benefits charge you
 
00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
need it was established by Statute if
 
00:59:12.589 --> 00:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
you want to make it higher or lower then
 
00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
you change the statute you don't
 
00:59:16.069 --> 00:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
delegate that authority to anybody else
 
00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:17.700 align:start position:0%
it has to go back through the general
 
00:59:21.289 --> 00:59:21.299 align:start position:0%
court or it is allowed for authorization
 
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
by the fiscal Committee of the general
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
court as well as the is the court itself
 
00:59:29.569 --> 00:59:29.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for introducing
 
00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
introducing House Bill 381 questions
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
McWilliams has a question uh thank you
 
00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:41.460 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
Harrington for presenting this bill I do
 
00:59:45.049 --> 00:59:45.059 align:start position:0%
have a question about what it looks like
 
00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:46.980 align:start position:0%
for the fiscal committee to approve it
 
00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
can you just walk me through what that
 
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
process would be
 
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
I I would thank you for the question but
 
00:59:55.549 --> 00:59:55.559 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to try to quote the exact
 
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
process because I don't have it
 
00:59:58.370 --> 00:59:58.380 align:start position:0%
memorized but there is a process that
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
the fiscal Commit This is not new to
 
01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
this bill it's it's a process that's
 
01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
used uh
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
quite often for different things
 
01:00:08.569 --> 01:00:08.579 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
01:00:08.579 --> 01:00:10.789 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
so

01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
so having gone through this with the
 
01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
State Building Code every three years
 
01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
when we update the State Building Code
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
it requires the the updated Bill to go
 
01:00:24.289 --> 01:00:24.299 align:start position:0%
through Edna right a house committee
 
01:00:26.569 --> 01:00:26.579 align:start position:0%
then to get approved by the house and
 
01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:28.980 align:start position:0%
the Senate and then sign into law by the
 
01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:31.140 align:start position:0%
governor and we've had problems in the
 
01:00:33.049 --> 01:00:33.059 align:start position:0%
past with the state building code where
 
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
we were approximately nine years behind
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
the rest of the country because we
 
01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't come to a consensus on updating
 
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
the state building code for construction
 
01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:43.140 align:start position:0%
and so it just lagged and lagged and
 
01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:45.660 align:start position:0%
lagged do you see something like that
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
becoming an impediment with this bill
 
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
because we can't get our act together as
 
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
a legislature
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
not at all because first of all it's the
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
function it's the purpose of the
 
01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
legislation we get elected in one of our
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
most important duties that we have is to
 
01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:01.799 align:start position:0%
decide who's going to get taxed and how
 
01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
much so the system benefit charge is a
 
01:01:06.289 --> 01:01:06.299 align:start position:0%
fancy name for a tax we're taking money
 
01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:07.799 align:start position:0%
away from people they have no choice
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
they want to have electricity they have
 
01:01:11.089 --> 01:01:11.099 align:start position:0%
to pay it so I just think the
 
01:01:12.829 --> 01:01:12.839 align:start position:0%
legislature should look at it and if we
 
01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:15.660 align:start position:0%
decide that it needs to be increased or
 
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
decreased or just stay the same that's
 
01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
fine there's no impediment there's no
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
codes involved this is strictly at the
 
01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
discretion of the legislature and I
 
01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:25.859 align:start position:0%
don't see that as being an issue
 
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
thank you additional questions from the
 
01:01:28.319 --> 01:01:31.849 align:start position:0%
thank you additional questions from the
committee

01:01:31.849 --> 01:01:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:33.789 --> 01:01:33.799 align:start position:0%
seeing none I told you would be quick
 
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
I'll thank representative Harrington for
 
01:01:39.049 --> 01:01:39.059 align:start position:0%
introducing the Senate Bill uh House
 
01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:43.380 align:start position:0%
Bill 381 and I'll next call on and I'll
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
remind representative Harrington that he
 
01:01:47.809 --> 01:01:47.819 align:start position:0%

01:01:47.819 --> 01:01:49.370 align:start position:0%

and

01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:49.380 align:start position:0%

01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
and then I'll call to the testimony
 
01:01:53.809 --> 01:01:53.819 align:start position:0%
table the representative from the
 
01:02:05.690 --> 01:02:05.700 align:start position:0%

as introduced
 
01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
um for context this bill amends State
 
01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
Statute that was created by House Bill
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
549 last year that statute codified the
 
01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
rate at which the system benefits charge
 
01:02:31.150 --> 01:02:31.160 align:start position:0%
is set and is increased in the future
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
the bill was passed by the legislature
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
in response to puc decisions to alter
 
01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
the funding levels for
 
01:02:41.690 --> 01:02:41.700 align:start position:0%
um from the SBC to the state's Energy
 
01:02:43.849 --> 01:02:43.859 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs that are managed by
 
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
the utilities here in the state
 
01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:49.799 align:start position:0%
under uh House Bill 549 from last year
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
the legislature clearly established what
 
01:02:54.289 --> 01:02:54.299 align:start position:0%
the system benefits charge level should
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
be per that bill the portion of the
 
01:02:59.630 --> 01:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
system benefits charge shall be adjusted
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
annually using the most recently
 
01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
available three-year average of the
 
01:03:06.289 --> 01:03:06.299 align:start position:0%
Consumer Price Index plus a quarter of a
 
01:03:06.299 --> 01:03:07.609 align:start position:0%
Consumer Price Index plus a quarter of a
percent

01:03:07.609 --> 01:03:07.619 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
um the bill would remove this language
 
01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
that allows for an uh this kind of
 
01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
escalator in the system benefits charge
 
01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
and require any increase to the system
 
01:03:17.930 --> 01:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
benefits chart should be done through
 
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
legislative approval either through
 
01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
legislation as uh as this committee
 
01:03:25.609 --> 01:03:25.619 align:start position:0%
regularly does or through the uh joint
 
01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
legislative fiscal committee
 
01:03:30.109 --> 01:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
we do want to inform the committee that
 
01:03:33.289 --> 01:03:33.299 align:start position:0%
should the bill forward uh wrapping on
 
01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative McWilliams question
 
01:03:36.890 --> 01:03:36.900 align:start position:0%
further Clarity around the joint
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
legislative fiscal committee approval
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
path would be welcomed as a committee
 
01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:43.140 align:start position:0%
knows state agencies and departments
 
01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
bring forward items to the Joint
 
01:03:47.049 --> 01:03:47.059 align:start position:0%
legislative fiscal committee for review
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
should an increase be made is the fiscal
 
01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
committee coming from a state agency or
 
01:03:54.349 --> 01:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
a state department
 
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
um if it does fall to say doe or the puc
 
01:03:58.630 --> 01:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
how would we know when to bring an item
 
01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
is there some other route that the
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
legislature would like the fiscal item
 
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
to appear before the fiscal committee
 
01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
these are just some of the questions
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
that the department would respectfully
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to consider
 
01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
should it move forward with this bill
 
01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:13.980 align:start position:0%
um and that really concludes my
 
01:04:15.289 --> 01:04:15.299 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'm happy to take any
 
01:04:15.299 --> 01:04:16.789 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'm happy to take any
questions

01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for your and the Department's
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
perspective on this issue representative
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
Corman has a question
 
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
Roberts for taking my question uh so
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
as as I'm seeing this it's possible that
 
01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
we can have a scenario where the
 
01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
legislature fails to update the system
 
01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
benefits charge as the Consumer Price
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
Index goes up and up and up uh would
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
that mean that that effectively then the
 
01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
value of the SBC going into Energy
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
Efficiency is is it being lowered then
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
in effect thank you for the question so
 
01:04:55.849 --> 01:04:55.859 align:start position:0%
based on our read of the bill it does
 
01:04:58.069 --> 01:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
not lower the system benefits charge in
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
any way shape or form it keeps it static
 
01:05:03.049 --> 01:05:03.059 align:start position:0%
as to where it currently is it prevents
 
01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
any further the bill prevents any
 
01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
further increase to the system benefits
 
01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:07.910 align:start position:0%
further increase to the system benefits
charge

01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
charge
 
01:05:10.609 --> 01:05:10.619 align:start position:0%
um absent legislative approval
 
01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:12.839 align:start position:0%
um so again under current statute is
 
01:05:16.130 --> 01:05:16.140 align:start position:0%
that the SBC is allowed to increase
 
01:05:18.170 --> 01:05:18.180 align:start position:0%
um based on the available three-year
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
average of the CPI plus a quarter of a
 
01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
percent under this bill again that
 
01:05:25.549 --> 01:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
language would be removed funding level
 
01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:27.059 align:start position:0%
remains where it is it will not change
 
01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
unless legislative approval is made
 
01:05:32.089 --> 01:05:32.099 align:start position:0%
follow up right but my concern is is
 
01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
more about
 
01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
um if the SBC stays the same but prices
 
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
continue to increase does that lower the
 
01:05:41.569 --> 01:05:41.579 align:start position:0%
effective value of the SBC what the
 
01:05:43.370 --> 01:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
amount of energy efficiency that we can
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
buy okay I'm sorry is decreasing yep I
 
01:05:48.109 --> 01:05:48.119 align:start position:0%
apologize I understand your question now
 
01:05:49.730 --> 01:05:49.740 align:start position:0%
um that is a potential obviously in
 
01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:51.900 align:start position:0%
inflation increases cost for goods
 
01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
Supply services and that type of thing
 
01:05:55.849 --> 01:05:55.859 align:start position:0%
um that is obviously a policy
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
consideration for uh this committee to
 
01:06:02.450 --> 01:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
consider uh but again House Bill 549
 
01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
um was a clear demonstration by the
 
01:06:05.809 --> 01:06:05.819 align:start position:0%
legislature last year that they wanted a
 
01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:07.140 align:start position:0%
role in setting the system benefits
 
01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
charge so Falls to policy makers to make
 
01:06:11.690 --> 01:06:11.700 align:start position:0%
that decision thank you for the question
 
01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter has a question
 
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
I did but I just found it on my phone
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:22.010 --> 01:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question thank
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:24.890 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
question

01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:24.900 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
um forgive me if I'm uh forgetting
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
something from our orientation sessions
 
01:06:28.559 --> 01:06:29.569 align:start position:0%
something from our orientation sessions
but

01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:29.579 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:06:32.809 --> 01:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
um the um this this bill is only talking
 
01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:35.700 align:start position:0%
about the Energy Efficiency component of
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
the SBC that's correct how how what what
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
percentage of the total SBC does that
 
01:06:45.890 --> 01:06:45.900 align:start position:0%
represent if I could I could I'd love to
 
01:06:47.809 --> 01:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
follow up with you on that I don't have
 
01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:49.980 align:start position:0%
that data available here but I'm sure it
 
01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
varies across uh utility to utility but
 
01:06:54.049 --> 01:06:54.059 align:start position:0%
that can check on that thank you thank
 
01:06:54.059 --> 01:06:56.630 align:start position:0%
that can check on that thank you thank
you

01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman very just a very
 
01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
quick clarification question is that
 
01:07:04.849 --> 01:07:04.859 align:start position:0%
you're understanding that in the New
 
01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:07.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution it states that
 
01:07:09.049 --> 01:07:09.059 align:start position:0%
the State House Representatives controls
 
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
the purse of the State of New Hampshire
 
01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
but I I am thank you for the question I
 
01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
am not a constitutional expert so I I
 
01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
guess I would defer to your
 
01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
um judgment on that thank you
 
01:07:23.329 --> 01:07:23.339 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
01:07:25.549 --> 01:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
01:07:25.559 --> 01:07:26.690 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
um

01:07:26.690 --> 01:07:26.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
if we capped this
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
the charge at 2020 levels
 
01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
see how that would directly impact
 
01:07:35.809 --> 01:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency in New Hampshire sure
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question so
 
01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:38.990 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question so
um

01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:40.970 --> 01:07:40.980 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to move forward and
 
01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
funding levels remain the same they
 
01:07:45.289 --> 01:07:45.299 align:start position:0%
would remain static they would not go up
 
01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
or down absent legislative approval
 
01:07:50.930 --> 01:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
um circling back to what representative
 
01:07:53.049 --> 01:07:53.059 align:start position:0%
Corman may be asked is that obviously
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
the current language allows uh inflation
 
01:07:59.690 --> 01:07:59.700 align:start position:0%
to be a factor in readjusting the system
 
01:08:02.089 --> 01:08:02.099 align:start position:0%
benefits charge rate with that language
 
01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
removed again there's no consideration
 
01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
of other factors like that it would
 
01:08:07.849 --> 01:08:07.859 align:start position:0%
again be a it would be a legislative
 
01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
call for policy makers to make
 
01:08:14.029 --> 01:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:08:15.839 --> 01:08:16.789 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:19.249 --> 01:08:19.259 align:start position:0%
Mr Roberts the the system benefits
 
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
charge is a
 
01:08:25.729 --> 01:08:25.739 align:start position:0%
policy instrument that was invented
 
01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:28.980 align:start position:0%
decades ago uh and adopted here in New
 
01:08:30.829 --> 01:08:30.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it's used
 
01:08:32.450 --> 01:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
by many other states throughout the
 
01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:33.650 align:start position:0%
by many other states throughout the
country

01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:08:36.769 --> 01:08:36.779 align:start position:0%
uh representing an investment a
 
01:08:38.450 --> 01:08:38.460 align:start position:0%
Strategic investment in Energy
 
01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
Efficiency as part of the utility
 
01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:44.460 align:start position:0%
system representative I'm sure there is
 
01:08:46.610 --> 01:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
a question Roberts knows what the system
 
01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
benefits charge is yes the point I'm
 
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
trying to please ask assistant benefits
 
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
charge has been because it's part of the
 
01:08:55.729 --> 01:08:55.739 align:start position:0%
utility Administration system it like
 
01:08:59.269 --> 01:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
utility rates has been the province of
 
01:09:02.329 --> 01:09:02.339 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities commissions which have
 
01:09:05.329 --> 01:09:05.339 align:start position:0%
staff which conduct all kinds of
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
economic analyzes of costs and benefits
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
and carefully adjust rates and the
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
system benefits charge
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this bill if adopted be
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
requiring the fiscal Committee of the
 
01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:21.829 align:start position:0%
requiring the fiscal Committee of the
house

01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:09:21.839 --> 01:09:23.510 align:start position:0%
house
uh

01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
of the House of Representatives of New
 
01:09:29.410 --> 01:09:29.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to suddenly acquire all of the
 
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
intricate knowledge and economic
 
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
analysis ability to properly
 
01:09:38.530 --> 01:09:38.540 align:start position:0%
evaluate cost benefit
 
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
adjust the system benefits charge or not
 
01:09:42.349 --> 01:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
I mean wouldn't that be a pretty huge
 
01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:44.940 align:start position:0%
burden to add to the already complicated
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
work of the house finance committee sure
 
01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the question I am not
 
01:09:51.530 --> 01:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
going to uh
 
01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
legislators can study look at take on
 
01:09:57.410 --> 01:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
whatever they wish to look at obviously
 
01:09:59.390 --> 01:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature decided last year when
 
01:10:01.850 --> 01:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
it passed uh House Bill 549 that wanted
 
01:10:04.189 --> 01:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
the more active role in the in where the
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
system benefits charge levels should be
 
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
um obviously with that
 
01:10:10.729 --> 01:10:10.739 align:start position:0%
um you know they put in an escalator uh
 
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
under current language whether or not
 
01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:14.219 align:start position:0%
the legislature wants to take on more of
 
01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
a role in determining maybe cost benefit
 
01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:18.900 align:start position:0%
and that type of thing again obviously a
 
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
policy call for folks to make
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
 
01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:27.110 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
committee

01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:10:29.149 --> 01:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has another one
 
01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
just a very quick question Mr chairman
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
um as with the system benefits charge
 
01:10:35.810 --> 01:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
though as we know inflation rates can
 
01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
vary and as they go up would this indeed
 
01:10:42.649 --> 01:10:42.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:45.169 --> 01:10:45.179 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question just to
 
01:10:47.209 --> 01:10:47.219 align:start position:0%
follow up I guess you're asking as
 
01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:49.140 align:start position:0%
inflation goes up in the current statute
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
allows for the consideration of
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
inflation when the system benefits
 
01:10:53.149 --> 01:10:53.159 align:start position:0%
charge also increase I think that's what
 
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
just that is true yes
 
01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:58.970 --> 01:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question thank
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
01:11:02.450 --> 01:11:02.460 align:start position:0%
um just to follow up to a question that
 
01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:04.380 align:start position:0%
I had asked earlier so if I understand
 
01:11:06.890 --> 01:11:06.900 align:start position:0%
correctly the way this this the way this
 
01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
bill is worded if it passes the
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
legislature would
 
01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
um decide on what the Energy Efficiency
 
01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
portion of the SBC should be
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
that would then be fed to either the puc
 
01:11:27.169 --> 01:11:27.179 align:start position:0%
the doe or the puc I assume to be worked
 
01:11:29.330 --> 01:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
into the calculation of what the system
 
01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
benefits charge is I I thank you for the
 
01:11:34.010 --> 01:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
question so I believe that would likely
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
be the case
 
01:11:37.250 --> 01:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
um obviously there is a mechanism in
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
current statute whereby the system
 
01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
benefits charge can increase considering
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
certain factors and then how those
 
01:11:45.709 --> 01:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
calculations are determined by the
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
department of energy when it comes to
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
saying the SBC this bill would remove
 
01:11:52.130 --> 01:11:52.140 align:start position:0%
that and put the responsibility largely
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
entirely in the hands of the legislature
 
01:11:55.610 --> 01:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
to determine what that rate is
 
01:11:58.910 --> 01:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up but my my but my
 
01:12:00.770 --> 01:12:00.780 align:start position:0%
point is or my question is
 
01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
it isn't really the res this doesn't
 
01:12:05.209 --> 01:12:05.219 align:start position:0%
change the responsibility for setting
 
01:12:08.209 --> 01:12:08.219 align:start position:0%
the entire SBC
 
01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
to the legislature the the the the
 
01:12:12.649 --> 01:12:12.659 align:start position:0%
department would still have
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility for setting the SBC the
 
01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
legislature only has responsibility for
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
setting a portion of the SPC oh God I'm
 
01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you for the question so I'd
 
01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
have to take a look through the further
 
01:12:25.370 --> 01:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
five for uh House Bill 549 statute I've
 
01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
only got what uh the part of the statute
 
01:12:29.689 --> 01:12:29.699 align:start position:0%
that's here in House Bill 381 but
 
01:12:33.290 --> 01:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
obviously as you see on lines
 
01:12:36.729 --> 01:12:36.739 align:start position:0%
12 to 13 you see that
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
the Energy Efficiency portion of the
 
01:12:40.850 --> 01:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
system benefits charge is adjusted based
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
on various factors as calculated by the
 
01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
department of energy so that language is
 
01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
being removed
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
um and it just it to just replace it
 
01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
with that the rate will be established
 
01:12:53.770 --> 01:12:53.780 align:start position:0%
by the New Hampshire general court
 
01:12:56.209 --> 01:12:56.219 align:start position:0%
so in that aspect I guess the department
 
01:12:58.610 --> 01:12:58.620 align:start position:0%
of energy is being removed from trying
 
01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
to help calculate that but again the
 
01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
legislature at least in this bill is
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
indicating that would like to take on a
 
01:13:05.450 --> 01:13:05.460 align:start position:0%
more active role in determining what
 
01:13:07.610 --> 01:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
that rate should be but if it helps at
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
all I'd like to take a deeper dive in
 
01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
the 549 Bill and then follow up with you
 
01:13:13.850 --> 01:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
by email if that's okay
 
01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
representative Randalls you have another
 
01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no further questions
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
for the Department we appreciate thank
 
01:13:30.169 --> 01:13:30.179 align:start position:0%
you for being here Mr robersh and now I
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
will call on our consumer Advocate Mr
 
01:13:38.209 --> 01:13:38.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman good morning
 
01:13:42.410 --> 01:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
everybody I'm Donald crease the consumer
 
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
Advocate thank you for this opportunity
 
01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
to testify today about House Bill 381 I
 
01:13:49.729 --> 01:13:49.739 align:start position:0%
respectfully request that you report
 
01:13:51.950 --> 01:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
this bill to the floor of the house as
 
01:13:55.070 --> 01:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate I have four
 
01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
reasons for making that recommendation
 
01:13:58.490 --> 01:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the state's residential
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
ratepayers and I will try to lay each of
 
01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
them out in elevators speech format
 
01:14:07.130 --> 01:14:07.140 align:start position:0%
uh although I understand that reasonable
 
01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
people might differ about weather and to
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
what extent we should pursue rate
 
01:14:14.810 --> 01:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
payer-funded Energy Efficiency the state
 
01:14:16.490 --> 01:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
reached what I thought was a pretty good
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
consensus on this issue a year ago via
 
01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:21.900 align:start position:0%
House Bill 549 we should give the
 
01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
provision of that bill all of the
 
01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
provisions of that bill time to have
 
01:14:28.370 --> 01:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
their effect particularly via the
 
01:14:30.770 --> 01:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
required filing of a new triennial
 
01:14:33.410 --> 01:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency plan this coming
 
01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:34.370 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency plan this coming
summer

01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
summer
 
01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
Point number two the Energy Efficiency
 
01:14:38.830 --> 01:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
portion of the system benefits charge
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
and the related ldac charge on natural
 
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
gas bills are properly regarded as a
 
01:14:47.630 --> 01:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
regulated rate charged by utilities for
 
01:14:51.290 --> 01:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
a particular service Energy Efficiency I
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree with the notion
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
that the system benefits charge is a tax
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
and here is why the SBC is not collected
 
01:15:01.850 --> 01:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
by the government the money is never in
 
01:15:04.010 --> 01:15:04.020 align:start position:0%
the hands of the government and not one
 
01:15:06.169 --> 01:15:06.179 align:start position:0%
cent of the money is spent by the
 
01:15:06.179 --> 01:15:07.010 align:start position:0%
cent of the money is spent by the
government

01:15:07.010 --> 01:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:15:10.490 --> 01:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
it is I think bad public policy for
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
legislatures to set utility rates that's
 
01:15:15.950 --> 01:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
why every state in the country has apuc
 
01:15:18.770 --> 01:15:18.780 align:start position:0%
or something like it I'm not suggesting
 
01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
that legislatures particularly this one
 
01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
lack the skill or the insight to set
 
01:15:26.050 --> 01:15:26.060 align:start position:0%
rates to the contrary there are enough
 
01:15:28.970 --> 01:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
phds lawyers and former puc
 
01:15:31.310 --> 01:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
Commissioners on this committee so that
 
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
if you were the puc you'd put any puc in
 
01:15:35.930 --> 01:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
the country to shame but legislators
 
01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
lack the time to do full bone rate
 
01:15:42.290 --> 01:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
investigations and when the puc does it
 
01:15:44.930 --> 01:15:44.940 align:start position:0%
the decisions have to be based on a full
 
01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
and fairly developed evidentiary record
 
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
based on sworn testimony those are
 
01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
requirements that are conducive to the
 
01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
kind of fairness and rigor that I know
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
you all like to see when it comes to
 
01:15:59.630 --> 01:15:59.640 align:start position:0%
setting utility rates
 
01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:02.460 align:start position:0%
uh this uh Point number three responds
 
01:16:03.770 --> 01:16:03.780 align:start position:0%
to some of the concerns I've heard
 
01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
already I worry that house bill 381
 
01:16:09.970 --> 01:16:09.980 align:start position:0%
might 381 might actually be
 
01:16:13.010 --> 01:16:13.020 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional if the intent here is
 
01:16:16.010 --> 01:16:16.020 align:start position:0%
to have the puc approve any increases in
 
01:16:18.830 --> 01:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
the SBC and then subject them to
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
approval by the general court or the
 
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee uh I I think that that
 
01:16:27.890 --> 01:16:27.900 align:start position:0%
would amount to a one house veto of a
 
01:16:30.890 --> 01:16:30.900 align:start position:0%
puc decision or even a one committee
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
veto of a puc decision way back in 1983
 
01:16:39.169 --> 01:16:39.179 align:start position:0%
in a case entitled ins versus Chata the
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
U.S Supreme Court decided as a matter of
 
01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
federal constitutional law that one
 
01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
house vetoes are unconstitutional the
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
reason is that they violate the
 
01:16:52.729 --> 01:16:52.739 align:start position:0%
presentment and bicameralism clauses of
 
01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
the U.S Constitution
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
the latter says that Congress can only
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
act via bills adopted by each chamber
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
the house and the Senate the former says
 
01:17:06.169 --> 01:17:06.179 align:start position:0%
that all bills in order to become law
 
01:17:09.169 --> 01:17:09.179 align:start position:0%
must be presented to the president for
 
01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:11.940 align:start position:0%
his signature and veto I have no doubt
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
that the exact same problems would arise
 
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
with a one-house veto under the New
 
01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution as interpreted by
 
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
01:17:24.050 --> 01:17:24.060 align:start position:0%
finally and this is the most important
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
thing I have to say at a time when
 
01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
electricity prices are soaring the very
 
01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
last thing we want to do is clip the
 
01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
wings of our rate payer funded NH saves
 
01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency programs to repeat
 
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
what I have said In This Very Room just
 
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
a few days ago negawatts with an N are
 
01:17:45.770 --> 01:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
cheaper than megawatts with an M I
 
01:17:47.570 --> 01:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
respect those who are philosophically
 
01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
opposed to putting thumbs on the scale
 
01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
of the market economy and energy to
 
01:17:53.930 --> 01:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
support Energy Efficiency but to my
 
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
friends of that persuasion I say
 
01:17:58.430 --> 01:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
respectfully please do not let the
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
perfect become the enemy of the good
 
01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
that concludes my prepared testimony of
 
01:18:05.689 --> 01:18:05.699 align:start position:0%
course if it's the chair's pleasure I'd
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:11.630 --> 01:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Grace we appreciate your
 
01:18:13.610 --> 01:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
being here and speaking to us about this
 
01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
bill today I have a question about your
 
01:18:18.410 --> 01:18:18.420 align:start position:0%
point of constitutionality
 
01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
because the fiscal committee is a joint
 
01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee that has both members
 
01:18:25.850 --> 01:18:25.860 align:start position:0%
of the house and the Senate on it
 
01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
would that address the question of one
 
01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
house vetoes
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh I would respectfully suggest it would
 
01:18:37.010 --> 01:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
not uh simply because neither house in
 
01:18:39.169 --> 01:18:39.179 align:start position:0%
that scenario meaning neither the Senate
 
01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
nor the house would actually vote on the
 
01:18:47.570 --> 01:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
proposal and then pass it along to the
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
governor for his signature or veto
 
01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for your legal opinion on that
 
01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:55.250 align:start position:0%
thank you for your legal opinion on that
question

01:18:55.250 --> 01:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:19:00.410 --> 01:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:02.570 --> 01:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
seeing none I thank you for being here
 
01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me off easy and
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
I'll call to the um call to the front of
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
the room Mr Michael Licata from
 
01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:16.310 align:start position:0%
the room Mr Michael Licata from
eversource

01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:18.770 --> 01:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
uh good morning again Michael Licata
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
representing eversource energy uh coming
 
01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
before you this time in opposition to HB
 
01:19:24.239 --> 01:19:26.450 align:start position:0%
before you this time in opposition to HB
381.

01:19:26.450 --> 01:19:26.460 align:start position:0%
381.
 
01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:27.709 align:start position:0%
381.
um I

01:19:27.709 --> 01:19:27.719 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
won't belabor a number of the points
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
that have already been made but
 
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
our opposition stems from the fact that
 
01:19:39.649 --> 01:19:39.659 align:start position:0%
this legislation if enacted would really
 
01:19:43.610 --> 01:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
fundamentally change the uh legislation
 
01:19:46.970 --> 01:19:46.980 align:start position:0%
that was passed just last year HB 549
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
which sought to provide consistency to
 
01:19:53.689 --> 01:19:53.699 align:start position:0%
the utilities and the regulators and our
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
customers on the funding sources for
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency programs which the
 
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
utilities administer on behalf of the
 
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.250 align:start position:0%
utilities administer on behalf of the
state

01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:04.790 align:start position:0%
state
um

01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
before uh you know
 
01:20:11.149 --> 01:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
this section of law that is uh struck
 
01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
out in the bill
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
has not been implemented uh yet uh as uh
 
01:20:19.790 --> 01:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
the consumer Advocate to increase had
 
01:20:22.010 --> 01:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh we have not yet developed
 
01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
the next triennial three-year plan that
 
01:20:27.890 --> 01:20:27.900 align:start position:0%
would be based upon this level of
 
01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
funding so this would really sort of
 
01:20:33.709 --> 01:20:33.719 align:start position:0%
put a hard right turn in that process
 
01:20:37.790 --> 01:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
that was developed under 549 last year
 
01:20:39.890 --> 01:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
and I would just you know point out that
 
01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
that legislation was passed unanimously
 
01:20:45.290 --> 01:20:45.300 align:start position:0%
by both the House and Senate and signed
 
01:20:47.570 --> 01:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
by the governor uh in an expedited
 
01:20:50.390 --> 01:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
fashion uh with the intent of providing
 
01:20:52.130 --> 01:20:52.140 align:start position:0%
that level of consistency and
 
01:20:54.530 --> 01:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
preservation of the programs
 
01:20:56.930 --> 01:20:56.940 align:start position:0%
um if this bill were were to move
 
01:20:59.330 --> 01:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
forward I would Echo the comments of the
 
01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
Department of energy that
 
01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:01.970 align:start position:0%
Department of energy that
um

01:21:01.970 --> 01:21:01.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
additional Clarity uh would be necessary
 
01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
or welcome uh online 16 through 19
 
01:21:12.649 --> 01:21:12.659 align:start position:0%
related to exactly how that submission
 
01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
and approval by either the general court
 
01:21:18.669 --> 01:21:18.679 align:start position:0%
or the fiscal committee would that be
 
01:21:21.890 --> 01:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
plans provided by the utilities as is
 
01:21:23.630 --> 01:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
the case to the Public Utilities
 
01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
Commission would that process precede
 
01:21:30.050 --> 01:21:30.060 align:start position:0%
the submission of approval to the fiscal
 
01:21:32.689 --> 01:21:32.699 align:start position:0%
committee would the Public Utilities
 
01:21:34.850 --> 01:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
Commission be the The Entity submitting
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
that approved plan would it be the
 
01:21:37.729 --> 01:21:37.739 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
as you can see there are a lot of
 
01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
questions uh of uh sort of just process
 
01:21:44.330 --> 01:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
nature around that
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
um so with that I will uh be happy to
 
01:21:50.090 --> 01:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that I can
 
01:21:52.130 --> 01:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate your perspective on
 
01:21:57.290 --> 01:21:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
01:22:02.090 --> 01:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I guess I'd kind
 
01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
of like to resurrect the question that I
 
01:22:05.689 --> 01:22:05.699 align:start position:0%
was going to ask earlier and just direct
 
01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
it to you Mr locata it refers to back to
 
01:22:11.090 --> 01:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
representative Summers question of a
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
previous Witness
 
01:22:16.490 --> 01:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
since we've had testimony from you and
 
01:22:18.169 --> 01:22:18.179 align:start position:0%
from your colleagues at the other
 
01:22:21.410 --> 01:22:21.420 align:start position:0%
utilities that um
 
01:22:24.169 --> 01:22:24.179 align:start position:0%
every dollar spent through the system
 
01:22:25.610 --> 01:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
benefits charge through the New
 
01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves program
 
01:22:29.810 --> 01:22:29.820 align:start position:0%
yields a savings to rate payers of over
 
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
four dollars
 
01:22:34.490 --> 01:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
if that system benefits charge continues
 
01:22:37.250 --> 01:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
to increase as is contemplated by
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
current legislation wouldn't the
 
01:22:42.530 --> 01:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
benefits to rate payers also increase
 
01:22:45.410 --> 01:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for the the question
 
01:22:48.050 --> 01:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
um uh so I think the
 
01:22:51.890 --> 01:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
the short answer is yes but uh and the
 
01:22:54.590 --> 01:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
the butt is simply that
 
01:22:57.950 --> 01:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
um all of the programs uh quite frankly
 
01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
whether this is passed or whether the
 
01:23:02.630 --> 01:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
current construct moves forward are
 
01:23:05.810 --> 01:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
subject to uh astringent and rigorous
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
cost benefit analysis to achieve the
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
savings as you describe representative
 
01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:11.630 align:start position:0%
savings as you describe representative
so

01:23:11.630 --> 01:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
um so even though the the cost of the
 
01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
program go up
 
01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
um they still need to meet that that
 
01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
cost benefit analysis which was
 
01:23:23.330 --> 01:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
enshrined in uh State Statute with HP
 
01:23:29.149 --> 01:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:23:33.470 --> 01:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions from the
 
01:23:34.729 --> 01:23:34.739 align:start position:0%
committee I want to thank you for being
 
01:23:37.370 --> 01:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
here and we'll call our final
 
01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:38.030 align:start position:0%
here and we'll call our final
um

01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
individual who would like to speak on
 
01:23:43.189 --> 01:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
this bill and that is Nick Krakow from
 
01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:44.780 align:start position:0%
the conservation
 
01:23:49.250 --> 01:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
conservation law Foundation Nick
 
01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:51.110 align:start position:0%
conservation law Foundation Nick
welcome

01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
01:23:52.669 --> 01:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you chairman and
 
01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
01:23:55.850 --> 01:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
um yeah as he said my name is Nick
 
01:23:57.229 --> 01:23:57.239 align:start position:0%
Krakow I'm with the conservation law
 
01:23:59.750 --> 01:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
Foundation here in Concord
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
um I urge you to oppose HB 381
 
01:24:05.570 --> 01:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
um and I really question why we're here
 
01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
today discussing this bill you know as
 
01:24:10.370 --> 01:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
others have already testified last year
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire House and Senate
 
01:24:15.530 --> 01:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly passed HB 549
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
and HP 549 reflected a bipartisan
 
01:24:20.450 --> 01:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
compromise the Energy Efficiency
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
programs benefit New Hampshire's economy
 
01:24:25.970 --> 01:24:25.980 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency programs are a
 
01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
cost-effective way to reduce families
 
01:24:30.890 --> 01:24:30.900 align:start position:0%
and businesses energy expenditures and
 
01:24:32.450 --> 01:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire saves should have a
 
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
stable funding level going forward
 
01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
HP 381 now seeks to undo this careful
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
bipartisan compromise reflected in HB
 
01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:42.709 align:start position:0%
bipartisan compromise reflected in HB
549

01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
549
 
01:24:44.990 --> 01:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
by eliminating any adjustments to the
 
01:24:47.209 --> 01:24:47.219 align:start position:0%
system benefits charge based on the
 
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
Consumer Price Index increases
 
01:24:52.130 --> 01:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
HP 381 would result in reductions in the
 
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
funding for New Hampshire State's
 
01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:54.310 align:start position:0%
funding for New Hampshire State's
programs

01:24:54.310 --> 01:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:24:56.930 --> 01:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
because of the high current level of
 
01:24:56.940 --> 01:24:58.130 align:start position:0%
because of the high current level of
inflation

01:24:58.130 --> 01:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
01:24:59.689 --> 01:24:59.699 align:start position:0%
these are deductions would likely be
 
01:25:01.970 --> 01:25:01.980 align:start position:0%
substantial over time
 
01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
um and this in turn would likely to
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
translate to less funding for
 
01:25:08.630 --> 01:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
cost-effective and popular Energy
 
01:25:10.370 --> 01:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs
 
01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:11.750 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs
and

01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
probably loss of Energy Efficiency jobs
 
01:25:17.330 --> 01:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
HP 549 reflects
 
01:25:20.570 --> 01:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
a rare bipartisan win for New Hampshire
 
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
um and I urge the committee to vote
 
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
against this bill and vote itl and I'm
 
01:25:25.729 --> 01:25:25.739 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions this time
 
01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920 align:start position:0%

testimony
 
01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
and I have no additional pink cards for
 
01:25:41.630 --> 01:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
this bill is there anyone in the
 
01:25:43.370 --> 01:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
audience who would like to speak who has
 
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
not spoken apparently there is one
 
01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:47.030 align:start position:0%
not spoken apparently there is one
person

01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:53.930 --> 01:25:53.940 align:start position:0%
please hand your pink card to miss
 
01:26:01.610 --> 01:26:01.620 align:start position:0%

01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
and so I'm about to introduce
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
Mr Ken Grant who is a citizen of
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
Barrington New Hampshire welcome Mr Kim
 
01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
Grant thank you I'll make this quick uh
 
01:26:20.209 --> 01:26:20.219 align:start position:0%
not experience the public speaking I
 
01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
I've received bills from uh eversource
 
01:26:26.510 --> 01:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
for my property which is 1100 square
 
01:26:28.729 --> 01:26:28.739 align:start position:0%
foot property would I keep the
 
01:26:32.930 --> 01:26:32.940 align:start position:0%
thermostat at 70 degrees uh yet in the
 
01:26:35.570 --> 01:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
bill that I've received I have become
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
suspect of emitting greenhouse gases and
 
01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:42.770 align:start position:0%
suspect of emitting greenhouse gases and
I

01:26:42.770 --> 01:26:42.780 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:26:46.490 --> 01:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
I'm then not having any solar or any any
 
01:26:49.610 --> 01:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
energy alternatives to receive this
 
01:26:52.970 --> 01:26:52.980 align:start position:0%
transfer payment of this uh Energy
 
01:26:56.209 --> 01:26:56.219 align:start position:0%
Credit the system benefit charge but in
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
in my opinion it's more than a tax it's
 
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
a payment a transfer charge and yet uh
 
01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
people there are houses that are two
 
01:27:09.530 --> 01:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
three times the size of my house that
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
might be receiving this benefit charge
 
01:27:15.410 --> 01:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
but they've got things like to a couple
 
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
air conditioners there there are three
 
01:27:19.129 --> 01:27:19.139 align:start position:0%
or four thousand square foot houses they
 
01:27:22.970 --> 01:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
may even have more than one uh oil or
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
fuel heating source and I just don't I
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh see why that
 
01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
I'm being charged uh uh this type of tax
 
01:27:36.649 --> 01:27:36.659 align:start position:0%
for this payment transfer to subsidize
 
01:27:39.410 --> 01:27:39.420 align:start position:0%
somebody somebody else and
 
01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:40.070 align:start position:0%
somebody somebody else and
um

01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:42.649 --> 01:27:42.659 align:start position:0%
there must be a cost there must be some
 
01:27:44.990 --> 01:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
type of administration cost to this that
 
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
I'm also paying for and that uh I I
 
01:27:51.709 --> 01:27:51.719 align:start position:0%
oppose the system benefit charge if
 
01:27:54.169 --> 01:27:54.179 align:start position:0%
people want all this stuff uh they
 
01:27:56.810 --> 01:27:56.820 align:start position:0%
should be willing to pay for it but
 
01:27:59.030 --> 01:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
than coming taxing me for it I don't
 
01:28:01.850 --> 01:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
agree with I I support the build up
 
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:03.120 align:start position:0%

so I'm here this time to introduce House
 
01:37:06.649 --> 01:37:06.659 align:start position:0%
Bill 385
 
01:37:09.169 --> 01:37:09.179 align:start position:0%
which is a bill that the Public
 
01:37:14.209 --> 01:37:14.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:16.910 --> 01:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
when the Public Utilities Commission
 
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
was separated into a smaller puc and a
 
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
big department of energy
 
01:37:26.410 --> 01:37:26.420 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of administrative
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
strings to untangle
 
01:37:34.490 --> 01:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:38.570 --> 01:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
and one of the strings that needed to be
 
01:37:38.580 --> 01:37:40.090 align:start position:0%
and one of the strings that needed to be
Unwound

01:37:40.090 --> 01:37:40.100 align:start position:0%
Unwound
 
01:37:44.209 --> 01:37:44.219 align:start position:0%
involved giving Authority from that was
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
previously with the puc to the doe and
 
01:37:48.770 --> 01:37:48.780 align:start position:0%
vice versa
 
01:37:48.780 --> 01:37:50.209 align:start position:0%
vice versa
foreign

01:37:50.209 --> 01:37:50.219 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:37:56.510 --> 01:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
arose from the realization by the puc
 
01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:59.770 align:start position:0%
arose from the realization by the puc
that

01:37:59.770 --> 01:37:59.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:03.590 --> 01:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
complaints that might arise from newly
 
01:38:05.810 --> 01:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
passed legislation on computer Community
 
01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:07.910 align:start position:0%
passed legislation on computer Community
aggregation

01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
aggregation
 
01:38:10.490 --> 01:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
should probably better be resolved by
 
01:38:12.410 --> 01:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
the department rather than the
 
01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:14.270 align:start position:0%
the department rather than the
commission

01:38:14.270 --> 01:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:38:16.370 --> 01:38:16.380 align:start position:0%
unless there was a disagreement between
 
01:38:18.590 --> 01:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
the complainant and the department in
 
01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
which case the commission
 
01:38:24.110 --> 01:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
would become the Arbiter the adjudicator
 
01:38:26.209 --> 01:38:26.219 align:start position:0%
of a final decision
 
01:38:30.050 --> 01:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
so this bill was submitted to transfer
 
01:38:34.370 --> 01:38:34.380 align:start position:0%
that Authority from the commission
 
01:38:37.970 --> 01:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
which previously had jurisdiction over
 
01:38:42.050 --> 01:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
RSA 53e Community power aggregation
 
01:38:43.790 --> 01:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
to the Department of energy for
 
01:38:47.209 --> 01:38:47.219 align:start position:0%
complaint investigation
 
01:38:49.850 --> 01:38:49.860 align:start position:0%
that is the uh
 
01:38:51.950 --> 01:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
basically the
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the bill that's all the
 
01:38:56.689 --> 01:38:56.699 align:start position:0%
language that the bill does
 
01:38:56.699 --> 01:38:58.910 align:start position:0%
language that the bill does
and

01:38:58.910 --> 01:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:01.010 --> 01:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
there are people behind me who I'm sure
 
01:39:04.189 --> 01:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
will testify to give you more detail on
 
01:39:06.229 --> 01:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
why this was necessary
 
01:39:09.050 --> 01:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
whether or not it will cost
 
01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
or has costs that the department of
 
01:39:13.669 --> 01:39:13.679 align:start position:0%
energy would have to assume
 
01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
and whether they can afford to assume
 
01:39:16.729 --> 01:39:16.739 align:start position:0%
that without
 
01:39:16.739 --> 01:39:17.990 align:start position:0%
that without
um

01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:21.169 --> 01:39:21.179 align:start position:0%
an appropriation being added to the bill
 
01:39:24.110 --> 01:39:24.120 align:start position:0%
all of that will be revealed in
 
01:39:26.510 --> 01:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
subsequent testimony to mine so I'm
 
01:39:29.390 --> 01:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
going to end it there and open
 
01:39:32.090 --> 01:39:32.100 align:start position:0%
the Florida questions and the people who
 
01:39:34.189 --> 01:39:34.199 align:start position:0%
want to testify behind me thank you
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Rose for the
 
01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:38.639 align:start position:0%
explanation I'll call on representative
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
Summers for a question
 
01:39:42.590 --> 01:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
01:39:45.169 --> 01:39:45.179 align:start position:0%
chairman quick question for you
 
01:39:48.590 --> 01:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
um would the would current
 
01:39:51.410 --> 01:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
um stated statutes with a puc still be
 
01:39:57.890 --> 01:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:00.649 --> 01:40:00.659 align:start position:0%
if we pass this would that yes I'm sorry
 
01:40:01.790 --> 01:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
01:40:04.010 --> 01:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
no I think that the the complaints would
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
go to the Department of energy they
 
01:40:07.370 --> 01:40:07.380 align:start position:0%
would try to resolve the complaint
 
01:40:10.790 --> 01:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
according to the language of the bill
 
01:40:13.550 --> 01:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
if they could not satisfy the
 
01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:15.649 align:start position:0%
if they could not satisfy the
complainant

01:40:15.649 --> 01:40:15.659 align:start position:0%
complainant
 
01:40:19.310 --> 01:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
adequately the complaint had objected to
 
01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:20.209 align:start position:0%
adequately the complaint had objected to
whatever

01:40:20.209 --> 01:40:20.219 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
solution that the department came up
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
with then they could appeal that
 
01:40:27.290 --> 01:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
decision to the commission
 
01:40:31.250 --> 01:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:33.709 --> 01:40:33.719 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas
 
01:40:36.649 --> 01:40:36.659 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:40:38.810 --> 01:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what the problem is that
 
01:40:41.330 --> 01:40:41.340 align:start position:0%
this bill is trying to fix so can you
 
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
answer I had the puc objected to having
 
01:40:46.250 --> 01:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
to resolve complaints
 
01:40:49.370 --> 01:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
the p2c is a much smaller organization
 
01:40:51.890 --> 01:40:51.900 align:start position:0%
now than it used to used to be it only
 
01:40:53.390 --> 01:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
has as you will call from the
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
presentation we heard last Friday it
 
01:40:56.570 --> 01:40:56.580 align:start position:0%
only has 16
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
employee full-time employees and maybe a
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
couple of part-time employees
 
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
so they have far less staff to deal with
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
issues such as this than they used to
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
the department of energy on the other
 
01:41:13.129 --> 01:41:13.139 align:start position:0%
hand has like 75 or 80 employees they
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
have a compliance division which is
 
01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
charged with dealing with complaints and
 
01:41:21.590 --> 01:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
other compliance issues so the
 
01:41:23.930 --> 01:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
commission felt that this responsibility
 
01:41:26.750 --> 01:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
more properly lay with the Department of
 
01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:28.910 align:start position:0%
more properly lay with the Department of
energy

01:41:28.910 --> 01:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:41:32.689 --> 01:41:32.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:34.850 --> 01:41:34.860 align:start position:0%
uh thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:41:37.070 --> 01:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
question would it be correct am I
 
01:41:39.350 --> 01:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
correct in stating that the consumer
 
01:41:42.169 --> 01:41:42.179 align:start position:0%
group that used to work for the puc has
 
01:41:44.090 --> 01:41:44.100 align:start position:0%
the Personnel the responsibilities that
 
01:41:47.090 --> 01:41:47.100 align:start position:0%
has moved over the department of energy
 
01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
I believe that is correct you could
 
01:41:50.750 --> 01:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
verify that with the spokesman for the
 
01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:55.850 --> 01:41:55.860 align:start position:0%
representative munz
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:42:00.129 --> 01:42:00.139 align:start position:0%
um I I'm I'm
 
01:42:03.649 --> 01:42:03.659 align:start position:0%
struggling with the um the the the the
 
01:42:06.109 --> 01:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
the flow here
 
01:42:09.770 --> 01:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
um the you know if if somebody has you
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
know the way I read this is the
 
01:42:13.490 --> 01:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
commission sets the rules
 
01:42:16.250 --> 01:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
or makes the initial ruling then if the
 
01:42:19.010 --> 01:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
if the if the individual has an issue
 
01:42:20.689 --> 01:42:20.699 align:start position:0%
they go to the DOE
 
01:42:23.629 --> 01:42:23.639 align:start position:0%
uh the doe decides but if that if the
 
01:42:25.609 --> 01:42:25.619 align:start position:0%
person involved in that decision still
 
01:42:27.109 --> 01:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
has an issue it goes back to the
 
01:42:29.330 --> 01:42:29.340 align:start position:0%
commission so the same people
 
01:42:31.609 --> 01:42:31.619 align:start position:0%
that are setting the rules get the
 
01:42:34.490 --> 01:42:34.500 align:start position:0%
ultimate decision on what the resolution
 
01:42:36.290 --> 01:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:42:40.010 --> 01:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't the why wouldn't the
 
01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:41.990 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't the why wouldn't the
initial

01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
initial
 
01:42:44.629 --> 01:42:44.639 align:start position:0%
um complaint be handled by the puc with
 
01:42:46.609 --> 01:42:46.619 align:start position:0%
the doe being kind of the final
 
01:42:49.070 --> 01:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
arbitrator to kind of negotiate a
 
01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:50.750 align:start position:0%
arbitrator to kind of negotiate a
settlement

01:42:50.750 --> 01:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
01:42:52.609 --> 01:42:52.619 align:start position:0%
good question thank you representative
 
01:42:56.330 --> 01:42:56.340 align:start position:0%
for it the issue here is investigating
 
01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
the complaint
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
the POC doesn't have the resources to
 
01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
investigate the complaint whereas the
 
01:43:05.450 --> 01:43:05.460 align:start position:0%
due and its compliance division
 
01:43:08.570 --> 01:43:08.580 align:start position:0%
hopefully does they may require some
 
01:43:10.010 --> 01:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
additional resources we'll hear about
 
01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:11.090 align:start position:0%
additional resources we'll hear about
that

01:43:11.090 --> 01:43:11.100 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:43:13.790 --> 01:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
in subsequent testimony but
 
01:43:16.910 --> 01:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
presumably because they have a much
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
larger staff they're in a better place
 
01:43:23.090 --> 01:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
to do complaint investigation then the
 
01:43:24.770 --> 01:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
commission is itself the commission
 
01:43:27.290 --> 01:43:27.300 align:start position:0%
itself can
 
01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
make you know adjudicate issues of
 
01:43:31.199 --> 01:43:32.209 align:start position:0%
make you know adjudicate issues of
dispute

01:43:32.209 --> 01:43:32.219 align:start position:0%
dispute
 
01:43:34.729 --> 01:43:34.739 align:start position:0%
once the facts are known once the
 
01:43:37.129 --> 01:43:37.139 align:start position:0%
investigation is complete but they don't
 
01:43:37.139 --> 01:43:38.450 align:start position:0%
investigation is complete but they don't
have

01:43:38.450 --> 01:43:38.460 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:43:39.950 --> 01:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
or at least they're telling us through
 
01:43:41.750 --> 01:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
this legislation that they don't have
 
01:43:43.310 --> 01:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
the staff to do the investigation
 
01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:46.010 align:start position:0%
the staff to do the investigation
follow-up

01:43:46.010 --> 01:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh one follow-up okay uh
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
isn't the issue that wouldn't the issue
 
01:43:53.810 --> 01:43:53.820 align:start position:0%
therefore be
 
01:43:57.169 --> 01:43:57.179 align:start position:0%
the allocation of staff that perhaps
 
01:43:59.270 --> 01:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
some of the staff that was
 
01:44:02.090 --> 01:44:02.100 align:start position:0%
sent from the puc to the doe needs to go
 
01:44:04.010 --> 01:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
back to the puc
 
01:44:04.020 --> 01:44:05.629 align:start position:0%
back to the puc
foreign

01:44:05.629 --> 01:44:05.639 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
I can't comment on that if anybody from
 
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
the commission testifies at this uh
 
01:44:13.070 --> 01:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
public hearing you could ask them that
 
01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:14.270 align:start position:0%
public hearing you could ask them that
question

01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:44:16.669 --> 01:44:16.679 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh we're starting to
 
01:44:18.410 --> 01:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
have circular questions here so I think
 
01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
I'd like to move on thank you
 
01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
representative Rose for your testimony I
 
01:44:25.490 --> 01:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
like to call on Mr
 
01:44:27.709 --> 01:44:27.719 align:start position:0%
Griffin Roberge from the Department of
 
01:44:29.810 --> 01:44:29.820 align:start position:0%
energy who I'm sure has heard a lot of
 
01:44:38.750 --> 01:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:44.510 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:44.520 align:start position:0%

thank you uh chairman Thomas members of
 
01:44:48.890 --> 01:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
the committee Griffin Roberts again from
 
01:44:50.570 --> 01:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy
 
01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
um the department is neutral on this
 
01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:53.810 align:start position:0%
um the department is neutral on this
bill

01:44:53.810 --> 01:44:53.820 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:44:56.330 --> 01:44:56.340 align:start position:0%
um for context uh The Spill amends State
 
01:44:56.340 --> 01:44:58.070 align:start position:0%
um for context uh The Spill amends State
Statute

01:44:58.070 --> 01:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
Statute
 
01:45:00.290 --> 01:45:00.300 align:start position:0%
um uh regarding complaints arising from
 
01:45:02.570 --> 01:45:02.580 align:start position:0%
Community electric aggregation plans
 
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
under current statute the public utility
 
01:45:08.629 --> 01:45:08.639 align:start position:0%
vets and approves Community aggregation
 
01:45:12.109 --> 01:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
plans under administrative rule the puc
 
01:45:15.169 --> 01:45:15.179 align:start position:0%
currently vets complaints but none of
 
01:45:17.570 --> 01:45:17.580 align:start position:0%
these Community aggregation plans have
 
01:45:20.689 --> 01:45:20.699 align:start position:0%
really gone live as of yet so the puc
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
has not received any com active
 
01:45:24.970 --> 01:45:24.980 align:start position:0%
complaints right now
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
HB 385 outlines a process to sell
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
complaints arising from municipal or
 
01:45:33.530 --> 01:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
County aggregation committees the
 
01:45:35.209 --> 01:45:35.219 align:start position:0%
community power aggregator or the
 
01:45:36.910 --> 01:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
utility before the department of energy
 
01:45:39.590 --> 01:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
per the bills process a complaint is
 
01:45:40.970 --> 01:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
submitted to the department and is
 
01:45:43.850 --> 01:45:43.860 align:start position:0%
shared with all parties doe May issue an
 
01:45:46.669 --> 01:45:46.679 align:start position:0%
order requiring the complaint complaint
 
01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
to be addressed or the complaint be
 
01:45:51.729 --> 01:45:51.739 align:start position:0%
addressed by the complaint about party
 
01:45:54.169 --> 01:45:54.179 align:start position:0%
doe is allowed to investigate complaints
 
01:45:56.330 --> 01:45:56.340 align:start position:0%
and we may bring proceedings before the
 
01:45:58.310 --> 01:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
puc or if the complaintant is
 
01:46:00.770 --> 01:46:00.780 align:start position:0%
unsatisfied with our the Department's
 
01:46:03.290 --> 01:46:03.300 align:start position:0%
findings they may obviously appeal as
 
01:46:06.590 --> 01:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
has been mentioned to the puc do we
 
01:46:07.910 --> 01:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to note several observations
 
01:46:09.649 --> 01:46:09.659 align:start position:0%
should this bill move forward in its
 
01:46:12.109 --> 01:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
current form the department does not
 
01:46:14.629 --> 01:46:14.639 align:start position:0%
have an appropriate Revenue stream to
 
01:46:17.169 --> 01:46:17.179 align:start position:0%
build this new regulatory responsibility
 
01:46:19.870 --> 01:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
while the department normally uses
 
01:46:22.370 --> 01:46:22.380 align:start position:0%
utility assessments to pay for its work
 
01:46:24.590 --> 01:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
on dealing with electric distribution
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
companies there is no means currently in
 
01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
state statute for doe to place an
 
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
assessment on municipalities and
 
01:46:33.530 --> 01:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
Community aggregation plans
 
01:46:35.390 --> 01:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
additionally there is nothing in State
 
01:46:37.490 --> 01:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
Statute that gives doe the authority to
 
01:46:39.770 --> 01:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
compel these Community aggregations or
 
01:46:41.450 --> 01:46:41.460 align:start position:0%
utilities to undertake any specific
 
01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
action in the complaint do we obviously
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
under this language can issue findings
 
01:46:48.590 --> 01:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
and issue orders but it doesn't have any
 
01:46:50.750 --> 01:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
um enforcement mechanisms to compel
 
01:46:52.430 --> 01:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
parties to engage in any type of
 
01:46:55.149 --> 01:46:55.159 align:start position:0%
activity or remedy
 
01:46:57.649 --> 01:46:57.659 align:start position:0%
additionally goe cannot predict how
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
frequently complaints will occur or how
 
01:47:01.250 --> 01:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
many complaints the department will
 
01:47:03.370 --> 01:47:03.380 align:start position:0%
receive over any given period of time
 
01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
should these complaints be made
 
01:47:09.229 --> 01:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
frequently as I mentioned it's likely we
 
01:47:11.209 --> 01:47:11.219 align:start position:0%
will not have the Staffing Resources to
 
01:47:14.149 --> 01:47:14.159 align:start position:0%
vet these complaints we expect that the
 
01:47:16.189 --> 01:47:16.199 align:start position:0%
complaints will likely be very complex
 
01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
and time consuming
 
01:47:20.570 --> 01:47:20.580 align:start position:0%
um we are estimating that we will likely
 
01:47:24.169 --> 01:47:24.179 align:start position:0%
need back of the envelope figures likely
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
need two additional positions full-time
 
01:47:29.590 --> 01:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
attorney and a full-time utility analyst
 
01:47:33.649 --> 01:47:33.659 align:start position:0%
to process these complaints I know that
 
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh when we're the prime sponsor
 
01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
testified that
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
um there's some discussion about the
 
01:47:40.189 --> 01:47:40.199 align:start position:0%
allocation of resources between the puc
 
01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
and the doe it is true that a lot of the
 
01:47:44.330 --> 01:47:44.340 align:start position:0%
consumer division staff that was
 
01:47:46.250 --> 01:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
formerly at the puc have now been rolled
 
01:47:49.010 --> 01:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
over to the Department of energy if the
 
01:47:50.330 --> 01:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
thought was to have the consumer
 
01:47:51.590 --> 01:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
division within the department of energy
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
take these on again
 
01:47:54.530 --> 01:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
um they do not have the current
 
01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
resources to vet these complaints um
 
01:47:57.890 --> 01:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
there would likely need to be the
 
01:48:00.709 --> 01:48:00.719 align:start position:0%
additional positions funded and for
 
01:48:02.689 --> 01:48:02.699 align:start position:0%
additional context we've heard that the
 
01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
puc is a very slim regulatory body
 
01:48:08.750 --> 01:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
operating solely on for adjudication
 
01:48:11.090 --> 01:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
issues regardless of whether or not
 
01:48:14.030 --> 01:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
these complaints remain with the puc or
 
01:48:16.370 --> 01:48:16.380 align:start position:0%
are shifted over to the department a lot
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
of these concerns will remain whether or
 
01:48:20.990 --> 01:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
not the puc or doe have the resources to
 
01:48:22.790 --> 01:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
vet these complaints whether or not the
 
01:48:25.850 --> 01:48:25.860 align:start position:0%
puc or the doe have the um
 
01:48:28.189 --> 01:48:28.199 align:start position:0%
have the appropriate revenue streams to
 
01:48:30.590 --> 01:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
bill for this type of work so these are
 
01:48:32.570 --> 01:48:32.580 align:start position:0%
all things we want the committee to
 
01:48:34.910 --> 01:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
consider should they move forward with
 
01:48:35.810 --> 01:48:35.820 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:48:37.970 --> 01:48:37.980 align:start position:0%
um and with that I'm happy to answer any
 
01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:39.649 align:start position:0%
um and with that I'm happy to answer any
questions

01:48:39.649 --> 01:48:39.659 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Royers Rovers I'll have a
 
01:48:45.830 --> 01:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
I'll ask my question here to you based
 
01:48:47.629 --> 01:48:47.639 align:start position:0%
on what you just said
 
01:48:50.870 --> 01:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
for clarification it sounds like
 
01:48:55.870 --> 01:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
neither the doe nor the puc
 
01:49:00.649 --> 01:49:00.659 align:start position:0%
are ready or equipped to assume any
 
01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
complaints from the community
 
01:49:04.430 --> 01:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
aggregation program once it gets going
 
01:49:07.910 --> 01:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
is is that is that what you're saying so
 
01:49:09.950 --> 01:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so there is
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
currently a process under administrative
 
01:49:13.729 --> 01:49:13.739 align:start position:0%
role at the puc to vet complaints
 
01:49:16.129 --> 01:49:16.139 align:start position:0%
however I think a lot of the issues
 
01:49:17.930 --> 01:49:17.940 align:start position:0%
regarding Revenue stream and Staffing
 
01:49:20.090 --> 01:49:20.100 align:start position:0%
frequency of when these of how often
 
01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
these complaints may occur are things
 
01:49:25.729 --> 01:49:25.739 align:start position:0%
that things to consider off in the
 
01:49:26.990 --> 01:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
future once these complaints start
 
01:49:31.129 --> 01:49:31.139 align:start position:0%
arising they haven't Arisen yet so it is
 
01:49:32.750 --> 01:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
something for policy makers to consider
 
01:49:34.310 --> 01:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
obviously Community aggregation was a
 
01:49:38.169 --> 01:49:38.179 align:start position:0%
result of House Bill 315 two years ago
 
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
it was a substantial policy change there
 
01:49:42.169 --> 01:49:42.179 align:start position:0%
are obviously pieces that still need to
 
01:49:44.629 --> 01:49:44.639 align:start position:0%
be flushed down and picked up after that
 
01:49:47.450 --> 01:49:47.460 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Winnie Thomas
 
01:49:49.729 --> 01:49:49.739 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:49:51.709 --> 01:49:51.719 align:start position:0%
I understand you can't give us a number
 
01:49:54.169 --> 01:49:54.179 align:start position:0%
of anticipated complaints but surely you
 
01:49:55.970 --> 01:49:55.980 align:start position:0%
can give us a number of complaints that
 
01:49:57.770 --> 01:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
have already happened so do you have an
 
01:50:00.169 --> 01:50:00.179 align:start position:0%
estimate of how often these complaints
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
happen is it yearly is it monthly sure
 
01:50:05.450 --> 01:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question so
 
01:50:07.370 --> 01:50:07.380 align:start position:0%
um as I mentioned the puc approves
 
01:50:08.990 --> 01:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
Community aggregation plans to ensure
 
01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
that they're in conformance with State
 
01:50:12.229 --> 01:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
Statute and administrative rule but it's
 
01:50:14.390 --> 01:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that none of these
 
01:50:15.709 --> 01:50:15.719 align:start position:0%
Community aggregation plans have
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
actually taken off as of yet like none
 
01:50:19.790 --> 01:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
are live they've gotten approval but
 
01:50:21.109 --> 01:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
they still need to they still need to
 
01:50:23.629 --> 01:50:23.639 align:start position:0%
develop so in that instance I believe
 
01:50:25.070 --> 01:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
that there have been no active
 
01:50:27.290 --> 01:50:27.300 align:start position:0%
complaints made before the puc as of yet
 
01:50:28.729 --> 01:50:28.739 align:start position:0%
so I couldn't give any type of
 
01:50:30.770 --> 01:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
indication as to what might come up in
 
01:50:31.790 --> 01:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
the future but something for
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
policymakers to consider
 
01:50:35.810 --> 01:50:35.820 align:start position:0%
representative Summers
 
01:50:37.729 --> 01:50:37.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman quick question
 
01:50:40.189 --> 01:50:40.199 align:start position:0%
when we had puc testified in front of us
 
01:50:43.129 --> 01:50:43.139 align:start position:0%
last week and we brought up the the fact
 
01:50:45.410 --> 01:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
that they have a stated order that says
 
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
that the utilities can only go to the
 
01:50:48.830 --> 01:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
market once every six months to buy
 
01:50:50.510 --> 01:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
electricity and they said they were
 
01:50:52.669 --> 01:50:52.679 align:start position:0%
investigating it because of the size of
 
01:50:54.590 --> 01:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
their body right now who would be
 
01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
investigating it right now and if this
 
01:50:58.010 --> 01:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
bill was passed would that
 
01:51:00.410 --> 01:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
responsibility fall upon the DOE
 
01:51:02.689 --> 01:51:02.699 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so I wasn't
 
01:51:04.609 --> 01:51:04.619 align:start position:0%
here for the puc's presentation so I'll
 
01:51:06.290 --> 01:51:06.300 align:start position:0%
take your word about what they mentioned
 
01:51:08.270 --> 01:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
about uh utilities seeking default
 
01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:09.189 align:start position:0%
about uh utilities seeking default
service

01:51:09.189 --> 01:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:51:12.890 --> 01:51:12.900 align:start position:0%
if they I imagine I imagine they have
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
enough I believe they have a number of
 
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
Investigations pending right now those
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
investigations are largely done
 
01:51:20.930 --> 01:51:20.940 align:start position:0%
um by the three Commissioners by the by
 
01:51:22.850 --> 01:51:22.860 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission itself
 
01:51:25.550 --> 01:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
with assistance from their staff
 
01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:26.330 align:start position:0%
with assistance from their staff
um

01:51:26.330 --> 01:51:26.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:28.850 --> 01:51:28.860 align:start position:0%
whether or not those investigations
 
01:51:32.209 --> 01:51:32.219 align:start position:0%
might impact their ability to vet these
 
01:51:33.649 --> 01:51:33.659 align:start position:0%
complaints I don't know that's a that's
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
a work load issue that might be better
 
01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
directed at the puc
 
01:51:41.870 --> 01:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative partial
 
01:51:44.990 --> 01:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for being here today
 
01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:46.430 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for being here today
um

01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:49.970 --> 01:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
this seems like a preemptive solution to
 
01:51:51.709 --> 01:51:51.719 align:start position:0%
something that we really don't know if
 
01:51:53.330 --> 01:51:53.340 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a problem yet and I
 
01:51:55.310 --> 01:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
applaud the idea of trying to be
 
01:51:58.910 --> 01:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
preemptive and before problem occurs uh
 
01:52:00.890 --> 01:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
but at the same time could you say this
 
01:52:03.470 --> 01:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
is uh because we don't know the scope of
 
01:52:05.390 --> 01:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
the problem yet could you say this is a
 
01:52:08.410 --> 01:52:08.420 align:start position:0%
solution looking for a problem uh
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the thank you for the
 
01:52:12.169 --> 01:52:12.179 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
01:52:13.850 --> 01:52:13.860 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if I would necessarily
 
01:52:15.950 --> 01:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
say that I think I would I would say
 
01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:16.790 align:start position:0%
say that I think I would I would say
that

01:52:16.790 --> 01:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:18.649 --> 01:52:18.659 align:start position:0%
um I think I've turned it around a
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
little bit and say this is I guess maybe
 
01:52:23.870 --> 01:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
a hole in the regulatory process uh
 
01:52:25.790 --> 01:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
around these Community aggregation plans
 
01:52:27.770 --> 01:52:27.780 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily a hole that's
 
01:52:30.649 --> 01:52:30.659 align:start position:0%
presenting a problem yet but it might be
 
01:52:32.570 --> 01:52:32.580 align:start position:0%
something for policy makers to consider
 
01:52:34.910 --> 01:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
as these Community aggregation plans
 
01:52:36.290 --> 01:52:36.300 align:start position:0%
start getting up and off the ground and
 
01:52:39.050 --> 01:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
becoming live and active
 
01:52:41.149 --> 01:52:41.159 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter
 
01:52:43.310 --> 01:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair could Community power
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
vendors pay for complaint investigations
 
01:52:47.689 --> 01:52:47.699 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
01:52:47.699 --> 01:52:50.149 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
um

01:52:50.149 --> 01:52:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:53.629 --> 01:52:53.639 align:start position:0%
it's possible but under the I I guess I
 
01:52:55.609 --> 01:52:55.619 align:start position:0%
could say yeah it's possible but under
 
01:52:56.990 --> 01:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
the current language that's not
 
01:52:58.729 --> 01:52:58.739 align:start position:0%
something that's uh that's indicated
 
01:52:58.739 --> 01:53:00.350 align:start position:0%
something that's uh that's indicated
here

01:53:00.350 --> 01:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:53:02.030 --> 01:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
or it's not an option I guess in the
 
01:53:04.729 --> 01:53:04.739 align:start position:0%
current language I should say
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you Mr chair
 
01:53:09.530 --> 01:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
and thank you once again for taking my
 
01:53:09.540 --> 01:53:10.870 align:start position:0%
and thank you once again for taking my
question

01:53:10.870 --> 01:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:53:14.330 --> 01:53:14.340 align:start position:0%
can you describe what the nature of a
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
complaint might be I know this is
 
01:53:18.050 --> 01:53:18.060 align:start position:0%
speculative but I'm just wondering you
 
01:53:19.490 --> 01:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
know what what would these complaints be
 
01:53:21.229 --> 01:53:21.239 align:start position:0%
like sure uh thank you for the question
 
01:53:24.709 --> 01:53:24.719 align:start position:0%
I I couldn't give you too much of detail
 
01:53:26.570 --> 01:53:26.580 align:start position:0%
on that as of yet but under the current
 
01:53:29.450 --> 01:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
language this process only arises if a
 
01:53:31.970 --> 01:53:31.980 align:start position:0%
complaint comes from a municipal or
 
01:53:33.770 --> 01:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
County aggregator or an electric
 
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
distribution utility it is my
 
01:53:37.609 --> 01:53:37.619 align:start position:0%
understanding let's say if you're just a
 
01:53:39.169 --> 01:53:39.179 align:start position:0%
resident in a municipality with a
 
01:53:40.729 --> 01:53:40.739 align:start position:0%
community aggregation your complaint
 
01:53:42.169 --> 01:53:42.179 align:start position:0%
would not go through this plot process
 
01:53:43.609 --> 01:53:43.619 align:start position:0%
you would then you would first complain
 
01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
to the town it's kind of like a kind of
 
01:53:47.629 --> 01:53:47.639 align:start position:0%
like uh dealing with a water district or
 
01:53:49.310 --> 01:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
your water bill right you go to your
 
01:53:51.229 --> 01:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
local water district you don't appeal
 
01:53:52.729 --> 01:53:52.739 align:start position:0%
straight up to the puc or the Supreme
 
01:53:54.290 --> 01:53:54.300 align:start position:0%
Court about it
 
01:53:54.300 --> 01:53:54.970 align:start position:0%
Court about it
um

01:53:54.970 --> 01:53:54.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
regarding I guess the nature of the
 
01:53:58.490 --> 01:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
complaints as to what they might entail
 
01:54:00.290 --> 01:54:00.300 align:start position:0%
I don't know but
 
01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:00.830 align:start position:0%
I don't know but
um

01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:03.530 --> 01:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
I would submit that I you know elect uh
 
01:54:05.330 --> 01:54:05.340 align:start position:0%
Community aggregation plans are fairly
 
01:54:07.070 --> 01:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
complex they're not necessarily A
 
01:54:08.450 --> 01:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
straightforward thing
 
01:54:10.669 --> 01:54:10.679 align:start position:0%
um so I do imagine that it will take uh
 
01:54:13.129 --> 01:54:13.139 align:start position:0%
some staff time to vet these complaints
 
01:54:15.109 --> 01:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
into and to conduct a full investigation
 
01:54:17.870 --> 01:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
and everything like that
 
01:54:19.850 --> 01:54:19.860 align:start position:0%
thank you I censor questions are
 
01:54:21.709 --> 01:54:21.719 align:start position:0%
circling around the same subject matter
 
01:54:24.290 --> 01:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
uh I'd like to move on now thank you for
 
01:54:26.270 --> 01:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you I'm going to
 
01:54:27.530 --> 01:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
call on
 
01:54:30.290 --> 01:54:30.300 align:start position:0%
a subject matter expert on this which
 
01:54:33.410 --> 01:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
would be Mr Clifton below who has
 
01:54:34.970 --> 01:54:34.980 align:start position:0%
promised me he will solve all of your
 
01:54:34.980 --> 01:54:37.189 align:start position:0%
promised me he will solve all of your
questions

01:54:37.189 --> 01:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:54:39.229 --> 01:54:39.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:54:39.239 --> 01:54:40.850 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

01:54:40.850 --> 01:54:40.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:42.229 --> 01:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
um we don't I'm here on behalf of the
 
01:54:46.370 --> 01:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
community power Coalition in New
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a joint power agency comprised
 
01:54:53.689 --> 01:54:53.699 align:start position:0%
of 28 subdivisions of the state
 
01:54:56.810 --> 01:54:56.820 align:start position:0%
um 27 municipalities in one County that
 
01:54:58.310 --> 01:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
are looking to launch community power
 
01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
aggregation programs some as early as
 
01:55:03.470 --> 01:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
April of this year
 
01:55:05.570 --> 01:55:05.580 align:start position:0%
um we don't have a position of
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
particularly for or against this bill I
 
01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
certainly understand that the puc is got
 
01:55:15.169 --> 01:55:15.179 align:start position:0%
a limited Staffing
 
01:55:18.950 --> 01:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
um in general uh there is language and
 
01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
statute along these lines or or in rules
 
01:55:25.729 --> 01:55:25.739 align:start position:0%
uh that deal with how
 
01:55:25.739 --> 01:55:26.330 align:start position:0%
uh that deal with how
um

01:55:26.330 --> 01:55:26.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:29.450 --> 01:55:29.460 align:start position:0%
it used to be the puc but it was shifted
 
01:55:31.129 --> 01:55:31.139 align:start position:0%
in in the reorganization to the
 
01:55:33.310 --> 01:55:33.320 align:start position:0%
Department of energy how they deal with
 
01:55:35.810 --> 01:55:35.820 align:start position:0%
complaints and I don't think this is
 
01:55:38.090 --> 01:55:38.100 align:start position:0%
limited to complaints uh
 
01:55:42.410 --> 01:55:42.420 align:start position:0%
made by Community aggregations or the
 
01:55:45.649 --> 01:55:45.659 align:start position:0%
utility but it is limited if you look on
 
01:55:49.669 --> 01:55:49.679 align:start position:0%
line 17 it says complaints pertaining to
 
01:55:52.090 --> 01:55:52.100 align:start position:0%
actions undertaken omitted by any
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
municipal or County aggregator or
 
01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
electric distribution utility arising
 
01:55:58.970 --> 01:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
under this chapter shall be made to the
 
01:56:00.970 --> 01:56:00.980 align:start position:0%
department so that that goes on
 
01:56:04.910 --> 01:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
currently although this is not addressed
 
01:56:07.669 --> 01:56:07.679 align:start position:0%
per se in law the rules that the puc
 
01:56:10.189 --> 01:56:10.199 align:start position:0%
adopted do provide that the complaints
 
01:56:12.530 --> 01:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
would go to the puc and they would
 
01:56:15.290 --> 01:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
follow similar steps
 
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
um I do you know if the bill moves
 
01:56:20.090 --> 01:56:20.100 align:start position:0%
forward I do have a few suggestions that
 
01:56:22.129 --> 01:56:22.139 align:start position:0%
I think would address some concerns that
 
01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:56:25.609 --> 01:56:25.619 align:start position:0%
um and I'll just say
 
01:56:25.619 --> 01:56:27.669 align:start position:0%
um and I'll just say
um

01:56:27.669 --> 01:56:27.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:31.550 --> 01:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
we we do have some issues uh where we
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
feel that the utilities are not acting
 
01:56:35.330 --> 01:56:35.340 align:start position:0%
in compliance with the rules that have
 
01:56:37.129 --> 01:56:37.139 align:start position:0%
been adopted at this point we are
 
01:56:38.870 --> 01:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
working directly with the utilities to
 
01:56:40.790 --> 01:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
try to resolve those and to help help
 
01:56:43.310 --> 01:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
them come into compliance some of it's
 
01:56:45.410 --> 01:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
just because this is new and it takes a
 
01:56:47.390 --> 01:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
while to implement certain things and
 
01:56:49.370 --> 01:56:49.380 align:start position:0%
some things haven't been implemented yet
 
01:56:52.010 --> 01:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
that that the rules call for so you know
 
01:56:54.290 --> 01:56:54.300 align:start position:0%
we we don't want to make any formal
 
01:56:56.930 --> 01:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
complaints but um it's at some point we
 
01:56:59.750 --> 01:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
may need to uh because it you know we
 
01:57:01.430 --> 01:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
are letting the utilities know that at
 
01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
this point well with at least two of
 
01:57:05.629 --> 01:57:05.639 align:start position:0%
them uh that some of the delays and
 
01:57:08.930 --> 01:57:08.940 align:start position:0%
complaints with the rules are risking uh
 
01:57:11.689 --> 01:57:11.699 align:start position:0%
delay in our ability to launch
 
01:57:14.229 --> 01:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
um that being said I think my concern
 
01:57:17.870 --> 01:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
are that when complaints well there's
 
01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
two kinds of complaints I should say the
 
01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
consumer affairs division uh which was
 
01:57:23.930 --> 01:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
part of the puc and was moved over to
 
01:57:26.510 --> 01:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
doe traditionally handled just like a
 
01:57:29.570 --> 01:57:29.580 align:start position:0%
res residential rate payer that would
 
01:57:31.970 --> 01:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
have you know a complaint that their
 
01:57:33.530 --> 01:57:33.540 align:start position:0%
bill wasn't calculated right or
 
01:57:35.450 --> 01:57:35.460 align:start position:0%
something like that and those would not
 
01:57:37.910 --> 01:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
be publicly docketed the the consumer
 
01:57:39.950 --> 01:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
affairs would work with customer and the
 
01:57:41.750 --> 01:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
utility to try to resolve it and the
 
01:57:43.310 --> 01:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
vast majority of those would be resolved
 
01:57:45.709 --> 01:57:45.719 align:start position:0%
occasionally they'd get escalated to an
 
01:57:47.810 --> 01:57:47.820 align:start position:0%
adjudicated proceeding at the commission
 
01:57:49.609 --> 01:57:49.619 align:start position:0%
and the commission would have to decide
 
01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
the matter
 
01:57:55.550 --> 01:57:55.560 align:start position:0%
um but um traditionally uh if a business
 
01:57:58.070 --> 01:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
of something other than a residential
 
01:58:01.430 --> 01:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
rate payer made a complaint it would get
 
01:58:04.070 --> 01:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
docketed and so there'd be a public
 
01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
record of it and so this is one of my
 
01:58:10.370 --> 01:58:10.380 align:start position:0%
first concerns um just using an example
 
01:58:12.830 --> 01:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
might a private business that I'm a
 
01:58:14.450 --> 01:58:14.460 align:start position:0%
partner in one Court Street Associates
 
01:58:18.370 --> 01:58:18.380 align:start position:0%
filed a complaint in May of 2017
 
01:58:20.209 --> 01:58:20.219 align:start position:0%
regarding it was complaint against
 
01:58:22.910 --> 01:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
Liberty utility for them failing to
 
01:58:24.290 --> 01:58:24.300 align:start position:0%
maintain certain of their distribution
 
01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:26.149 align:start position:0%
maintain certain of their distribution
facilities

01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:58:28.490 --> 01:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
um they responded to the complaint we
 
01:58:31.729 --> 01:58:31.739 align:start position:0%
replied to that in June of 2017
 
01:58:32.870 --> 01:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
um asking for an independent
 
01:58:34.490 --> 01:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
investigation because we didn't think
 
01:58:36.890 --> 01:58:36.900 align:start position:0%
their response was satisfactory a
 
01:58:38.390 --> 01:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
technical session was scheduled in
 
01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
January of 2018
 
01:58:42.410 --> 01:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
and held
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
and then sort of nothing happened in the
 
01:58:46.970 --> 01:58:46.980 align:start position:0%
docket for a number of years
 
01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:48.109 align:start position:0%
docket for a number of years
um

01:58:48.109 --> 01:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:51.669 --> 01:58:51.679 align:start position:0%
and finally on uh
 
01:58:54.550 --> 01:58:54.560 align:start position:0%
just about a year ago in February of
 
01:58:59.270 --> 01:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
2022 the puc issued a order seeking a
 
01:59:01.729 --> 01:59:01.739 align:start position:0%
status report from the Department of
 
01:59:05.810 --> 01:59:05.820 align:start position:0%
energy uh since in on July 2021 they
 
01:59:07.430 --> 01:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
were made responsible for conducting
 
01:59:09.770 --> 01:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
these investigations uh into consumer
 
01:59:09.780 --> 01:59:11.510 align:start position:0%
these investigations uh into consumer
complaints

01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:12.649 align:start position:0%
complaints
um

01:59:12.649 --> 01:59:12.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:14.930 --> 01:59:14.940 align:start position:0%
and they asked the question you know
 
01:59:16.609 --> 01:59:16.619 align:start position:0%
what's the status of the investigation
 
01:59:19.370 --> 01:59:19.380 align:start position:0%
and should we close this docket and the
 
01:59:21.890 --> 01:59:21.900 align:start position:0%
department of energy replied
 
01:59:25.149 --> 01:59:25.159 align:start position:0%
um uh on the deadline of March 9 2022
 
01:59:27.350 --> 01:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
and said the department has not
 
01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
completed its investigation into this
 
01:59:31.310 --> 01:59:31.320 align:start position:0%
matter and has not yet concluded whether
 
01:59:31.320 --> 01:59:32.330 align:start position:0%
matter and has not yet concluded whether
filing

01:59:32.330 --> 01:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
filing
 
01:59:34.250 --> 01:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
or they're filing a motion to bring the
 
01:59:35.629 --> 01:59:35.639 align:start position:0%
complaint before the commission is
 
01:59:35.639 --> 01:59:36.950 align:start position:0%
complaint before the commission is
warranted

01:59:36.950 --> 01:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
warranted
 
01:59:38.629 --> 01:59:38.639 align:start position:0%
so nothing has happened since then
 
01:59:41.149 --> 01:59:41.159 align:start position:0%
there's no record of the complaint
 
01:59:43.250 --> 01:59:43.260 align:start position:0%
that's publicly visible on the
 
01:59:44.990 --> 01:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
department of energy website they they
 
01:59:47.089 --> 01:59:47.099 align:start position:0%
have not unlike the puc they don't
 
01:59:50.089 --> 01:59:50.099 align:start position:0%
docket complaints like this so one of my
 
01:59:51.589 --> 01:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
requests would be that for
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
non-residential rate payers that the com
 
01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
that the department of energy publicly
 
01:59:58.970 --> 01:59:58.980 align:start position:0%
docket the complaint and put the
 
02:00:01.790 --> 02:00:01.800 align:start position:0%
complaint in the utility response in a
 
02:00:04.310 --> 02:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
publicly available location through
 
02:00:06.530 --> 02:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
their website because there may be other
 
02:00:09.229 --> 02:00:09.239 align:start position:0%
entities that have a similar concern and
 
02:00:11.030 --> 02:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
this could certainly apply to either
 
02:00:12.470 --> 02:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
Community power aggregations or
 
02:00:15.290 --> 02:00:15.300 align:start position:0%
utilities where there's a a complaint I
 
02:00:16.669 --> 02:00:16.679 align:start position:0%
think residential is different because
 
02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
maybe residential people don't want that
 
02:00:21.770 --> 02:00:21.780 align:start position:0%
information public they'd rather just
 
02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
try to resolve the problem so that's one
 
02:00:24.239 --> 02:00:26.330 align:start position:0%
try to resolve the problem so that's one
suggestion

02:00:26.330 --> 02:00:26.340 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
02:00:29.770 --> 02:00:29.780 align:start position:0%
um two other suggestions are um
 
02:00:32.330 --> 02:00:32.340 align:start position:0%
uh allowing
 
02:00:34.430 --> 02:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
um complaints that are made before the
 
02:00:37.129 --> 02:00:37.139 align:start position:0%
effective date of the law uh to go ahead
 
02:00:38.689 --> 02:00:38.699 align:start position:0%
and proceed and follow the existing
 
02:00:40.970 --> 02:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
process so so my concern for instance
 
02:00:43.490 --> 02:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
with this other complaint is it was at
 
02:00:46.129 --> 02:00:46.139 align:start position:0%
the puc for a number of years
 
02:00:46.139 --> 02:00:46.790 align:start position:0%
the puc for a number of years
um

02:00:46.790 --> 02:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:50.270 --> 02:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
transferred to doe there's no
 
02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:50.990 align:start position:0%
transferred to doe there's no
um

02:00:50.990 --> 02:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:53.330 --> 02:00:53.340 align:start position:0%
you know it's not clear if we had to
 
02:00:55.010 --> 02:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
start all over again or not and that
 
02:00:56.390 --> 02:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
might be the case
 
02:00:59.149 --> 02:00:59.159 align:start position:0%
um so one thing to do another thing that
 
02:01:00.890 --> 02:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
could be done is it says effective 60
 
02:01:02.990 --> 02:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
days after passage it was it was made
 
02:01:06.290 --> 02:01:06.300 align:start position:0%
effective upon passage then you'd sooner
 
02:01:08.270 --> 02:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
know who this should be going to the
 
02:01:10.490 --> 02:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
Department of energy rather than the POC
 
02:01:12.830 --> 02:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
but if something gets filed
 
02:01:14.930 --> 02:01:14.940 align:start position:0%
um in the next month or two with the POC
 
02:01:16.970 --> 02:01:16.980 align:start position:0%
I would hope that it could just proceed
 
02:01:18.649 --> 02:01:18.659 align:start position:0%
through that process and that would be
 
02:01:20.030 --> 02:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
consistent with the idea of not making
 
02:01:22.070 --> 02:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
laws retroactive
 
02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:22.910 align:start position:0%
laws retroactive
um

02:01:22.910 --> 02:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:26.209 --> 02:01:26.219 align:start position:0%
and so my final suggestion would be uh
 
02:01:28.910 --> 02:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
that there might be a time limit on
 
02:01:31.729 --> 02:01:31.739 align:start position:0%
review by the department that
 
02:01:33.950 --> 02:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
um if if they haven't
 
02:01:36.709 --> 02:01:36.719 align:start position:0%
um come up with a uh
 
02:01:38.810 --> 02:01:38.820 align:start position:0%
a recommendation a resolution of the
 
02:01:41.330 --> 02:01:41.340 align:start position:0%
matter within 180 days you know six
 
02:01:44.689 --> 02:01:44.699 align:start position:0%
months that the complainant whether it's
 
02:01:46.430 --> 02:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
the utility against the committee
 
02:01:48.770 --> 02:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
congregation or vice versa or an
 
02:01:51.169 --> 02:01:51.179 align:start position:0%
individual that the complaintant should
 
02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
be able to after some period of time say
 
02:01:57.649 --> 02:01:57.659 align:start position:0%
six months uh if they want escalate it
 
02:02:00.109 --> 02:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
to to request an adjudicating proceeding
 
02:02:02.089 --> 02:02:02.099 align:start position:0%
at the commission so it just doesn't
 
02:02:04.370 --> 02:02:04.380 align:start position:0%
linger forever and there's just no
 
02:02:06.830 --> 02:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
deadline for anyone to take any action
 
02:02:09.410 --> 02:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
so those are my suggestions you know I
 
02:02:12.649 --> 02:02:12.659 align:start position:0%
think overall it's it's reasonable uh
 
02:02:14.450 --> 02:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
because the idea is the Department of
 
02:02:16.310 --> 02:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
energy has more of the staff to do this
 
02:02:19.729 --> 02:02:19.739 align:start position:0%
uh but but that's um you know those are
 
02:02:22.070 --> 02:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
my thoughts thank you thank you very
 
02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:24.470 align:start position:0%
my thoughts thank you thank you very
much

02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:27.649 --> 02:02:27.659 align:start position:0%
I see um representative partial as a
 
02:02:27.659 --> 02:02:28.729 align:start position:0%
I see um representative partial as a
question

02:02:28.729 --> 02:02:28.739 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:02:30.410 --> 02:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chair and thank you for
 
02:02:32.270 --> 02:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
your uh
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
Illuminating testimony is your testimony
 
02:02:37.129 --> 02:02:37.139 align:start position:0%
written no
 
02:02:38.450 --> 02:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
um it's just
 
02:02:41.570 --> 02:02:41.580 align:start position:0%
nope it was just spontaneous
 
02:02:43.729 --> 02:02:43.739 align:start position:0%
sure I could I would love to see you
 
02:02:45.709 --> 02:02:45.719 align:start position:0%
examine these recommendations to make a
 
02:02:47.570 --> 02:02:47.580 align:start position:0%
little bit closer though could we
 
02:02:50.270 --> 02:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
get to them I I was taking notes but I
 
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy we're not engaging in a in
 
02:02:55.129 --> 02:02:55.139 align:start position:0%
a discussion here the subject matter is
 
02:02:57.050 --> 02:02:57.060 align:start position:0%
whether or not the the merits of the
 
02:03:00.290 --> 02:03:00.300 align:start position:0%
bill is to be uh is to complaints to be
 
02:03:03.290 --> 02:03:03.300 align:start position:0%
transferred to the uh you know doe uh so
 
02:03:05.810 --> 02:03:05.820 align:start position:0%
they stand corrected representative
 
02:03:08.270 --> 02:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
months thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:03:10.250 --> 02:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
for coming in again do you have any
 
02:03:13.790 --> 02:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
concerns about a process where if you
 
02:03:15.770 --> 02:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
have a complaint
 
02:03:19.310 --> 02:03:19.320 align:start position:0%
that complaint gets handled by a third
 
02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:20.629 align:start position:0%
that complaint gets handled by a third
party

02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:20.639 align:start position:0%
party
 
02:03:23.390 --> 02:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
that third party makes a decision
 
02:03:26.689 --> 02:03:26.699 align:start position:0%
and then but then the appeal the only
 
02:03:28.550 --> 02:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
rights of appeal that you would have if
 
02:03:30.229 --> 02:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
you disagree with that is to go back to
 
02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
the original party that you originally
 
02:03:36.290 --> 02:03:36.300 align:start position:0%
had a pro a concern with
 
02:03:38.330 --> 02:03:38.340 align:start position:0%
and I guess I'm coming back to the
 
02:03:40.850 --> 02:03:40.860 align:start position:0%
question I had asked earlier about you
 
02:03:44.330 --> 02:03:44.340 align:start position:0%
know shouldn't the role of the doe be to
 
02:03:46.729 --> 02:03:46.739 align:start position:0%
be kind of a neutral arbitrator to kind
 
02:03:48.830 --> 02:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
of figure out you know what the right
 
02:03:50.990 --> 02:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
course of action is between the position
 
02:03:53.330 --> 02:03:53.340 align:start position:0%
that the complaintant takes and the
 
02:03:55.910 --> 02:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
composition that the puc has taken
 
02:03:58.250 --> 02:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
uh well it's not really about a position
 
02:04:00.770 --> 02:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
the puc has taken they have adopted
 
02:04:00.780 --> 02:04:02.810 align:start position:0%
the puc has taken they have adopted
rules

02:04:02.810 --> 02:04:02.820 align:start position:0%
rules
 
02:04:05.390 --> 02:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
um which is essentially an extension of
 
02:04:07.129 --> 02:04:07.139 align:start position:0%
the legislative function to flesh out
 
02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
the details of how the chapter should
 
02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:11.089 align:start position:0%
the details of how the chapter should
work

02:04:11.089 --> 02:04:11.099 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:04:11.099 --> 02:04:11.770 align:start position:0%
work
um

02:04:11.770 --> 02:04:11.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:14.450 --> 02:04:14.460 align:start position:0%
you know structurally it's the puc
 
02:04:16.609 --> 02:04:16.619 align:start position:0%
that's supposed to be the arbitrator of
 
02:04:19.490 --> 02:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
the the balances the interest of
 
02:04:22.250 --> 02:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
uh rate pairs Community power
 
02:04:25.070 --> 02:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
aggregations utilities
 
02:04:28.370 --> 02:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
um by various criteria uh
 
02:04:31.990 --> 02:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
so I I think
 
02:04:34.430 --> 02:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
sort of a generic concern is that we
 
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
don't sort of create two regulatory
 
02:04:38.330 --> 02:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
authorities that the doe becomes a
 
02:04:38.340 --> 02:04:39.589 align:start position:0%
authorities that the doe becomes a
regulator

02:04:39.589 --> 02:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
regulator
 
02:04:42.830 --> 02:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
in addition to the puc
 
02:04:45.890 --> 02:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
um but it does make sense that the staff
 
02:04:48.350 --> 02:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
that used to be part of the puc that
 
02:04:50.330 --> 02:04:50.340 align:start position:0%
would do the investigation and perhaps
 
02:04:52.669 --> 02:04:52.679 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation try to resolve the
 
02:04:56.330 --> 02:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
matter without litigation so to speak uh
 
02:04:58.310 --> 02:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
that those staff have been over moved
 
02:05:00.649 --> 02:05:00.659 align:start position:0%
over to the doe so I so I understand the
 
02:05:04.609 --> 02:05:04.619 align:start position:0%
logic of having doe staff try to uh you
 
02:05:06.709 --> 02:05:06.719 align:start position:0%
know investigate and you know seek a
 
02:05:06.719 --> 02:05:08.629 align:start position:0%
know investigate and you know seek a
resolution

02:05:08.629 --> 02:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
02:05:10.490 --> 02:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
um but if it's if they're going to have
 
02:05:13.070 --> 02:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
to make sort of judgments or start
 
02:05:15.790 --> 02:05:15.800 align:start position:0%
ordering uh somebody to do something
 
02:05:19.129 --> 02:05:19.139 align:start position:0%
that's the role of the puc they're the
 
02:05:21.350 --> 02:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
ones who have plenary authority over the
 
02:05:24.350 --> 02:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
utilities and can direct them to do
 
02:05:26.689 --> 02:05:26.699 align:start position:0%
something or not
 
02:05:26.699 --> 02:05:27.350 align:start position:0%
something or not
um

02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:31.490 --> 02:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
and yeah so that's a thought follow-up
 
02:05:34.729 --> 02:05:34.739 align:start position:0%
yeah one quick follow-up please
 
02:05:37.729 --> 02:05:37.739 align:start position:0%
uh if that being the case I mean just by
 
02:05:40.669 --> 02:05:40.679 align:start position:0%
the fact that we are inserting the doe
 
02:05:42.410 --> 02:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
into the process
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
we are kind of violating that principle
 
02:05:47.149 --> 02:05:47.159 align:start position:0%
that you've stated that this the puc's
 
02:05:47.159 --> 02:05:48.370 align:start position:0%
that you've stated that this the puc's
responsibility

02:05:48.370 --> 02:05:48.380 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
02:05:52.070 --> 02:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the better approach be to move
 
02:05:55.010 --> 02:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
the staff into the puc
 
02:05:57.470 --> 02:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
well they were just that's a legislative
 
02:05:59.689 --> 02:05:59.699 align:start position:0%
decision and and the decision was to
 
02:06:02.510 --> 02:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
move them to the doe in general all
 
02:06:05.149 --> 02:06:05.159 align:start position:0%
complaints that would regard going to
 
02:06:07.490 --> 02:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
utilities or competitive electric power
 
02:06:10.490 --> 02:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
suppliers now would go to the doe and
 
02:06:13.850 --> 02:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
they could be escalated to the puc
 
02:06:15.950 --> 02:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
um if the party's not satisfied with the
 
02:06:18.530 --> 02:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
resolution I was just suggesting that
 
02:06:20.750 --> 02:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
that that be an option after some period
 
02:06:22.970 --> 02:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
of time so it just doesn't linger
 
02:06:22.980 --> 02:06:24.169 align:start position:0%
of time so it just doesn't linger
forever

02:06:24.169 --> 02:06:24.179 align:start position:0%
forever
 
02:06:27.290 --> 02:06:27.300 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think we need to to uh ask
 
02:06:29.750 --> 02:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
questions involving the actual Merit of
 
02:06:32.629 --> 02:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
the Bill of going from the puc to the
 
02:06:34.850 --> 02:06:34.860 align:start position:0%
doe we've heard a lot of questions that
 
02:06:36.709 --> 02:06:36.719 align:start position:0%
are becoming very similar now about
 
02:06:40.129 --> 02:06:40.139 align:start position:0%
Staffing uh I will take one more
 
02:06:42.530 --> 02:06:42.540 align:start position:0%
question if it pertains to the mechanics
 
02:06:46.189 --> 02:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
or technical issue of this bill in terms
 
02:06:48.649 --> 02:06:48.659 align:start position:0%
of getting better Clarity on it
 
02:06:50.689 --> 02:06:50.699 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington
 
02:06:52.129 --> 02:06:52.139 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and thank you for taking my
 
02:06:54.290 --> 02:06:54.300 align:start position:0%
question in your experience at the
 
02:06:56.089 --> 02:06:56.099 align:start position:0%
commission what would you say the
 
02:06:59.390 --> 02:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
percentage of complaints that have to go
 
02:07:02.930 --> 02:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
up to commission review or as compared
 
02:07:04.490 --> 02:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
to most of them being done at the lower
 
02:07:04.500 --> 02:07:05.990 align:start position:0%
to most of them being done at the lower
level

02:07:05.990 --> 02:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:07:08.270 --> 02:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
um just a tiny fraction I I wouldn't
 
02:07:10.850 --> 02:07:10.860 align:start position:0%
know the number but during my 10 years
 
02:07:12.770 --> 02:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
of commissioner you probably can reflect
 
02:07:15.169 --> 02:07:15.179 align:start position:0%
on this too there was just a handful uh
 
02:07:17.330 --> 02:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
yeah two or three maybe I can recall a
 
02:07:19.609 --> 02:07:19.619 align:start position:0%
couple or three maybe
 
02:07:21.830 --> 02:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah and I would just say I can't
 
02:07:24.109 --> 02:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
imagine this would take a full even a
 
02:07:26.750 --> 02:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
single full-time position I I there
 
02:07:27.830 --> 02:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
might be
 
02:07:31.070 --> 02:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
a few occasional complaints certainly
 
02:07:33.350 --> 02:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities that are going to be very
 
02:07:35.089 --> 02:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
concerned about being responsive to
 
02:07:37.550 --> 02:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
their citizens so we're being very
 
02:07:39.350 --> 02:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
conscious about about making sure our
 
02:07:41.089 --> 02:07:41.099 align:start position:0%
aggregations are complying with the
 
02:07:43.430 --> 02:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
rules in the law and if if there's an
 
02:07:45.290 --> 02:07:45.300 align:start position:0%
issue I I would expect that we would
 
02:07:48.050 --> 02:07:48.060 align:start position:0%
resolve it rather quickly
 
02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you I think we've heard enough
 
02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
questions involving this bill here
 
02:07:54.169 --> 02:07:54.179 align:start position:0%
they're all becoming very similar thank
 
02:07:56.270 --> 02:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
you so much for your testimony I don't
 
02:07:59.030 --> 02:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
see any other pink cards here therefore
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh I will declare this
 
02:08:04.250 --> 02:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
public hearing closed
 
02:08:07.729 --> 02:08:07.739 align:start position:0%
and ask representative poche to read the
 
02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:12.830 --> 02:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
02:08:16.430 --> 02:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
House Bill 385
 
02:08:19.189 --> 02:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet there was none in support
 
02:08:21.169 --> 02:08:21.179 align:start position:0%
none opposed
 
02:08:21.179 --> 02:08:22.910 align:start position:0%
none opposed
online

02:08:22.910 --> 02:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
online
 
02:08:26.589 --> 02:08:26.599 align:start position:0%
there was one in support two opposed
 
02:08:31.609 --> 02:08:31.619 align:start position:0%
and Mr chair Mr materials yes if you
 
02:08:34.370 --> 02:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
like I do have the online to report for
 
02:08:39.290 --> 02:08:39.300 align:start position:0%
House Bill 381 okay please read it
 
02:08:41.229 --> 02:08:41.239 align:start position:0%
House Bill

chair

02:09:00.350 --> 02:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:09:01.970 --> 02:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:09:03.770 --> 02:09:03.780 align:start position:0%
moving right along trying to catch up
 
02:09:06.109 --> 02:09:06.119 align:start position:0%
with our schedule I'm going to open a
 
02:09:08.810 --> 02:09:08.820 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 251 and
 
02:09:11.390 --> 02:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
call on the bills Prime sponsor
 
02:09:12.890 --> 02:09:12.900 align:start position:0%
Vice chair of this committee
 
02:09:16.070 --> 02:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative Douglas Thomas
 
02:09:18.589 --> 02:09:18.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you to the
 
02:09:20.270 --> 02:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
committee uh for giving me the
 
02:09:24.350 --> 02:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to brief on HB 251.
 
02:09:26.689 --> 02:09:26.699 align:start position:0%
um I'm not going to go into a lot of
 
02:09:28.550 --> 02:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
history because it'll take too long but
 
02:09:31.790 --> 02:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
basically uh about three years ago the
 
02:09:33.350 --> 02:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate with the governor's
 
02:09:36.709 --> 02:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
approval uh decided that it was in the
 
02:09:38.990 --> 02:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
best interests of our residential
 
02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
customers to know what they're what
 
02:09:43.970 --> 02:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
they're paying for on their on their
 
02:09:47.089 --> 02:09:47.099 align:start position:0%
electric bill and so we decided that it
 
02:09:48.709 --> 02:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
would be a good practice for
 
02:09:52.390 --> 02:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
transparency to have the
 
02:09:56.350 --> 02:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
estimated annual cost of the RPS
 
02:09:59.510 --> 02:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
portion of the bill be displayed on
 
02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
their electric bill and it was decided
 
02:10:05.330 --> 02:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
that December would be the time period
 
02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
that that it would display this annual
 
02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:09.169 align:start position:0%
that that it would display this annual
amount

02:10:09.169 --> 02:10:09.179 align:start position:0%
amount
 
02:10:12.169 --> 02:10:12.179 align:start position:0%
when it got to the Senate they they
 
02:10:15.470 --> 02:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
agreed but they decided that the amount
 
02:10:18.290 --> 02:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
to be shown would be based on the
 
02:10:21.290 --> 02:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour basis
 
02:10:23.689 --> 02:10:23.699 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure exactly what that meant to
 
02:10:27.050 --> 02:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
this day uh even now my electric bill
 
02:10:30.709 --> 02:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
does not show the cost of RPS in those
 
02:10:32.930 --> 02:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
words and
 
02:10:35.990 --> 02:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
um and I I get the sense that no other
 
02:10:38.169 --> 02:10:38.179 align:start position:0%
customer would have any idea
 
02:10:42.229 --> 02:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
how this law was put into effect but it
 
02:10:46.250 --> 02:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
is my feeling that since we've already
 
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
decided that it's important enough to
 
02:10:51.890 --> 02:10:51.900 align:start position:0%
show the cost of the RPS program on your
 
02:10:53.350 --> 02:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
electric bill
 
02:10:56.810 --> 02:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
annualized that we should change the the
 
02:10:58.609 --> 02:10:58.619 align:start position:0%
law that said it should be done in terms
 
02:11:01.370 --> 02:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
of total dollars so that people can
 
02:11:03.649 --> 02:11:03.659 align:start position:0%
understand what they're seeing
 
02:11:06.609 --> 02:11:06.619 align:start position:0%
and I've
 
02:11:11.089 --> 02:11:11.099 align:start position:0%
looked at my December bill and
 
02:11:13.930 --> 02:11:13.940 align:start position:0%
there is no word that says RPS on there
 
02:11:16.729 --> 02:11:16.739 align:start position:0%
there is
 
02:11:20.209 --> 02:11:20.219 align:start position:0%
s there's the SBC charges but I don't
 
02:11:22.609 --> 02:11:22.619 align:start position:0%
see any word on here that explains how
 
02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
much money was spent on on RPS or charge
 
02:11:28.729 --> 02:11:28.739 align:start position:0%
to me anyway so I I have a concern that
 
02:11:31.609 --> 02:11:31.619 align:start position:0%
maybe possibly an amendment might be in
 
02:11:34.129 --> 02:11:34.139 align:start position:0%
order if this is not already being shown
 
02:11:36.470 --> 02:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
on my electric bill but I would like to
 
02:11:39.169 --> 02:11:39.179 align:start position:0%
hear comments from anyone behind me that
 
02:11:41.689 --> 02:11:41.699 align:start position:0%
that can explain that process but again
 
02:11:44.750 --> 02:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
the thrust of this bill is is to merely
 
02:11:47.330 --> 02:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
change the measurement factor from a
 
02:11:50.209 --> 02:11:50.219 align:start position:0%
kilowatt basis to just total dollars so
 
02:11:52.129 --> 02:11:52.139 align:start position:0%
people can understand what they're
 
02:11:54.589 --> 02:11:54.599 align:start position:0%
seeing on this bill and that's the basis
 
02:11:58.550 --> 02:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
of of my bill uh any other questions I
 
02:12:01.370 --> 02:12:01.380 align:start position:0%
think I would like to defer to uh either
 
02:12:04.129 --> 02:12:04.139 align:start position:0%
uh the utilities behind me or anyone
 
02:12:07.550 --> 02:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
else because uh I I cannot answer why
 
02:12:11.629 --> 02:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:13.370 --> 02:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
just for clarification though to make
 
02:12:14.930 --> 02:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
sure I understand what you're trying to
 
02:12:15.890 --> 02:12:15.900 align:start position:0%
do here
 
02:12:19.250 --> 02:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
rather than have the bill show
 
02:12:25.390 --> 02:12:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:28.790 --> 02:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
three seven cents per kilowatt hour
 
02:12:32.750 --> 02:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
you want the bill to show our cost for
 
02:12:37.070 --> 02:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
RPS and client compliance was 57 for the
 
02:12:39.830 --> 02:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
year is that correct that's correct that
 
02:12:41.870 --> 02:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
was the intent of the bill but I don't
 
02:12:44.570 --> 02:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
even see that on my electric bill for
 
02:12:47.689 --> 02:12:47.699 align:start position:0%
December so I have questions about where
 
02:12:49.870 --> 02:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
if a word
 
02:12:52.550 --> 02:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
.0037 cents per kilowatt hour I don't
 
02:12:55.010 --> 02:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
even see that on my bill so I I have
 
02:12:57.109 --> 02:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
questions on that as well
 
02:12:59.870 --> 02:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative Corman has a
 
02:13:02.229 --> 02:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:13:04.609 --> 02:13:04.619 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas Doug Thomas for
 
02:13:06.709 --> 02:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
taking my question what would you think
 
02:13:09.109 --> 02:13:09.119 align:start position:0%
about just having both the per kilowatt
 
02:13:11.149 --> 02:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
hour and the total annual cost showing
 
02:13:13.970 --> 02:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
on the bill I have the objection to both
 
02:13:19.129 --> 02:13:19.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:23.569 --> 02:13:23.579 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:25.729 --> 02:13:25.739 align:start position:0%
taking my question is the total cost
 
02:13:28.490 --> 02:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the total cost uh
 
02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
accumulated over the course of the
 
02:13:32.930 --> 02:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
previous year or is it total cost of the
 
02:13:34.790 --> 02:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
RPS program
 
02:13:37.330 --> 02:13:37.340 align:start position:0%
uh it would be an estimated cost
 
02:13:42.589 --> 02:13:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:45.470 --> 02:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
yeah and as I I didn't make any changes
 
02:13:47.569 --> 02:13:47.579 align:start position:0%
it would say for the prior compliance
 
02:13:49.850 --> 02:13:49.860 align:start position:0%
here okay I missed that as it is yeah
 
02:13:53.270 --> 02:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:56.030 --> 02:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
02:13:57.649 --> 02:13:57.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:13:58.910 --> 02:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:14:01.069 --> 02:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
um when we get into the cost here is
 
02:14:04.250 --> 02:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
this a average per you know we have the
 
02:14:06.290 --> 02:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
Standard customer out there that's 650
 
02:14:10.370 --> 02:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
megawatt uh 650 kilowatt hours per month
 
02:14:13.189 --> 02:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
or is this the actual cost to that
 
02:14:16.310 --> 02:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
customer so if you used uh a lot more
 
02:14:18.530 --> 02:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
than the average person your bill would
 
02:14:20.750 --> 02:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
show a much higher charge if you used a
 
02:14:22.490 --> 02:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
lot less you'd show a lower charge or is
 
02:14:24.649 --> 02:14:24.659 align:start position:0%
it some kind of an average
 
02:14:27.410 --> 02:14:27.420 align:start position:0%
well it's my understanding uh obviously
 
02:14:29.089 --> 02:14:29.099 align:start position:0%
if you use more kilowatt hours you
 
02:14:31.490 --> 02:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
you'll get a higher charge on there but
 
02:14:33.890 --> 02:14:33.900 align:start position:0%
the cost alone is an estimate because
 
02:14:35.950 --> 02:14:35.960 align:start position:0%
after all they have to do a lot of
 
02:14:38.950 --> 02:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
compilation not in time to cover for the
 
02:14:42.530 --> 02:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
December bill but again as the as the
 
02:14:45.770 --> 02:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
law as the uh the untouched portion of
 
02:14:47.750 --> 02:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
the bill says is from the prior
 
02:14:50.089 --> 02:14:50.099 align:start position:0%
compliance year and again we were told
 
02:14:52.430 --> 02:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
in testimony a couple years ago that it
 
02:14:54.530 --> 02:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
would be an estimate anyway it's always
 
02:14:57.589 --> 02:14:57.599 align:start position:0%
an estimate not exactly to to the penny
 
02:14:59.030 --> 02:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
but close enough to know what you're
 
02:15:01.129 --> 02:15:01.139 align:start position:0%
spending a follow-up
 
02:15:03.890 --> 02:15:03.900 align:start position:0%
follow up so I'm just trying to get this
 
02:15:05.450 --> 02:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
straight so let's just say in the course
 
02:15:09.950 --> 02:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
of a year I use uh 6 000 kilowatt hours
 
02:15:13.790 --> 02:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
with the estimate base be based on what
 
02:15:15.950 --> 02:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
the charge was per kilowatt hour basis
 
02:15:18.709 --> 02:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
is the present law says times that 6 000
 
02:15:20.390 --> 02:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
and that's what would appear on my bill
 
02:15:23.870 --> 02:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
or would it be the average customer uses
 
02:15:25.669 --> 02:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
this much electricity in the course of a
 
02:15:27.410 --> 02:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
year so for an average customer this is
 
02:15:28.609 --> 02:15:28.619 align:start position:0%
the cost
 
02:15:30.830 --> 02:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
is my understanding that it would be
 
02:15:33.530 --> 02:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
based on your usage not on any average
 
02:15:37.629 --> 02:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:39.770 --> 02:15:39.780 align:start position:0%
additional questions representative
 
02:15:42.890 --> 02:15:42.900 align:start position:0%
Reynolds has a question
 
02:15:44.569 --> 02:15:44.579 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:15:44.579 --> 02:15:45.950 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

02:15:45.950 --> 02:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:47.930 --> 02:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
as I think about
 
02:15:47.940 --> 02:15:49.490 align:start position:0%
as I think about
the

02:15:49.490 --> 02:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:15:49.500 --> 02:15:50.689 align:start position:0%
the
um

02:15:50.689 --> 02:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:52.550 --> 02:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to achieve here with
 
02:15:55.250 --> 02:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
the utilities calculating and then
 
02:15:58.069 --> 02:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
disclosing to each consumer each each
 
02:16:02.270 --> 02:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
rate payer the cost of their RPS
 
02:16:05.149 --> 02:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
compliance for their total Supply and
 
02:16:08.149 --> 02:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
then divided by all their customers
 
02:16:11.990 --> 02:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
in their in their territory
 
02:16:15.470 --> 02:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking that the maybe the reason
 
02:16:17.990 --> 02:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
the utilities haven't gotten there in
 
02:16:19.550 --> 02:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
terms of disclosing anything on the bill
 
02:16:23.030 --> 02:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
is that it seems like it would be really
 
02:16:25.790 --> 02:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
uh complicated have do the utilities
 
02:16:27.109 --> 02:16:27.119 align:start position:0%
have you talked to the utilities about
 
02:16:29.209 --> 02:16:29.219 align:start position:0%
this bill or do they have a position on
 
02:16:31.310 --> 02:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
like their ability we heard concern
 
02:16:34.250 --> 02:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
earlier about the you know the costs of
 
02:16:37.190 --> 02:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
administering the billing process
 
02:16:39.530 --> 02:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
um have have you talked to the utilities
 
02:16:42.709 --> 02:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
about how much how easy or how difficult
 
02:16:45.169 --> 02:16:45.179 align:start position:0%
this would be to do for every consumer
 
02:16:45.179 --> 02:16:46.129 align:start position:0%
this would be to do for every consumer
bill

02:16:46.129 --> 02:16:46.139 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:16:49.070 --> 02:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question and uh
 
02:16:52.490 --> 02:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
three or so years ago when uh correct me
 
02:16:54.110 --> 02:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong I think representative Rose
 
02:16:56.150 --> 02:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
might have been the prime sponsor on the
 
02:16:59.270 --> 02:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
original bill but my memory escapes me a
 
02:17:01.610 --> 02:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
bit but I was there and and we had that
 
02:17:05.690 --> 02:17:05.700 align:start position:0%
very discussion at that time and uh I
 
02:17:08.150 --> 02:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
believe the utilities uh although
 
02:17:10.849 --> 02:17:10.859 align:start position:0%
expressed a little bit of concern on how
 
02:17:12.770 --> 02:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
they would do it they had no objection
 
02:17:15.889 --> 02:17:15.899 align:start position:0%
to it uh the fact that the house and the
 
02:17:17.330 --> 02:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
Senate and the governor has signed this
 
02:17:19.610 --> 02:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
into law would tell me that the
 
02:17:21.230 --> 02:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
utilities would would need to comply
 
02:17:23.810 --> 02:17:23.820 align:start position:0%
with it admit it okay thank you
 
02:17:26.450 --> 02:17:26.460 align:start position:0%
as a point of information I am looking
 
02:17:28.370 --> 02:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
at my December
 
02:17:31.429 --> 02:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
20 2022 bill
 
02:17:33.770 --> 02:17:33.780 align:start position:0%
and under
 
02:17:37.129 --> 02:17:37.139 align:start position:0%
a heading called important information
 
02:17:39.290 --> 02:17:39.300 align:start position:0%
my bill reads as follows
 
02:17:41.929 --> 02:17:41.939 align:start position:0%
the 2021 average Statewide renewable
 
02:17:45.910 --> 02:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard compliance cost was
 
02:17:45.920 --> 02:17:48.429 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard compliance cost was
dollars

02:17:48.429 --> 02:17:48.439 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
0.0051 per kilowatt hour
 
02:17:53.810 --> 02:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
information on the RPS including its
 
02:17:55.490 --> 02:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
benefits may be found on the New
 
02:17:57.950 --> 02:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Energy's website
 
02:18:00.349 --> 02:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
and then it lists the
 
02:18:03.530 --> 02:18:03.540 align:start position:0%
the URL for the website
 
02:18:06.830 --> 02:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
so my bill does disclose this is the New
 
02:18:08.629 --> 02:18:08.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Electric Co-op that that
 
02:18:11.929 --> 02:18:11.939 align:start position:0%
serves my uh my distribution area my
 
02:18:14.089 --> 02:18:14.099 align:start position:0%
bill does disclose
 
02:18:17.270 --> 02:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
that information but only as a per
 
02:18:21.410 --> 02:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour choice or charge
 
02:18:24.530 --> 02:18:24.540 align:start position:0%
so it's not clear to me from the way
 
02:18:29.330 --> 02:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:30.650 --> 02:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
if that
 
02:18:33.169 --> 02:18:33.179 align:start position:0%
zero zero fifty one
 
02:18:37.250 --> 02:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
Cent per kilowatt hour charge is
 
02:18:40.009 --> 02:18:40.019 align:start position:0%
based on my usage or is just general
 
02:18:42.469 --> 02:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
usage it's not clear
 
02:18:43.990 --> 02:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
so that's a point of information
 
02:18:45.830 --> 02:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has another
 
02:18:47.990 --> 02:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
question well it I guess it'd be I don't
 
02:18:50.030 --> 02:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
know if it's may I ask a question back
 
02:18:51.230 --> 02:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
to you sir
 
02:18:53.990 --> 02:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
um sure if
 
02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:55.389 align:start position:0%
um sure if
the

02:18:55.389 --> 02:18:55.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:18:58.490 --> 02:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
most utility bills show
 
02:19:01.129 --> 02:19:01.139 align:start position:0%
a customer's
 
02:19:05.570 --> 02:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
12 past you know 12 months usage so
 
02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
isn't the intent there it sounds like a
 
02:19:09.709 --> 02:19:09.719 align:start position:0%
customer if they wanted to know what
 
02:19:11.690 --> 02:19:11.700 align:start position:0%
their total cost to them of RPS
 
02:19:13.429 --> 02:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
compliance would be to look at their
 
02:19:16.250 --> 02:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
12-month kilowatt hour usage and just do
 
02:19:20.270 --> 02:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
the math 650 kilowatt hours times that
 
02:19:21.889 --> 02:19:21.899 align:start position:0%
per kilowatt you know I'm saying the
 
02:19:24.650 --> 02:19:24.660 align:start position:0%
average number but each customer could
 
02:19:28.370 --> 02:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
say if I use double the average use up I
 
02:19:31.190 --> 02:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
used you know 1200 kilowatt hours a
 
02:19:33.709 --> 02:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
month I would then use 100
 
02:19:35.509 --> 02:19:35.519 align:start position:0%
fourteen thousand four hundred kilo
 
02:19:37.849 --> 02:19:37.859 align:start position:0%
hours a year times the figure you cited
 
02:19:39.650 --> 02:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
and they would get their cost of
 
02:19:39.660 --> 02:19:41.750 align:start position:0%
and they would get their cost of
compliance

02:19:41.750 --> 02:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
02:19:43.549 --> 02:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
yes and I will do that math for you
 
02:19:45.290 --> 02:19:45.300 align:start position:0%
really quickly all right
 
02:19:48.469 --> 02:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
so I used 565 kilowatt hours that month
 
02:19:51.889 --> 02:19:51.899 align:start position:0%
that month I'll multiply that times
 
02:19:51.899 --> 02:19:55.190 align:start position:0%
that month I'll multiply that times
.0051

02:19:55.190 --> 02:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:58.010 --> 02:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
and that comes out to
 
02:19:58.020 --> 02:20:03.349 align:start position:0%
and that comes out to
2.88

02:20:03.349 --> 02:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:05.210 --> 02:20:05.220 align:start position:0%
if I did that math correctly yeah I
 
02:20:07.790 --> 02:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
think he might have I think he didn't
 
02:20:09.650 --> 02:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
have enough decimal places I think
 
02:20:14.570 --> 02:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:16.490 --> 02:20:16.500 align:start position:0%
anyway we'll take this offline this
 
02:20:18.590 --> 02:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
calculation but you're right that's how
 
02:20:20.630 --> 02:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
it could be done but what I think
 
02:20:22.730 --> 02:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas and this bill is
 
02:20:24.770 --> 02:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
suggesting that why should a customer
 
02:20:27.349 --> 02:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
have to make that computation when the
 
02:20:29.270 --> 02:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
utility could do it and put the total
 
02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
amount on the bill
 
02:20:33.170 --> 02:20:33.180 align:start position:0%
that would be more transparent
 
02:20:36.349 --> 02:20:36.359 align:start position:0%
and would help people understand exactly
 
02:20:37.790 --> 02:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
what they're paying for
 
02:20:37.800 --> 02:20:39.530 align:start position:0%
what they're paying for
so

02:20:39.530 --> 02:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:20:42.050 --> 02:20:42.060 align:start position:0%
any further questions on this uh
 
02:20:43.969 --> 02:20:43.979 align:start position:0%
legislation we have one more person who
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
would like to testify so
 
02:20:50.270 --> 02:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
let's move on and representative Corman
 
02:20:52.010 --> 02:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
has a question so I just downloaded my
 
02:20:53.690 --> 02:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
bill from Liberty and I'm in the same
 
02:20:55.250 --> 02:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
boat as you representative Thomas
 
02:20:57.230 --> 02:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
there's nothing about this charge on my
 
02:20:57.240 --> 02:20:59.090 align:start position:0%
there's nothing about this charge on my
bill

02:20:59.090 --> 02:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:21:00.950 --> 02:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
no dude
 
02:21:02.870 --> 02:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay so noted all right thank you
 
02:21:04.910 --> 02:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas for introducing
 
02:21:06.469 --> 02:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
this bill I'll Now call on Griffin
 
02:21:08.030 --> 02:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
Robbers from the Department of energy
 
02:21:11.090 --> 02:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
for the Department's perspective
 
02:21:11.100 --> 02:21:13.330 align:start position:0%
for the Department's perspective
foreign

02:21:13.330 --> 02:21:13.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:15.710 --> 02:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
Thomas don't forget to submit a pink
 
02:21:15.720 --> 02:21:20.630 align:start position:0%
Thomas don't forget to submit a pink
card

02:21:20.630 --> 02:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:22.670 --> 02:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman votes members of
 
02:21:24.590 --> 02:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
the committee Griffin Roberge again from
 
02:21:26.510 --> 02:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of energy
 
02:21:28.370 --> 02:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
um no surprise we're neutral on this
 
02:21:30.290 --> 02:21:30.300 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced
 
02:21:32.210 --> 02:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
um for context just because it's been
 
02:21:33.950 --> 02:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned frequently here at this
 
02:21:37.510 --> 02:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
statute uh that's subject to House Bill
 
02:21:42.530 --> 02:21:42.540 align:start position:0%
251 was created by House Bill 1550 and
 
02:21:46.610 --> 02:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
2018. the statute requires the estimated
 
02:21:49.309 --> 02:21:49.319 align:start position:0%
cost of the RPS on a per kilowatt hour
 
02:21:51.590 --> 02:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
basis to be displayed on an electric
 
02:21:54.010 --> 02:21:54.020 align:start position:0%
customer's December bill
 
02:21:56.450 --> 02:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
this estimated cost will be focused on
 
02:21:59.510 --> 02:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
the prior RPS compliance year this
 
02:22:01.250 --> 02:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
estimation is done once a year and
 
02:22:03.410 --> 02:22:03.420 align:start position:0%
information about the RPS including its
 
02:22:06.230 --> 02:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
benefits is available via a link to the
 
02:22:08.090 --> 02:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
appropriate State website utilities are
 
02:22:09.590 --> 02:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
allowed to recover the costs of
 
02:22:11.210 --> 02:22:11.220 align:start position:0%
providing this information from Electric
 
02:22:13.849 --> 02:22:13.859 align:start position:0%
rate payers on their bill
 
02:22:18.830 --> 02:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 1550 as uh as has been
 
02:22:21.710 --> 02:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned here uh simply just requires
 
02:22:24.770 --> 02:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
the per kilowatt hour usage to be posted
 
02:22:26.809 --> 02:22:26.819 align:start position:0%
on an electric customer's December bill
 
02:22:29.690 --> 02:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
that rate is an average that has arrived
 
02:22:31.969 --> 02:22:31.979 align:start position:0%
at every year for the prior compliance
 
02:22:34.370 --> 02:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
year so uh
 
02:22:36.110 --> 02:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
referencing what you mentioned uh
 
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
chairman Vos every year in the renewable
 
02:22:40.849 --> 02:22:40.859 align:start position:0%
energy fund report that the department
 
02:22:44.750 --> 02:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
puts out we list out the costs of our PS
 
02:22:47.690 --> 02:22:47.700 align:start position:0%
for the RPS compliance as we all know
 
02:22:50.510 --> 02:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
the RPS uh for electric providers to
 
02:22:52.309 --> 02:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
satisfy that must either purchase Rex
 
02:22:55.610 --> 02:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
and acps those come at a cost
 
02:22:57.349 --> 02:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
um based on
 
02:23:00.770 --> 02:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
information that representative uh
 
02:23:02.809 --> 02:23:02.819 align:start position:0%
mentioned as well as available on the
 
02:23:04.610 --> 02:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
report the average per kilowatt rate
 
02:23:09.590 --> 02:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:11.570 --> 02:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
dollar cents
 
02:23:13.849 --> 02:23:13.859 align:start position:0%
um you would then take that rate
 
02:23:16.550 --> 02:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
multiply it against your respective
 
02:23:19.490 --> 02:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
usage and you would arrive at your RPS
 
02:23:22.130 --> 02:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
compliance cost for that month
 
02:23:24.830 --> 02:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
um or you could gather all your 12
 
02:23:26.330 --> 02:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
months worth of bills put them together
 
02:23:28.550 --> 02:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
and then you know figure out what your
 
02:23:32.750 --> 02:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
cost is per year so assuming a 650
 
02:23:35.330 --> 02:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
kilowatt monthly consumption that's an
 
02:23:36.950 --> 02:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
average electric customer's consumption
 
02:23:40.130 --> 02:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
every year I'm sorry averaging that
 
02:23:43.309 --> 02:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
number against the compliance year 21
 
02:23:45.370 --> 02:23:45.380 align:start position:0%
RPS cost
 
02:23:49.730 --> 02:23:49.740 align:start position:0%
that would be about 3.31 cents a month
 
02:23:53.230 --> 02:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
or 39.78 a year
 
02:23:56.450 --> 02:23:56.460 align:start position:0%
circling back to the bill the the bill
 
02:23:59.809 --> 02:23:59.819 align:start position:0%
before you House Bill 1251 I mean uh 251
 
02:24:02.450 --> 02:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
the bill proposes to remove the per
 
02:24:04.429 --> 02:24:04.439 align:start position:0%
kilowatt information that's provided on
 
02:24:06.650 --> 02:24:06.660 align:start position:0%
a customer's Bill and instead would be
 
02:24:08.690 --> 02:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
required to show the estimated total
 
02:24:10.969 --> 02:24:10.979 align:start position:0%
cost in dollars for compliance with the
 
02:24:13.250 --> 02:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
RPS for the prior compliance year and
 
02:24:15.170 --> 02:24:15.180 align:start position:0%
hearing the prime sponsor's testimony I
 
02:24:17.389 --> 02:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
believe the focus is to have the
 
02:24:20.389 --> 02:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
individualized cost in dollars shown on
 
02:24:22.550 --> 02:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
electric customers Bill respectfully
 
02:24:24.290 --> 02:24:24.300 align:start position:0%
that is not how the department views the
 
02:24:26.270 --> 02:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
bill as currently written we view it as
 
02:24:28.849 --> 02:24:28.859 align:start position:0%
demonstrating the overall fat cost of
 
02:24:30.889 --> 02:24:30.899 align:start position:0%
RPS compliance being posted on a
 
02:24:33.710 --> 02:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
customer's bill so last year for
 
02:24:37.010 --> 02:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
compliance year 21 the average cost for
 
02:24:39.110 --> 02:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
the art the total RPS compliance cost
 
02:24:41.809 --> 02:24:41.819 align:start position:0%
was about 53 million dollars that is the
 
02:24:43.550 --> 02:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
figure that would be posted on folks
 
02:24:45.290 --> 02:24:45.300 align:start position:0%
December bill and in hearing the product
 
02:24:46.849 --> 02:24:46.859 align:start position:0%
sponsors testimony that is not what's
 
02:24:49.190 --> 02:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
indicated that's not what's wanted I
 
02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:50.389 align:start position:0%
indicated that's not what's wanted I
believe

02:24:50.389 --> 02:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
believe
 
02:24:54.290 --> 02:24:54.300 align:start position:0%
um if the goal is to provide an
 
02:24:56.929 --> 02:24:56.939 align:start position:0%
estimated cost in dollars for each
 
02:24:59.750 --> 02:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
respective Electric customer I imagine
 
02:25:02.030 --> 02:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
that will require some type of billing
 
02:25:04.490 --> 02:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
modification from the utilities
 
02:25:07.190 --> 02:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
which those cost per the language on
 
02:25:10.969 --> 02:25:10.979 align:start position:0%
lines 12 to 4 12 to 13 will likely be
 
02:25:13.790 --> 02:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
recovered from Electric customers
 
02:25:15.710 --> 02:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
um with that I'm happy to take any
 
02:25:17.690 --> 02:25:17.700 align:start position:0%
questions that folks might have
 
02:25:20.570 --> 02:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Roberts for refreshing my
 
02:25:23.150 --> 02:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
memory about house bill 1550.
 
02:25:26.450 --> 02:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
I remember now some of the details about
 
02:25:29.450 --> 02:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
the debate on that bill before it was
 
02:25:32.330 --> 02:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
passed in fact it went to
 
02:25:35.389 --> 02:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
it it passed the house
 
02:25:35.399 --> 02:25:36.290 align:start position:0%
it it passed the house
um

02:25:36.290 --> 02:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:38.630 --> 02:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
describing the cost in the way that
 
02:25:41.330 --> 02:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas Doug Thomas
 
02:25:44.450 --> 02:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
suggests that it should in this bill
 
02:25:46.670 --> 02:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
and the bill actually went to a
 
02:25:48.770 --> 02:25:48.780 align:start position:0%
committee of conference and it was in
 
02:25:51.110 --> 02:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
the committee of conference that Senator
 
02:25:53.570 --> 02:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
Bradley insisted that it be changed to
 
02:25:57.469 --> 02:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
the per kilowatt hour average rather
 
02:26:00.410 --> 02:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
than the total average
 
02:26:04.250 --> 02:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
but I am recalling now that when we
 
02:26:05.809 --> 02:26:05.819 align:start position:0%
discussed with the utilities whether
 
02:26:08.030 --> 02:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
they could calculate it out for every
 
02:26:10.490 --> 02:26:10.500 align:start position:0%
individual customer they indicated that
 
02:26:12.290 --> 02:26:12.300 align:start position:0%
that would be very costly
 
02:26:15.889 --> 02:26:15.899 align:start position:0%
so the bill as it was eventually signed
 
02:26:19.010 --> 02:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
by the governor just required that the
 
02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
average costs be placed on the bill
 
02:26:22.800 --> 02:26:24.410 align:start position:0%
average costs be placed on the bill
so

02:26:24.410 --> 02:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:26:26.929 --> 02:26:26.939 align:start position:0%
as I just read my bill a few minutes ago
 
02:26:30.190 --> 02:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:34.730 --> 02:26:34.740 align:start position:0%
0.0051 dollars per kilowatt hour
 
02:26:37.670 --> 02:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
as you pointed out a 650 kilowatt hour
 
02:26:40.429 --> 02:26:40.439 align:start position:0%
customer would be paying about 39 a year
 
02:26:42.710 --> 02:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
a year yes that's the number that should
 
02:26:44.270 --> 02:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
be on the bill according to
 
02:26:46.969 --> 02:26:46.979 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas's bill is I
 
02:26:48.410 --> 02:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
02:26:51.590 --> 02:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
is that your understanding
 
02:26:53.090 --> 02:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
um and here uh thank you for the
 
02:26:55.130 --> 02:26:55.140 align:start position:0%
question so in hearing you explain that
 
02:26:57.230 --> 02:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
I do understand it now
 
02:26:57.240 --> 02:26:58.790 align:start position:0%
I do understand it now
um

02:26:58.790 --> 02:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:01.730 --> 02:27:01.740 align:start position:0%
yeah I can't speak for utilities on
 
02:27:04.090 --> 02:27:04.100 align:start position:0%
their ability to post that information
 
02:27:06.349 --> 02:27:06.359 align:start position:0%
uh easily on their bill obviously
 
02:27:08.990 --> 02:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
there's limited space on bills and any
 
02:27:10.849 --> 02:27:10.859 align:start position:0%
type of change on the type of
 
02:27:12.530 --> 02:27:12.540 align:start position:0%
information that they need to put on a
 
02:27:15.110 --> 02:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
bill will likely require some type of uh
 
02:27:16.849 --> 02:27:16.859 align:start position:0%
Billing System modification that again
 
02:27:18.710 --> 02:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
is recovered from electricity electric
 
02:27:18.720 --> 02:27:20.270 align:start position:0%
is recovered from electricity electric
customers

02:27:20.270 --> 02:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
customers
 
02:27:22.429 --> 02:27:22.439 align:start position:0%
um but that's what I in hearing the
 
02:27:24.110 --> 02:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
discussion here today that's what we
 
02:27:26.270 --> 02:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
believe the intention to be in looking
 
02:27:27.889 --> 02:27:27.899 align:start position:0%
at the language as it's currently
 
02:27:30.550 --> 02:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
drafted in the bill we view it as
 
02:27:33.170 --> 02:27:33.180 align:start position:0%
utilities are posting the total cost in
 
02:27:35.809 --> 02:27:35.819 align:start position:0%
dollars of RPS for the prior compliance
 
02:27:38.030 --> 02:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
year it's not individualized in any any
 
02:27:40.309 --> 02:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
way shape or form is the total fat cost
 
02:27:42.530 --> 02:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
of RPS compliance that all ratepayers
 
02:27:44.929 --> 02:27:44.939 align:start position:0%
paid so again for compliance year 21
 
02:27:46.910 --> 02:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
that figure was around I think 53
 
02:27:48.650 --> 02:27:48.660 align:start position:0%
million dollars that would be the figure
 
02:27:51.170 --> 02:27:51.180 align:start position:0%
that would be put on the bill based on
 
02:27:52.550 --> 02:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
our read
 
02:27:54.950 --> 02:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
before this public hearing
 
02:27:57.889 --> 02:27:57.899 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Corman has
 
02:27:58.910 --> 02:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
a question
 
02:28:00.889 --> 02:28:00.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you once
 
02:28:03.349 --> 02:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
again Mr Roberts so if I understand
 
02:28:05.870 --> 02:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
correctly then you would support an
 
02:28:07.550 --> 02:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
amendment that just makes it clear that
 
02:28:09.950 --> 02:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
this uh amount of this estimated total
 
02:28:13.490 --> 02:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
cost should be either per customer or
 
02:28:15.469 --> 02:28:15.479 align:start position:0%
for the individual customer rather than
 
02:28:18.110 --> 02:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
the entire RPS across the entire State
 
02:28:19.790 --> 02:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
sure and thank you for the question we
 
02:28:21.830 --> 02:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
are neutral on the bill we'd likely be
 
02:28:24.050 --> 02:28:24.060 align:start position:0%
neutral with any type of change but I
 
02:28:26.929 --> 02:28:26.939 align:start position:0%
think I would respectfully suggest that
 
02:28:28.910 --> 02:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
um to determine maybe whether or not the
 
02:28:30.710 --> 02:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
utilities are able to accommodate this
 
02:28:32.630 --> 02:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
that the committee and or the sponsors
 
02:28:34.730 --> 02:28:34.740 align:start position:0%
of the bill may want to reach out to the
 
02:28:36.230 --> 02:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
utilities to inquire with them about
 
02:28:38.330 --> 02:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
this proposed change and whether they'd
 
02:28:42.469 --> 02:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
be able to uh undertake it
 
02:28:45.429 --> 02:28:45.439 align:start position:0%
thank you if my utility can put the 0 0
 
02:28:49.010 --> 02:28:49.020 align:start position:0%
51 dollar amount on the bill
 
02:28:52.510 --> 02:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
then they could easily put the
 
02:28:56.690 --> 02:28:56.700 align:start position:0%
650 kilowatt per month average total of
 
02:28:59.450 --> 02:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
39 and whatever you said it was yep it
 
02:29:01.610 --> 02:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
could easily put that on the bill
 
02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
so do we have any further questions for
 
02:29:06.410 --> 02:29:06.420 align:start position:0%
Mr Roberts representative Reynolds has a
 
02:29:06.420 --> 02:29:07.130 align:start position:0%
Mr Roberts representative Reynolds has a
question

02:29:07.130 --> 02:29:07.140 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:29:08.809 --> 02:29:08.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:29:08.819 --> 02:29:09.650 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

02:29:09.650 --> 02:29:09.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:14.330 --> 02:29:14.340 align:start position:0%
since the administration of the utility
 
02:29:17.469 --> 02:29:17.479 align:start position:0%
the public utility system and the
 
02:29:20.410 --> 02:29:20.420 align:start position:0%
utility rate making process is all about
 
02:29:25.150 --> 02:29:25.160 align:start position:0%
balancing costs and benefits
 
02:29:28.550 --> 02:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
what would you think of the
 
02:29:30.469 --> 02:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
um an amendment to this bill that would
 
02:29:33.230 --> 02:29:33.240 align:start position:0%
require the calculation and the
 
02:29:36.290 --> 02:29:36.300 align:start position:0%
placement on each customer's bill of
 
02:29:39.530 --> 02:29:39.540 align:start position:0%
an amount that represents the benefits
 
02:29:43.190 --> 02:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
of the RPS policy thank you for the
 
02:29:46.490 --> 02:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
question so I uh I would
 
02:29:48.530 --> 02:29:48.540 align:start position:0%
submit that might be difficult to
 
02:29:49.670 --> 02:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
quantify that at least for the
 
02:29:51.349 --> 02:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
Department we don't have any you know
 
02:29:53.090 --> 02:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
year-to-year independent economic
 
02:29:55.070 --> 02:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
analysis for the benefit that the RPS
 
02:29:57.710 --> 02:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
has on an individual's specific electric
 
02:29:57.720 --> 02:29:59.150 align:start position:0%
has on an individual's specific electric
rates

02:29:59.150 --> 02:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
rates
 
02:29:59.160 --> 02:30:00.550 align:start position:0%
rates
um

02:30:00.550 --> 02:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:03.230 --> 02:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
was it I I would reference
 
02:30:05.030 --> 02:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
um the committee to line 11 where it
 
02:30:07.130 --> 02:30:07.140 align:start position:0%
does require
 
02:30:09.050 --> 02:30:09.060 align:start position:0%
um on a customer's Bill to not only
 
02:30:11.150 --> 02:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
identify the cost but also provide a
 
02:30:12.730 --> 02:30:12.740 align:start position:0%
link to the information about the RPS
 
02:30:15.770 --> 02:30:15.780 align:start position:0%
including its benefits at uh the State
 
02:30:18.770 --> 02:30:18.780 align:start position:0%
website so obviously folks can go there
 
02:30:20.450 --> 02:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
to see it but
 
02:30:21.410 --> 02:30:21.420 align:start position:0%
um you know at least from the
 
02:30:23.330 --> 02:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
Department's perspective I think it'd be
 
02:30:25.370 --> 02:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
at least difficult for us to arrive at a
 
02:30:27.110 --> 02:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
specific figure for the benefits of the
 
02:30:27.120 --> 02:30:28.490 align:start position:0%
specific figure for the benefits of the
RPS

02:30:28.490 --> 02:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
RPS
 
02:30:31.490 --> 02:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
follow-up before you follow up I just
 
02:30:33.230 --> 02:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
want to point out that having been
 
02:30:37.130 --> 02:30:37.140 align:start position:0%
intimately involved in House Bill 1550
 
02:30:40.250 --> 02:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
back in 2018 or whenever it was that was
 
02:30:43.790 --> 02:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
a compromise that was arrived at by all
 
02:30:46.849 --> 02:30:46.859 align:start position:0%
parties that putting a link to the RPS
 
02:30:49.730 --> 02:30:49.740 align:start position:0%
information on
 
02:30:52.670 --> 02:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
at that time the puc website was the
 
02:30:54.830 --> 02:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
solution to the to the question that you
 
02:30:56.510 --> 02:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
just asked okay
 
02:30:59.750 --> 02:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you now you can follow up if
 
02:31:00.830 --> 02:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
you need to
 
02:31:04.070 --> 02:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
well you know I guess I would I would
 
02:31:06.170 --> 02:31:06.180 align:start position:0%
add I would
 
02:31:09.050 --> 02:31:09.060 align:start position:0%
ask you about we we've had presentations
 
02:31:11.570 --> 02:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
from each utility
 
02:31:11.580 --> 02:31:12.530 align:start position:0%
from each utility
um

02:31:12.530 --> 02:31:12.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:15.710 --> 02:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
in the early part of our session here uh
 
02:31:15.720 --> 02:31:17.450 align:start position:0%
in the early part of our session here uh
year

02:31:17.450 --> 02:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:31:17.460 --> 02:31:18.290 align:start position:0%
year
um

02:31:18.290 --> 02:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:21.770 --> 02:31:21.780 align:start position:0%
in particular the the uh
 
02:31:23.450 --> 02:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
grid operator showed us that the
 
02:31:25.210 --> 02:31:25.220 align:start position:0%
presence of distributed generation
 
02:31:27.410 --> 02:31:27.420 align:start position:0%
renewable you know per the renewable
 
02:31:28.969 --> 02:31:28.979 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard you know lowered
 
02:31:33.349 --> 02:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
wholesale power costs by X and simply
 
02:31:37.010 --> 02:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:39.050 --> 02:31:39.060 align:start position:0%
reduction in wholesale power costs
 
02:31:41.510 --> 02:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
across the rate base could provide
 
02:31:44.270 --> 02:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
a figure in the same way that
 
02:31:47.330 --> 02:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
this figure cost of RPS compliance is is
 
02:31:49.070 --> 02:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
being arrived at
 
02:31:50.809 --> 02:31:50.819 align:start position:0%
what do you think do you think is that
 
02:31:54.170 --> 02:31:54.180 align:start position:0%
analogous uh I I guess thank you for the
 
02:31:54.180 --> 02:31:54.950 align:start position:0%
analogous uh I I guess thank you for the
question

02:31:54.950 --> 02:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:31:56.750 --> 02:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
um you know whether or not policymakers
 
02:31:59.150 --> 02:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
want to put on some specific figure to
 
02:32:03.050 --> 02:32:03.060 align:start position:0%
show a numerical benefit of the RPS on a
 
02:32:05.389 --> 02:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
customer's bill is obviously their call
 
02:32:08.030 --> 02:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
I can only just reference what's you
 
02:32:09.590 --> 02:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
know typically put out every year by the
 
02:32:11.389 --> 02:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
department and its renewable energy fund
 
02:32:13.849 --> 02:32:13.859 align:start position:0%
report obviously the costs are
 
02:32:16.910 --> 02:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
relatively easy to quantify trying to
 
02:32:21.530 --> 02:32:21.540 align:start position:0%
quantify year to year the benefits of of
 
02:32:23.290 --> 02:32:23.300 align:start position:0%
um quantify the benefits every year
 
02:32:25.969 --> 02:32:25.979 align:start position:0%
might be a little bit bigger of an
 
02:32:27.710 --> 02:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
economic undertaking and Beyond at least
 
02:32:30.010 --> 02:32:30.020 align:start position:0%
the resources of our staff to quantify
 
02:32:32.270 --> 02:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
obviously if there's some other type of
 
02:32:33.730 --> 02:32:33.740 align:start position:0%
resource that
 
02:32:36.889 --> 02:32:36.899 align:start position:0%
legislators think should be shown on a
 
02:32:38.030 --> 02:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
bill to show that numerical benefit
 
02:32:41.090 --> 02:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
that's obviously their call
 
02:32:43.550 --> 02:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
thank you okay further questions for Mr
 
02:32:43.560 --> 02:32:46.670 align:start position:0%
thank you okay further questions for Mr
Roberge

02:32:46.670 --> 02:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:48.830 --> 02:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none I want to thank you for
 
02:32:50.990 --> 02:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you coming to give us the
 
02:32:52.429 --> 02:32:52.439 align:start position:0%
Department's perspective on this
 
02:32:55.070 --> 02:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
legislation I have no more pink cards
 
02:32:58.969 --> 02:32:58.979 align:start position:0%
for this bill is there anyone sitting in
 
02:33:00.590 --> 02:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
the audience who would like to speak on
 
02:33:06.230 --> 02:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:07.969 --> 02:33:07.979 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will close the public
 
02:33:10.910 --> 02:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 251 and ask Mr
 
02:33:13.010 --> 02:33:13.020 align:start position:0%
representative closet to give us the
 
02:33:14.150 --> 02:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
blue sheet
 
02:33:18.950 --> 02:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
Cali thank you chair I'll spill two five
 
02:33:18.960 --> 02:33:20.090 align:start position:0%
Cali thank you chair I'll spill two five
one

02:33:20.090 --> 02:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:33:23.690 --> 02:33:23.700 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet zero in support one
 
02:33:29.809 --> 02:33:29.819 align:start position:0%
oppose online one in support 52 oppose
 
02:33:34.309 --> 02:33:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:38.570 --> 02:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
so we actually caught up
 
02:33:41.570 --> 02:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
amazing I'm I'm I'm
 
02:33:44.150 --> 02:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
encouraged that our experiment may have
 
02:33:46.969 --> 02:33:46.979 align:start position:0%
proved to be productive that we were
 
02:33:49.730 --> 02:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
able to get through four bills
 
02:33:53.690 --> 02:33:53.700 align:start position:0%
and instead of using three hours
 
02:33:56.870 --> 02:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
or instead of using an hour per bill
 
02:33:59.270 --> 02:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
we only used about 45 minutes per bill
 
02:34:02.389 --> 02:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
which is pretty good now that
 
02:34:04.309 --> 02:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
could just be because of the nature of
 
02:34:06.530 --> 02:34:06.540 align:start position:0%
the bills I don't know but
 
02:34:09.050 --> 02:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
um it was an encouraging experiment in
 
02:34:11.030 --> 02:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
any case
 
02:34:12.889 --> 02:34:12.899 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll take a win whenever we can
 
02:34:15.170 --> 02:34:15.180 align:start position:0%
get one right so
 
02:34:15.180 --> 02:34:16.190 align:start position:0%
get one right so
um

02:34:16.190 --> 02:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:17.870 --> 02:34:17.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to take a lunch break now
 
02:34:19.309 --> 02:34:19.319 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be actually a little
 
02:34:20.809 --> 02:34:20.819 align:start position:0%
bit longer a lunch break than I
 
02:34:22.790 --> 02:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
anticipated I anticipated we would go
 
02:34:25.309 --> 02:34:25.319 align:start position:0%
all the way to noon before we took that
 
02:34:25.319 --> 02:34:26.210 align:start position:0%
all the way to noon before we took that
break

02:34:26.210 --> 02:34:26.220 align:start position:0%
break
 
02:34:29.389 --> 02:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
so we're not due back here until 1 30 at
 
02:34:30.950 --> 02:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
which time we will have an executive
 
02:34:30.960 --> 02:34:32.030 align:start position:0%
which time we will have an executive
session

02:34:32.030 --> 02:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:34:36.710 --> 02:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
on four five bills including two bills
 
02:34:38.750 --> 02:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
that we had an executive session on last
 
02:34:38.760 --> 02:34:39.889 align:start position:0%
that we had an executive session on last
Friday

02:34:39.889 --> 02:34:39.899 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
02:34:43.910 --> 02:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 211 and House Bill 633 both
 
02:34:47.270 --> 02:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
of those bills the minority leader and I
 
02:34:47.280 --> 02:34:48.530 align:start position:0%
of those bills the minority leader and I
agreed

02:34:48.530 --> 02:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
agreed
 
02:34:50.570 --> 02:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
we could exec on the same day that we
 
02:34:52.370 --> 02:34:52.380 align:start position:0%
heard those bills
 
02:34:56.450 --> 02:34:56.460 align:start position:0%
but we both had forgotten that we had
 
02:34:58.010 --> 02:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
scheduled the exact session on those
 
02:34:59.570 --> 02:34:59.580 align:start position:0%
bills for today
 
02:35:01.610 --> 02:35:01.620 align:start position:0%
so I called the house Clerk and said hey
 
02:35:04.010 --> 02:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
we already did those is that okay and he
 
02:35:05.990 --> 02:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
said no that's not okay he said you can
 
02:35:08.690 --> 02:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
have an exact session on a bill
 
02:35:11.210 --> 02:35:11.220 align:start position:0%
after it's been noticed but you can't
 
02:35:14.150 --> 02:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
have one before it's been noticed so
 
02:35:16.429 --> 02:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to redo House Bill
 
02:35:19.190 --> 02:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
211 and House Bill 633 hopefully that'll
 
02:35:21.770 --> 02:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
take five minutes each bill and then we
 
02:35:24.530 --> 02:35:24.540 align:start position:0%
can move on to the exact sessions for
 
02:35:27.590 --> 02:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill 139 House Bill 166 and House
 
02:35:31.610 --> 02:35:31.620 align:start position:0%
Bill 219 FN
 
02:35:33.349 --> 02:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
so that is our schedule for this
 
02:35:35.210 --> 02:35:35.220 align:start position:0%
afternoon after we finish the executive
 
02:35:37.130 --> 02:35:37.140 align:start position:0%
schedule which I'm hoping will last no
 
02:35:38.690 --> 02:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
longer than one hour
 
02:35:40.370 --> 02:35:40.380 align:start position:0%
we will hear
 
02:35:43.130 --> 02:35:43.140 align:start position:0%
two further we'll have public hearings
 
02:35:47.990 --> 02:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
on two further bills HB 257 and HB 263
 
02:35:49.730 --> 02:35:49.740 align:start position:0%
and with a little bit of luck we'll be
 
02:35:52.550 --> 02:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
out of here by a reasonable hour this
 
02:35:56.330 --> 02:35:56.340 align:start position:0%
afternoon maybe 4 or 4 30.
 
02:35:58.969 --> 02:35:58.979 align:start position:0%
so is there any committing business to
 
02:36:00.530 --> 02:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
conduct between
 
02:36:02.230 --> 02:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
um before we go on a lunch break
 
02:36:04.550 --> 02:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative notter
 
02:36:06.230 --> 02:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
I would like to request that the
 
02:36:08.690 --> 02:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
Republicans stay a few minutes so we can
 
02:36:10.849 --> 02:36:10.859 align:start position:0%
have a caucus
 
02:36:13.490 --> 02:36:13.500 align:start position:0%
good idea I was going to ask for that as
 
02:36:13.500 --> 02:36:15.530 align:start position:0%
good idea I was going to ask for that as
well

02:36:15.530 --> 02:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:36:17.929 --> 02:36:17.939 align:start position:0%
just as a point of of information for
 
02:36:19.849 --> 02:36:19.859 align:start position:0%
members of the committee representative
 
02:36:19.859 --> 02:36:21.469 align:start position:0%
members of the committee representative
lewicki

02:36:21.469 --> 02:36:21.479 align:start position:0%
lewicki
 
02:36:24.830 --> 02:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
will probably out be out for an extended
 
02:36:27.830 --> 02:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
period of time he was seriously ill
 
02:36:31.070 --> 02:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
a week ago Friday and the good news is
 
02:36:33.950 --> 02:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
he's recovering now but his recovery
 
02:36:37.250 --> 02:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
likely will be fairly extensive and he
 
02:36:39.650 --> 02:36:39.660 align:start position:0%
will need to rehab at the home of his
 
02:36:42.590 --> 02:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
daughter in Vermont so we may not see
 
02:36:43.790 --> 02:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
him for
 
02:36:45.849 --> 02:36:45.859 align:start position:0%
a while
 
02:36:49.070 --> 02:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
he is still in the hospital uh Southern
 
02:36:51.950 --> 02:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Medical Center in Nashua I
 
02:36:54.349 --> 02:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
do not have an address there yet I'm
 
02:36:55.730 --> 02:36:55.740 align:start position:0%
working on trying to get an address
 
02:36:59.389 --> 02:36:59.399 align:start position:0%
where we can send him get well cards and
 
02:37:03.170 --> 02:37:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:06.110 --> 02:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
the news on representative McGee I will
 
02:37:08.750 --> 02:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:10.610 --> 02:37:10.620 align:start position:0%
well I was going to refer defer to
 
02:37:12.290 --> 02:37:12.300 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams but I guess
 
02:37:15.790 --> 02:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
she's not here so I will tell you that
 
02:37:18.050 --> 02:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams has informed
 
02:37:20.929 --> 02:37:20.939 align:start position:0%
me that her surgery was deemed to be
 
02:37:23.510 --> 02:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
extremely successful she was released
 
02:37:25.370 --> 02:37:25.380 align:start position:0%
from the hospital last Friday which was
 
02:37:26.990 --> 02:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
two days early
 
02:37:29.210 --> 02:37:29.220 align:start position:0%
which is an encouraging sign
 
02:37:32.990 --> 02:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
so we're in our hearts and prayers we're
 
02:37:35.450 --> 02:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
wishing representative McGee all the
 
02:37:37.389 --> 02:37:37.399 align:start position:0%
best and hope to see her back here

02:37:49.550 --> 02:37:49.560 align:start position:0%

did an executive session last Friday but
 
04:32:18.889 --> 04:32:18.899 align:start position:0%
because they were noticed for today we
 
04:32:22.010 --> 04:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
have to redo them according to the clerk
 
04:32:25.010 --> 04:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
so we're going to do those two bills
 
04:32:25.020 --> 04:32:25.729 align:start position:0%

04:33:04.490 --> 04:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to summarize where we
 
04:33:05.869 --> 04:33:05.879 align:start position:0%
stand on this one
 
04:33:09.109 --> 04:33:09.119 align:start position:0%
um our our ongoing long-term testifier
 
04:33:12.650 --> 04:33:12.660 align:start position:0%
Mike Fitzgerald from Des uh requested
 
04:33:16.010 --> 04:33:16.020 align:start position:0%
this bill and he was very much in
 
04:33:18.650 --> 04:33:18.660 align:start position:0%
support of making this happen we heard
 
04:33:20.209 --> 04:33:20.219 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of excellent testimony
 
04:33:21.650 --> 04:33:21.660 align:start position:0%
about how this would streamline and
 
04:33:24.470 --> 04:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
refine the way things are handled and so
 
04:33:25.730 --> 04:33:25.740 align:start position:0%
therefore I think that this is a very
 
04:33:27.410 --> 04:33:27.420 align:start position:0%
good bill and I would agree with my
 
04:33:31.490 --> 04:33:31.500 align:start position:0%

representative McWilliams
 
04:35:59.990 --> 04:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
um well I believe that the sponsor of
 
04:36:01.910 --> 04:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
the bill was very well-meaning in trying
 
04:36:04.189 --> 04:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
to address Energy prices in this crazy
 
04:36:06.170 --> 04:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
Spike that we are all dealing with here
 
04:36:08.090 --> 04:36:08.100 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we really just couldn't
 
04:36:10.429 --> 04:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
find a way to work with the bill due to
 
04:36:12.310 --> 04:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
the nature of
 
04:36:15.590 --> 04:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
the way the pricing would be fixed and
 
04:36:19.010 --> 04:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
so therefore I recommend Ito

04:38:06.410 --> 04:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
moving right along here next up
 
04:38:09.109 --> 04:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill 139
 
04:38:11.209 --> 04:38:11.219 align:start position:0%
relative to the definition of Municipal
 
04:38:15.051 --> 04:38:15.061 align:start position:0%
host for purposes of limited electrical
 
04:38:17.689 --> 04:38:17.699 align:start position:0%
energy producers chair recognizes
 
04:38:19.789 --> 04:38:19.799 align:start position:0%
Michael Harrington
 
04:38:21.769 --> 04:38:21.779 align:start position:0%
uh you select the move uh inappropriate
 
04:38:24.230 --> 04:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
to legislate on this bill please
 
04:38:26.869 --> 04:38:26.879 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes Tom closure
 
04:38:29.330 --> 04:38:29.340 align:start position:0%
I'll second that it's been moved and
 
04:38:32.330 --> 04:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
seconded that we judge House Bill 139 to
 
04:38:34.730 --> 04:38:34.740 align:start position:0%
be itl
 
04:38:37.970 --> 04:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Harrington
 
04:38:39.709 --> 04:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
well this is another thing that we've
 
04:38:42.289 --> 04:38:42.299 align:start position:0%
continued to see uh in the expansion of
 
04:38:46.490 --> 04:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
eligibility for net metering and um
 
04:38:48.650 --> 04:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
it's just going to transfer more cost
 
04:38:50.929 --> 04:38:50.939 align:start position:0%
shifting to rate payers a lot of who I
 
04:38:52.551 --> 04:38:52.561 align:start position:0%
simply don't have the wherewithal
 
04:38:54.529 --> 04:38:54.539 align:start position:0%
facilities or whatever to put in any
 
04:38:55.970 --> 04:38:55.980 align:start position:0%
type of net metering or any type of
 
04:38:59.269 --> 04:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
generation and I think we last term we
 
04:39:02.029 --> 04:39:02.039 align:start position:0%
passed one that allowed municipals to do
 
04:39:03.769 --> 04:39:03.779 align:start position:0%
that with the idea that the cost savings
 
04:39:07.789 --> 04:39:07.799 align:start position:0%
would be uh uh realized by taxpayers
 
04:39:10.189 --> 04:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
rather than private individuals so I
 
04:39:12.109 --> 04:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
don't see any need to expand this uh
 
04:39:14.090 --> 04:39:14.100 align:start position:0%
beyond what we already have
 
04:39:22.789 --> 04:39:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:25.310 --> 04:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none I guess I'll ask the clerk
 
04:39:27.650 --> 04:39:27.660 align:start position:0%
to call the question of
 
04:39:34.429 --> 04:39:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:38.510 --> 04:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
Doug Thomas yes Denise not her yes
 
04:39:41.208 --> 04:39:41.218 align:start position:0%
Michael Harrington yes
 
04:39:45.770 --> 04:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
uh Ron Dunn yes Carol Brown yes Lex
 
04:39:50.090 --> 04:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
brajny yes JD Bernardi yes Tom closure
 
04:39:54.230 --> 04:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
yes James Summers yes Rebecca well
 
04:39:58.910 --> 04:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:01.970 --> 04:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
Joan hamblett no
 
04:40:06.948 --> 04:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
uh Marty Jack no lucious partial no
 
04:40:10.490 --> 04:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
Melanie Kaplan nope Chris muns nope
 
04:40:13.368 --> 04:40:13.378 align:start position:0%
Henry Noel no
 
04:40:18.050 --> 04:40:18.060 align:start position:0%

Ned Reynolds nope Mr chairman yes
 
04:40:26.208 --> 04:40:26.218 align:start position:0%
10 10. buy a vote of 10 to 10 the motion
 
04:40:29.448 --> 04:40:29.458 align:start position:0%
to itl fails
 
04:40:33.590 --> 04:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
and the chair judges that a motion to
 
04:40:36.708 --> 04:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
ought to pass would also fail so we will
 
04:40:38.390 --> 04:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
send this bill to the house floor
 
04:40:40.970 --> 04:40:40.980 align:start position:0%
without recommendation
 
04:40:43.970 --> 04:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington will write the
 
04:40:46.910 --> 04:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
itl position
 
04:40:48.770 --> 04:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
representative Mick Williams you have
 
04:40:51.310 --> 04:40:51.320 align:start position:0%
someone to write the OTP position
 
04:40:54.050 --> 04:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
representative Corman
 
04:40:55.730 --> 04:40:55.740 align:start position:0%
well say again please representative
 
04:40:55.740 --> 04:40:57.368 align:start position:0%
well say again please representative
Corman

04:40:57.368 --> 04:40:57.378 align:start position:0%
Corman

representative Corman
 
04:41:01.390 --> 04:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
I still can't understand
 
04:41:04.010 --> 04:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
Corman okay representative Carmen will
 
04:41:06.830 --> 04:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
write the position for uh ought to pass
 
04:41:10.310 --> 04:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
for house bill 139.
 
04:41:12.650 --> 04:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
and with that we'll close the public
 
04:41:15.230 --> 04:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
here at the executive session on House
 
04:41:18.410 --> 04:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
Bill 139.
 
04:41:20.570 --> 04:41:20.580 align:start position:0%
moving right along
 
04:41:23.448 --> 04:41:23.458 align:start position:0%
I'll open an executive session on House
 
04:41:26.868 --> 04:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
Bill 166 relative to the elimination
 
04:41:29.150 --> 04:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
of useful thermal energy from renewable
 
04:41:31.628 --> 04:41:31.638 align:start position:0%
energy classes and I recognize
 
04:41:34.970 --> 04:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas
 
04:41:38.628 --> 04:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh my recommendation is to
 
04:41:40.730 --> 04:41:40.740 align:start position:0%
retain this bill
 
04:41:42.288 --> 04:41:42.298 align:start position:0%
I recognize
 
04:41:45.288 --> 04:41:45.298 align:start position:0%
representative J.D Bernardi
 
04:41:47.270 --> 04:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
I second that motion
 
04:41:49.250 --> 04:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
it has been moved and seconded that we
 
04:41:52.670 --> 04:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
retain house bill 166.
 
04:41:54.530 --> 04:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion representative
 
04:41:54.540 --> 04:41:57.470 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion representative
Thomas

04:41:57.470 --> 04:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:00.708 --> 04:42:00.718 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I think we just uh this is a
 
04:42:03.230 --> 04:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
complicated issue we need more time and
 
04:42:07.010 --> 04:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
uh I believe that retaining it is in the
 
04:42:08.390 --> 04:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
best interest of seeing if we can come
 
04:42:10.368 --> 04:42:10.378 align:start position:0%
up with something that might be amenable
 
04:42:12.288 --> 04:42:12.298 align:start position:0%
to both sides
 
04:42:22.570 --> 04:42:22.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:25.128 --> 04:42:25.138 align:start position:0%
to call the roll on the question of
 
04:42:28.670 --> 04:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
retain for house bill 166.
 
04:42:31.010 --> 04:42:31.020 align:start position:0%

16-4

04:43:25.430 --> 04:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
16-4
 
04:43:29.570 --> 04:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
by about a 15 16 to 4.
 
04:43:32.448 --> 04:43:32.458 align:start position:0%
the committee votes to retain house bill
 
04:43:32.458 --> 04:43:34.910 align:start position:0%
the committee votes to retain house bill
166.

04:43:34.910 --> 04:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
166.
 
04:43:37.850 --> 04:43:37.860 align:start position:0%
by way of explanation which remembers
 
04:43:40.490 --> 04:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
I'll remind everyone that retain means
 
04:43:44.150 --> 04:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
that we still own this bill
 
04:43:47.448 --> 04:43:47.458 align:start position:0%
we by voting to retain
 
04:43:49.250 --> 04:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
we have to report that to the house
 
04:43:52.550 --> 04:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
clerk once that's reported we cannot
 
04:43:55.190 --> 04:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
touch this bill again until next fall
 
04:43:59.030 --> 04:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
next September at that time we can take
 
04:44:02.030 --> 04:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
it up again and issue some kind of a
 
04:44:05.810 --> 04:44:05.820 align:start position:0%
report by the
 
04:44:07.670 --> 04:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
I don't remember the exact date but some
 
04:44:10.310 --> 04:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
somewhere around November 1st
 
04:44:11.868 --> 04:44:11.878 align:start position:0%
so that's what will happen with this
 
04:44:11.878 --> 04:44:13.430 align:start position:0%
so that's what will happen with this
bill

04:44:13.430 --> 04:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:44:15.708 --> 04:44:15.718 align:start position:0%
we can form a stud study committee if we
 
04:44:17.628 --> 04:44:17.638 align:start position:0%
want to try to figure out if there's
 
04:44:21.948 --> 04:44:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:24.110 --> 04:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
and we can discuss that at a future date
 
04:44:27.830 --> 04:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
we don't have to figure that out today
 
04:44:27.840 --> 04:44:28.788 align:start position:0%
we don't have to figure that out today
um

04:44:28.788 --> 04:44:28.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:30.530 --> 04:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
we do have a fair amount of work to do
 
04:44:32.150 --> 04:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
today so
 
04:44:35.030 --> 04:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
possibly we don't want to
 
04:44:37.788 --> 04:44:37.798 align:start position:0%
well maybe we should decide that
 
04:44:37.798 --> 04:44:39.590 align:start position:0%
well maybe we should decide that
um

04:44:39.590 --> 04:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:41.390 --> 04:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
as we only have one other Bill to deal
 
04:44:44.510 --> 04:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:46.368 --> 04:44:46.378 align:start position:0%
is there any appetite for forwarding
 
04:44:49.310 --> 04:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
forming a subcommittee to study the
 
04:44:57.590 --> 04:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:59.510 --> 04:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
it would appear not
 
04:45:01.430 --> 04:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative munz
 
04:45:04.730 --> 04:45:04.740 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair I I voted
 
04:45:06.770 --> 04:45:06.780 align:start position:0%
um no to retain the bill because if I'm
 
04:45:08.930 --> 04:45:08.940 align:start position:0%
not mistaken there was a similar Bill
 
04:45:12.230 --> 04:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
introduced in the 2021 session that was
 
04:45:13.550 --> 04:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
referred to study and nothing ever
 
04:45:15.708 --> 04:45:15.718 align:start position:0%
happened with that so I'm not sure what
 
04:45:17.330 --> 04:45:17.340 align:start position:0%
we're going to accomplish by looking at
 
04:45:21.708 --> 04:45:21.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:24.050 --> 04:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
don't know that a subcommittee is going
 
04:45:24.060 --> 04:45:24.770 align:start position:0%
don't know that a subcommittee is going
to

04:45:24.770 --> 04:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:45:27.970 --> 04:45:27.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:29.990 --> 04:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative partial do you have a
 
04:45:30.000 --> 04:45:32.868 align:start position:0%
representative partial do you have a
comment

04:45:32.868 --> 04:45:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:35.750 --> 04:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
oh no oh I saw that your microphone was
 
04:45:38.868 --> 04:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:40.868 --> 04:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
representative nadles
 
04:45:46.730 --> 04:45:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:48.110 --> 04:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
all right there doesn't seem to be much
 
04:45:49.788 --> 04:45:49.798 align:start position:0%
of an appetite for forming a study
 
04:45:53.690 --> 04:45:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:55.610 --> 04:45:55.620 align:start position:0%
so I guess we're done with uh House Bill
 
04:45:59.470 --> 04:45:59.480 align:start position:0%
166 did I close the exact session
 
04:46:02.270 --> 04:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
I closed the exact session on House Bill
 
04:46:02.280 --> 04:46:03.830 align:start position:0%
I closed the exact session on House Bill
166.

04:46:03.830 --> 04:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
166.
 
04:46:05.810 --> 04:46:05.820 align:start position:0%
that leaves us with one further bill
 
04:46:08.530 --> 04:46:08.540 align:start position:0%
that's House Bill
 
04:46:12.170 --> 04:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
219-fn relative to certain Public public
 
04:46:17.330 --> 04:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:20.030 --> 04:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
so I have opened this exact session but
 
04:46:23.150 --> 04:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
I'm going to recess it because
 
04:46:26.448 --> 04:46:26.458 align:start position:0%
the rather lengthy Amendment that's
 
04:46:28.970 --> 04:46:28.980 align:start position:0%
going to be required to fix this bill
 
04:46:31.368 --> 04:46:31.378 align:start position:0%
could not be prepared in time for this
 
04:46:33.230 --> 04:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
04:46:37.250 --> 04:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
so we will resume this executive session
 
04:46:40.550 --> 04:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
at a time and date to be determined and
 
04:46:42.530 --> 04:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
to be noticed in the calendar
 
04:46:44.090 --> 04:46:44.100 align:start position:0%
and we will
 
04:46:47.510 --> 04:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
take it up then with a Amendment
 
04:46:50.330 --> 04:46:50.340 align:start position:0%
that basically reconstitutes the whole
 
04:46:53.868 --> 04:46:53.878 align:start position:0%
bill as a study committee to study each
 
04:46:55.070 --> 04:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
and every
 
04:46:58.190 --> 04:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
RSA that was listed in the original Bill
 
04:47:00.530 --> 04:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
to determine should it be repealed
 
04:47:03.128 --> 04:47:03.138 align:start position:0%
should it be Rewritten should it be
 
04:47:06.110 --> 04:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
put somewhere else in statute just
 
04:47:07.910 --> 04:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
exactly what needs to be done with it
 
04:47:10.128 --> 04:47:10.138 align:start position:0%
it's a study committee that actually has
 
04:47:11.890 --> 04:47:11.900 align:start position:0%
a real
 
04:47:16.010 --> 04:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
defined and uh
 
04:47:17.868 --> 04:47:17.878 align:start position:0%
precise purpose
 
04:47:19.670 --> 04:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
so it's a study committee whose work
 
04:47:22.490 --> 04:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
should go fairly well fairly quickly and
 
04:47:25.070 --> 04:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
fairly smoothly
 
04:47:28.610 --> 04:47:28.620 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll close no I can't close
 
04:47:30.708 --> 04:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
it I got it it's recessed so I can't
 
04:47:32.750 --> 04:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
close that executive session it remains
 
04:47:35.330 --> 04:47:35.340 align:start position:0%
open until a future date
 
04:47:37.310 --> 04:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
so we're done we got through this faster
 
04:47:39.110 --> 04:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
than I thought we would
 
04:47:43.368 --> 04:47:43.378 align:start position:0%
and we now have 45 minutes to kill while
 
04:47:45.050 --> 04:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
we wait for the next public hearing
 
04:47:46.910 --> 04:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
 
04:47:50.270 --> 04:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
question uh yes Mr chair uh just a
 
04:47:54.050 --> 04:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
comment here for those uh we I know that
 
04:47:57.350 --> 04:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
last week we talked about HP 81 which
 
04:48:00.170 --> 04:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
was the propane gas bill and so we
 
04:48:02.810 --> 04:48:02.820 align:start position:0%
formed the subcommittee and so my
 
04:48:05.990 --> 04:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
question is is uh my first availability
 
04:48:10.550 --> 04:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
would be next Wednesday at 1 pm we can
 
04:48:12.410 --> 04:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
have a subcommittee we are currently
 
04:48:14.990 --> 04:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
searching for which room here to use but
 
04:48:17.510 --> 04:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
if the people that were named on the
 
04:48:19.070 --> 04:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee last week if they could get
 
04:48:21.110 --> 04:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
back to me and let me know that they can
 
04:48:22.610 --> 04:48:22.620 align:start position:0%
make that I can't make the morning I
 
04:48:24.530 --> 04:48:24.540 align:start position:0%
have a doctor's appointment but in the
 
04:48:26.868 --> 04:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
afternoon one o'clock would work
 
04:48:30.410 --> 04:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
uh so just let me know okay I got one
 
04:48:32.030 --> 04:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
thumbs up there
 
04:48:34.250 --> 04:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
two thumbs up
 
04:48:37.868 --> 04:48:37.878 align:start position:0%
a waiver a
 
04:48:42.788 --> 04:48:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:47.270 --> 04:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:49.970 --> 04:48:49.980 align:start position:0%
and uh just because we have people named
 
04:48:51.530 --> 04:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
on the subcommittee does not mean that
 
04:48:53.150 --> 04:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
the rest of you cannot attend you're
 
04:48:55.250 --> 04:48:55.260 align:start position:0%
certainly welcome to come
 
04:48:55.260 --> 04:48:56.150 align:start position:0%
certainly welcome to come
um

04:48:56.150 --> 04:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:58.430 --> 04:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
if you want to add Mr chair no
 
04:49:01.430 --> 04:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
now that sounds great we I am I was told

uh just before coming in here this this
 
04:49:06.890 --> 04:49:06.900 align:start position:0%
afternoon I was told that uh at that
 
04:49:10.550 --> 04:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee AmeriGas will be flying
 
04:49:13.570 --> 04:49:13.580 align:start position:0%

anyone else but
 
04:49:26.230 --> 04:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
that much
 
04:49:29.090 --> 04:49:29.100 align:start position:0%

2 30 for a public hearing on House Bill
257.

04:49:37.670 --> 04:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
257.
 
05:31:51.770 --> 05:31:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:54.170 --> 05:31:54.180 align:start position:0%

welcome representative chairman Vose as
 
05:32:04.850 --> 05:32:04.860 align:start position:0%

05:32:07.368 --> 05:32:07.378 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chairman good
 
05:32:09.530 --> 05:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
afternoon again members of the committee
 
05:32:11.270 --> 05:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
for the record representative Michael
 
05:32:14.750 --> 05:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
Vose representing Rockingham District 5
 
05:32:17.510 --> 05:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
the town of Epping
 
05:32:20.750 --> 05:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
I'm here this afternoon to introduce
 
05:32:23.270 --> 05:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
house bill 257.
 
05:32:25.490 --> 05:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
and those of you who were on this
 
05:32:27.230 --> 05:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
committee last year will recognize the
 
05:32:29.930 --> 05:32:29.940 align:start position:0%
title of this bill which is to relative
 
05:32:29.940 --> 05:32:31.448 align:start position:0%
title of this bill which is to relative
to

05:32:31.448 --> 05:32:31.458 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:32:34.850 --> 05:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
relieving carriers of their carrier of
 
05:32:36.948 --> 05:32:36.958 align:start position:0%
Last Resort obligation
 
05:32:39.230 --> 05:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
it was a bill that passed this committee
 
05:32:43.250 --> 05:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
and the house last year but then ran
 
05:32:46.010 --> 05:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
into roadblocks in the Senate
 
05:32:46.020 --> 05:32:49.730 align:start position:0%
into roadblocks in the Senate
and

05:32:49.730 --> 05:32:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:52.310 --> 05:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
the common wisdom is that circumstances
 
05:32:55.310 --> 05:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
have changed a bit since last year and
 
05:32:57.590 --> 05:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
so we're submitting this bill again in
 
05:33:00.530 --> 05:33:00.540 align:start position:0%
the hopes that this year it will
 
05:33:05.150 --> 05:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
meet with a more favorable reception
 
05:33:07.430 --> 05:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it continues the
 
05:33:10.070 --> 05:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
process of the deregulation of the
 
05:33:13.788 --> 05:33:13.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:17.448 --> 05:33:17.458 align:start position:0%
as you are no doubt well aware
 
05:33:19.670 --> 05:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
much of the telephone industry was
 
05:33:21.770 --> 05:33:21.780 align:start position:0%
heavily regulated
 
05:33:25.430 --> 05:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
back before 1970 1996 when the
 
05:33:28.448 --> 05:33:28.458 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications Act opened the
 
05:33:32.628 --> 05:33:32.638 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications Market to competition
 
05:33:32.638 --> 05:33:34.070 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications Market to competition
and

05:33:34.070 --> 05:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:33:34.080 --> 05:33:35.690 align:start position:0%
and
that

05:33:35.690 --> 05:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:33:38.330 --> 05:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
free market competition has led to much
 
05:33:40.610 --> 05:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
lower prices and much greater services
 
05:33:44.390 --> 05:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
in telecommunications and the years
 
05:33:49.368 --> 05:33:49.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:52.310 --> 05:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
the carrier of Last Resort obligation
 
05:33:55.850 --> 05:33:55.860 align:start position:0%
actually dates back to like 1934. the
 
05:33:58.550 --> 05:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
communications Act of that year
 
05:34:01.128 --> 05:34:01.138 align:start position:0%
regulated landline companies those were
 
05:34:03.288 --> 05:34:03.298 align:start position:0%
the only companies that were available
 
05:34:05.750 --> 05:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
then and they were given Monopoly
 
05:34:07.550 --> 05:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
territories just like utilities are
 
05:34:12.170 --> 05:34:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:14.150 --> 05:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
and back then
 
05:34:16.430 --> 05:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
the telephone companies received Federal
 
05:34:19.970 --> 05:34:19.980 align:start position:0%
subsidies to make sure that everybody
 
05:34:22.190 --> 05:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
had access to
 
05:34:24.288 --> 05:34:24.298 align:start position:0%
telephone service
 
05:34:27.170 --> 05:34:27.180 align:start position:0%
while those Federal subsidies of long
 
05:34:29.628 --> 05:34:29.638 align:start position:0%
since ceased
 
05:34:32.030 --> 05:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
they went away with the 1996
 
05:34:34.670 --> 05:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications Act
 
05:34:37.368 --> 05:34:37.378 align:start position:0%
but the carrier of Last Resort
 
05:34:37.378 --> 05:34:39.288 align:start position:0%
but the carrier of Last Resort
obligation

05:34:39.288 --> 05:34:39.298 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
05:34:42.170 --> 05:34:42.180 align:start position:0%
still resides with landline telephone
 
05:34:43.868 --> 05:34:43.878 align:start position:0%
companies even though they receive no
 
05:34:48.590 --> 05:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
help in paying to make those to secure
 
05:34:53.570 --> 05:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:55.850 --> 05:34:55.860 align:start position:0%
there aren't a lot of these companies
 
05:34:58.430 --> 05:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
left in New Hampshire but there are a
 
05:35:01.070 --> 05:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
few several I guess and they're small
 
05:35:03.830 --> 05:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
They don't serve many customers
 
05:35:06.170 --> 05:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
but the carrier of Last Resort
 
05:35:09.830 --> 05:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
obligation does put a fairly significant
 
05:35:16.550 --> 05:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:18.470 --> 05:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
and if we don't remove this carrier of
 
05:35:21.410 --> 05:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
Last Resort obligation we may lose even
 
05:35:22.850 --> 05:35:22.860 align:start position:0%
more of these companies than we've
 
05:35:25.910 --> 05:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:28.430 --> 05:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
so that's why I think it's imperative
 
05:35:31.430 --> 05:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
that we seriously consider how we can
 
05:35:33.650 --> 05:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
how we can make this happen now the
 
05:35:36.590 --> 05:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
legislation that is before you today is
 
05:35:38.570 --> 05:35:38.580 align:start position:0%
virtually identical to the legislation
 
05:35:41.030 --> 05:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
that passed last year
 
05:35:42.830 --> 05:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
and there may be a couple of tweaks that
 
05:35:46.190 --> 05:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
can be made to it to make it
 
05:35:49.128 --> 05:35:49.138 align:start position:0%
more acceptable to everyone
 
05:35:51.288 --> 05:35:51.298 align:start position:0%
because ultimately the goal here is to
 
05:35:54.050 --> 05:35:54.060 align:start position:0%
make sure that no person who lives in
 
05:35:57.230 --> 05:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:00.530 --> 05:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
doesn't have access to at least 9-1-1
 
05:36:00.540 --> 05:36:02.150 align:start position:0%
doesn't have access to at least 9-1-1
service

05:36:02.150 --> 05:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
service
 
05:36:04.628 --> 05:36:04.638 align:start position:0%
obviously 911
 
05:36:07.128 --> 05:36:07.138 align:start position:0%
saving service and so we want to make
 
05:36:08.448 --> 05:36:08.458 align:start position:0%
sure everybody in New Hampshire has
 
05:36:11.510 --> 05:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
access to that service
 
05:36:14.390 --> 05:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
but the reality is that in this this day
 
05:36:16.610 --> 05:36:16.620 align:start position:0%
and age of cell phones in this day and
 
05:36:20.868 --> 05:36:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:25.010 --> 05:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
activity including uh voice over IP
 
05:36:28.670 --> 05:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
internet telephone service
 
05:36:30.470 --> 05:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
there are very few people in our state
 
05:36:33.170 --> 05:36:33.180 align:start position:0%
who don't have access to telephone
 
05:36:33.180 --> 05:36:35.868 align:start position:0%
who don't have access to telephone
Communications

05:36:35.868 --> 05:36:35.878 align:start position:0%
Communications
 
05:36:38.208 --> 05:36:38.218 align:start position:0%
and as you'll read the text of the bill
 
05:36:40.850 --> 05:36:40.860 align:start position:0%
the bill provides that this carrier of
 
05:36:44.150 --> 05:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
Last Resort obligation cannot be
 
05:36:48.708 --> 05:36:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:52.850 --> 05:36:52.860 align:start position:0%
an area has substantial coverage from
 
05:36:55.128 --> 05:36:55.138 align:start position:0%
these other kinds of telecommunication
 
05:36:55.138 --> 05:36:58.490 align:start position:0%
these other kinds of telecommunication
services

05:36:58.490 --> 05:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:00.288 --> 05:37:00.298 align:start position:0%
so that's my introduction to the bill
 
05:37:02.208 --> 05:37:02.218 align:start position:0%
there are people who will testify after
 
05:37:04.610 --> 05:37:04.620 align:start position:0%
me that will give you more detail
 
05:37:04.620 --> 05:37:05.810 align:start position:0%
me that will give you more detail
on

05:37:05.810 --> 05:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:37:09.170 --> 05:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
various aspects of the legislation
 
05:37:10.970 --> 05:37:10.980 align:start position:0%
I'm going to wrap it up for now and take
 
05:37:12.590 --> 05:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee and
 
05:37:15.110 --> 05:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
then we'll move along
 
05:37:16.850 --> 05:37:16.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:37:19.310 --> 05:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
representative Vose I'm going to make a
 
05:37:21.650 --> 05:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
statement uh this is a simply worded
 
05:37:23.628 --> 05:37:23.638 align:start position:0%
bill I would like to have questions
 
05:37:27.050 --> 05:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
asked pertaining to the Bill's Mechanics
 
05:37:30.170 --> 05:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
or things that clarify the bill if you
 
05:37:32.090 --> 05:37:32.100 align:start position:0%
will please thank you I'll start with
 
05:37:34.368 --> 05:37:34.378 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas
 
05:37:36.050 --> 05:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:37:38.330 --> 05:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
um clarifying the bill on lines three
 
05:37:40.310 --> 05:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
and four it says relieved of its carrier
 
05:37:42.350 --> 05:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
of Last Resort obligation in one or more
 
05:37:46.010 --> 05:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
municipalities my question is are they
 
05:37:47.750 --> 05:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
relieved of the obligation for the
 
05:37:49.788 --> 05:37:49.798 align:start position:0%
entire municipality or is this on a
 
05:37:55.010 --> 05:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:57.170 --> 05:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
not sure I can ask answer that question
 
05:37:59.208 --> 05:37:59.218 align:start position:0%
but there are people behind me who can
 
05:38:02.030 --> 05:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you hold on to it
 
05:38:04.610 --> 05:38:04.620 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan
 
05:38:07.070 --> 05:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr
 
05:38:09.708 --> 05:38:09.718 align:start position:0%
standing or sitting chair and uh thanks
 
05:38:12.170 --> 05:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
for taking my question Mr chair um I'm
 
05:38:14.270 --> 05:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
just curious what this went to interim
 
05:38:17.810 --> 05:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:20.510 --> 05:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
I don't remember exactly how the Senate
 
05:38:22.970 --> 05:38:22.980 align:start position:0%
disposed of it but it did not become law
 
05:38:25.430 --> 05:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
that I know but did they make do you
 
05:38:26.990 --> 05:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
know if they made the following a
 
05:38:29.448 --> 05:38:29.458 align:start position:0%
follow-up sorry did they have
 
05:38:31.550 --> 05:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations from any interim study
 
05:38:37.670 --> 05:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:39.948 --> 05:38:39.958 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter
 
05:38:42.650 --> 05:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm trying to remember from
 
05:38:45.350 --> 05:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
last term did um the commissioner of
 
05:38:47.628 --> 05:38:47.638 align:start position:0%
safety Mark Doyle come and testify for
 
05:38:49.128 --> 05:38:49.138 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:38:50.570 --> 05:38:50.580 align:start position:0%
you recall
 
05:38:56.208 --> 05:38:56.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:59.150 --> 05:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi
 
05:39:01.970 --> 05:39:01.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Mr chair do you have
 
05:39:04.730 --> 05:39:04.740 align:start position:0%
a number or approximate number of how
 
05:39:08.628 --> 05:39:08.638 align:start position:0%
many individuals may be affected by this
 
05:39:10.970 --> 05:39:10.980 align:start position:0%
I don't but I suspect that the people
 
05:39:12.770 --> 05:39:12.780 align:start position:0%
who would testify after me will have
 
05:39:14.750 --> 05:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
that number thank you or be able to
 
05:39:16.850 --> 05:39:16.860 align:start position:0%
estimate it
 
05:39:18.590 --> 05:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
see no more questions thank you very
 
05:39:20.330 --> 05:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony
 
05:39:23.750 --> 05:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
chairman Vos and I will call on Amanda
 
05:39:27.050 --> 05:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
Noonan to the stand
 
05:39:40.910 --> 05:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:42.350 --> 05:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:39:42.360 --> 05:39:43.788 align:start position:0%
thank you
better

05:39:43.788 --> 05:39:43.798 align:start position:0%
better
 
05:39:46.190 --> 05:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
good afternoon all thank you for the
 
05:39:48.050 --> 05:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the Department to make
 
05:39:50.770 --> 05:39:50.780 align:start position:0%
some comments on this legislation as
 
05:39:52.970 --> 05:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
representative Bose noted this
 
05:39:55.128 --> 05:39:55.138 align:start position:0%
legislation was also introduced last
 
05:39:57.708 --> 05:39:57.718 align:start position:0%
year the Department's comments are
 
05:39:59.750 --> 05:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
consistent with our testimony from last
 
05:39:59.760 --> 05:40:00.910 align:start position:0%
consistent with our testimony from last
year

05:40:00.910 --> 05:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:40:04.010 --> 05:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
this is certainly a policy decision for
 
05:40:05.510 --> 05:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature and the department
 
05:40:08.990 --> 05:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a position on this bill we
 
05:40:11.650 --> 05:40:11.660 align:start position:0%
do have a few observations and potential
 
05:40:14.570 --> 05:40:14.580 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences perhaps that
 
05:40:18.470 --> 05:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:20.208 --> 05:40:20.218 align:start position:0%
um I think as you've heard has proposed
 
05:40:22.448 --> 05:40:22.458 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow an incumbent
 
05:40:25.310 --> 05:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
telecommunications provider to petition
 
05:40:27.708 --> 05:40:27.718 align:start position:0%
the department of energy to relieve it
 
05:40:29.030 --> 05:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
of its carrier of Last Resort
 
05:40:31.250 --> 05:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
obligations in one or more
 
05:40:31.260 --> 05:40:32.868 align:start position:0%
obligations in one or more
municipalities

05:40:32.868 --> 05:40:32.878 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
05:40:39.350 --> 05:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:42.410 --> 05:40:42.420 align:start position:0%
should the department receive a petition
 
05:40:45.590 --> 05:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
to this effect it's well prior to the
 
05:40:47.270 --> 05:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
department receiving a petition to this
 
05:40:48.708 --> 05:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
effect it's likely that we would
 
05:40:51.170 --> 05:40:51.180 align:start position:0%
undertake some rulemaking to determine
 
05:40:53.330 --> 05:40:53.340 align:start position:0%
what the right procedure would be if we
 
05:40:55.070 --> 05:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
received one of these petitions for
 
05:40:55.080 --> 05:40:56.208 align:start position:0%
received one of these petitions for
relief

05:40:56.208 --> 05:40:56.218 align:start position:0%
relief
 
05:40:59.208 --> 05:40:59.218 align:start position:0%
there's two possible paths for that
 
05:41:01.090 --> 05:41:01.100 align:start position:0%
rulemaking to follow
 
05:41:04.128 --> 05:41:04.138 align:start position:0%
one would just be Reliance on any
 
05:41:07.430 --> 05:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
certification provided by the
 
05:41:09.470 --> 05:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications provider that they've
 
05:41:11.628 --> 05:41:11.638 align:start position:0%
complied with the Bill's criteria
 
05:41:14.330 --> 05:41:14.340 align:start position:0%
the second would be a path where there's
 
05:41:16.788 --> 05:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
independent review and Analysis of the
 
05:41:19.610 --> 05:41:19.620 align:start position:0%
data provided by the incumbent carrier
 
05:41:21.970 --> 05:41:21.980 align:start position:0%
the department would most likely require
 
05:41:25.628 --> 05:41:25.638 align:start position:0%
consultant services to carry out that
 
05:41:30.368 --> 05:41:30.378 align:start position:0%
independent review to ensure that the
 
05:41:32.930 --> 05:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
requirements of 95 percent of the
 
05:41:35.270 --> 05:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
households having access to one or more
 
05:41:38.288 --> 05:41:38.298 align:start position:0%
mobile service providers or sorry to
 
05:41:41.330 --> 05:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
other competitive providers or 97
 
05:41:43.670 --> 05:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
percent having access to one or more
 
05:41:46.970 --> 05:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
mobile service providers are met
 
05:41:50.090 --> 05:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
or that there was another provider that
 
05:41:52.128 --> 05:41:52.138 align:start position:0%
had received federal state or Municipal
 
05:41:55.910 --> 05:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
funds to serve the entire community
 
05:41:58.368 --> 05:41:58.378 align:start position:0%
those costs of a consultant would be
 
05:41:59.930 --> 05:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
assessed most likely against the
 
05:42:03.890 --> 05:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:07.070 --> 05:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
so there'd be no cost to the to the
 
05:42:09.530 --> 05:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
state or to the general fund
 
05:42:12.650 --> 05:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
um as representative Bose noted the
 
05:42:14.390 --> 05:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications industry in New
 
05:42:16.550 --> 05:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is primarily deregulated and
 
05:42:19.550 --> 05:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
has been for some period of time
 
05:42:21.650 --> 05:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
um competition has provided a number of
 
05:42:24.708 --> 05:42:24.718 align:start position:0%
Alternatives and lower costs for
 
05:42:24.718 --> 05:42:26.510 align:start position:0%
Alternatives and lower costs for
customers

05:42:26.510 --> 05:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
customers
 
05:42:28.788 --> 05:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
and while competition among
 
05:42:31.128 --> 05:42:31.138 align:start position:0%
telecommunication providers is fairly
 
05:42:33.910 --> 05:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
robust in some areas of New Hampshire
 
05:42:37.910 --> 05:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
cities larger municipalities towns where
 
05:42:40.490 --> 05:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
there's a more denser a better
 
05:42:42.310 --> 05:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
population density
 
05:42:45.288 --> 05:42:45.298 align:start position:0%
many rural areas of the state don't have
 
05:42:47.270 --> 05:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
the same level of access to service
 
05:42:50.390 --> 05:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
providers into options and alternatives
 
05:42:53.208 --> 05:42:53.218 align:start position:0%
those rural areas due to their geography
 
05:42:56.448 --> 05:42:56.458 align:start position:0%
are most likely less likely to have
 
05:42:59.990 --> 05:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
ubiquitous wireless service as we've all
 
05:43:01.610 --> 05:43:01.620 align:start position:0%
experienced the frustrations of
 
05:43:02.930 --> 05:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
traveling throughout the state and
 
05:43:06.708 --> 05:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
having no coverage on our cell phones
 
05:43:09.948 --> 05:43:09.958 align:start position:0%
the carry of Last Resort the incumbent
 
05:43:12.288 --> 05:43:12.298 align:start position:0%
telecommunications Services obligation
 
05:43:14.990 --> 05:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
to provide service to provide landline
 
05:43:17.570 --> 05:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
service to those customers provides
 
05:43:19.910 --> 05:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
those folks with access to essential
 
05:43:25.628 --> 05:43:25.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:29.330 --> 05:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
while this bill would allow the care of
 
05:43:32.868 --> 05:43:32.878 align:start position:0%
last the incumbent provider to be
 
05:43:34.788 --> 05:43:34.798 align:start position:0%
relieved of its carrier of Last Resort
 
05:43:34.798 --> 05:43:36.708 align:start position:0%
relieved of its carrier of Last Resort
obligation

05:43:36.708 --> 05:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
05:43:38.570 --> 05:43:38.580 align:start position:0%
if the department found that the
 
05:43:41.270 --> 05:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate criteria were met there are
 
05:43:44.030 --> 05:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
no other criteria in the bill regarding
 
05:43:46.850 --> 05:43:46.860 align:start position:0%
service availability or any requirement
 
05:43:49.548 --> 05:43:49.558 align:start position:0%
to serve all customers in a given area
 
05:43:49.558 --> 05:43:51.590 align:start position:0%
to serve all customers in a given area
and

05:43:51.590 --> 05:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:43:53.690 --> 05:43:53.700 align:start position:0%
if you think about cell phone coverage
 
05:43:56.570 --> 05:43:56.580 align:start position:0%
for example it's an area where we're
 
05:43:58.190 --> 05:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
concerned that the bill could lead to
 
05:44:00.770 --> 05:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
some percentage of households being
 
05:44:03.048 --> 05:44:03.058 align:start position:0%
unable to access essential communication
 
05:44:06.110 --> 05:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
services such as emergency services
 
05:44:10.310 --> 05:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
medical services customers that rely on
 
05:44:13.548 --> 05:44:13.558 align:start position:0%
their landline service to provide data
 
05:44:16.490 --> 05:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
to a physician about their their medical
 
05:44:16.500 --> 05:44:19.850 align:start position:0%
to a physician about their their medical
condition

05:44:19.850 --> 05:44:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:22.548 --> 05:44:22.558 align:start position:0%
similarly an incumbent can request
 
05:44:25.430 --> 05:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
relief if there's a provider that's
 
05:44:28.128 --> 05:44:28.138 align:start position:0%
received state or federal or Municipal
 
05:44:31.010 --> 05:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
funding to serve the entire municipality
 
05:44:33.650 --> 05:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
but there's no discussion about what
 
05:44:35.810 --> 05:44:35.820 align:start position:0%
that service is and whether it would be
 
05:44:38.030 --> 05:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
landlines or not landline service but
 
05:44:40.190 --> 05:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
phone service traditional phone service
 
05:44:43.368 --> 05:44:43.378 align:start position:0%
or VoIP phone service some sort of voice
 
05:44:45.948 --> 05:44:45.958 align:start position:0%
service or if it's simply a broadband
 
05:44:48.890 --> 05:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
service that wouldn't provide actual
 
05:44:52.610 --> 05:44:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:54.830 --> 05:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
I think most importantly the the
 
05:44:57.048 --> 05:44:57.058 align:start position:0%
criteria for permitting an incumbent
 
05:44:59.930 --> 05:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
carrier to be relieved of its care of
 
05:45:02.990 --> 05:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
last resort obligation is based on the
 
05:45:06.230 --> 05:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
competitive land landscape at a single
 
05:45:07.610 --> 05:45:07.620 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
05:45:10.970 --> 05:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
and that landscape changes and it could
 
05:45:14.330 --> 05:45:14.340 align:start position:0%
be whatever conditions are pushing an
 
05:45:17.090 --> 05:45:17.100 align:start position:0%
incumbent provider to ask for relief
 
05:45:18.590 --> 05:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
from its carrier of Last Resort
 
05:45:21.530 --> 05:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
obligations may also
 
05:45:24.368 --> 05:45:24.378 align:start position:0%
result in that provider
 
05:45:26.750 --> 05:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
reducing some of its services or
 
05:45:29.448 --> 05:45:29.458 align:start position:0%
discontinuing some of its services and
 
05:45:31.788 --> 05:45:31.798 align:start position:0%
those same circumstances that drive it
 
05:45:34.250 --> 05:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
to do that may drive other providers in
 
05:45:36.948 --> 05:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
that area to reduce or discontinue
 
05:45:39.890 --> 05:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
services without that carrier flash
 
05:45:42.770 --> 05:45:42.780 align:start position:0%
Resort obligation you risk having big
 
05:45:44.930 --> 05:45:44.940 align:start position:0%
pockets of a community potentially
 
05:45:47.090 --> 05:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
without access to telecommunications
 
05:45:47.100 --> 05:45:50.030 align:start position:0%
without access to telecommunications
services

05:45:50.030 --> 05:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:50.040 --> 05:45:50.868 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:45:50.868 --> 05:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:53.570 --> 05:45:53.580 align:start position:0%
I understand no one wants to see
 
05:45:55.548 --> 05:45:55.558 align:start position:0%
customers in the State lose access to
 
05:45:58.730 --> 05:45:58.740 align:start position:0%
essential services and I I think there
 
05:46:01.430 --> 05:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
are some pitfalls to avoid if you look
 
05:46:03.230 --> 05:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
at moving forward with this bill and
 
05:46:05.270 --> 05:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
hopefully that helps you identify some
 
05:46:08.930 --> 05:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
of them and happy to ask answer I don't
 
05:46:10.610 --> 05:46:10.620 align:start position:0%
have to ask but happy to answer any
 
05:46:14.350 --> 05:46:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:17.570 --> 05:46:17.580 align:start position:0%
representative Corman please
 
05:46:20.448 --> 05:46:20.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:46:21.708 --> 05:46:21.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:46:25.310 --> 05:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
so I am concerned about people who don't
 
05:46:28.368 --> 05:46:28.378 align:start position:0%
have access to wireless service also
 
05:46:32.030 --> 05:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
losing the capability for landline one
 
05:46:34.910 --> 05:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
concern I would have just is defining
 
05:46:37.190 --> 05:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
who has wireless service because just
 
05:46:39.410 --> 05:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
because you have a Wireless contract
 
05:46:41.510 --> 05:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean you have service at your
 
05:46:43.490 --> 05:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
home but the real question that I have
 
05:46:44.750 --> 05:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
for you is
 
05:46:47.930 --> 05:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
do we have a way to determine how many
 
05:46:49.670 --> 05:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
people are in this situation I don't
 
05:46:50.990 --> 05:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
expect that you have that number now but
 
05:46:56.510 --> 05:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:58.850 --> 05:46:58.860 align:start position:0%
some time ago the Federal Communications
 
05:47:03.470 --> 05:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
Commission authorized some studies about
 
05:47:06.350 --> 05:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
how ubiquitous wireless coverage was and
 
05:47:09.350 --> 05:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
whether that coverage matched the maps
 
05:47:11.930 --> 05:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
of the service providers it would need
 
05:47:15.368 --> 05:47:15.378 align:start position:0%
to take a look at that study it was
 
05:47:15.378 --> 05:47:17.288 align:start position:0%
to take a look at that study it was
perhaps

05:47:17.288 --> 05:47:17.298 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
05:47:21.530 --> 05:47:21.540 align:start position:0%
2015 16 17 time frame to see if there
 
05:47:23.628 --> 05:47:23.638 align:start position:0%
was some um
 
05:47:25.788 --> 05:47:25.798 align:start position:0%
formula or analysis in there for
 
05:47:32.690 --> 05:47:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:34.490 --> 05:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
Riverside months
 
05:47:37.190 --> 05:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:47:39.350 --> 05:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question just to follow up on
 
05:47:42.590 --> 05:47:42.600 align:start position:0%
representative Corman so in the bill it
 
05:47:44.810 --> 05:47:44.820 align:start position:0%
you know sets some some
 
05:47:47.750 --> 05:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
um some thresholds 95 percent
 
05:47:47.760 --> 05:47:48.410 align:start position:0%
um some thresholds 95 percent
um

05:47:48.410 --> 05:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:47:51.830 --> 05:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
and 97 for various types of service so
 
05:47:54.530 --> 05:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
do we do we know what the what that
 
05:47:57.170 --> 05:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
number is right now for each
 
05:47:57.180 --> 05:47:59.330 align:start position:0%
number is right now for each
municipality

05:47:59.330 --> 05:47:59.340 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
05:48:01.190 --> 05:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
we at the department don't have that
 
05:48:03.288 --> 05:48:03.298 align:start position:0%
information no
 
05:48:06.650 --> 05:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
it's a follow-up follow-up so is that
 
05:48:09.048 --> 05:48:09.058 align:start position:0%
part of the study that you're suggesting
 
05:48:11.570 --> 05:48:11.580 align:start position:0%
that the that the the department would
 
05:48:13.610 --> 05:48:13.620 align:start position:0%
have to do if this went forward as part
 
05:48:15.470 --> 05:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
of the rulemaking
 
05:48:18.170 --> 05:48:18.180 align:start position:0%
that's exactly right if we received a
 
05:48:20.510 --> 05:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
petition and we're going to do an
 
05:48:22.490 --> 05:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
independent review and Analysis of the
 
05:48:25.070 --> 05:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
data that is part of the study we'd have
 
05:48:30.170 --> 05:48:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:32.330 --> 05:48:32.340 align:start position:0%
representative Winnie Thomas
 
05:48:34.070 --> 05:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
05:48:35.570 --> 05:48:35.580 align:start position:0%
um do you have an idea of the cost
 
05:48:37.730 --> 05:48:37.740 align:start position:0%
savings by telephone utilities if they
 
05:48:41.628 --> 05:48:41.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:45.170 --> 05:48:45.180 align:start position:0%
I do not telephone providers have been
 
05:48:47.930 --> 05:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
deregulated for rates for
 
05:48:51.650 --> 05:48:51.660 align:start position:0%
10 plus years so I would have no way of
 
05:48:54.410 --> 05:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
knowing what that cost might be okay I
 
05:48:56.030 --> 05:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
suspect they can tell you and we'll tell
 
05:48:58.490 --> 05:48:58.500 align:start position:0%
you later okay thank you
 
05:49:00.410 --> 05:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you see no questions so thank you
 
05:49:04.548 --> 05:49:04.558 align:start position:0%
for your testimony and we'll move on I'm
 
05:49:06.288 --> 05:49:06.298 align:start position:0%
not sure I can get this last name
 
05:49:13.310 --> 05:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:13.320 --> 05:49:18.770 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:49:18.770 --> 05:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:22.030 --> 05:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
and just for my record
 
05:49:26.690 --> 05:49:26.700 align:start position:0%
am I uh there am I on now great uh I'm
 
05:49:28.970 --> 05:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
Theresa Rosenberger and I apologize for
 
05:49:30.948 --> 05:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
the bad handwriting
 
05:49:33.708 --> 05:49:33.718 align:start position:0%
um and I'm here representing the New
 
05:49:35.868 --> 05:49:35.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire telephone Association and I I
 
05:49:38.690 --> 05:49:38.700 align:start position:0%
work for Bernstein sure uh the New
 
05:49:41.270 --> 05:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire telephone Association are the
 
05:49:44.448 --> 05:49:44.458 align:start position:0%
old Ma Bell companies and
 
05:49:48.770 --> 05:49:48.780 align:start position:0%
um they are at the moment uh Bretton
 
05:49:51.190 --> 05:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
Woods telephone Dunbarton telephone
 
05:49:54.350 --> 05:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
Granite State telephone TDS telephone
 
05:49:57.650 --> 05:49:57.660 align:start position:0%
which is the old Wilton Hollis Etc and
 
05:49:59.990 --> 05:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
Consolidated Communications years ago we
 
05:50:02.990 --> 05:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
also had dixville telephone but as
 
05:50:05.270 --> 05:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
Amanda Noonan knows it took years and
 
05:50:07.430 --> 05:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
dixville was dissolved because they only
 
05:50:09.548 --> 05:50:09.558 align:start position:0%
had five customers
 
05:50:12.430 --> 05:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
but it took years
 
05:50:16.310 --> 05:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
so the old mobile companies as
 
05:50:19.190 --> 05:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative Bose said back in 1934
 
05:50:21.830 --> 05:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
where the communications act they were
 
05:50:24.368 --> 05:50:24.378 align:start position:0%
awarded monopolies they were awarded
 
05:50:27.470 --> 05:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
territories these territories do not
 
05:50:29.750 --> 05:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily which is maybe going to
 
05:50:32.330 --> 05:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
answer your question follow Town lines
 
05:50:35.930 --> 05:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
they were territory so you have for
 
05:50:39.490 --> 05:50:39.500 align:start position:0%
example over in Plainfield you have
 
05:50:43.310 --> 05:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
Consolidated and TDS so they are both in
 
05:50:45.948 --> 05:50:45.958 align:start position:0%
the town and in other towns you have
 
05:50:49.128 --> 05:50:49.138 align:start position:0%
them just one one carry it just depended
 
05:50:52.430 --> 05:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
on how way back in almost 30 years 100
 
05:50:55.610 --> 05:50:55.620 align:start position:0%
years ago they divvied up the map so
 
05:50:57.590 --> 05:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
these are your old mobile companies your
 
05:50:59.628 --> 05:50:59.638 align:start position:0%
monopolies when they were given their
 
05:51:01.730 --> 05:51:01.740 align:start position:0%
Monopoly they were required to have
 
05:51:05.750 --> 05:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
quote duty to serve all the territory so
 
05:51:08.150 --> 05:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
if you awarded the Monopoly for Concord
 
05:51:11.990 --> 05:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
you had to serve all of Concord not just
 
05:51:16.030 --> 05:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
here but all of conquered then back in
 
05:51:18.530 --> 05:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
1996 the feds passed the
 
05:51:22.010 --> 05:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications Act of 96 and the
 
05:51:24.048 --> 05:51:24.058 align:start position:0%
goal of that was to bring in competition
 
05:51:26.390 --> 05:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
you were beginning to have wireless you
 
05:51:27.770 --> 05:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
were beginning to have all these other
 
05:51:30.770 --> 05:51:30.780 align:start position:0%
Technologies well let me just say it has
 
05:51:33.490 --> 05:51:33.500 align:start position:0%
worked and it has worked wonderfully
 
05:51:37.150 --> 05:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
there's competition now across the board
 
05:51:40.010 --> 05:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
you've even got today not just
 
05:51:42.048 --> 05:51:42.058 align:start position:0%
telecommunications companies you've got
 
05:51:43.730 --> 05:51:43.740 align:start position:0%
municipalities you've got electric
 
05:51:46.270 --> 05:51:46.280 align:start position:0%
co-ops you've certainly got Wireless
 
05:51:49.990 --> 05:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
landline voice satellite so you've got
 
05:51:54.048 --> 05:51:54.058 align:start position:0%
competition across the board I will say
 
05:51:57.708 --> 05:51:57.718 align:start position:0%
also one of the goals of competition was
 
05:51:59.750 --> 05:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
to bring down the rates and I will say I
 
05:52:00.948 --> 05:52:00.958 align:start position:0%
was in the house Ways and Means
 
05:52:02.990 --> 05:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
Committee last week and there was a
 
05:52:04.910 --> 05:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
question why is the communication
 
05:52:08.510 --> 05:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
Services tax revenue going down
 
05:52:10.510 --> 05:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
because the rates are going down
 
05:52:13.610 --> 05:52:13.620 align:start position:0%
competition is in my in my house I have
 
05:52:16.070 --> 05:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
to tell you we switched service last
 
05:52:18.048 --> 05:52:18.058 align:start position:0%
year the rates went down a third and I
 
05:52:20.090 --> 05:52:20.100 align:start position:0%
thought holy cow so there is definitely
 
05:52:20.100 --> 05:52:22.010 align:start position:0%
thought holy cow so there is definitely
competition

05:52:22.010 --> 05:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
competition
 
05:52:25.970 --> 05:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
even when I'll give you an example last
 
05:52:29.570 --> 05:52:29.580 align:start position:0%
year the state awarded Through The Fez
 
05:52:31.250 --> 05:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars to the New Hampshire
 
05:52:34.730 --> 05:52:34.740 align:start position:0%
Electric Co-op to build broadband and it
 
05:52:38.390 --> 05:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
was very interesting what they did
 
05:52:38.400 --> 05:52:39.490 align:start position:0%
was very interesting what they did
um

05:52:39.490 --> 05:52:39.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:44.270 --> 05:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
they the co-op was not at was not um
 
05:52:48.170 --> 05:52:48.180 align:start position:0%
did not have to put any money in
 
05:52:51.470 --> 05:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
to this build the co-op unlike my
 
05:52:53.570 --> 05:52:53.580 align:start position:0%
clients does not have a union and the
 
05:52:55.850 --> 05:52:55.860 align:start position:0%
co-op is a non-profit so it's not paying
 
05:52:58.850 --> 05:52:58.860 align:start position:0%
the taxes the other thing they did in a
 
05:53:00.650 --> 05:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire did when New Hampshire put out
 
05:53:00.660 --> 05:53:01.850 align:start position:0%
Hampshire did when New Hampshire put out
this

05:53:01.850 --> 05:53:01.860 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:53:04.730 --> 05:53:04.740 align:start position:0%
um Broadband proposal
 
05:53:06.708 --> 05:53:06.718 align:start position:0%
and they were going off of federal
 
05:53:09.948 --> 05:53:09.958 align:start position:0%
guidelines not federal mandates but
 
05:53:14.030 --> 05:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines that if you you got a
 
05:53:16.250 --> 05:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
higher score if you were a municipality
 
05:53:20.810 --> 05:53:20.820 align:start position:0%
a non-profit or a Cooperative so for
 
05:53:23.570 --> 05:53:23.580 align:start position:0%
example when this came out last summer
 
05:53:26.330 --> 05:53:26.340 align:start position:0%
all of my clients the most they could
 
05:53:28.970 --> 05:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
score if they applied to get this money
 
05:53:31.788 --> 05:53:31.798 align:start position:0%
was 75 percent
 
05:53:34.610 --> 05:53:34.620 align:start position:0%
the co-op or a municipality get a
 
05:53:35.750 --> 05:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
hundred percent
 
05:53:38.750 --> 05:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
so as you can imagine cable landline
 
05:53:41.090 --> 05:53:41.100 align:start position:0%
while we all screamed and yelled and
 
05:53:42.410 --> 05:53:42.420 align:start position:0%
said wait a minute this is just
 
05:53:44.930 --> 05:53:44.940 align:start position:0%
blatantly unfair we've all spent all
 
05:53:47.570 --> 05:53:47.580 align:start position:0%
this money we're continuing to build and
 
05:53:50.750 --> 05:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
we can't you know if you didn't score 70
 
05:53:54.110 --> 05:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
you got thrown out so unless you were
 
05:53:55.730 --> 05:53:55.740 align:start position:0%
perfect and none of my clients are
 
05:53:57.770 --> 05:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
perfect so needless to say we were all
 
05:53:59.750 --> 05:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
going to get thrown out So eventually
 
05:54:01.990 --> 05:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
they amended it and put it at 90 percent
 
05:54:05.330 --> 05:54:05.340 align:start position:0%
so obviously
 
05:54:07.490 --> 05:54:07.500 align:start position:0%
um we didn't win none of the none of the
 
05:54:09.070 --> 05:54:09.080 align:start position:0%
for-profit companies Comcast
 
05:54:12.650 --> 05:54:12.660 align:start position:0%
Consolidated Charter TDS nobody nobody
 
05:54:15.590 --> 05:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
won the co-op one they put out round two
 
05:54:17.810 --> 05:54:17.820 align:start position:0%
and guess what we can still only score
 
05:54:19.430 --> 05:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
90 percent
 
05:54:22.430 --> 05:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
so now when they go to the next
 
05:54:22.440 --> 05:54:23.930 align:start position:0%
so now when they go to the next
iteration

05:54:23.930 --> 05:54:23.940 align:start position:0%
iteration
 
05:54:26.990 --> 05:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
the for-profits can apply and can I
 
05:54:29.390 --> 05:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
think score 100 but they have to put 25
 
05:54:31.250 --> 05:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
capital in
 
05:54:33.410 --> 05:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
the reason I'm telling you this is not
 
05:54:35.270 --> 05:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
to whine as I did for a long time about
 
05:54:38.510 --> 05:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
how unfair this was but to tell you when
 
05:54:41.330 --> 05:54:41.340 align:start position:0%
you look at a competitive landscape and
 
05:54:43.190 --> 05:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
you've got for-profits are spending
 
05:54:45.708 --> 05:54:45.718 align:start position:0%
their own money and then and the case of
 
05:54:47.930 --> 05:54:47.940 align:start position:0%
one of my clients they they have a union
 
05:54:51.170 --> 05:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
and they're paying taxes and then all of
 
05:54:53.090 --> 05:54:53.100 align:start position:0%
a sudden you still have government
 
05:54:55.548 --> 05:54:55.558 align:start position:0%
regulation of being the carry of Last
 
05:54:57.948 --> 05:54:57.958 align:start position:0%
Resort when you've got complete
 
05:55:00.770 --> 05:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
competition in an area
 
05:55:04.368 --> 05:55:04.378 align:start position:0%
you're Shackled and and so we believe
 
05:55:07.430 --> 05:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
this bill is taking us forward in
 
05:55:11.690 --> 05:55:11.700 align:start position:0%
deregulation now for us we're having to
 
05:55:14.330 --> 05:55:14.340 align:start position:0%
maintain old and for those of you I
 
05:55:16.670 --> 05:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
think who've been here a long time well
 
05:55:18.650 --> 05:55:18.660 align:start position:0%
no years ago and I think representative
 
05:55:20.810 --> 05:55:20.820 align:start position:0%
Noel you were here a while back and I'm
 
05:55:24.650 --> 05:55:24.660 align:start position:0%
back again we've talked about copper and
 
05:55:27.650 --> 05:55:27.660 align:start position:0%
fiber Etc well most of these carrier
 
05:55:30.350 --> 05:55:30.360 align:start position:0%
blast resorts are copper so we're having
 
05:55:32.570 --> 05:55:32.580 align:start position:0%
my clients are having to maintain that
 
05:55:35.570 --> 05:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
copper line as well as they're building
 
05:55:40.128 --> 05:55:40.138 align:start position:0%
fiber at the same time and what you've
 
05:55:42.530 --> 05:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
got you've got to maintain two systems
 
05:55:46.070 --> 05:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
now you take Concord for example they're
 
05:55:49.010 --> 05:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
being built out completely in fiber well
 
05:55:52.430 --> 05:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
why do you then need to maintain a a
 
05:55:55.070 --> 05:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
copper Network it's expensive
 
05:55:58.490 --> 05:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
so I would surmise that we would be
 
05:56:00.590 --> 05:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
better as a state because the federal
 
05:56:03.830 --> 05:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
money is not going to go to Every rural
 
05:56:06.310 --> 05:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
area and build out that last mile
 
05:56:09.708 --> 05:56:09.718 align:start position:0%
I think from a resource perspective we'd
 
05:56:11.270 --> 05:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
be better to take that money of
 
05:56:13.730 --> 05:56:13.740 align:start position:0%
maintaining that old Network for carry
 
05:56:16.730 --> 05:56:16.740 align:start position:0%
of Last Resort and building out those
 
05:56:20.330 --> 05:56:20.340 align:start position:0%
rural municipalities where the last mile
 
05:56:22.368 --> 05:56:22.378 align:start position:0%
still isn't going to go to with all that
 
05:56:24.470 --> 05:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
Federal money because you've got
 
05:56:27.708 --> 05:56:27.718 align:start position:0%
companies who are willing to invest
 
05:56:29.750 --> 05:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
and two I'm not sure who asked the
 
05:56:32.570 --> 05:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
question about the race it was you with
 
05:56:34.930 --> 05:56:34.940 align:start position:0%
you representative the rate
 
05:56:37.910 --> 05:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
really I think in many ways what you're
 
05:56:40.070 --> 05:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
going to see happen is the companies
 
05:56:42.110 --> 05:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
take that Capital these spending
 
05:56:45.590 --> 05:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
maintaining an old Antiquated system and
 
05:56:48.170 --> 05:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
then using it frankly to build out
 
05:56:50.990 --> 05:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
places with fiber in the North Country
 
05:56:53.030 --> 05:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
Etc the other issue you've got here I
 
05:56:55.310 --> 05:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
hate to say it and Sarah Davis can talk
 
05:56:57.770 --> 05:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
about it more than I the question is how
 
05:56:59.690 --> 05:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
long is it going to be before you can't
 
05:57:02.750 --> 05:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
get parts for that old Network and so
 
05:57:05.750 --> 05:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
then you've got your think you've got a
 
05:57:07.788 --> 05:57:07.798 align:start position:0%
carry of Last Resort but you really
 
05:57:09.708 --> 05:57:09.718 align:start position:0%
don't because you don't have the parts
 
05:57:12.650 --> 05:57:12.660 align:start position:0%
and the equipment to maintain it so I
 
05:57:14.750 --> 05:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
think this is a good time for New
 
05:57:17.390 --> 05:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to really look at beginning to
 
05:57:20.930 --> 05:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
move forward of finding a way that we
 
05:57:22.788 --> 05:57:22.798 align:start position:0%
can make sure everybody's got 9-1-1
 
05:57:25.190 --> 05:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
everybody's got fire they've got police
 
05:57:28.730 --> 05:57:28.740 align:start position:0%
but they're on new technology and using
 
05:57:31.128 --> 05:57:31.138 align:start position:0%
multiple types of technology and we are
 
05:57:33.708 --> 05:57:33.718 align:start position:0%
relieving this Antiquated system from
 
05:57:36.470 --> 05:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
way back way back when I kind of got off
 
05:57:40.548 --> 05:57:40.558 align:start position:0%
my script but um the bottom line here is
 
05:57:45.170 --> 05:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
we did back in 2012 past Senate Bill 48
 
05:57:47.990 --> 05:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
which started deregulation as Mrs Noonan
 
05:57:50.350 --> 05:57:50.360 align:start position:0%
said we are getting there
 
05:57:53.750 --> 05:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
most of the country we have 38 states
 
05:57:57.288 --> 05:57:57.298 align:start position:0%
that have already uh moved and some of
 
05:58:00.110 --> 05:58:00.120 align:start position:0%
them a long time ago to relieve
 
05:58:02.628 --> 05:58:02.638 align:start position:0%
companies completely of the carry a last
 
05:58:05.628 --> 05:58:05.638 align:start position:0%
resort or to allow companies to do what
 
05:58:08.150 --> 05:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
we're asking here which is only petition
 
05:58:11.590 --> 05:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
Maine for example their law went in
 
05:58:14.530 --> 05:58:14.540 align:start position:0%
2016. Vermont all our neighboring states
 
05:58:18.170 --> 05:58:18.180 align:start position:0%
this is only enabling legislation so all
 
05:58:21.530 --> 05:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
you're doing is allowing a company to be
 
05:58:24.350 --> 05:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
able to position the puc the company's
 
05:58:26.090 --> 05:58:26.100 align:start position:0%
not going to waste their time or
 
05:58:29.030 --> 05:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
resources if they don't have meet the
 
05:58:31.670 --> 05:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
criteria here so what are we really
 
05:58:34.030 --> 05:58:34.040 align:start position:0%
talking about Concord
 
05:58:37.368 --> 05:58:37.378 align:start position:0%
Manchester maybe Nash it's going to be
 
05:58:38.750 --> 05:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
your big cities
 
05:58:41.628 --> 05:58:41.638 align:start position:0%
I mean I here in Concord we have the
 
05:58:44.448 --> 05:58:44.458 align:start position:0%
choice of Consolidated Comcast Breeze
 
05:58:47.150 --> 05:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
line and every single wireless carrier
 
05:58:49.010 --> 05:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
as well as you can have satellite as
 
05:58:52.070 --> 05:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
well so for a company they're really
 
05:58:53.990 --> 05:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
only going to position the puc if
 
05:58:56.510 --> 05:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
they're sure they've got coverage across
 
05:58:58.010 --> 05:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
the board and you're going to see this
 
05:59:01.850 --> 05:59:01.860 align:start position:0%
as one or more Wireless carriers and so
 
05:59:03.128 --> 05:59:03.138 align:start position:0%
you're going to see you're going to see
 
05:59:05.090 --> 05:59:05.100 align:start position:0%
nobody's going to waste their time
 
05:59:08.690 --> 05:59:08.700 align:start position:0%
frankly petitioning the puc for Mylon or
 
05:59:10.548 --> 05:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
Romney or anything like that you're
 
05:59:12.770 --> 05:59:12.780 align:start position:0%
gonna you're gonna that's I'd say
 
05:59:15.048 --> 05:59:15.058 align:start position:0%
another decade down the road down the
 
05:59:15.058 --> 05:59:16.310 align:start position:0%
another decade down the road down the
road

05:59:16.310 --> 05:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
road
 
05:59:18.650 --> 05:59:18.660 align:start position:0%
um I think I have I'm hoping I've
 
05:59:21.048 --> 05:59:21.058 align:start position:0%
answered the questions but again this is
 
05:59:24.470 --> 05:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
the enabling legislation it's on us to
 
05:59:28.850 --> 05:59:28.860 align:start position:0%
prove that there is competition clearly
 
05:59:31.490 --> 05:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
with the co-op getting the money the
 
05:59:33.110 --> 05:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
companies were having to figure out how
 
05:59:35.448 --> 05:59:35.458 align:start position:0%
to prove the over Bill the companies
 
05:59:37.970 --> 05:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
know how to do that and they would have
 
05:59:40.970 --> 05:59:40.980 align:start position:0%
to and if the puc says we don't think
 
05:59:42.350 --> 05:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
you proved it correctly you've got to go
 
05:59:43.910 --> 05:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
back to the drawing board
 
05:59:45.708 --> 05:59:45.718 align:start position:0%
so thank you I think I covered
 
05:59:48.530 --> 05:59:48.540 align:start position:0%
everything but I didn't please ask me uh
 
05:59:50.390 --> 05:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you question uh representative
 
05:59:50.400 --> 05:59:52.490 align:start position:0%
thank you question uh representative
Kaplan

05:59:52.490 --> 05:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
Kaplan
 
05:59:54.048 --> 05:59:54.058 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:59:55.850 --> 05:59:55.860 align:start position:0%
coming and testifying I didn't answer
 
05:59:57.530 --> 05:59:57.540 align:start position:0%
your question
 
05:59:58.910 --> 05:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
um I have a question for you okay but I
 
06:00:00.110 --> 06:00:00.120 align:start position:0%
forgot to answer the one you asked
 
06:00:02.690 --> 06:00:02.700 align:start position:0%
before but I will okay
 
06:00:05.448 --> 06:00:05.458 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that the Legacy
 
06:00:09.288 --> 06:00:09.298 align:start position:0%
carriers might choose to install fiber
 
06:00:10.788 --> 06:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
optic cable instead of maintaining the
 
06:00:13.250 --> 06:00:13.260 align:start position:0%
old copper lines that might be a you
 
06:00:15.310 --> 06:00:15.320 align:start position:0%
know logical choice for them
 
06:00:18.170 --> 06:00:18.180 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if the telephone
 
06:00:19.910 --> 06:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
carriers might be open to an amendment
 
06:00:23.090 --> 06:00:23.100 align:start position:0%
that said going forward the the you know
 
06:00:24.730 --> 06:00:24.740 align:start position:0%
from here on
 
06:00:27.590 --> 06:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
the carriers would not be liable to
 
06:00:31.250 --> 06:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
carry that last mile obligation for new
 
06:00:33.288 --> 06:00:33.298 align:start position:0%
houses but they you know so they
 
06:00:35.090 --> 06:00:35.100 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to install new lines but
 
06:00:36.288 --> 06:00:36.298 align:start position:0%
they would still have to maintain the
 
06:00:40.610 --> 06:00:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:42.770 --> 06:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
I think if I understand you you're
 
06:00:45.410 --> 06:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
saying when these new construction you
 
06:00:46.850 --> 06:00:46.860 align:start position:0%
don't have to have the carry of Last
 
06:00:48.708 --> 06:00:48.718 align:start position:0%
Resort obligation and that you would
 
06:00:50.208 --> 06:00:50.218 align:start position:0%
install fiber
 
06:00:53.930 --> 06:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
well let me say here everybody's
 
06:00:57.048 --> 06:00:57.058 align:start position:0%
installing fiber now and so nobody is
 
06:00:59.690 --> 06:00:59.700 align:start position:0%
gonna nobody's gonna install uh copper
 
06:01:03.048 --> 06:01:03.058 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be fiber uh that
 
06:01:04.610 --> 06:01:04.620 align:start position:0%
doesn't really get us where we're going
 
06:01:08.270 --> 06:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
because you'd only be be eliminating
 
06:01:10.070 --> 06:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
carry of Last Resort for new
 
06:01:12.830 --> 06:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
construction and really when you think
 
06:01:16.010 --> 06:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
about it if you are in Manchester or
 
06:01:18.048 --> 06:01:18.058 align:start position:0%
Concord and you've got the choice of
 
06:01:20.330 --> 06:01:20.340 align:start position:0%
four or five Wireless carriers and
 
06:01:22.910 --> 06:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
you've got at least two cable and at
 
06:01:25.730 --> 06:01:25.740 align:start position:0%
least one landline and in this case
 
06:01:27.708 --> 06:01:27.718 align:start position:0%
landline other landlines could come in
 
06:01:27.718 --> 06:01:29.330 align:start position:0%
landline other landlines could come in
then

06:01:29.330 --> 06:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
then
 
06:01:31.730 --> 06:01:31.740 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it make more sense to let them
 
06:01:33.948 --> 06:01:33.958 align:start position:0%
be relieved because everybody can dial
 
06:01:37.910 --> 06:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 and then build out some of these
 
06:01:40.010 --> 06:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
areas in the other parts of the state
 
06:01:41.690 --> 06:01:41.700 align:start position:0%
that are more rural so we could get
 
06:01:43.850 --> 06:01:43.860 align:start position:0%
everybody that they had choices like we
 
06:01:46.730 --> 06:01:46.740 align:start position:0%
do in our big cities so I didn't really
 
06:01:49.670 --> 06:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
answer your question but I I think we'd
 
06:01:51.830 --> 06:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
be better off to do it and you can only
 
06:01:55.430 --> 06:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
do it for one area so as representative
 
06:02:00.110 --> 06:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
Thomas asked you you you could do two
 
06:02:02.810 --> 06:02:02.820 align:start position:0%
two areas together but they both have to
 
06:02:05.270 --> 06:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
be whatever your area is it's got to
 
06:02:07.430 --> 06:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
still meet the qualifications here but
 
06:02:08.990 --> 06:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
to answer your other question that you
 
06:02:10.430 --> 06:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
asked before about what happened in the
 
06:02:13.128 --> 06:02:13.138 align:start position:0%
Senate I will honestly say we had
 
06:02:16.490 --> 06:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
support for it in the Senate and um I'm
 
06:02:18.708 --> 06:02:18.718 align:start position:0%
going to politely say it was what I call
 
06:02:22.368 --> 06:02:22.378 align:start position:0%
an administrative glitch and the bill
 
06:02:25.190 --> 06:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
the the exact session ran over other
 
06:02:28.070 --> 06:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
people were coming in and it was put it
 
06:02:30.288 --> 06:02:30.298 align:start position:0%
in a room setting and they did not meet
 
06:02:31.610 --> 06:02:31.620 align:start position:0%
on it
 
06:02:33.830 --> 06:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
so it was it was one of the more
 
06:02:35.510 --> 06:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
frustrating bills I've dealt with in
 
06:02:36.830 --> 06:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
years where you thought oh gosh couldn't
 
06:02:39.530 --> 06:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
you have a debate but it was you know we
 
06:02:41.510 --> 06:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
got to leave the room so okay thank you
 
06:02:43.788 --> 06:02:43.798 align:start position:0%
very much um we're not going to carry a
 
06:02:45.948 --> 06:02:45.958 align:start position:0%
debate on here on no what could be done
 
06:02:49.610 --> 06:02:49.620 align:start position:0%
or done uh if you have I'll take one
 
06:02:52.030 --> 06:02:52.040 align:start position:0%
more question goes we do need to move on
 
06:02:54.170 --> 06:02:54.180 align:start position:0%
all right representative Community
 
06:02:57.110 --> 06:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
Thomas ask your pertinent question
 
06:02:58.610 --> 06:02:58.620 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair my pertinent
 
06:03:01.070 --> 06:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
question is you've used the phrases or
 
06:03:03.350 --> 06:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
the terms area region and municipality
 
06:03:06.170 --> 06:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
can you just clarify exactly what those
 
06:03:06.180 --> 06:03:07.128 align:start position:0%
can you just clarify exactly what those
are

06:03:07.128 --> 06:03:07.138 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:03:10.850 --> 06:03:10.860 align:start position:0%
well I can't really clarify well let me
 
06:03:11.868 --> 06:03:11.878 align:start position:0%
just say
 
06:03:15.048 --> 06:03:15.058 align:start position:0%
for a telephone Monopoly an old Monopoly
 
06:03:17.930 --> 06:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
they were given a territory so that
 
06:03:20.208 --> 06:03:20.218 align:start position:0%
territory like I gave the example in
 
06:03:23.690 --> 06:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
Playing Field that territory included
 
06:03:27.350 --> 06:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
half a playing field and the other towns
 
06:03:29.090 --> 06:03:29.100 align:start position:0%
surrounding it it didn't include the
 
06:03:33.170 --> 06:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
they didn't do it by by Town border and
 
06:03:35.330 --> 06:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
so that's why you have there with
 
06:03:37.430 --> 06:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
Consolidated having part of playing
 
06:03:40.970 --> 06:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
field and and TDS having the other part
 
06:03:43.548 --> 06:03:43.558 align:start position:0%
so they gave them territory some of them
 
06:03:47.390 --> 06:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
bigger than others uh example Granite
 
06:03:49.788 --> 06:03:49.798 align:start position:0%
State telephone has where and they've
 
06:03:53.750 --> 06:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
got all of where so if by chance where
 
06:03:56.930 --> 06:03:56.940 align:start position:0%
were a town that qualified they would
 
06:03:59.830 --> 06:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
come in with a petition for all where
 
06:04:03.048 --> 06:04:03.058 align:start position:0%
so it's it they didn't follow the town
 
06:04:05.628 --> 06:04:05.638 align:start position:0%
map I'm not sure if all the towns were
 
06:04:08.208 --> 06:04:08.218 align:start position:0%
here in 34 times right thank you I think
 
06:04:09.650 --> 06:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
they answered the question yeah thank
 
06:04:09.660 --> 06:04:10.310 align:start position:0%
they answered the question yeah thank
you

06:04:10.310 --> 06:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:04:11.510 --> 06:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
um we're going to move on here thank you
 
06:04:13.250 --> 06:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
so much for testimony I'm going to call
 
06:04:17.990 --> 06:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:22.788 --> 06:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:22.798 --> 06:04:23.750 align:start position:0%
 
sir

06:04:23.750 --> 06:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
sir
 
06:04:31.368 --> 06:04:31.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:33.590 --> 06:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Catherine heck
 
06:04:35.868 --> 06:04:35.878 align:start position:0%
I represent nhma and thank you for
 
06:04:38.090 --> 06:04:38.100 align:start position:0%
allowing me this opportunity to testify
 
06:04:41.868 --> 06:04:41.878 align:start position:0%
today on House Bill 257. at this time we
 
06:04:43.490 --> 06:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
continue to be opposed to the
 
06:04:45.708 --> 06:04:45.718 align:start position:0%
legislation as we do believe it's still
 
06:04:49.788 --> 06:04:49.798 align:start position:0%
slightly premature as written however we
 
06:04:52.128 --> 06:04:52.138 align:start position:0%
do recognize that many other states have
 
06:04:54.288 --> 06:04:54.298 align:start position:0%
begun the process of relieving their
 
06:04:56.510 --> 06:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
carrier of Last Resort obligations and
 
06:04:59.868 --> 06:04:59.878 align:start position:0%
they've done so in a very methodical and
 
06:05:02.770 --> 06:05:02.780 align:start position:0%
spelled out type of way
 
06:05:05.270 --> 06:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
I don't want to repeat any testimony
 
06:05:07.070 --> 06:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
that you've already heard one of our
 
06:05:09.830 --> 06:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
main objections is of course 911 service
 
06:05:11.990 --> 06:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
and making sure people have access to
 
06:05:14.448 --> 06:05:14.458 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 and we know that there's many
 
06:05:17.868 --> 06:05:17.878 align:start position:0%
pockets in areas in the state even right
 
06:05:19.810 --> 06:05:19.820 align:start position:0%
here in Concord that don't have wireless
 
06:05:22.490 --> 06:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
coverage for such a thing as a 9-1-1
 
06:05:24.350 --> 06:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
call so
 
06:05:26.448 --> 06:05:26.458 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire is very
 
06:05:28.910 --> 06:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
actively working through the Broadband
 
06:05:31.128 --> 06:05:31.138 align:start position:0%
initiative through Bea the Bureau of
 
06:05:33.288 --> 06:05:33.298 align:start position:0%
economic Affairs to address the
 
06:05:35.868 --> 06:05:35.878 align:start position:0%
Broadband concerns Statewide and they
 
06:05:37.970 --> 06:05:37.980 align:start position:0%
are engaged in a comprehensive mapping
 
06:05:40.990 --> 06:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
program which is expected to be finished
 
06:05:43.548 --> 06:05:43.558 align:start position:0%
this spring so kind of crossing over
 
06:05:45.708 --> 06:05:45.718 align:start position:0%
this legislation the reason why we
 
06:05:47.628 --> 06:05:47.638 align:start position:0%
require more comprehensive mapping is
 
06:05:50.090 --> 06:05:50.100 align:start position:0%
because currently all our broadband and
 
06:05:52.970 --> 06:05:52.980 align:start position:0%
wireless data is based on census tract
 
06:05:54.650 --> 06:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
data from the US government and that
 
06:05:56.750 --> 06:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
means if you ping one household and they
 
06:05:58.788 --> 06:05:58.798 align:start position:0%
have that data and what's considered a
 
06:06:00.650 --> 06:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
census Block it's considered to be
 
06:06:00.660 --> 06:06:01.730 align:start position:0%
census Block it's considered to be
served

06:06:01.730 --> 06:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
served
 
06:06:04.250 --> 06:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
whether or not everyone in that area is
 
06:06:06.770 --> 06:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
served or not so we do not have firm
 
06:06:08.690 --> 06:06:08.700 align:start position:0%
data on how many are underserved but we
 
06:06:11.448 --> 06:06:11.458 align:start position:0%
do know for example some towns looked to
 
06:06:13.310 --> 06:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
move forward with Broadband projects to
 
06:06:15.288 --> 06:06:15.298 align:start position:0%
bring the Last Mile in and because of
 
06:06:17.390 --> 06:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
census tract data they were considered
 
06:06:19.490 --> 06:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
to be served there's currently a bill in
 
06:06:21.830 --> 06:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
the Senate to ensure that bonding can
 
06:06:25.850 --> 06:06:25.860 align:start position:0%
now be bonding on the municipal level
 
06:06:29.090 --> 06:06:29.100 align:start position:0%
can happen for both underserved and
 
06:06:31.610 --> 06:06:31.620 align:start position:0%
unserved so underserved was currently
 
06:06:33.410 --> 06:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
not an option for bonding but we
 
06:06:35.330 --> 06:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
recognize that that middle and last mile
 
06:06:38.150 --> 06:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
of broadband it's critical so to give
 
06:06:41.208 --> 06:06:41.218 align:start position:0%
you an example up north and Northern as
 
06:06:43.010 --> 06:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
we talked about the co-op we do know
 
06:06:45.590 --> 06:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
that our most northern neighbors are the
 
06:06:47.690 --> 06:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
most underserved or unserved in the
 
06:06:49.490 --> 06:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
state and they worked with the state of
 
06:06:52.788 --> 06:06:52.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they were awarded as a
 
06:06:56.810 --> 06:06:56.820 align:start position:0%
fellow testifier just stated a a grant
 
06:06:58.610 --> 06:06:58.620 align:start position:0%
from the state of New Hampshire to build
 
06:07:00.830 --> 06:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
out and they will be building out
 
06:07:04.190 --> 06:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
between 30 35 and 40 000 people who did
 
06:07:06.170 --> 06:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
not have service so that that's a
 
06:07:08.030 --> 06:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
significant number of people who may be
 
06:07:09.948 --> 06:07:09.958 align:start position:0%
affected by this bill now the number
 
06:07:12.110 --> 06:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
exactly is still hard to know who would
 
06:07:15.230 --> 06:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
be 95 or 97 percent unserved so that's
 
06:07:17.208 --> 06:07:17.218 align:start position:0%
just an example but that's only one
 
06:07:19.010 --> 06:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
region of the state
 
06:07:19.020 --> 06:07:19.788 align:start position:0%
region of the state
um

06:07:19.788 --> 06:07:19.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:07:22.368 --> 06:07:22.378 align:start position:0%
there are additional grants under the
 
06:07:24.530 --> 06:07:24.540 align:start position:0%
capital projects fund that will go to
 
06:07:27.170 --> 06:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
Private Industry for broadband and
 
06:07:29.628 --> 06:07:29.638 align:start position:0%
wireless bill though there was 122
 
06:07:31.368 --> 06:07:31.378 align:start position:0%
million dollars in the capital projects
 
06:07:33.410 --> 06:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
fund I believe about 40 million has been
 
06:07:35.270 --> 06:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
awarded and they're continuing to take
 
06:07:37.970 --> 06:07:37.980 align:start position:0%
rfps so I've put some links into my
 
06:07:39.530 --> 06:07:39.540 align:start position:0%
testimony I'll email it to you so you
 
06:07:42.110 --> 06:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
can access those links for example and
 
06:07:44.150 --> 06:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
you can see what the state of New
 
06:07:45.890 --> 06:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is doing to address this issue
 
06:07:47.810 --> 06:07:47.820 align:start position:0%
so we'd be happy to work with the
 
06:07:50.690 --> 06:07:50.700 align:start position:0%
sponsors and talk about how other states
 
06:07:52.548 --> 06:07:52.558 align:start position:0%
did it how this could be framed in a way
 
06:07:54.170 --> 06:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
that could work for New Hampshire given
 
06:07:56.150 --> 06:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
that we are moving forward very
 
06:07:58.368 --> 06:07:58.378 align:start position:0%
diligently as a state to get broadband
 
06:08:00.590 --> 06:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
service to all of our residents and
 
06:08:02.230 --> 06:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
Wireless Communications
 
06:08:04.850 --> 06:08:04.860 align:start position:0%
and I did want to point out that for
 
06:08:07.250 --> 06:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
example the state of Maine has a
 
06:08:08.750 --> 06:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
commission that they've created they
 
06:08:11.448 --> 06:08:11.458 align:start position:0%
have a statute they go through it
 
06:08:13.910 --> 06:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
methodically and they decide it's all
 
06:08:13.920 --> 06:08:14.990 align:start position:0%
methodically and they decide it's all
available

06:08:14.990 --> 06:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
available
 
06:08:17.448 --> 06:08:17.458 align:start position:0%
um in my testimony which I'll email and
 
06:08:19.310 --> 06:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
I do have hard copies so that you can
 
06:08:21.650 --> 06:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
see how they've gone about relieving the
 
06:08:23.570 --> 06:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
carrier Last Resort of their obligation
 
06:08:25.670 --> 06:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
so it's possible but I feel like it's
 
06:08:27.590 --> 06:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
premature without this comprehensive
 
06:08:29.390 --> 06:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
mapping that our state is currently
 
06:08:31.128 --> 06:08:31.138 align:start position:0%
working on so we really understand how
 
06:08:33.350 --> 06:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
many people would be affected by this
 
06:08:35.448 --> 06:08:35.458 align:start position:0%
legislation so I'll just take questions
 
06:08:37.910 --> 06:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:08:40.310 --> 06:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
I have one question from representative
 
06:08:40.320 --> 06:08:41.448 align:start position:0%
I have one question from representative
munz

06:08:41.448 --> 06:08:41.458 align:start position:0%
munz
 
06:08:43.670 --> 06:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:08:47.030 --> 06:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
joining us today I had earlier asked the
 
06:08:48.350 --> 06:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
representative from the Department of
 
06:08:50.090 --> 06:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
energy if we had a handle on how many
 
06:08:53.750 --> 06:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
people were affected by this I'm I take
 
06:08:56.628 --> 06:08:56.638 align:start position:0%
it that this this mapping exercise would
 
06:08:58.730 --> 06:08:58.740 align:start position:0%
answer that question is that correct
 
06:09:01.250 --> 06:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
that is correct sir so that's why we
 
06:09:02.330 --> 06:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
were hoping that that would be
 
06:09:03.830 --> 06:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
incorporated somehow into this
 
06:09:05.628 --> 06:09:05.638 align:start position:0%
legislation so it can't be enacted
 
06:09:09.170 --> 06:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
without using the map to reference the
 
06:09:11.208 --> 06:09:11.218 align:start position:0%
spont the department of Energy's
 
06:09:14.150 --> 06:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
testimony she stated that
 
06:09:16.730 --> 06:09:16.740 align:start position:0%
it could be up to the carrier to prove
 
06:09:18.230 --> 06:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
that someone you know that they they
 
06:09:20.030 --> 06:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
meet the criteria and then they would
 
06:09:21.708 --> 06:09:21.718 align:start position:0%
have someone vet that we feel like
 
06:09:24.048 --> 06:09:24.058 align:start position:0%
having a comprehensive map that everyone
 
06:09:25.788 --> 06:09:25.798 align:start position:0%
has to reference that the state has
 
06:09:27.170 --> 06:09:27.180 align:start position:0%
developed and we know it's done with
 
06:09:28.670 --> 06:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
Fidelity would provide those
 
06:09:31.670 --> 06:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
reassurances that everyone
 
06:09:31.680 --> 06:09:33.110 align:start position:0%
reassurances that everyone
um

06:09:33.110 --> 06:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:35.150 --> 06:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
is being treated equally and fairly
 
06:09:38.868 --> 06:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
under this legislation follow-up
 
06:09:41.570 --> 06:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
I'll take one follow-up in your in your
 
06:09:41.580 --> 06:09:43.010 align:start position:0%
I'll take one follow-up in your in your
testimony

06:09:43.010 --> 06:09:43.020 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
06:09:45.590 --> 06:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
um you indicate that that exercise would
 
06:09:49.250 --> 06:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
be completed sometime later in 2023
 
06:09:52.430 --> 06:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
would can you give us any better idea of
 
06:09:54.170 --> 06:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
when that might happen well I actually
 
06:09:57.230 --> 06:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
was on a just a call with Bea this
 
06:09:59.150 --> 06:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
morning that's accessible to everyone
 
06:10:01.190 --> 06:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
and I did ask that very pointed question
 
06:10:03.350 --> 06:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
to prepare for this testimony and they
 
06:10:04.970 --> 06:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
were hoping to have it by the first
 
06:10:07.548 --> 06:10:07.558 align:start position:0%
quarter of this year to start going
 
06:10:11.150 --> 06:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
through the preliminary mapping data so
 
06:10:13.670 --> 06:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
again I I don't have an exact date but
 
06:10:15.350 --> 06:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
they're very hopeful because Bea is
 
06:10:17.448 --> 06:10:17.458 align:start position:0%
looking to distribute those funds based
 
06:10:20.510 --> 06:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
on the map that's produced from this RFP
 
06:10:21.948 --> 06:10:21.958 align:start position:0%
that they put out
 
06:10:23.990 --> 06:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I think I'm sensing the
 
06:10:25.850 --> 06:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
questions or getting back to the your
 
06:10:28.270 --> 06:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
testimony again uh the same information
 
06:10:31.310 --> 06:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your testimony I'm
 
06:10:35.208 --> 06:10:35.218 align:start position:0%
going to call on Sarah Davis next and uh
 
06:10:37.490 --> 06:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
don't take this as anything different
 
06:10:39.350 --> 06:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
um I failed to make an announcement
 
06:10:41.510 --> 06:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
earlier that if you do have written
 
06:10:45.410 --> 06:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
testimony please we can read please just
 
06:10:47.628 --> 06:10:47.638 align:start position:0%
summarize your written testimony and you
 
06:10:49.910 --> 06:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
can add to it if you think it's a
 
06:10:51.890 --> 06:10:51.900 align:start position:0%
pertinent to that bill so thank you very
 
06:10:55.670 --> 06:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
much welcome Miss Davis uh the floor is
 
06:10:58.490 --> 06:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
yours thank you very much as you stated
 
06:11:01.070 --> 06:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
my name is Sarah Davis and I am with
 
06:11:03.110 --> 06:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
Consolidated Communications and I'm here
 
06:11:04.910 --> 06:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
testifying in favor of this bill I
 
06:11:06.650 --> 06:11:06.660 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity I will not
 
06:11:10.128 --> 06:11:10.138 align:start position:0%
bore you I will not read my testimony I
 
06:11:11.570 --> 06:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
will address some of the issues I heard
 
06:11:13.430 --> 06:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
before me and try to try to anticipate
 
06:11:17.810 --> 06:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
some of the questions so this bill is an
 
06:11:22.070 --> 06:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
attempt to move in a direction that is
 
06:11:24.288 --> 06:11:24.298 align:start position:0%
not drastic for the State of New
 
06:11:25.850 --> 06:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to start working towards
 
06:11:29.750 --> 06:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
what's a very basic issue that at this
 
06:11:32.150 --> 06:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
point in time Consolidated for instance
 
06:11:34.010 --> 06:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
has about eight percent of the access
 
06:11:38.090 --> 06:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
lines it had just 17 years ago yet it
 
06:11:40.910 --> 06:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
still has to maintain the millions of
 
06:11:44.208 --> 06:11:44.218 align:start position:0%
miles of facilities that it has up in
 
06:11:45.830 --> 06:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
the air to provide those same Services
 
06:11:49.730 --> 06:11:49.740 align:start position:0%
when it had 92 percent more access lines
 
06:11:51.770 --> 06:11:51.780 align:start position:0%
and so what that leaves is a situation
 
06:11:55.368 --> 06:11:55.378 align:start position:0%
where to continue to be viable the
 
06:11:59.048 --> 06:11:59.058 align:start position:0%
company has to continue increasing rates
 
06:12:02.090 --> 06:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
in for those telecommunications Services
 
06:12:04.490 --> 06:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
which is not a direction that it wants
 
06:12:07.368 --> 06:12:07.378 align:start position:0%
to go but
 
06:12:09.470 --> 06:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
still having to maintain an obligation
 
06:12:11.690 --> 06:12:11.700 align:start position:0%
and unfunded mandate in the state
 
06:12:14.208 --> 06:12:14.218 align:start position:0%
without you know the the customer base
 
06:12:16.250 --> 06:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
or the Monopoly protection to guarantee
 
06:12:17.930 --> 06:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
a rate of return at the end of that puts
 
06:12:20.150 --> 06:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
you in this position and so we have
 
06:12:21.530 --> 06:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
followed what we did in Maine I heard
 
06:12:23.270 --> 06:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
main reference earlier we followed what
 
06:12:25.310 --> 06:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
we did in Maine and we're trying to move
 
06:12:27.288 --> 06:12:27.298 align:start position:0%
forward in a way that allows the company
 
06:12:29.628 --> 06:12:29.638 align:start position:0%
to be relieved of that obligation in any
 
06:12:31.548 --> 06:12:31.558 align:start position:0%
area where there is sufficient
 
06:12:34.070 --> 06:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
competition it is not being asked to be
 
06:12:36.770 --> 06:12:36.780 align:start position:0%
relieved of that in areas where there is
 
06:12:39.830 --> 06:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
no other providers in very rural areas
 
06:12:41.330 --> 06:12:41.340 align:start position:0%
as areas where there is sufficient
 
06:12:44.030 --> 06:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
competition as Miss Rosenberger stated
 
06:12:46.850 --> 06:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
an area like Plymouth today has almost
 
06:12:49.430 --> 06:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
100 percent competition by Charter as
 
06:12:52.070 --> 06:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
well as Wireless providers and the New
 
06:12:53.930 --> 06:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Electric Co-op was just given
 
06:12:56.330 --> 06:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars to overbuild and
 
06:12:58.910 --> 06:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
provide fiber to the Prem service that
 
06:13:00.890 --> 06:13:00.900 align:start position:0%
is an area where it may make sense for
 
06:13:03.770 --> 06:13:03.780 align:start position:0%
Consolidated to not continue to provide
 
06:13:05.690 --> 06:13:05.700 align:start position:0%
service since there's two options in the
 
06:13:08.030 --> 06:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
area it can thereby save the money there
 
06:13:10.250 --> 06:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
and deploy in other areas where service
 
06:13:12.590 --> 06:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
may be needed more that's the basic
 
06:13:14.208 --> 06:13:14.218 align:start position:0%
issue in front of us and we're trying to
 
06:13:16.430 --> 06:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
move forward in a very smart way to
 
06:13:18.650 --> 06:13:18.660 align:start position:0%
answer the question over here the bill
 
06:13:20.330 --> 06:13:20.340 align:start position:0%
speaks to municipality that's
 
06:13:22.850 --> 06:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
intentional because a consumer doesn't
 
06:13:25.250 --> 06:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
always understand an exchange or an area
 
06:13:27.288 --> 06:13:27.298 align:start position:0%
or a region a consumer knows what
 
06:13:29.628 --> 06:13:29.638 align:start position:0%
municipality they live in and so the
 
06:13:32.448 --> 06:13:32.458 align:start position:0%
attempt is if that municipality in total
 
06:13:34.910 --> 06:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
re achieves that criteria you are
 
06:13:36.530 --> 06:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
relieved of that obligation in a
 
06:13:38.930 --> 06:13:38.940 align:start position:0%
municipality we believe it's very
 
06:13:40.430 --> 06:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
difficult for consumers to understand
 
06:13:43.190 --> 06:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
portions or regions or other areas that
 
06:13:44.930 --> 06:13:44.940 align:start position:0%
are not Geographic that they they don't
 
06:13:46.430 --> 06:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
have a clear understanding so it was
 
06:13:49.788 --> 06:13:49.798 align:start position:0%
written on a municipal basis over here
 
06:13:51.890 --> 06:13:51.900 align:start position:0%
there was a question about the cost to
 
06:13:54.410 --> 06:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
do that it's impossible to get the exact
 
06:13:56.030 --> 06:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
cost because you'd have to look at each
 
06:13:58.190 --> 06:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
area but I'll give you some I'll give
 
06:14:00.288 --> 06:14:00.298 align:start position:0%
you some references
 
06:14:03.530 --> 06:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
so for pole attachments just in the PSNH
 
06:14:06.288 --> 06:14:06.298 align:start position:0%
area if we move forward with our pole
 
06:14:08.570 --> 06:14:08.580 align:start position:0%
sale transaction Consolidated would pay
 
06:14:10.548 --> 06:14:10.558 align:start position:0%
over five million dollars just to to
 
06:14:12.250 --> 06:14:12.260 align:start position:0%
keep facilities up
 
06:14:14.390 --> 06:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
Consolidated is probably the largest
 
06:14:16.850 --> 06:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
Electric customer in the state so in all
 
06:14:18.350 --> 06:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
of these areas it pays very high
 
06:14:20.448 --> 06:14:20.458 align:start position:0%
electric bills millions of dollars a
 
06:14:22.970 --> 06:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
year these are all costs that to some
 
06:14:24.650 --> 06:14:24.660 align:start position:0%
extent could be avoided in very urban
 
06:14:27.650 --> 06:14:27.660 align:start position:0%
areas if the company decides that it
 
06:14:29.030 --> 06:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to continue there
 
06:14:31.430 --> 06:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
because competition has reducer access
 
06:14:34.548 --> 06:14:34.558 align:start position:0%
lines so low I was trying to think of
 
06:14:37.070 --> 06:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
some of the other questions before us
 
06:14:39.048 --> 06:14:39.058 align:start position:0%
you heard about Maine creating a
 
06:14:40.548 --> 06:14:40.558 align:start position:0%
commission I just want to clarify Maine
 
06:14:42.530 --> 06:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
did not create a commission the
 
06:14:44.448 --> 06:14:44.458 align:start position:0%
commission that oversaw deregulation in
 
06:14:47.090 --> 06:14:47.100 align:start position:0%
Maine like is proposed in this bill was
 
06:14:49.490 --> 06:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission here
 
06:14:50.750 --> 06:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
you've split up into the Public
 
06:14:53.208 --> 06:14:53.218 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission and the doe hence
 
06:14:55.910 --> 06:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
why the doe is doing that but it it was
 
06:14:57.410 --> 06:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
in the Public Utilities Commission a
 
06:14:58.788 --> 06:14:58.798 align:start position:0%
separate commission was not created
 
06:15:01.970 --> 06:15:01.980 align:start position:0%
there also was not study it was 21
 
06:15:04.190 --> 06:15:04.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities were automatically deemed
 
06:15:06.830 --> 06:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
competitive I also heard that the
 
06:15:08.750 --> 06:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
mapping is on a census block basis from
 
06:15:12.110 --> 06:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
the FCC in January that is not in fact
 
06:15:14.448 --> 06:15:14.458 align:start position:0%
the case in January the FCC produced its
 
06:15:17.030 --> 06:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
fabric mapping and that is on you can go
 
06:15:18.708 --> 06:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
see it it's right online on the FCC
 
06:15:21.830 --> 06:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
website that is pinpoints each household
 
06:15:24.708 --> 06:15:24.718 align:start position:0%
and lists the service pro the service
 
06:15:26.208 --> 06:15:26.218 align:start position:0%
available and the number of service
 
06:15:28.490 --> 06:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
providers available for each one of
 
06:15:29.990 --> 06:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
those households
 
06:15:32.208 --> 06:15:32.218 align:start position:0%
I think that is most of the questions
 
06:15:34.730 --> 06:15:34.740 align:start position:0%
that were asked I'm sure you have more
 
06:15:34.740 --> 06:15:35.990 align:start position:0%
that were asked I'm sure you have more
though

06:15:35.990 --> 06:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
though
 
06:15:38.750 --> 06:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative summer do you
 
06:15:40.430 --> 06:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
have a short question
 
06:15:42.948 --> 06:15:42.958 align:start position:0%
yeah this just pertains to uh to
 
06:15:44.750 --> 06:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
Consolidated expanding something like
 
06:15:47.330 --> 06:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
that as far as Last Mile the one
 
06:15:49.490 --> 06:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
question I have about that is if I have
 
06:15:52.610 --> 06:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
a company as it says industry or a farm
 
06:15:55.490 --> 06:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
let's say The Last Mile if the head in
 
06:15:57.048 --> 06:15:57.058 align:start position:0%
unit is at the end of the road and I
 
06:15:59.868 --> 06:15:59.878 align:start position:0%
have to run a line a mile to my house or
 
06:16:02.090 --> 06:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
a company to do that is that fall under
 
06:16:04.010 --> 06:16:04.020 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of the consumer to
 
06:16:06.650 --> 06:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
pay for the the dig out or the trench or
 
06:16:08.448 --> 06:16:08.458 align:start position:0%
the aerial for that instead of it
 
06:16:10.368 --> 06:16:10.378 align:start position:0%
falling on the rate pairs now is the
 
06:16:12.490 --> 06:16:12.500 align:start position:0%
consumer responsible for that
 
06:16:15.170 --> 06:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
yes for the most part so the consumer is
 
06:16:17.208 --> 06:16:17.218 align:start position:0%
responsible for the facilities so if
 
06:16:20.150 --> 06:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
polls or conduit are required generally
 
06:16:23.690 --> 06:16:23.700 align:start position:0%
the telephone company picks up the cable
 
06:16:23.700 --> 06:16:25.310 align:start position:0%
the telephone company picks up the cable
so

06:16:25.310 --> 06:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:16:26.810 --> 06:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
and that's a bit of a simplification
 
06:16:28.010 --> 06:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
because there's so many feet the
 
06:16:30.230 --> 06:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
consumer gets but in general that's the
 
06:16:30.240 --> 06:16:32.090 align:start position:0%
consumer gets but in general that's the
story

06:16:32.090 --> 06:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
story
 
06:16:34.190 --> 06:16:34.200 align:start position:0%
okay see no more questions thank you
 
06:16:36.410 --> 06:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony thank you
 
06:16:38.030 --> 06:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate it appreciate the opportunity
 
06:16:40.850 --> 06:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
we have one last speaker Mr David
 
06:16:40.860 --> 06:16:42.770 align:start position:0%
we have one last speaker Mr David
Marston

06:16:42.770 --> 06:16:42.780 align:start position:0%
Marston
 
06:16:46.010 --> 06:16:46.020 align:start position:0%
and Mr Marston I know you've requested
 
06:16:48.708 --> 06:16:48.718 align:start position:0%
seven to ten minutes but prorated can
 
06:16:50.868 --> 06:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
you keep it down to about one minute one
 
06:16:50.878 --> 06:16:52.190 align:start position:0%
you keep it down to about one minute one
minute

06:16:52.190 --> 06:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
minute
 
06:16:52.200 --> 06:16:52.910 align:start position:0%
minute
um

06:16:52.910 --> 06:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:56.390 --> 06:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
I feel like I have many issues that have
 
06:16:59.628 --> 06:16:59.638 align:start position:0%
not come up yet I I see that as being
 
06:17:01.128 --> 06:17:01.138 align:start position:0%
very difficult but I will burn through
 
06:17:04.310 --> 06:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
as best I can I'm David Marston just a
 
06:17:06.830 --> 06:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
ordinary subscriber to a landline I like
 
06:17:07.910 --> 06:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
a landline because it has better
 
06:17:09.650 --> 06:17:09.660 align:start position:0%
Fidelity and it works during a power
 
06:17:09.660 --> 06:17:10.910 align:start position:0%
Fidelity and it works during a power
failure

06:17:10.910 --> 06:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
failure
 
06:17:14.330 --> 06:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
uh back in ancient times the Telco is
 
06:17:16.548 --> 06:17:16.558 align:start position:0%
signed up to provide Universal service
 
06:17:18.410 --> 06:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
they knew what they were signing up for
 
06:17:21.288 --> 06:17:21.298 align:start position:0%
later on the FCC gave them a mechanism
 
06:17:23.628 --> 06:17:23.638 align:start position:0%
so that telcos could decline service to
 
06:17:25.788 --> 06:17:25.798 align:start position:0%
a particular individual subscriber that
 
06:17:29.570 --> 06:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
was just impossibly remote but now we're
 
06:17:32.750 --> 06:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
faced with this bill it says 97 coverage
 
06:17:35.270 --> 06:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
of the municipality is adequate instead
 
06:17:37.610 --> 06:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
of a hundred percent why is that what
 
06:17:40.310 --> 06:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
about the other three percent uh and
 
06:17:42.110 --> 06:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
possibly more this measurement called
 
06:17:43.788 --> 06:17:43.798 align:start position:0%
for in the bill only talks about
 
06:17:45.650 --> 06:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
households not about the farms and
 
06:17:48.590 --> 06:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
businesses or other users so the many
 
06:17:52.490 --> 06:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
possible losers in this dropping of the
 
06:17:54.590 --> 06:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
carrier of Last Resort only a handful of
 
06:17:58.810 --> 06:17:58.820 align:start position:0%
winners uh perhaps if the eye likes the
 
06:18:01.368 --> 06:18:01.378 align:start position:0%
Consolidated and other incumbent
 
06:18:02.750 --> 06:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
companies are in that much financial
 
06:18:05.628 --> 06:18:05.638 align:start position:0%
trouble we need something that's a
 
06:18:06.948 --> 06:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
broader view of what their financial
 
06:18:08.628 --> 06:18:08.638 align:start position:0%
issues are
 
06:18:12.110 --> 06:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
uh this bill talks exclusively about pot
 
06:18:14.448 --> 06:18:14.458 align:start position:0%
service plain old telephone service what
 
06:18:16.548 --> 06:18:16.558 align:start position:0%
you might call your landline without the
 
06:18:18.530 --> 06:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
extras that take it above the plane
 
06:18:21.530 --> 06:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
level you know voicemail and all that
 
06:18:23.810 --> 06:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
but there are many other kinds of
 
06:18:25.910 --> 06:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
services provided by those incumbent
 
06:18:27.230 --> 06:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
telephone companies including
 
06:18:29.270 --> 06:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
non-switched lease lines such as alarm
 
06:18:32.628 --> 06:18:32.638 align:start position:0%
circuits in fact there are several dozen
 
06:18:35.090 --> 06:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
different kinds of services yet the bill
 
06:18:37.190 --> 06:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
does not provide for consideration of
 
06:18:39.650 --> 06:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
the impact of the withdrawal of those
 
06:18:39.660 --> 06:18:40.970 align:start position:0%
the impact of the withdrawal of those
services

06:18:40.970 --> 06:18:40.980 align:start position:0%
services
 
06:18:43.788 --> 06:18:43.798 align:start position:0%
uh signaling over the Internet or over
 
06:18:47.990 --> 06:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
pots the potential Alternatives is less
 
06:18:50.570 --> 06:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
secure than using dedicated lease lines
 
06:18:52.430 --> 06:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
directly between the remote site and the
 
06:18:53.690 --> 06:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
communications up
 
06:18:55.730 --> 06:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
and cable companies like Comcast
 
06:18:58.070 --> 06:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
generally don't want to offer unbundled
 
06:18:59.868 --> 06:18:59.878 align:start position:0%
alarm circuits so you're taking business
 
06:19:02.150 --> 06:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
away from small businesses in New
 
06:19:03.890 --> 06:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the alarm companies that can
 
06:19:07.128 --> 06:19:07.138 align:start position:0%
use an unbundled alarm line when there
 
06:19:08.868 --> 06:19:08.878 align:start position:0%
is the incumbent telephone company
 
06:19:10.730 --> 06:19:10.740 align:start position:0%
providing that coverage
 
06:19:12.650 --> 06:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
these local companies are also more
 
06:19:14.330 --> 06:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
versatile regarding the types of
 
06:19:15.830 --> 06:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
conditions that they can monitor with
 
06:19:17.628 --> 06:19:17.638 align:start position:0%
their alarms
 
06:19:20.330 --> 06:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
the wired telecommunications Network
 
06:19:22.730 --> 06:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
that we are talking about possibly
 
06:19:25.368 --> 06:19:25.378 align:start position:0%
dismantling parts of is the foundation
 
06:19:27.650 --> 06:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
upon which other companies build the
 
06:19:29.930 --> 06:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
switched telephone Network possibly
 
06:19:33.170 --> 06:19:33.180 align:start position:0%
several layers on that the internet and
 
06:19:35.090 --> 06:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
other networks built on leased lines for
 
06:19:36.770 --> 06:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
example the Associated Press has a
 
06:19:38.150 --> 06:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
network that goes out to all their
 
06:19:41.150 --> 06:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
customers that is lease lines
 
06:19:43.010 --> 06:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
and if you change or disrupt that
 
06:19:45.350 --> 06:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
Network you need to talk about all the
 
06:19:47.510 --> 06:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
services not just the plain old
 
06:19:49.788 --> 06:19:49.798 align:start position:0%
telephone service that is called for in
 
06:19:52.070 --> 06:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
the bill measure all the availability of
 
06:19:53.810 --> 06:19:53.820 align:start position:0%
all the services
 
06:19:56.270 --> 06:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
there's no mention of any kind of notice
 
06:19:59.090 --> 06:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
of any type whatsoever not even after
 
06:20:01.670 --> 06:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
the petition is approved to the affected
 
06:20:04.490 --> 06:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
parties and first and foremost on the
 
06:20:06.048 --> 06:20:06.058 align:start position:0%
list of affected parties is the
 
06:20:08.270 --> 06:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
municipality itself because they are the
 
06:20:10.850 --> 06:20:10.860 align:start position:0%
most likely to need service in obscure
 
06:20:12.910 --> 06:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
parts of town the kinds of last miles
 
06:20:15.470 --> 06:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
that the incumbent Telco would be
 
06:20:18.890 --> 06:20:18.900 align:start position:0%
looking to drop most eagerly the state
 
06:20:20.510 --> 06:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire you think about the
 
06:20:22.368 --> 06:20:22.378 align:start position:0%
transportation department fish and games
 
06:20:25.250 --> 06:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
state parks they also require service in
 
06:20:27.530 --> 06:20:27.540 align:start position:0%
obscure parts of towns that might not
 
06:20:30.470 --> 06:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
have residential subscribers nearby but
 
06:20:32.868 --> 06:20:32.878 align:start position:0%
residential subscribers themselves are
 
06:20:35.990 --> 06:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
threatened possible losers if they're in
 
06:20:38.090 --> 06:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
the abandoned three percent or like me
 
06:20:39.708 --> 06:20:39.718 align:start position:0%
they want better Fidelity on their
 
06:20:39.718 --> 06:20:40.850 align:start position:0%
they want better Fidelity on their
Communications

06:20:40.850 --> 06:20:40.860 align:start position:0%
Communications
 
06:20:42.590 --> 06:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
other utilities
 
06:20:44.270 --> 06:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
and I would particularly call out
 
06:20:46.788 --> 06:20:46.798 align:start position:0%
electric companies remember I said that
 
06:20:49.010 --> 06:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
you get a much more secure network for
 
06:20:51.048 --> 06:20:51.058 align:start position:0%
monitoring and control when you have
 
06:20:53.448 --> 06:20:53.458 align:start position:0%
dedicated lease lines this is an
 
06:20:55.548 --> 06:20:55.558 align:start position:0%
important national security issue for
 
06:20:57.890 --> 06:20:57.900 align:start position:0%
the electric companies they do not want
 
06:20:59.930 --> 06:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
to control the grid over the Internet
 
06:21:02.810 --> 06:21:02.820 align:start position:0%
they want dedicated lease lines they
 
06:21:06.048 --> 06:21:06.058 align:start position:0%
have facilities such as dams and wind
 
06:21:08.930 --> 06:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
turbines and solar arrays that are out
 
06:21:10.730 --> 06:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
in obscure parts of town again those
 
06:21:13.128 --> 06:21:13.138 align:start position:0%
last miles that these telcos would be
 
06:21:14.750 --> 06:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
looking to drop
 
06:21:17.990 --> 06:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
also just in general businesses Academia
 
06:21:20.770 --> 06:21:20.780 align:start position:0%
non-profit organizations your usual
 
06:21:23.448 --> 06:21:23.458 align:start position:0%
non-residential telephone subscribers
 
06:21:25.730 --> 06:21:25.740 align:start position:0%
but other affected parties are
 
06:21:27.890 --> 06:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
developers trying to consider where they
 
06:21:30.470 --> 06:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
might build new facilities residential
 
06:21:33.288 --> 06:21:33.298 align:start position:0%
or non-residential in a municipality
 
06:21:37.368 --> 06:21:37.378 align:start position:0%
there is no notification required to any
 
06:21:39.350 --> 06:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
of these parties about what's going on
 
06:21:42.288 --> 06:21:42.298 align:start position:0%
according to the bill it just happens
 
06:21:44.150 --> 06:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
no announcement
 
06:21:46.548 --> 06:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
no chance to challenge the evidence
 
06:21:49.430 --> 06:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
being provided by the petitioner
 
06:21:53.208 --> 06:21:53.218 align:start position:0%
so we don't know what's going on when do
 
06:21:55.730 --> 06:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
we even have a matter of record that a
 
06:21:57.708 --> 06:21:57.718 align:start position:0%
person could check years in the future
 
06:21:59.690 --> 06:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
oh they dropped their carrier of Last
 
06:22:01.368 --> 06:22:01.378 align:start position:0%
Resort they don't have one in that
 
06:22:01.378 --> 06:22:02.750 align:start position:0%
Resort they don't have one in that
municipality

06:22:02.750 --> 06:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
06:22:06.590 --> 06:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh we have talked a bit with the various
 
06:22:08.570 --> 06:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
people testifying about municipalities
 
06:22:10.430 --> 06:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
as service territories
 
06:22:12.590 --> 06:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh let's clarify that there is a
 
06:22:14.690 --> 06:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
division of the state into Telco service
 
06:22:16.788 --> 06:22:16.798 align:start position:0%
areas it's a whole map tiling off the
 
06:22:18.890 --> 06:22:18.900 align:start position:0%
state and other than the dropping of
 
06:22:22.910 --> 06:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
dixville there has been no reduction in
 
06:22:25.190 --> 06:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
incumbent telephone service around the
 
06:22:27.770 --> 06:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
state now there might be fewer companies
 
06:22:30.470 --> 06:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
because of acquisitions by TDS
 
06:22:34.670 --> 06:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
but there is a number of different cases
 
06:22:34.680 --> 06:22:35.810 align:start position:0%
but there is a number of different cases
where

06:22:35.810 --> 06:22:35.820 align:start position:0%
where
 
06:22:39.948 --> 06:22:39.958 align:start position:0%
the map of the towns has a disjoint
 
06:22:42.110 --> 06:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
appearance relative to the map of the
 
06:22:44.628 --> 06:22:44.638 align:start position:0%
Telco service areas for example Grant
 
06:22:46.670 --> 06:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
State Communications provides pot
 
06:22:49.430 --> 06:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
service Plano telephone service in
 
06:22:51.650 --> 06:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton Deering Hillsboro New Boston
 
06:22:54.350 --> 06:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
even Dairy now you think Dairy you think
 
06:22:56.570 --> 06:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
oh that's a Consolidated territory but
 
06:22:58.310 --> 06:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
no parts of dairy because the Chester
 
06:23:00.350 --> 06:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
telephone company are actually served by
 
06:23:01.670 --> 06:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
Granite State
 
06:23:04.190 --> 06:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
uh Dunbarton same thing parts of Bowen
 
06:23:08.090 --> 06:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
Goffstown so the petition is a company
 
06:23:10.310 --> 06:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
like Dunbarton could say well we don't
 
06:23:11.990 --> 06:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
want to serve Ghost Town anymore this
 
06:23:13.910 --> 06:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
little sliver we're serving I believe
 
06:23:17.150 --> 06:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
it's actually less than three percent so
 
06:23:19.250 --> 06:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
they can show Numbers based on some
 
06:23:21.230 --> 06:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
other company and how they serve it's
 
06:23:24.368 --> 06:23:24.378 align:start position:0%
the rest of golf Scott Goffstown and say
 
06:23:27.230 --> 06:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
look there's enough service we can drop
 
06:23:29.750 --> 06:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
out Mr Marston are you if I read us some
 
06:23:31.670 --> 06:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
up please I've given you a lot more time
 
06:23:34.910 --> 06:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you I asked you to all right well
 
06:23:37.788 --> 06:23:37.798 align:start position:0%
there there are a number of other issues
 
06:23:40.548 --> 06:23:40.558 align:start position:0%
that I will submit in writing but I
 
06:23:42.650 --> 06:23:42.660 align:start position:0%
would ask where is the puc in all this
 
06:23:44.810 --> 06:23:44.820 align:start position:0%
it's it seems like there's a lot more
 
06:23:46.970 --> 06:23:46.980 align:start position:0%
concerns a lot more need to have
 
06:23:49.670 --> 06:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
interest represented and I am not
 
06:23:51.830 --> 06:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
calling simply for heavily amending the
 
06:23:51.840 --> 06:23:53.270 align:start position:0%
calling simply for heavily amending the
bill

06:23:53.270 --> 06:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:23:56.150 --> 06:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
changes of this type are so basic we
 
06:23:59.270 --> 06:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
need to step back and look at what do we
 
06:24:01.750 --> 06:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
actually achieve if we take away
 
06:24:03.890 --> 06:24:03.900 align:start position:0%
Universal service and the carrier of
 
06:24:05.750 --> 06:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
Last Resort and then look at the effect
 
06:24:08.150 --> 06:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
on the national Telecom Network and then
 
06:24:10.430 --> 06:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
go from there thank you
 
06:24:12.350 --> 06:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
thank you you did bring up some
 
06:24:16.250 --> 06:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:18.170 --> 06:24:18.180 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions thank you so much
 
06:24:21.110 --> 06:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
for your testimony I have no other pink
 
06:24:24.770 --> 06:24:24.780 align:start position:0%
bills here so we'll end this testimony
 
06:24:29.868 --> 06:24:29.878 align:start position:0%
on HB 257 and I'll close
 
06:24:32.990 --> 06:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
and ask representative poche for the
 
06:24:41.150 --> 06:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:42.890 --> 06:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
and thank you chair

although I have a question in my mind
 
06:28:54.230 --> 06:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
whether that's the right title for that
 
06:28:54.240 --> 06:28:55.250 align:start position:0%

06:32:14.090 --> 06:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
thank you chervos for the record my name
 
06:32:15.590 --> 06:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
is Rebecca McWilliams I'm a
 
06:32:18.830 --> 06:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
representative from South Concord also I
 
06:32:20.930 --> 06:32:20.940 align:start position:0%
am already late to present another bill
 
06:32:22.430 --> 06:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to present this quickly and
 
06:32:24.230 --> 06:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
then I need to duck out my apologies I
 
06:32:26.810 --> 06:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
know we're running a little bit late
 
06:32:28.670 --> 06:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
um you've already heard testimony on
 
06:32:31.670 --> 06:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill 234 regarding the practice of
 
06:32:34.310 --> 06:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
wreck sweeping consider this testimony a
 
06:32:36.350 --> 06:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
review and deeper discussion in regards
 
06:32:38.810 --> 06:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
to how we protect our constituents from
 
06:32:40.368 --> 06:32:40.378 align:start position:0%
potential conversion of their personal
 
06:32:40.378 --> 06:32:42.708 align:start position:0%
potential conversion of their personal
property

06:32:42.708 --> 06:32:42.718 align:start position:0%
property
 
06:32:45.650 --> 06:32:45.660 align:start position:0%
Rec sweeping authorizes State seizure of
 
06:32:47.510 --> 06:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
renewable energy property
 
06:32:49.548 --> 06:32:49.558 align:start position:0%
without the knowledge of or any
 
06:32:51.770 --> 06:32:51.780 align:start position:0%
compensation to New Hampshire businesses
 
06:32:54.230 --> 06:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
and residents this practice is known as
 
06:32:56.570 --> 06:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
wreck sweeping and it enables both
 
06:32:58.128 --> 06:32:58.138 align:start position:0%
private multi-billion dollar
 
06:33:00.350 --> 06:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
out-of-state corporations and in-state
 
06:33:02.510 --> 06:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
utilities to use this renewable energy
 
06:33:04.910 --> 06:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
in which New Hampshire residents invest
 
06:33:07.310 --> 06:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
to meet their obligations not the
 
06:33:08.930 --> 06:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
residence obligations these other
 
06:33:11.448 --> 06:33:11.458 align:start position:0%
corporations obligations under the
 
06:33:14.628 --> 06:33:14.638 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard or RPS
 
06:33:17.208 --> 06:33:17.218 align:start position:0%
in the case of a business this deprives
 
06:33:19.010 --> 06:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
the original investors of their right to
 
06:33:20.750 --> 06:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
Market their business as powered by
 
06:33:22.910 --> 06:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
renewable energy or even claim they use
 
06:33:24.410 --> 06:33:24.420 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy that they produce
 
06:33:26.390 --> 06:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
on site I'm thinking this could happen
 
06:33:29.448 --> 06:33:29.458 align:start position:0%
to a farm or to a manufacturing client
 
06:33:32.090 --> 06:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
any firm doing so is vulnerable to
 
06:33:33.590 --> 06:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
costly Federal Trade Commission
 
06:33:35.810 --> 06:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
enforcement action or even criminal
 
06:33:37.310 --> 06:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
prosecution by the New Hampshire
 
06:33:39.350 --> 06:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
attorney general and fines of up to a
 
06:33:41.330 --> 06:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars under the New
 
06:33:43.788 --> 06:33:43.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire consumer protection act this
 
06:33:46.128 --> 06:33:46.138 align:start position:0%
is not chump change if you are having
 
06:33:48.230 --> 06:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
your wreck swept and you still claim
 
06:33:50.510 --> 06:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
that you're producing renewable energy
 
06:33:52.788 --> 06:33:52.798 align:start position:0%
legal opinion obtained from multiple
 
06:33:54.770 --> 06:33:54.780 align:start position:0%
members of the New Hampshire bar affirms
 
06:33:56.990 --> 06:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
the state seizure constitutes an
 
06:33:59.390 --> 06:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional taking of private
 
06:34:01.670 --> 06:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
property and violates the taking clause
 
06:34:03.590 --> 06:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
in part 1 article 12 of the New
 
06:34:05.150 --> 06:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution
 
06:34:07.670 --> 06:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
this practice has
 
06:34:10.190 --> 06:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
in effect wrecked
 
06:34:13.070 --> 06:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
as in destroyed the New Hampshire Rec
 
06:34:16.010 --> 06:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
Renewable Energy Credit market and
 
06:34:17.750 --> 06:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
significantly reduce the need for
 
06:34:20.208 --> 06:34:20.218 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments which is
 
06:34:21.830 --> 06:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
a source of funding for the renewable
 
06:34:23.868 --> 06:34:23.878 align:start position:0%
energy fund our state's Soul mechanism
 
06:34:25.190 --> 06:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
for investing in the clean energy
 
06:34:25.200 --> 06:34:26.810 align:start position:0%
for investing in the clean energy
transition

06:34:26.810 --> 06:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
transition
 
06:34:28.368 --> 06:34:28.378 align:start position:0%
the argument that this could increase
 
06:34:31.010 --> 06:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
electricity bills is Pennywise and pound
 
06:34:32.750 --> 06:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
foolish as any possible increase
 
06:34:35.150 --> 06:34:35.160 align:start position:0%
resulting from rectifying this practice
 
06:34:37.190 --> 06:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
would be literally Pennies on the
 
06:34:39.530 --> 06:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
average monthly bill most likely around
 
06:34:42.788 --> 06:34:42.798 align:start position:0%
the order of six cents in contrast
 
06:34:45.048 --> 06:34:45.058 align:start position:0%
investments in renewable energy can pay
 
06:34:46.730 --> 06:34:46.740 align:start position:0%
off in the hundreds of millions of
 
06:34:49.250 --> 06:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
dollars in lower demand for out-of-state
 
06:34:52.490 --> 06:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels lower Peak demand improved
 
06:34:55.310 --> 06:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
air quality more jobs and increased
 
06:34:57.890 --> 06:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
in-state economic activity
 
06:35:00.830 --> 06:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
as the only lawyer on this committee I
 
06:35:03.110 --> 06:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
am very concerned that absent action in
 
06:35:05.330 --> 06:35:05.340 align:start position:0%
this session we may be allowing an
 
06:35:07.610 --> 06:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional statutory provision to
 
06:35:07.620 --> 06:35:08.510 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional statutory provision to
stand

06:35:08.510 --> 06:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
stand
 
06:35:10.788 --> 06:35:10.798 align:start position:0%
this could result after sending House
 
06:35:13.070 --> 06:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
Bill 234 to the floor
 
06:35:14.570 --> 06:35:14.580 align:start position:0%
without a committee recommendation
 
06:35:17.090 --> 06:35:17.100 align:start position:0%
should that happen we should at least
 
06:35:19.368 --> 06:35:19.378 align:start position:0%
provide the constitutionally necessary
 
06:35:21.830 --> 06:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
due process protection of adequate
 
06:35:25.010 --> 06:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
notice to our constituents the residents
 
06:35:27.770 --> 06:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
and businesses of this state where there
 
06:35:30.170 --> 06:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
is a state taking of property
 
06:35:32.690 --> 06:35:32.700 align:start position:0%
with a property right interest there
 
06:35:36.470 --> 06:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
must be at the minimum notification to
 
06:35:38.090 --> 06:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
the affected parties
 
06:35:40.310 --> 06:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
this applies even to putatively
 
06:35:41.930 --> 06:35:41.940 align:start position:0%
state-created interests or government
 
06:35:45.170 --> 06:35:45.180 align:start position:0%
assistance and the course the the case
 
06:35:48.530 --> 06:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
that I would cite for this is 1978 New

subcommittee if there are specific edits
 
06:38:42.048 --> 06:38:42.058 align:start position:0%
needed to pass this bill but this
 
06:38:44.150 --> 06:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
rectifies a problem of lack of notice
 
06:38:46.310 --> 06:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
and therefore a taking with no notice
 
06:38:48.948 --> 06:38:48.958 align:start position:0%

won't be able to stay for questions I
 
06:38:54.048 --> 06:38:54.058 align:start position:0%

06:39:08.270 --> 06:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:10.788 --> 06:39:10.798 align:start position:0%
so now we'll have a conversation no
 
06:39:14.150 --> 06:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
doubt with the honorable Lee oxenham
 
06:39:15.770 --> 06:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
from Plainfield
 
06:39:21.410 --> 06:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:23.570 --> 06:39:23.580 align:start position:0%
played a large part in the creation of
 
06:39:25.670 --> 06:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
this legislation so
 
06:39:27.110 --> 06:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we'll have an interesting
 
06:39:30.650 --> 06:39:30.660 align:start position:0%
conversation welcome back representative
 
06:39:32.570 --> 06:39:32.580 align:start position:0%
or former representative good to see you
 
06:39:35.448 --> 06:39:35.458 align:start position:0%
again thank you very much Mr chair and
 
06:39:37.070 --> 06:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
thank you colleagues for being here and
 
06:39:37.080 --> 06:39:38.810 align:start position:0%
thank you colleagues for being here and
listening

06:39:38.810 --> 06:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
listening
 
06:39:41.390 --> 06:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
I will focus my testimony today on the
 
06:39:44.868 --> 06:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
fiscal note to HB 263 and if you have
 
06:39:46.670 --> 06:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
that in front of you it might be helpful
 
06:39:50.330 --> 06:39:50.340 align:start position:0%
to um just bring that out and and have
 
06:39:52.548 --> 06:39:52.558 align:start position:0%
it next to you I seem to have left mine
 
06:39:57.350 --> 06:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:59.690 --> 06:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
first the note claims that there will be
 
06:40:01.850 --> 06:40:01.860 align:start position:0%
a fifteen thousand dollar cost attached
 
06:40:04.190 --> 06:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
to passing this bill do you need excuse
 
06:40:06.470 --> 06:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
me do you need a copy of the fiscal note
 
06:40:08.208 --> 06:40:08.218 align:start position:0%
um I think I have everything in my nose
 
06:40:10.310 --> 06:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
but it might it might be very helpful
 
06:40:12.230 --> 06:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I do appreciate that
 
06:40:14.030 --> 06:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know what I do with it thank you
 
06:40:16.250 --> 06:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds for providing
 
06:40:17.510 --> 06:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
06:40:19.548 --> 06:40:19.558 align:start position:0%
so the note claims that there's a
 
06:40:21.410 --> 06:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand dollar cost attached
 
06:40:23.628 --> 06:40:23.638 align:start position:0%
which is the reason presumptively why
 
06:40:26.030 --> 06:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
there's a fiscal note but there is no
 
06:40:28.610 --> 06:40:28.620 align:start position:0%
such requirement in this bill there is
 
06:40:30.890 --> 06:40:30.900 align:start position:0%
no necessary funding impact no increased
 
06:40:33.048 --> 06:40:33.058 align:start position:0%
burden or lessened benefit to any rate
 
06:40:36.048 --> 06:40:36.058 align:start position:0%
payer from this bill page three lines
 
06:40:38.090 --> 06:40:38.100 align:start position:0%
one through eight provides a method of
 
06:40:41.150 --> 06:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
notification via the utilities and the
 
06:40:43.448 --> 06:40:43.458 align:start position:0%
installers that cost the state nothing
 
06:40:46.850 --> 06:40:46.860 align:start position:0%
though it may minimally increase these
 
06:40:48.288 --> 06:40:48.298 align:start position:0%
companies costs by adding a
 
06:40:50.208 --> 06:40:50.218 align:start position:0%
communication requirement to documents
 
06:40:53.030 --> 06:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
they already pay for and mail out to
 
06:40:54.470 --> 06:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
their customers
 
06:40:56.690 --> 06:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
much more importantly this note raises a
 
06:40:58.368 --> 06:40:58.378 align:start position:0%
series of other issues
 
06:41:00.288 --> 06:41:00.298 align:start position:0%
the claim is made in the note that quote
 
06:41:02.208 --> 06:41:02.218 align:start position:0%
in addition getting this list of
 
06:41:04.128 --> 06:41:04.138 align:start position:0%
specific people who are interconnected
 
06:41:06.708 --> 06:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
and not rec registered will not be an
 
06:41:08.990 --> 06:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
easy undertaking and cannot be
 
06:41:09.000 --> 06:41:10.548 align:start position:0%
easy undertaking and cannot be
guaranteed

06:41:10.548 --> 06:41:10.558 align:start position:0%
guaranteed
 
06:41:12.230 --> 06:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
not the kind of language you usually see
 
06:41:13.730 --> 06:41:13.740 align:start position:0%
in a fiscal note
 
06:41:16.670 --> 06:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
and it's also
 
06:41:20.390 --> 06:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
raises a fundamental question I've I've
 
06:41:24.350 --> 06:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
circulated a document which has to do
 
06:41:26.628 --> 06:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
with the administrative rules and you'll
 
06:41:29.570 --> 06:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
see three arrows on the front page that
 
06:41:32.090 --> 06:41:32.100 align:start position:0%
will point you to the points that I will
 
06:41:34.190 --> 06:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
be making now the rec sweeping
 
06:41:37.150 --> 06:41:37.160 align:start position:0%
regulations codified as puc
 
06:41:40.810 --> 06:41:40.820 align:start position:0%
2503.04 B1 B1 through two
 
06:41:44.090 --> 06:41:44.100 align:start position:0%
specifically require the distribution
 
06:41:48.170 --> 06:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
utilities to provide the puc with the
 
06:41:51.770 --> 06:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
name of everyone quote who is
 
06:41:55.548 --> 06:41:55.558 align:start position:0%
interconnected and not rec registered
 
06:41:59.030 --> 06:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
as well as the location of their system
 
06:42:01.970 --> 06:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
which in the vast majority of cases will
 
06:42:04.670 --> 06:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
also be the home or business address to
 
06:42:07.368 --> 06:42:07.378 align:start position:0%
which this notice should be sent
 
06:42:09.590 --> 06:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
so the claim that is made in this note
 
06:42:11.990 --> 06:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
that getting the list
 
06:42:14.090 --> 06:42:14.100 align:start position:0%
will not be an easy undertaking and
 
06:42:16.070 --> 06:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
cannot be guaranteed
 
06:42:19.368 --> 06:42:19.378 align:start position:0%
raises a rather fundamental question are
 
06:42:20.890 --> 06:42:20.900 align:start position:0%
they not collecting this information
 
06:42:23.330 --> 06:42:23.340 align:start position:0%
have they not been collecting the
 
06:42:26.208 --> 06:42:26.218 align:start position:0%
information for the last decade are they
 
06:42:28.430 --> 06:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
not ensuring that the utilities are
 
06:42:30.830 --> 06:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
complying with their own administrative
 
06:42:30.840 --> 06:42:36.708 align:start position:0%
complying with their own administrative
rules

06:42:36.708 --> 06:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:39.048 --> 06:42:39.058 align:start position:0%
one can only posit that the fiscal note
 
06:42:41.810 --> 06:42:41.820 align:start position:0%
is based on representations made to OLS
 
06:42:44.090 --> 06:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
by the department of energy
 
06:42:46.430 --> 06:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
and the statement
 
06:42:50.628 --> 06:42:50.638 align:start position:0%
ostensibly refers to their difficulty in
 
06:42:54.288 --> 06:42:54.298 align:start position:0%
accessing this data it is the case that
 
06:42:56.948 --> 06:42:56.958 align:start position:0%
the regulation which is currently online
 
06:43:00.288 --> 06:43:00.298 align:start position:0%
continues to cite the puc and continues
 
06:43:01.788 --> 06:43:01.798 align:start position:0%
to cite the 20
 
06:43:01.798 --> 06:43:02.330 align:start position:0%
to cite the 20
um

06:43:02.330 --> 06:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:43:06.350 --> 06:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
the capacity Factor at 20 for solar
 
06:43:09.288 --> 06:43:09.298 align:start position:0%
which was uh changed recently I think in
 
06:43:11.030 --> 06:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
the last biennium
 
06:43:14.570 --> 06:43:14.580 align:start position:0%
nevertheless uh these these matters are
 
06:43:16.430 --> 06:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
not the essential point the essential
 
06:43:17.868 --> 06:43:17.878 align:start position:0%
point is
 
06:43:20.448 --> 06:43:20.458 align:start position:0%
location and name which are the two
 
06:43:22.970 --> 06:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
things required for notice are required
 
06:43:26.030 --> 06:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
that data must be in the hands of the
 
06:43:29.868 --> 06:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
puc and we should be able to get it and
 
06:43:32.628 --> 06:43:32.638 align:start position:0%
the doe should be able to get it

06:43:45.770 --> 06:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
generation attributes must not have been
 
06:43:48.410 --> 06:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
used for compliance with any similar
 
06:43:50.690 --> 06:43:50.700 align:start position:0%
requirements of another non-federal
 
06:43:55.270 --> 06:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction or otherwise sold retired
 
06:43:59.030 --> 06:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
claimed or represented as part of any
 
06:44:02.030 --> 06:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
other electrical energy output thermal
 
06:44:05.208 --> 06:44:05.218 align:start position:0%
energy output portfolio or sale
 
06:44:07.910 --> 06:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
now I would submit that that language
 
06:44:09.890 --> 06:44:09.900 align:start position:0%
fully substantiates the testimony
 
06:44:14.030 --> 06:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
presented last week under hb234 that
 
06:44:16.250 --> 06:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
the state is fully aware that the
 
06:44:18.288 --> 06:44:18.298 align:start position:0%
renewable attributes are the property
 
06:44:20.690 --> 06:44:20.700 align:start position:0%
interest they recognize that they can't
 
06:44:23.208 --> 06:44:23.218 align:start position:0%
use those renewable attributes and no
 
06:44:26.390 --> 06:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
one else can unless there is exclusive
 
06:44:30.048 --> 06:44:30.058 align:start position:0%
control over the property interest so it
 
06:44:33.070 --> 06:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
says directly in the um in the handout
 
06:44:36.830 --> 06:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
that unless these conditions are met
 
06:44:40.970 --> 06:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
they cannot be used and that is the
 
06:44:43.368 --> 06:44:43.378 align:start position:0%
thrust of the argument here that they
 
06:44:46.850 --> 06:44:46.860 align:start position:0%
have been stripped from their owners the
 
06:44:49.910 --> 06:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
customer generator they have been seized
 
06:44:51.830 --> 06:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
by the state and they have been
 
06:44:54.350 --> 06:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
allocated to private corporations and
 
06:44:56.868 --> 06:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
the public utilities without notice
 
06:45:00.170 --> 06:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
without compensation this is a
 
06:45:02.690 --> 06:45:02.700 align:start position:0%
significant legal constitutional issue
 
06:45:05.650 --> 06:45:05.660 align:start position:0%
and it has been raised previously
 
06:45:07.910 --> 06:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
when this bill came before this
 
06:45:10.730 --> 06:45:10.740 align:start position:0%
Committee in a previous biennium that
 
06:45:12.590 --> 06:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
those who are affected should take the
 
06:45:13.910 --> 06:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
matter to court
 
06:45:17.030 --> 06:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
well taking the matter to court is an
 
06:45:20.330 --> 06:45:20.340 align:start position:0%
extremely costly Venture extremely
 
06:45:22.490 --> 06:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
costly in the hundreds of thousands of
 
06:45:25.490 --> 06:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
dollars and that cost would have to be
 
06:45:28.190 --> 06:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
borne by the customer generators
 
06:45:31.010 --> 06:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
and the state would have to defend
 
06:45:32.708 --> 06:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
against this
 
06:45:36.470 --> 06:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
unprincipled I would claim action and
 
06:45:37.850 --> 06:45:37.860 align:start position:0%
that will be on the cost of the
 
06:45:37.860 --> 06:45:39.230 align:start position:0%
that will be on the cost of the
taxpayers

06:45:39.230 --> 06:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
06:45:42.350 --> 06:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
the legislature can fix this and I think
 
06:45:44.628 --> 06:45:44.638 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee that would look at this
 
06:45:48.650 --> 06:45:48.660 align:start position:0%
bill and consider it in the in
 
06:45:50.990 --> 06:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
in a way that it has not been looked at
 
06:45:51.000 --> 06:45:52.310 align:start position:0%
in a way that it has not been looked at
previously

06:45:52.310 --> 06:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
previously
 
06:45:54.770 --> 06:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
and I will take some responsibility for
 
06:45:57.048 --> 06:45:57.058 align:start position:0%
that because it is an incredibly complex
 
06:45:59.570 --> 06:45:59.580 align:start position:0%
issue and I've been working on this for
 
06:46:01.910 --> 06:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh you helped me out chair Vos is it
 
06:46:03.650 --> 06:46:03.660 align:start position:0%
four years or is it six years we've been
 
06:46:05.690 --> 06:46:05.700 align:start position:0%
working on this bill
 
06:46:08.330 --> 06:46:08.340 align:start position:0%
um but it's it's a long time a long time
 
06:46:12.110 --> 06:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
but I think I think we by having taken
 
06:46:15.410 --> 06:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
the initial steps for legal prosecution
 
06:46:18.530 --> 06:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
having obtained the legal opinions of
 
06:46:19.968 --> 06:46:19.978 align:start position:0%
numerous members of the New Hampshire
 
06:46:19.978 --> 06:46:21.110 align:start position:0%
numerous members of the New Hampshire
bar

06:46:21.110 --> 06:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
bar
 
06:46:25.910 --> 06:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's now clear that this statute should
 
06:46:30.468 --> 06:46:30.478 align:start position:0%
not stand that it does represent a
 
06:46:33.288 --> 06:46:33.298 align:start position:0%
taking by the state without notice
 
06:46:37.610 --> 06:46:37.620 align:start position:0%
clearly without compensation none
 
06:46:41.208 --> 06:46:41.218 align:start position:0%
and that cannot stand by the terms of
 
06:46:43.190 --> 06:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
numerous New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
06:46:46.548 --> 06:46:46.558 align:start position:0%
cases so please save the taxpayers the
 
06:46:46.558 --> 06:46:47.390 align:start position:0%
cases so please save the taxpayers the
money

06:46:47.390 --> 06:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
money
 
06:46:49.730 --> 06:46:49.740 align:start position:0%
save the customer generators
 
06:46:52.670 --> 06:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
and let's resolve this issue and so the
 
06:46:55.250 --> 06:46:55.260 align:start position:0%
future St committees will not have to
 
06:46:57.170 --> 06:46:57.180 align:start position:0%
consider it yet again
 
06:47:00.948 --> 06:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:03.288 --> 06:47:03.298 align:start position:0%
I was certain you would
 
06:47:05.390 --> 06:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm glad you would thank
 
06:47:05.400 --> 06:47:06.288 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm glad you would thank
you

06:47:06.288 --> 06:47:06.298 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:47:08.390 --> 06:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
so I will start with a couple of
 
06:47:11.150 --> 06:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
questions regarding the
 
06:47:12.830 --> 06:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire code of administrative
 
06:47:15.890 --> 06:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
rules handout that you sent it that you
 
06:47:19.010 --> 06:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:21.468 --> 06:47:21.478 align:start position:0%
you stated that
 
06:47:21.478 --> 06:47:22.628 align:start position:0%
you stated that
Rule

06:47:22.628 --> 06:47:22.638 align:start position:0%
Rule
 
06:47:27.110 --> 06:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
2503.04 net meter and credit States
 
06:47:30.410 --> 06:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:30.420 --> 06:47:32.708 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:47:32.708 --> 06:47:32.718 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
06:47:35.690 --> 06:47:35.700 align:start position:0%
and Class 2 certificate credits for the
 
06:47:37.730 --> 06:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
production of electricity
 
06:47:40.310 --> 06:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
that is net metered
 
06:47:46.128 --> 06:47:46.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:49.368 --> 06:47:49.378 align:start position:0%
you okay provided that the certificates
 
06:47:51.530 --> 06:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
or generation attributes have not been
 
06:47:53.448 --> 06:47:53.458 align:start position:0%
used for compliance with any similar
 
06:47:56.448 --> 06:47:56.458 align:start position:0%
requirements doesn't that simply say
 
06:47:58.670 --> 06:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
06:48:02.270 --> 06:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
if you abandon your Rex then the
 
06:48:06.288 --> 06:48:06.298 align:start position:0%
utility can use those
 
06:48:09.288 --> 06:48:09.298 align:start position:0%
wrecks or you or use those credits
 
06:48:11.930 --> 06:48:11.940 align:start position:0%
that's what that language says
 
06:48:11.940 --> 06:48:14.270 align:start position:0%
that's what that language says
uh

06:48:14.270 --> 06:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:48:17.390 --> 06:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
I I certainly disagree and and most
 
06:48:19.430 --> 06:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
importantly there is no case of
 
06:48:21.650 --> 06:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
Abandonment here abandonment has a very
 
06:48:24.350 --> 06:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
legal meaning and it requires property
 
06:48:27.650 --> 06:48:27.660 align:start position:0%
to have been out of use for periods of
 
06:48:30.770 --> 06:48:30.780 align:start position:0%
years there's no issue here of property
 
06:48:33.530 --> 06:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
abandonment the issue is people who know
 
06:48:36.530 --> 06:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
nothing about this situation who have
 
06:48:40.190 --> 06:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
invested tens of thousands of dollars in
 
06:48:43.310 --> 06:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
creating generation capacity to assist
 
06:48:45.288 --> 06:48:45.298 align:start position:0%
the state in moving forward with the
 
06:48:48.048 --> 06:48:48.058 align:start position:0%
clean energy transition who have have
 
06:48:50.628 --> 06:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
worked hard and and done what they
 
06:48:52.190 --> 06:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
thought they were doing
 
06:48:55.270 --> 06:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
have had their property
 
06:48:59.150 --> 06:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
effectively stolen from them by state
 
06:48:59.160 --> 06:49:00.170 align:start position:0%
effectively stolen from them by state
action

06:49:00.170 --> 06:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
action
 
06:49:02.810 --> 06:49:02.820 align:start position:0%
and it has been this fig leaf that we're
 
06:49:04.368 --> 06:49:04.378 align:start position:0%
going to help the ratepayers because
 
06:49:07.010 --> 06:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
we're lowering rates for the utilities
 
06:49:10.430 --> 06:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
an infinitesimal amount and almost half
 
06:49:12.230 --> 06:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
of that amount going to private
 
06:49:14.448 --> 06:49:14.458 align:start position:0%
corporations like Constellation Energy
 
06:49:17.150 --> 06:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
and Direct Energy which has nothing to
 
06:49:20.208 --> 06:49:20.218 align:start position:0%
do with the rate payers or the rates
 
06:49:22.010 --> 06:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
that they pay that simply helps their
 
06:49:23.288 --> 06:49:23.298 align:start position:0%
bottom line
 
06:49:23.298 --> 06:49:25.010 align:start position:0%
bottom line
so

06:49:25.010 --> 06:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:49:27.590 --> 06:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
so my next question is about the
 
06:49:28.910 --> 06:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
language that says distribution
 
06:49:31.128 --> 06:49:31.138 align:start position:0%
utilities shall submit to the commission
 
06:49:32.330 --> 06:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
the following
 
06:49:35.208 --> 06:49:35.218 align:start position:0%
a list of color customer cited sources
 
06:49:38.448 --> 06:49:38.458 align:start position:0%
eligible for et cetera et cetera Etc
 
06:49:40.850 --> 06:49:40.860 align:start position:0%
doesn't that mean that the customer has
 
06:49:40.860 --> 06:49:42.350 align:start position:0%
doesn't that mean that the customer has
to

06:49:42.350 --> 06:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:49:46.368 --> 06:49:46.378 align:start position:0%
contact the utility and indicate that
 
06:49:48.830 --> 06:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
they are a source
 
06:49:51.650 --> 06:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
of eligible class one certification if
 
06:49:53.930 --> 06:49:53.940 align:start position:0%
they don't do that then
 
06:49:57.170 --> 06:49:57.180 align:start position:0%
the utility has no obligation to submit
 
06:49:58.910 --> 06:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
to the commission their name because
 
06:50:01.490 --> 06:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
they don't have it
 
06:50:03.350 --> 06:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
isn't that true
 
06:50:05.330 --> 06:50:05.340 align:start position:0%
of it
 
06:50:08.208 --> 06:50:08.218 align:start position:0%
it's a little more complicated than that
 
06:50:11.690 --> 06:50:11.700 align:start position:0%
and the other um fig leaf that has been
 
06:50:13.310 --> 06:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
put forward here is that these people
 
06:50:16.548 --> 06:50:16.558 align:start position:0%
received rebates anyone who received a
 
06:50:19.310 --> 06:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
rebate there will be a rebate
 
06:50:21.890 --> 06:50:21.900 align:start position:0%
application with their name and their
 
06:50:24.890 --> 06:50:24.900 align:start position:0%
address so any affected customer
 
06:50:27.708 --> 06:50:27.718 align:start position:0%
generator who received a rebate that
 
06:50:29.930 --> 06:50:29.940 align:start position:0%
information would be on file with the
 
06:50:33.590 --> 06:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
utility again you're suggesting that
 
06:50:35.510 --> 06:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
someone who knows nothing of this
 
06:50:37.430 --> 06:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
provision should be taking affirmative
 
06:50:40.070 --> 06:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
action to reach out to the utility to
 
06:50:41.868 --> 06:50:41.878 align:start position:0%
inform them of information that they
 
06:50:43.610 --> 06:50:43.620 align:start position:0%
should know
 
06:50:45.830 --> 06:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
yeah actually what I was suggesting is
 
06:50:49.070 --> 06:50:49.080 align:start position:0%
that the language of this rule says that
 
06:50:51.048 --> 06:50:51.058 align:start position:0%
it's up to the customer to notify you
 
06:50:52.910 --> 06:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
the utility
 
06:50:56.208 --> 06:50:56.218 align:start position:0%
that's the language of the
 
06:50:58.190 --> 06:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
of the rule
 
06:51:00.170 --> 06:51:00.180 align:start position:0%
I also have a question about you said
 
06:51:00.180 --> 06:51:02.150 align:start position:0%
I also have a question about you said
that

06:51:02.150 --> 06:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:51:05.090 --> 06:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
the last section of the bill imposes no
 
06:51:07.128 --> 06:51:07.138 align:start position:0%
cost on the state because the
 
06:51:08.810 --> 06:51:08.820 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities would be the ones
 
06:51:11.208 --> 06:51:11.218 align:start position:0%
who had would be required to do the
 
06:51:11.218 --> 06:51:12.708 align:start position:0%
who had would be required to do the
mailings

06:51:12.708 --> 06:51:12.718 align:start position:0%
mailings
 
06:51:15.468 --> 06:51:15.478 align:start position:0%
but distribution utilities can recover
 
06:51:18.590 --> 06:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
their costs and rates so
 
06:51:20.628 --> 06:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
there might not be any direct costs to
 
06:51:22.730 --> 06:51:22.740 align:start position:0%
the state but that fifteen thousand
 
06:51:24.350 --> 06:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
dollars is going to be recovered from
 
06:51:26.930 --> 06:51:26.940 align:start position:0%
customers no matter what
 
06:51:30.230 --> 06:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
does that kind of cost six cents on the
 
06:51:33.468 --> 06:51:33.478 align:start position:0%
average dollar uh residence average bill
 
06:51:35.570 --> 06:51:35.580 align:start position:0%
does that come under a fiscal note
 
06:51:38.868 --> 06:51:38.878 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes or costs to the state
 
06:51:41.810 --> 06:51:41.820 align:start position:0%
are they not oh I think fiscal notes can
 
06:51:44.230 --> 06:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
be costs in general I don't think
 
06:51:48.310 --> 06:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
I've certainly never seen that but uh
 
06:51:51.410 --> 06:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
another another issue which the legal
 
06:51:53.628 --> 06:51:53.638 align:start position:0%
experts who could be brought in to
 
06:51:55.850 --> 06:51:55.860 align:start position:0%
consider this matter such that we would
 
06:51:59.350 --> 06:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
not be imposing dramatic costs not
 
06:52:03.288 --> 06:52:03.298 align:start position:0%
infinitesimal costs on taxpayers might
 
06:52:05.390 --> 06:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
be a better way to go forward than to
 
06:52:06.708 --> 06:52:06.718 align:start position:0%
ask me questions that are better
 
06:52:09.650 --> 06:52:09.660 align:start position:0%
directed to a lawyer maybe the doe can
 
06:52:11.930 --> 06:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
shed some light on that question since
 
06:52:14.150 --> 06:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
the doe presented this information I
 
06:52:15.770 --> 06:52:15.780 align:start position:0%
don't think we will see a solution from
 
06:52:15.780 --> 06:52:16.670 align:start position:0%
don't think we will see a solution from
them

06:52:16.670 --> 06:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:52:19.250 --> 06:52:19.260 align:start position:0%
okay representative Summers has a
 
06:52:19.260 --> 06:52:20.030 align:start position:0%
okay representative Summers has a
question

06:52:20.030 --> 06:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:52:21.770 --> 06:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
06:52:24.110 --> 06:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question now I'll be the first
 
06:52:26.628 --> 06:52:26.638 align:start position:0%
to admit I am not a lawyer I have
 
06:52:29.810 --> 06:52:29.820 align:start position:0%
questions though on page two of lines 25
 
06:52:32.510 --> 06:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
through 28 in regards to the Federal
 
06:52:35.628 --> 06:52:35.638 align:start position:0%
Trade Commission and then uh excuse me
 
06:52:37.430 --> 06:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
are you on the handout or the bill the
 
06:52:39.770 --> 06:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
actual bill the actual bill page two
 
06:52:44.090 --> 06:52:44.100 align:start position:0%
lines 25-28 thank you and on here this
 
06:52:46.070 --> 06:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
is the meat of the penalty where it says
 
06:52:48.968 --> 06:52:48.978 align:start position:0%
that uh the Federal Trade Commission can
 
06:52:48.978 --> 06:52:50.890 align:start position:0%
that uh the Federal Trade Commission can
basically

06:52:50.890 --> 06:52:50.900 align:start position:0%
basically
 
06:52:54.230 --> 06:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
find you guilty of false advertising if
 
06:52:55.788 --> 06:52:55.798 align:start position:0%
you mark your home businesses running a
 
06:52:57.468 --> 06:52:57.478 align:start position:0%
renewable energy that you generate
 
06:52:59.510 --> 06:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
failure to comply with resulting FTC
 
06:53:01.310 --> 06:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
order May subject to your business civil
 
06:53:03.230 --> 06:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
penalties up to ten thousand for every
 
06:53:05.990 --> 06:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
day the violation continues so then I
 
06:53:07.070 --> 06:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
was looking this up under the Federal
 
06:53:08.868 --> 06:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
Trade Commission and I found the Federal
 
06:53:11.390 --> 06:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
Trade Commission states that the uh the
 
06:53:13.490 --> 06:53:13.500 align:start position:0%
commission can seek civil penalties if
 
06:53:16.010 --> 06:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
it proves the company knew the conduct
 
06:53:19.730 --> 06:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
was unfair or deceptive in violation
 
06:53:24.468 --> 06:53:24.478 align:start position:0%
of a particular FTC Act and the FTC
 
06:53:27.948 --> 06:53:27.958 align:start position:0%
already issued a written decision that
 
06:53:30.708 --> 06:53:30.718 align:start position:0%
such conduct is unfair or deceptive do
 
06:53:32.868 --> 06:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
you know if there's actually an FTC act
 
06:53:36.048 --> 06:53:36.058 align:start position:0%
or a written uh fine Court finding on
 
06:53:39.048 --> 06:53:39.058 align:start position:0%
any of the of this pertaining to uh
 
06:53:41.868 --> 06:53:41.878 align:start position:0%
solar Renewables yes and it has been
 
06:53:43.850 --> 06:53:43.860 align:start position:0%
presented previously and was referenced
 
06:53:46.368 --> 06:53:46.378 align:start position:0%
in the HB 234 I didn't bring that
 
06:53:48.230 --> 06:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
information with me today because I was
 
06:53:49.850 --> 06:53:49.860 align:start position:0%
quite certain that the chair would
 
06:53:52.250 --> 06:53:52.260 align:start position:0%
direct me to speak to this bill rather
 
06:53:53.930 --> 06:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
than that bill
 
06:53:58.190 --> 06:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
um so yes there are cases and in fact
 
06:54:02.628 --> 06:54:02.638 align:start position:0%
it's the FTC guidance which cites legal
 
06:54:06.590 --> 06:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
cases again it's it's not a likely
 
06:54:06.600 --> 06:54:09.110 align:start position:0%
cases again it's it's not a likely
um

06:54:09.110 --> 06:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:11.270 --> 06:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
I I think what what you're looking at
 
06:54:13.788 --> 06:54:13.798 align:start position:0%
when they say the FCC can do the
 
06:54:16.430 --> 06:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
following it's it is um
 
06:54:19.368 --> 06:54:19.378 align:start position:0%
not exclusive it is it it it it it gives
 
06:54:20.930 --> 06:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
you things that it can do but it doesn't
 
06:54:23.628 --> 06:54:23.638 align:start position:0%
say that's all it can do and because of
 
06:54:26.090 --> 06:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
the guidance that we have discovered and
 
06:54:29.390 --> 06:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
which I can send you the reference to uh
 
06:54:32.708 --> 06:54:32.718 align:start position:0%
we know that in fact they the
 
06:54:34.610 --> 06:54:34.620 align:start position:0%
presumption is
 
06:54:37.368 --> 06:54:37.378 align:start position:0%
you can't even have a picture of the
 
06:54:39.948 --> 06:54:39.958 align:start position:0%
solar array of your business
 
06:54:43.128 --> 06:54:43.138 align:start position:0%
and say nothing about it being renewably
 
06:54:46.670 --> 06:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
run because the presumption is that if
 
06:54:48.948 --> 06:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
you had the picture with your solar
 
06:54:52.850 --> 06:54:52.860 align:start position:0%
panels that you were the presumption is
 
06:54:54.890 --> 06:54:54.900 align:start position:0%
that you're advertising yourself as
 
06:54:57.708 --> 06:54:57.718 align:start position:0%
being run by renewable energy but in
 
06:54:59.868 --> 06:54:59.878 align:start position:0%
fact if you've sold your wrecks or if
 
06:55:01.788 --> 06:55:01.798 align:start position:0%
they've been taken from you
 
06:55:06.110 --> 06:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
you are falsely making that claim
 
06:55:07.850 --> 06:55:07.860 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:55:09.890 --> 06:55:09.900 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
06:55:11.930 --> 06:55:11.940 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
06:55:13.850 --> 06:55:13.860 align:start position:0%
um actually this is a comment directed
 
06:55:17.030 --> 06:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
towards uh you although I truly support
 
06:55:19.430 --> 06:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill there seemed to
 
06:55:21.170 --> 06:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
be some fairly large discrepancies with
 
06:55:22.850 --> 06:55:22.860 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note and the information
 
06:55:24.948 --> 06:55:24.958 align:start position:0%
presented and I'd like to ask for a
 
06:55:28.310 --> 06:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to address these issues
 
06:55:32.990 --> 06:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:34.850 --> 06:55:34.860 align:start position:0%
representative randles I know you had
 
06:55:37.490 --> 06:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
your hand up but you're a a co-sponsor
 
06:55:39.288 --> 06:55:39.298 align:start position:0%
of this bill so we're not allowed you're
 
06:55:44.448 --> 06:55:44.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:44.458 --> 06:55:45.530 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:55:45.530 --> 06:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:55:48.650 --> 06:55:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:50.048 --> 06:55:50.058 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
06:55:52.670 --> 06:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
representative muns thank you um no just
 
06:55:54.350 --> 06:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
to follow up on representative Wendy
 
06:55:56.208 --> 06:55:56.218 align:start position:0%
Thomas I'm I'm assuming that if we did
 
06:55:58.430 --> 06:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
have a subcommittee that we could also
 
06:56:01.730 --> 06:56:01.740 align:start position:0%
look at the exact language that's
 
06:56:03.830 --> 06:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
um included on
 
06:56:05.930 --> 06:56:05.940 align:start position:0%
page two which is the actual notice
 
06:56:05.940 --> 06:56:07.490 align:start position:0%
page two which is the actual notice
correct

06:56:07.490 --> 06:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
correct
 
06:56:09.530 --> 06:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
I mean the the important point of this
 
06:56:11.390 --> 06:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation is that notice
 
06:56:14.930 --> 06:56:14.940 align:start position:0%
should be provided the exact wording of
 
06:56:16.310 --> 06:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
the notice is something that we can
 
06:56:18.770 --> 06:56:18.780 align:start position:0%
certainly talk about in a subcommittee I
 
06:56:20.750 --> 06:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
would think
 
06:56:22.548 --> 06:56:22.558 align:start position:0%
yeah so some committee could certainly
 
06:56:25.670 --> 06:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
talk about that thank you absolutely
 
06:56:27.890 --> 06:56:27.900 align:start position:0%
any additional questions
 
06:56:27.900 --> 06:56:30.310 align:start position:0%
any additional questions
for

06:56:30.310 --> 06:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:56:32.570 --> 06:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
non-representative The Honorable
 
06:56:32.580 --> 06:56:35.830 align:start position:0%
non-representative The Honorable
representative

06:56:35.830 --> 06:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:38.930 --> 06:56:38.940 align:start position:0%
representative cloje has a question
 
06:56:43.968 --> 06:56:43.978 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair thank you uh MS oksan
 
06:56:46.010 --> 06:56:46.020 align:start position:0%
if this does go
 
06:56:48.288 --> 06:56:48.298 align:start position:0%
through this bill
 
06:56:51.948 --> 06:56:51.958 align:start position:0%
does it not notify in the consumer
 
06:56:54.890 --> 06:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
generator and if they still do not does
 
06:56:56.930 --> 06:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
not do nothing do they have a legal
 
06:56:58.850 --> 06:56:58.860 align:start position:0%
recourse now
 
06:57:06.170 --> 06:57:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:07.968 --> 06:57:07.978 align:start position:0%
it's a very interesting question it's
 
06:57:09.530 --> 06:57:09.540 align:start position:0%
never occurred to me that someone who
 
06:57:11.750 --> 06:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
was notified would
 
06:57:16.128 --> 06:57:16.138 align:start position:0%
not be interested in taking protective
 
06:57:16.138 --> 06:57:17.628 align:start position:0%
not be interested in taking protective
action

06:57:17.628 --> 06:57:17.638 align:start position:0%
action
 
06:57:17.638 --> 06:57:19.788 align:start position:0%
action
um

06:57:19.788 --> 06:57:19.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:21.830 --> 06:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
once again perhaps the subcommittee
 
06:57:24.468 --> 06:57:24.478 align:start position:0%
could resolve that issue for us
 
06:57:26.270 --> 06:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
it's a good question
 
06:57:26.280 --> 06:57:27.830 align:start position:0%
it's a good question
follow-up

06:57:27.830 --> 06:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:57:29.628 --> 06:57:29.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:57:29.638 --> 06:57:32.110 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

06:57:32.110 --> 06:57:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:34.730 --> 06:57:34.740 align:start position:0%
myself reading it
 
06:57:39.530 --> 06:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
if I wasn't taking the wrecks now or not
 
06:57:39.540 --> 06:57:41.090 align:start position:0%
if I wasn't taking the wrecks now or not
metering

06:57:41.090 --> 06:57:41.100 align:start position:0%
metering
 
06:57:46.310 --> 06:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
the attributes I would look discard it
 
06:57:47.990 --> 06:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
the question
 
06:57:50.090 --> 06:57:50.100 align:start position:0%
to you is
 
06:57:50.100 --> 06:57:52.070 align:start position:0%
to you is
would

06:57:52.070 --> 06:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:57:54.830 --> 06:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
the sweat sweeping still
 
06:57:59.810 --> 06:57:59.820 align:start position:0%
be allowed to those if they're abandoned
 
06:58:06.850 --> 06:58:06.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:09.530 --> 06:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
I wish the the word abandoned it had
 
06:58:11.208 --> 06:58:11.218 align:start position:0%
never come up because it's it's such a
 
06:58:13.128 --> 06:58:13.138 align:start position:0%
red herring it really has nothing to do
 
06:58:16.090 --> 06:58:16.100 align:start position:0%
with the issue when a customer generator
 
06:58:18.830 --> 06:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
invests in their equipment and they
 
06:58:21.590 --> 06:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
establish it on their property there is
 
06:58:24.770 --> 06:58:24.780 align:start position:0%
a presumption that they have the
 
06:58:27.410 --> 06:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
property that they have the renewable
 
06:58:30.048 --> 06:58:30.058 align:start position:0%
energy that is being generated that they
 
06:58:30.058 --> 06:58:31.128 align:start position:0%
energy that is being generated that they
can

06:58:31.128 --> 06:58:31.138 align:start position:0%
can
 
06:58:34.190 --> 06:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
if they sell the house they can say oh
 
06:58:36.288 --> 06:58:36.298 align:start position:0%
and look it's you know has renewable
 
06:58:36.298 --> 06:58:38.690 align:start position:0%
and look it's you know has renewable
energy

06:58:38.690 --> 06:58:38.700 align:start position:0%
energy
 
06:58:42.770 --> 06:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
if a person is informed that actually
 
06:58:45.530 --> 06:58:45.540 align:start position:0%
the state is making it impossible for
 
06:58:47.990 --> 06:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
them to even claim that they've been
 
06:58:50.030 --> 06:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
using renewable energy for the 10 years
 
06:58:51.890 --> 06:58:51.900 align:start position:0%
that they've been living on the property
 
06:58:54.230 --> 06:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
and thinking that they were using
 
06:58:58.190 --> 06:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:59.930 --> 06:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
I think I went down to rabbit hole and
 
06:59:03.048 --> 06:59:03.058 align:start position:0%
and lost where that sentence was going
 
06:59:05.708 --> 06:59:05.718 align:start position:0%
um the
 
06:59:07.788 --> 06:59:07.798 align:start position:0%
central issue is the renewable
 
06:59:09.288 --> 06:59:09.298 align:start position:0%
attributes which are the property
 
06:59:12.650 --> 06:59:12.660 align:start position:0%
interest they have never been lost
 
06:59:15.468 --> 06:59:15.478 align:start position:0%
they were generated they were created at
 
06:59:17.570 --> 06:59:17.580 align:start position:0%
the moment of generation and they had
 
06:59:20.930 --> 06:59:20.940 align:start position:0%
been taken by the state action away from
 
06:59:23.030 --> 06:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
the customer generator without their
 
06:59:25.910 --> 06:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge the notification enables them
 
06:59:30.288 --> 06:59:30.298 align:start position:0%
to know that this is occurring now is a
 
06:59:32.330 --> 06:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
another issue which you've certainly
 
06:59:34.670 --> 06:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
created in my mind which is what happens
 
06:59:36.230 --> 06:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
to the person who doesn't read the
 
06:59:39.770 --> 06:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
notification you know they they will be
 
06:59:41.810 --> 06:59:41.820 align:start position:0%
in the same position that they are now
 
06:59:45.650 --> 06:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
if the statute is allowed to stand but
 
06:59:48.230 --> 06:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's certainly my hope that out of this
 
06:59:50.510 --> 06:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee there will be a recognition
 
06:59:53.448 --> 06:59:53.458 align:start position:0%
that this is a provision which no longer
 
06:59:56.330 --> 06:59:56.340 align:start position:0%
should be in New Hampshire law and no
 
07:00:01.010 --> 07:00:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:03.708 --> 07:00:03.718 align:start position:0%
could the chair indulge me
 
07:00:05.930 --> 07:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
I will indulge you since we do have time
 
07:00:07.730 --> 07:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:00:07.740 --> 07:00:09.230 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

07:00:09.230 --> 07:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:00:12.190 --> 07:00:12.200 align:start position:0%
so there's actually a third
 
07:00:14.510 --> 07:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
thing that hasn't been discussed until
 
07:00:16.968 --> 07:00:16.978 align:start position:0%
now if I understand it right
 
07:00:19.250 --> 07:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
so the customer generator
 
07:00:23.030 --> 07:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
now knowing they have attributes
 
07:00:25.910 --> 07:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
had because they've been taken they
 
07:00:27.230 --> 07:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
still haven't at this time I believe
 
07:00:29.930 --> 07:00:29.940 align:start position:0%
they haven't have not been slept oh they
 
07:00:32.570 --> 07:00:32.580 align:start position:0%
have been if you have if you are a
 
07:00:34.490 --> 07:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
customer generator your renewable
 
07:00:36.708 --> 07:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
attributes have been swept from the
 
07:00:41.208 --> 07:00:41.218 align:start position:0%
moment that you started operating
 
07:00:41.218 --> 07:00:43.310 align:start position:0%
moment that you started operating
foreign

07:00:43.310 --> 07:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
07:00:46.010 --> 07:00:46.020 align:start position:0%
did that answer your question no may I
 
07:00:46.020 --> 07:00:47.570 align:start position:0%
did that answer your question no may I
continue

07:00:47.570 --> 07:00:47.580 align:start position:0%
continue
 
07:00:49.548 --> 07:00:49.558 align:start position:0%
well we don't I'm good we don't engage
 
07:00:52.788 --> 07:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
in debate we we ask questions it was a
 
07:00:55.310 --> 07:00:55.320 align:start position:0%
question for clarification understanding
 
07:00:58.850 --> 07:00:58.860 align:start position:0%
all right I'll allow it and
 
07:01:01.368 --> 07:01:01.378 align:start position:0%
the customer generator
 
07:01:04.070 --> 07:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
if it's not if they are not
 
07:01:06.048 --> 07:01:06.058 align:start position:0%
net metered
 
07:01:08.030 --> 07:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
they are
 
07:01:10.010 --> 07:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
this is under the net metering statute
 
07:01:13.850 --> 07:01:13.860 align:start position:0%
then there if they are net meter
 
07:01:18.010 --> 07:01:18.020 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:22.310 --> 07:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
if they don't sell their wrecks
 
07:01:24.708 --> 07:01:24.718 align:start position:0%
they just keep getting them
 
07:01:27.830 --> 07:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
is is that that question is is that the
 
07:01:30.170 --> 07:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
point you're trying to make so if they
 
07:01:32.570 --> 07:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
want to keep them
 
07:01:35.690 --> 07:01:35.700 align:start position:0%
they are not available to be slipped
 
07:01:37.190 --> 07:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
it may
 
07:01:40.850 --> 07:01:40.860 align:start position:0%
thank you it it is it is the case that
 
07:01:42.650 --> 07:01:42.660 align:start position:0%
by registering
 
07:01:44.628 --> 07:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
and spending that money and having that
 
07:01:46.190 --> 07:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
industrial meter in your front yard and
 
07:01:48.110 --> 07:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
all of those onerous things by doing
 
07:01:50.390 --> 07:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
that you can protect your renewable
 
07:01:53.150 --> 07:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
attributes from being swept any longer
 
07:01:55.730 --> 07:01:55.740 align:start position:0%
you it you're protecting yourself from
 
07:01:57.948 --> 07:01:57.958 align:start position:0%
the moment at which they stop doing it
 
07:02:00.048 --> 07:02:00.058 align:start position:0%
but they're already
 
07:02:05.030 --> 07:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:08.030 --> 07:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
representative partial has a question
 
07:02:09.948 --> 07:02:09.958 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
07:02:12.110 --> 07:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
um do I understand correctly that the
 
07:02:14.090 --> 07:02:14.100 align:start position:0%
two parts way ma uh do I understand
 
07:02:14.100 --> 07:02:15.288 align:start position:0%
two parts way ma uh do I understand
correctly

07:02:15.288 --> 07:02:15.298 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
07:02:18.230 --> 07:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
that having Rex does not necessarily
 
07:02:20.448 --> 07:02:20.458 align:start position:0%
mean that I need to sell those racks I
 
07:02:22.968 --> 07:02:22.978 align:start position:0%
can register the Rex and decide to
 
07:02:25.670 --> 07:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
retain them for my own enjoyment
 
07:02:28.070 --> 07:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
whatever that may be
 
07:02:30.530 --> 07:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
you could if you wanted to fill out all
 
07:02:32.510 --> 07:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
the forms have the work done on your
 
07:02:35.030 --> 07:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
property pay the money you could do that
 
07:02:38.868 --> 07:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
and get the satisfaction of nobody being
 
07:02:41.510 --> 07:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
able to use this provision of law
 
07:02:42.708 --> 07:02:42.718 align:start position:0%
against you
 
07:02:44.750 --> 07:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and a follow-up I may
 
07:02:46.190 --> 07:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
07:02:46.200 --> 07:02:48.170 align:start position:0%
go ahead
um

07:02:48.170 --> 07:02:48.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:02:51.288 --> 07:02:51.298 align:start position:0%
if I want to take these wrecks I do need
 
07:02:52.788 --> 07:02:52.798 align:start position:0%
to purchase equipment in order to
 
07:02:55.910 --> 07:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
measure a meter is aware
 
07:02:58.368 --> 07:02:58.378 align:start position:0%
uh however
 
07:03:00.468 --> 07:03:00.478 align:start position:0%
when the wrecks are swept
 
07:03:03.530 --> 07:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
they use their information independent
 
07:03:05.750 --> 07:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
of what of what that meter says so
 
07:03:08.510 --> 07:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
there's an expense some say maybe an
 
07:03:11.208 --> 07:03:11.218 align:start position:0%
owner's expense on me in order to
 
07:03:12.590 --> 07:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
register those racks that the power
 
07:03:15.890 --> 07:03:15.900 align:start position:0%
company does not incur by sweeping them
 
07:03:17.868 --> 07:03:17.878 align:start position:0%
yes and if you were if you wanted to
 
07:03:19.610 --> 07:03:19.620 align:start position:0%
sell your wrecks you could only sell
 
07:03:22.070 --> 07:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
your excess production the the net that
 
07:03:23.750 --> 07:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
you put out whereas when they're
 
07:03:25.250 --> 07:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
sweeping the wrecks they take everything
 
07:03:27.468 --> 07:03:27.478 align:start position:0%
even what you used inside your business
 
07:03:29.868 --> 07:03:29.878 align:start position:0%
or inside your home because it's a
 
07:03:31.610 --> 07:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
calculation based on the name plate
 
07:03:34.310 --> 07:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
times the capacity Factor times the
 
07:03:39.770 --> 07:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
number of hours of a year and that is
 
07:03:43.368 --> 07:03:43.378 align:start position:0%
a number which is the maximum possible
 
07:03:45.350 --> 07:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:03:47.930 --> 07:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
representative muns asked a question so
 
07:03:52.010 --> 07:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up to that question if um if
 
07:03:55.190 --> 07:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
someone chose to sell their wrecks then
 
07:03:57.708 --> 07:03:57.718 align:start position:0%
that would be income that they would
 
07:04:00.230 --> 07:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
have to help them offset some of their
 
07:04:03.048 --> 07:04:03.058 align:start position:0%
other expenses their any utility bills
 
07:04:04.910 --> 07:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
that they're paying or other expenses
 
07:04:07.910 --> 07:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
correct yes I'll take my own facility
 
07:04:09.410 --> 07:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
just as
 
07:04:12.468 --> 07:04:12.478 align:start position:0%
you know as an example I produce one
 
07:04:14.810 --> 07:04:14.820 align:start position:0%
megawatt a year
 
07:04:17.510 --> 07:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
so going through all this in order to
 
07:04:20.510 --> 07:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
get one wreck
 
07:04:23.330 --> 07:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
when I don't even think they were
 
07:04:25.730 --> 07:04:25.740 align:start position:0%
selling for twenty dollars
 
07:04:29.510 --> 07:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
I just did there there's no reason why
 
07:04:29.520 --> 07:04:31.548 align:start position:0%
I just did there there's no reason why
any

07:04:31.548 --> 07:04:31.558 align:start position:0%
any
 
07:04:33.830 --> 07:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
reasonably uh
 
07:04:36.170 --> 07:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
penny pinching
 
07:04:40.670 --> 07:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
good Yankee would would undertake such a
 
07:04:40.680 --> 07:04:43.070 align:start position:0%
good Yankee would would undertake such a
measure

07:04:43.070 --> 07:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
measure
 
07:04:44.930 --> 07:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
so that's probably why 40 percent of
 
07:04:48.048 --> 07:04:48.058 align:start position:0%
people eligible don't bother to collect
 
07:04:49.788 --> 07:04:49.798 align:start position:0%
their wrecks correct
 
07:04:52.128 --> 07:04:52.138 align:start position:0%
it's not about collecting
 
07:04:55.128 --> 07:04:55.138 align:start position:0%
wrecks are a representation of the
 
07:04:56.868 --> 07:04:56.878 align:start position:0%
renewable attributes the renewable
 
07:04:59.090 --> 07:04:59.100 align:start position:0%
attributes are there they're produced
 
07:05:01.610 --> 07:05:01.620 align:start position:0%
just every time electricity is produced
 
07:05:03.890 --> 07:05:03.900 align:start position:0%
by that generator the question is who
 
07:05:06.708 --> 07:05:06.718 align:start position:0%
owns those renewable attributes and for
 
07:05:09.650 --> 07:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
I would say most of the 40 percent have
 
07:05:12.890 --> 07:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
no idea of even what a wreck is much
 
07:05:14.570 --> 07:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
less that they've or a renewable
 
07:05:17.330 --> 07:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
attribute or the fact that they do not
 
07:05:19.968 --> 07:05:19.978 align:start position:0%
in fact generate renewable energy in
 
07:05:21.410 --> 07:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
their home or business they think they
 
07:05:21.420 --> 07:05:24.410 align:start position:0%
their home or business they think they
do

07:05:24.410 --> 07:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:24.420 --> 07:05:25.730 align:start position:0%
 
okay

07:05:25.730 --> 07:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:05:27.650 --> 07:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions I'd like
 
07:05:29.930 --> 07:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
to call forward and I'd like to thank
 
07:05:32.150 --> 07:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
the honorable uh thank you the oxenham
 
07:05:33.948 --> 07:05:33.958 align:start position:0%
for her testimony here I'd like to call
 
07:05:35.990 --> 07:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
forward Griffin Roberge from the
 
07:05:38.208 --> 07:05:38.218 align:start position:0%
Department of energy to give us their
 
07:05:52.510 --> 07:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:52.520 --> 07:05:54.288 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

07:05:54.288 --> 07:05:54.298 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
07:05:56.570 --> 07:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman both members of the
 
07:05:59.570 --> 07:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
committee uh Griffin Roberts again from
 
07:06:00.708 --> 07:06:00.718 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of energy
 
07:06:03.590 --> 07:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
the department is neutral on this bill
 
07:06:05.270 --> 07:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
is introduced
 
07:06:07.250 --> 07:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
um the bill requires the department to
 
07:06:09.350 --> 07:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
notify customer generators who are not
 
07:06:12.110 --> 07:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
rec certified under class one and two
 
07:06:14.270 --> 07:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
that their production has been credited
 
07:06:16.368 --> 07:06:16.378 align:start position:0%
under the statutory provision that was
 
07:06:19.910 --> 07:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
subject to a public hearing on House
 
07:06:22.430 --> 07:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
Bill 234 I believe
 
07:06:22.440 --> 07:06:23.208 align:start position:0%
Bill 234 I believe
um

07:06:23.208 --> 07:06:23.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:06:25.968 --> 07:06:25.978 align:start position:0%
under section two of the bill doe is
 
07:06:27.948 --> 07:06:27.958 align:start position:0%
required to issue an annual notice to
 
07:06:29.208 --> 07:06:29.218 align:start position:0%
customer generators that their
 
07:06:31.190 --> 07:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
production has been credited against
 
07:06:34.128 --> 07:06:34.138 align:start position:0%
electric providers RPS obligations under
 
07:06:36.830 --> 07:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
classes one and two the notice shall
 
07:06:38.448 --> 07:06:38.458 align:start position:0%
inform customer generators of their
 
07:06:40.070 --> 07:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
options to get certified to create
 
07:06:41.990 --> 07:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
wrecks and the consequences of having
 
07:06:43.810 --> 07:06:43.820 align:start position:0%
their production credited
 
07:06:46.850 --> 07:06:46.860 align:start position:0%
the other part of section 2 page one
 
07:06:46.860 --> 07:06:48.128 align:start position:0%
the other part of section 2 page one
lines

07:06:48.128 --> 07:06:48.138 align:start position:0%
lines
 
07:06:51.230 --> 07:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
17-24 also require any person who
 
07:06:53.208 --> 07:06:53.218 align:start position:0%
interconnects as a customer generator at
 
07:06:55.128 --> 07:06:55.138 align:start position:0%
a later date be noticed that the
 
07:06:56.930 --> 07:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
prediction that their production will be
 
07:06:58.548 --> 07:06:58.558 align:start position:0%
credited unless they become Rec
 
07:07:00.830 --> 07:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
certified the notice will inform
 
07:07:02.330 --> 07:07:02.340 align:start position:0%
customer generators again of their
 
07:07:04.610 --> 07:07:04.620 align:start position:0%
options to get certified uh to create
 
07:07:06.170 --> 07:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
wrecks and the consequences of having
 
07:07:09.530 --> 07:07:09.540 align:start position:0%
their production credited
 
07:07:13.190 --> 07:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
um page one lines 28
 
07:07:15.830 --> 07:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
to throughout the entirety of page two
 
07:07:18.170 --> 07:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
uh include language that Doe must
 
07:07:19.850 --> 07:07:19.860 align:start position:0%
prominently include and they're written
 
07:07:22.310 --> 07:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
notice to these customer generators and
 
07:07:25.788 --> 07:07:25.798 align:start position:0%
then on page three sub paragraph d uh
 
07:07:28.010 --> 07:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
permits doe to fulfill its duties under
 
07:07:30.350 --> 07:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
the bill by passing this written notice
 
07:07:31.968 --> 07:07:31.978 align:start position:0%
responsibility onto electric
 
07:07:34.128 --> 07:07:34.138 align:start position:0%
distribution companies
 
07:07:35.510 --> 07:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
um Dewey does want to note some
 
07:07:37.250 --> 07:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
observations from the bills fiscal note
 
07:07:39.910 --> 07:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
which I know has been mentioned already
 
07:07:43.730 --> 07:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
Department would agree that it is would
 
07:07:45.468 --> 07:07:45.478 align:start position:0%
contend that it is in fact difficult to
 
07:07:47.150 --> 07:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
get accurate data on how many customer
 
07:07:49.368 --> 07:07:49.378 align:start position:0%
generators are interconnected and are
 
07:07:51.708 --> 07:07:51.718 align:start position:0%
not producing Rex the interconnection
 
07:07:54.110 --> 07:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
process is largely done through
 
07:07:56.570 --> 07:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
utilities when when customer generators
 
07:07:59.750 --> 07:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
interconnect they are not filing regular
 
07:08:00.890 --> 07:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
information with the New Hampshire
 
07:08:02.810 --> 07:08:02.820 align:start position:0%
Department of energy utilities are the
 
07:08:04.430 --> 07:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
ones going out and interconnecting these
 
07:08:07.310 --> 07:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
resources onto their infrastructure
 
07:08:09.048 --> 07:08:09.058 align:start position:0%
um per the bills fiscal note we do
 
07:08:11.390 --> 07:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
assume that there are roughly 14 000
 
07:08:13.850 --> 07:08:13.860 align:start position:0%
customer generators in the state that
 
07:08:15.890 --> 07:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
are that may be eligible to produce Rex
 
07:08:17.750 --> 07:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
but again due to the inconsistencies and
 
07:08:19.610 --> 07:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
how this data is kept
 
07:08:21.350 --> 07:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
um we can't provide an actual figure for
 
07:08:23.150 --> 07:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
how many customer generators are not
 
07:08:26.090 --> 07:08:26.100 align:start position:0%
producing class one or two Rex
 
07:08:27.530 --> 07:08:27.540 align:start position:0%
um we also as I mentioned we do not
 
07:08:28.610 --> 07:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
receive any information about
 
07:08:30.230 --> 07:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
interconnections as this is done
 
07:08:32.510 --> 07:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
entirely through the utilities
 
07:08:34.788 --> 07:08:34.798 align:start position:0%
um again per the bills fiscal note
 
07:08:36.288 --> 07:08:36.298 align:start position:0%
getting a list of specific customer
 
07:08:38.030 --> 07:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
generators who are interconnected not
 
07:08:40.490 --> 07:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
registered will not be an easy
 
07:08:43.548 --> 07:08:43.558 align:start position:0%
undertaking there is no shared form of
 
07:08:45.110 --> 07:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
identification between the data
 
07:08:47.510 --> 07:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
available between doe and the data held
 
07:08:50.690 --> 07:08:50.700 align:start position:0%
by utilities matching up these lists
 
07:08:52.788 --> 07:08:52.798 align:start position:0%
will be a significant undertaking for
 
07:08:54.350 --> 07:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
administrative staff within our
 
07:08:56.030 --> 07:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
sustainable energy division who already
 
07:08:58.128 --> 07:08:58.138 align:start position:0%
have a Litany of other tasks to do on a
 
07:08:59.410 --> 07:08:59.420 align:start position:0%
day-to-day basis
 
07:09:01.910 --> 07:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
based again on the fiscal note and this
 
07:09:04.430 --> 07:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
is just for the actual mailings and the
 
07:09:07.670 --> 07:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
postage and whatnot for this notice
 
07:09:09.770 --> 07:09:09.780 align:start position:0%
requirement the annual cost to send
 
07:09:11.868 --> 07:09:11.878 align:start position:0%
these notices would be around fifteen
 
07:09:15.170 --> 07:09:15.180 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars should doe be unable to
 
07:09:16.910 --> 07:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
come up with the funds for just the
 
07:09:19.788 --> 07:09:19.798 align:start position:0%
administrative mailing costs or the
 
07:09:21.350 --> 07:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
administrative staffing needs in order
 
07:09:24.230 --> 07:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
to complete this um the responsibility
 
07:09:26.628 --> 07:09:26.638 align:start position:0%
would likely be passed on to electric
 
07:09:28.610 --> 07:09:28.620 align:start position:0%
distribution companies under the
 
07:09:30.490 --> 07:09:30.500 align:start position:0%
provisions on page three
 
07:09:32.930 --> 07:09:32.940 align:start position:0%
utilities as is noted would likely pass
 
07:09:36.110 --> 07:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
that cost onto their ratepayers to cover
 
07:09:38.390 --> 07:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
the cost for these annual mailings
 
07:09:38.400 --> 07:09:38.990 align:start position:0%
the cost for these annual mailings
um

07:09:38.990 --> 07:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:09:41.448 --> 07:09:41.458 align:start position:0%
regarding the written notice itself
 
07:09:43.310 --> 07:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
which is
 
07:09:46.548 --> 07:09:46.558 align:start position:0%
prominently on page two the language
 
07:09:48.468 --> 07:09:48.478 align:start position:0%
does not reference any statutory
 
07:09:50.868 --> 07:09:50.878 align:start position:0%
Provisions or resources for customer
 
07:09:53.810 --> 07:09:53.820 align:start position:0%
generators to understand the RPS most
 
07:09:57.708 --> 07:09:57.718 align:start position:0%
significantly lines 18 to 28 on page two
 
07:09:59.990 --> 07:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
indicate that the customer generator may
 
07:10:02.690 --> 07:10:02.700 align:start position:0%
be undertaking illegal activity and is
 
07:10:04.730 --> 07:10:04.740 align:start position:0%
subject to civil penalties of up to ten
 
07:10:06.590 --> 07:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a day the notice
 
07:10:08.570 --> 07:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
includes no reference to any federal
 
07:10:10.850 --> 07:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
rule or statute allowing for the Federal
 
07:10:12.468 --> 07:10:12.478 align:start position:0%
Trade Commission to undertake this
 
07:10:15.170 --> 07:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
action I I think the department would
 
07:10:16.730 --> 07:10:16.740 align:start position:0%
contend that the threat of a ten
 
07:10:19.548 --> 07:10:19.558 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar fine will alarm electric
 
07:10:22.190 --> 07:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
customers in the state and they will
 
07:10:23.990 --> 07:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
want more information as to where that
 
07:10:27.170 --> 07:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
Authority is derived and as previously
 
07:10:29.510 --> 07:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
discussed in the house bill 234 public
 
07:10:32.270 --> 07:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
hearing getting Rec certified is not an
 
07:10:34.070 --> 07:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
easy task there are a lack of
 
07:10:36.288 --> 07:10:36.298 align:start position:0%
independent monitors in the state to do
 
07:10:38.750 --> 07:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
indiv to do in-person Rec certification
 
07:10:40.850 --> 07:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
for the for facilities there's also
 
07:10:42.948 --> 07:10:42.958 align:start position:0%
there are existing options to get
 
07:10:44.990 --> 07:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
inverse murders or utility meters to
 
07:10:47.330 --> 07:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
measure production but again doing so
 
07:10:50.090 --> 07:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
comes at an additional cost additionally
 
07:10:51.650 --> 07:10:51.660 align:start position:0%
customer generators may have already
 
07:10:54.410 --> 07:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
decided not to register as they see the
 
07:10:56.690 --> 07:10:56.700 align:start position:0%
value of Class 2 Rex is pretty low
 
07:10:59.628 --> 07:10:59.638 align:start position:0%
because of a high Supply so it may not
 
07:11:02.090 --> 07:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
be financially viable for them to spend
 
07:11:05.208 --> 07:11:05.218 align:start position:0%
these upfront costs to get Rec certified
 
07:11:07.910 --> 07:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
pay for ongoing monitoring services but
 
07:11:09.890 --> 07:11:09.900 align:start position:0%
only get a very modest income from
 
07:11:11.628 --> 07:11:11.638 align:start position:0%
selling your wrecks
 
07:11:11.638 --> 07:11:12.230 align:start position:0%
selling your wrecks
um

07:11:12.230 --> 07:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:11:14.810 --> 07:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
finally the notice implies at its
 
07:11:19.990 --> 07:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
conclusion on page two lines 29 to 36
 
07:11:22.490 --> 07:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
that customer generators should get Rec
 
07:11:24.590 --> 07:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
certified and then not sell their wrecks
 
07:11:27.770 --> 07:11:27.780 align:start position:0%
to electric suppliers this notice could
 
07:11:30.170 --> 07:11:30.180 align:start position:0%
potentially have cut again have customer
 
07:11:32.750 --> 07:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
generators pay significant cost for rec
 
07:11:34.430 --> 07:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
certification but they receive no
 
07:11:36.170 --> 07:11:36.180 align:start position:0%
benefit from that certification as they
 
07:11:38.530 --> 07:11:38.540 align:start position:0%
cannot sell their wrecks to electric
 
07:11:41.390 --> 07:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
electric suppliers as is being advocated
 
07:11:43.548 --> 07:11:43.558 align:start position:0%
in the notice it might also confuse
 
07:11:45.110 --> 07:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
customers because they might believe
 
07:11:47.510 --> 07:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
that the notice constitutes or
 
07:11:49.490 --> 07:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
represents a legal requirement to
 
07:11:51.110 --> 07:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
register in order to create wrecks under
 
07:11:53.990 --> 07:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
the RPS when no such requirement for
 
07:11:55.850 --> 07:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
interconnection exists in order to get
 
07:11:59.750 --> 07:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
Rec certified and with that I'm happy to
 
07:12:01.788 --> 07:12:01.798 align:start position:0%
take any questions I will start out and
 
07:12:04.610 --> 07:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
say I am not an attorney I will be very
 
07:12:06.230 --> 07:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
limited in what I can offer about the
 
07:12:08.090 --> 07:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of things but more
 
07:12:09.948 --> 07:12:09.958 align:start position:0%
than willing to take a shot at any
 
07:12:12.350 --> 07:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
questions that are offered
 
07:12:15.288 --> 07:12:15.298 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate your testimony uh
 
07:12:17.628 --> 07:12:17.638 align:start position:0%
representative partial has a question
 
07:12:20.030 --> 07:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
it's like a chair of those
 
07:12:21.770 --> 07:12:21.780 align:start position:0%
um once again I'm hearing about the
 
07:12:24.230 --> 07:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
depressed prices on uh
 
07:12:26.030 --> 07:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
the value of Iraq
 
07:12:28.430 --> 07:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
and I am thus thinking about just supply
 
07:12:31.610 --> 07:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
and demand if I'm out there selling
 
07:12:35.208 --> 07:12:35.218 align:start position:0%
apples as an example for an analogy and
 
07:12:37.490 --> 07:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
the guy next door gets his apples that's
 
07:12:39.708 --> 07:12:39.718 align:start position:0%
by sneaking my yard at night
 
07:12:42.890 --> 07:12:42.900 align:start position:0%
and be able to sell them without any
 
07:12:46.128 --> 07:12:46.138 align:start position:0%
over cost from my tree it's not going to
 
07:12:47.810 --> 07:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
depress the price of what I can charge
 
07:12:49.910 --> 07:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
for my apples so thank you for the
 
07:12:52.310 --> 07:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
question so apples aside I'm just
 
07:12:53.750 --> 07:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
shifting it back to class two right well
 
07:12:56.030 --> 07:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
that's okay I'm using the same analogy
 
07:12:57.948 --> 07:12:57.958 align:start position:0%
here so thank you fine
 
07:13:00.948 --> 07:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
um but class two Rex uh prices you know
 
07:13:02.990 --> 07:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
I think in talking with our sustainable
 
07:13:05.090 --> 07:13:05.100 align:start position:0%
energy division typically vary between
 
07:13:08.090 --> 07:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
three dollars to six dollars a wreck and
 
07:13:10.250 --> 07:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
again a wreck is measured based on one
 
07:13:12.948 --> 07:13:12.958 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour of production so for a
 
07:13:15.230 --> 07:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
small residential system over the course
 
07:13:17.390 --> 07:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
of a year that output can be very very
 
07:13:19.430 --> 07:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
small so
 
07:13:23.570 --> 07:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the uh reduced cost of
 
07:13:25.968 --> 07:13:25.978 align:start position:0%
Class 2 Rex there are a number of
 
07:13:28.610 --> 07:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
factors that go into that obviously the
 
07:13:30.350 --> 07:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
crediting mechanism that currently
 
07:13:34.070 --> 07:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
exists as was proposed in House Bill 234
 
07:13:37.610 --> 07:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
plays A Part the overall abundance of
 
07:13:41.090 --> 07:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
Class 2 Rex also plays a role as well as
 
07:13:42.830 --> 07:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
well as the current obligation level for
 
07:13:45.230 --> 07:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
Class 2 playwrack player play a role
 
07:13:45.240 --> 07:13:46.190 align:start position:0%
Class 2 playwrack player play a role
sorry

07:13:46.190 --> 07:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
07:13:48.368 --> 07:13:48.378 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:13:55.788 --> 07:13:55.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:58.368 --> 07:13:58.378 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has one thank you
 
07:14:00.708 --> 07:14:00.718 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and I just want to
 
07:14:02.510 --> 07:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
make sure I'm clear on something you
 
07:14:05.570 --> 07:14:05.580 align:start position:0%
said earlier when you were talking about
 
07:14:08.690 --> 07:14:08.700 align:start position:0%
um that the utilities do know who these
 
07:14:10.490 --> 07:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
customer generators are
 
07:14:10.500 --> 07:14:11.510 align:start position:0%
customer generators are
but

07:14:11.510 --> 07:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:14:13.250 --> 07:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
there's just some interoperability
 
07:14:16.788 --> 07:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
issues with doe with the systems At Doe
 
07:14:19.490 --> 07:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
is is that it it's a matter of of just
 
07:14:21.288 --> 07:14:21.298 align:start position:0%
getting the information into the correct
 
07:14:23.208 --> 07:14:23.218 align:start position:0%
format or is there more to it than that
 
07:14:26.208 --> 07:14:26.218 align:start position:0%
sure so thank you for the question
 
07:14:28.490 --> 07:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
um again doe is not going out with
 
07:14:30.890 --> 07:14:30.900 align:start position:0%
trucks and Crews interconnecting you
 
07:14:33.110 --> 07:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
know customer generators and their
 
07:14:34.548 --> 07:14:34.558 align:start position:0%
facilities onto the grid that is done
 
07:14:36.128 --> 07:14:36.138 align:start position:0%
through utility so utilities
 
07:14:39.110 --> 07:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
predominantly have that information if
 
07:14:42.650 --> 07:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
the goal was to have doe conduct this uh
 
07:14:44.628 --> 07:14:44.638 align:start position:0%
conduct these notices themselves which
 
07:14:46.010 --> 07:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
obviously there is a provision to pass
 
07:14:48.288 --> 07:14:48.298 align:start position:0%
it along to distribution utilities but
 
07:14:51.048 --> 07:14:51.058 align:start position:0%
if there was the obligation for doe to
 
07:14:53.770 --> 07:14:53.780 align:start position:0%
assume itself it would require
 
07:14:57.350 --> 07:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
significant administrative staff time to
 
07:14:59.810 --> 07:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
consult with utilities match up their
 
07:15:02.270 --> 07:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
lists with any type of data that we
 
07:15:03.830 --> 07:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
might have on the con on customer
 
07:15:05.930 --> 07:15:05.940 align:start position:0%
generators operating in the state and
 
07:15:08.090 --> 07:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
then split out who who's already
 
07:15:10.070 --> 07:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
registered to create Rex and who's not
 
07:15:13.850 --> 07:15:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:13.860 --> 07:15:15.730 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

07:15:15.730 --> 07:15:15.740 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
07:15:17.750 --> 07:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a question
 
07:15:19.670 --> 07:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
yeah just a follow-up on yeah thank you
 
07:15:20.810 --> 07:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
07:15:22.430 --> 07:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
question Mr Roberts
 
07:15:24.468 --> 07:15:24.478 align:start position:0%
um just to follow up on that uh I just
 
07:15:26.810 --> 07:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
I'm still having a problem squaring the
 
07:15:29.510 --> 07:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
um the information that we heard earlier
 
07:15:32.090 --> 07:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
based on the the administrative rules
 
07:15:34.010 --> 07:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
that there is a list submitted to the
 
07:15:34.020 --> 07:15:35.330 align:start position:0%
that there is a list submitted to the
commission

07:15:35.330 --> 07:15:35.340 align:start position:0%
commission
 
07:15:38.090 --> 07:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
um of customer cited Source eligible for
 
07:15:40.910 --> 07:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
certification and that that
 
07:15:43.250 --> 07:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
presumably that information is available
 
07:15:45.310 --> 07:15:45.320 align:start position:0%
already in the commission
 
07:15:49.010 --> 07:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
and so what what is the difficulty
 
07:15:51.948 --> 07:15:51.958 align:start position:0%
getting a hold of a list of people who
 
07:15:54.170 --> 07:15:54.180 align:start position:0%
are eligible for Rex this is just
 
07:15:55.850 --> 07:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
parsing the ones who have already
 
07:15:58.010 --> 07:15:58.020 align:start position:0%
applied for Rex and have received them
 
07:16:00.830 --> 07:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
from that list I mean it doesn't seem to
 
07:16:03.830 --> 07:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
be a huge administrative lift no thank
 
07:16:04.968 --> 07:16:04.978 align:start position:0%
you for the question
 
07:16:06.468 --> 07:16:06.478 align:start position:0%
um I would respectfully contend in
 
07:16:07.730 --> 07:16:07.740 align:start position:0%
talking with our sustainable energy
 
07:16:10.850 --> 07:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
division that this would be a lift
 
07:16:14.208 --> 07:16:14.218 align:start position:0%
um the lists the list again the
 
07:16:15.770 --> 07:16:15.780 align:start position:0%
utilities largely have this information
 
07:16:18.530 --> 07:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
I cannot point to any
 
07:16:19.850 --> 07:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
um information that might have been
 
07:16:21.530 --> 07:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
shared prior about administrative rules
 
07:16:22.968 --> 07:16:22.978 align:start position:0%
I can certainly talk with folks
 
07:16:24.890 --> 07:16:24.900 align:start position:0%
internally and get back to the committee
 
07:16:26.810 --> 07:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
on on the the rules that were mentioned
 
07:16:30.288 --> 07:16:30.298 align:start position:0%
previous testimony but as far as I know
 
07:16:31.670 --> 07:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
in talking with our sustainable energy
 
07:16:33.708 --> 07:16:33.718 align:start position:0%
division is that they are not day to day
 
07:16:35.330 --> 07:16:35.340 align:start position:0%
looking through a master list of all the
 
07:16:37.190 --> 07:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
interconnected sources registered in the
 
07:16:39.650 --> 07:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
state who register who is Rec certified
 
07:16:42.410 --> 07:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
and who isn't trying to develop
 
07:16:44.930 --> 07:16:44.940 align:start position:0%
processes and the mechanism to do that
 
07:16:46.850 --> 07:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis for these notices
 
07:16:46.860 --> 07:16:48.350 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis for these notices
would

07:16:48.350 --> 07:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
would
 
07:16:50.090 --> 07:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
take a significant amount of
 
07:16:52.368 --> 07:16:52.378 align:start position:0%
administrative time especially for our
 
07:16:54.048 --> 07:16:54.058 align:start position:0%
sustainable folks with which there's
 
07:16:55.968 --> 07:16:55.978 align:start position:0%
only really four staffers day to day
 
07:17:02.448 --> 07:17:02.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:04.730 --> 07:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
thank you I know you said earlier that
 
07:17:06.730 --> 07:17:06.740 align:start position:0%
you're not a lawyer
 
07:17:10.670 --> 07:17:10.680 align:start position:0%
and neither am I but do you have any
 
07:17:13.128 --> 07:17:13.138 align:start position:0%
idea what in
 
07:17:17.090 --> 07:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
administrative rule 2503.04
 
07:17:21.310 --> 07:17:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:25.128 --> 07:17:25.138 align:start position:0%
s-i-t-e-t-s-i-t-e-d source is does that
 
07:17:26.628 --> 07:17:26.638 align:start position:0%
do you know what the definition of that
 
07:17:29.030 --> 07:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
is does that just mean if I'm a customer
 
07:17:34.070 --> 07:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
who has a an on-site solar array is that
 
07:17:35.628 --> 07:17:35.638 align:start position:0%
what that means if I could what was the
 
07:17:38.048 --> 07:17:38.058 align:start position:0%
rule again I'm sorry
 
07:17:43.128 --> 07:17:43.138 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:45.650 --> 07:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't have that handout but
 
07:17:47.510 --> 07:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
what I can do is I can I've written down
 
07:17:49.070 --> 07:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
the rule here I can certainly take a
 
07:17:50.390 --> 07:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
look at that and follow back up with the
 
07:17:52.430 --> 07:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
committee if that's okay okay great
 
07:17:56.570 --> 07:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:58.190 --> 07:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
all right so you know further questions
 
07:18:00.170 --> 07:18:00.180 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
07:18:03.350 --> 07:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
and having no more pink cards
 
07:18:05.690 --> 07:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
I will ask if there's anybody sitting in
 
07:18:07.850 --> 07:18:07.860 align:start position:0%
the audience who would like to speak on
 
07:18:11.690 --> 07:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:13.670 --> 07:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
07:18:16.430 --> 07:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
I'll close the public hearing on House
 
07:18:19.128 --> 07:18:19.138 align:start position:0%
Bill 263 FN and ask representative
 
07:18:21.830 --> 07:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
closure to give us an indication as to
