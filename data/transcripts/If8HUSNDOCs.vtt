00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
um yeah probably yeah yeah that'd be
 
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.389 align:start position:0%
so um
we

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
got 150 when i left
 
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
senate finance it seemed like the this
 
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
bill was all set and
 
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
good to go and then it somehow
 
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
picked up a
 
00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
friend along the way
 
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
probably late night probably after i
 
00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
turned turned off
 
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
i was tuning into the senate a little
 
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
bit just
 
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
what time did you shut it off
 
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
what was it it was it was late it was
 
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
late i think we were there until
 
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
midnight yeah it was at least midnight
 
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
or afternoon no yeah
 
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
happy with what we've done i take it no
 
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
we we don't
 
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.030 align:start position:0%
we we don't
so

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
like this on here what part are you not
 
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
happy with john uh let's uh
 
00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
i had an amendment drama but it's so
 
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
simple it's probably silly uh it starts
 
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.310 align:start position:0%
simple it's probably silly uh it starts
at

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
section 86
 
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
of the bill yeah
 
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
so turned all the way back to the back
 
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
so obviously the amendment that i agreed
 
00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
to in finance so i had told him that i'm
 
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
okay with putting the pushing the
 
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
effective date out right
 
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.149 align:start position:0%
effective date out right
okay

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
and just so you know
 
00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 align:start position:0%
why i would
 
00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
agree to such a crazy idea
 
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
is that um we were we would be one of
 
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
the first states to pass this ucc
 
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.550 align:start position:0%
the first states to pass this ucc
legislation

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 align:start position:0%
and the uh ucf the uniform commercial
 
00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.910 align:start position:0%
and the uh ucf the uniform commercial
college

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
college
 
00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
whatever they what they call themselves
 
00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 align:start position:0%
they uniform commercial
 
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
no that's the code what's what's the
 
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
it's the use
 
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
council what's it called
 
00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
ulc right so ulc which is the
 
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
uniform law commission
 
00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
so they were say they put like the idea
 
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
that we would everybody would uh
 
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
have the law come into effect at the
 
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
same time
 
00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 align:start position:0%
um but that the one thing that they are
 
00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
happy about that
 
00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're taking this up now
 
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
and passing it now
 
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
is that it really it's puts us on on
 
00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 align:start position:0%
record notification to the whole country
 
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire is open to for
 
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
business for but with these
 
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
um guardrails
 
00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
that the ucc creates
 
00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
and and these are real guardrails and
 
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
that you know so that that um which you
 
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
know you you obviously know what a ucc
 
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
form is you know how important ucc is
 
00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 align:start position:0%
so so
 
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
having even though it seems a little
 
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
bizarre having an effective date out but
 
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
that really is the more important thing
 
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
is is that that means
 
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
anybody who owns any crypto now in
 
00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
knows that that they need to make sure
 
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
they conform
 
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
with the statute by the time it becomes
 
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.990 align:start position:0%
with the statute by the time it becomes
effective

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
effective
 
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
so it's giving everybody pre-advanced
 
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
worrying here's here's the tattoo and
 
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
really is you know it's a win-win by
 
00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 align:start position:0%
doing it this way good so you're happy
 
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
so we're very happy with our of that
 
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
amendment yes i agree with that amount
 
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
and that is amendment 1939s
 
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
senate finance correct okay so we're
 
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
happy with that amendment it was just
 
00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
the the amendment that started on
 
00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 align:start position:0%
section 86
 
00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
the steel the steel steel so that one
 
00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:01.429 align:start position:0%
the steel the steel steel so that one
page

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
amendment two-page amendment
 
00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159 align:start position:0%
you're not happy with the rest of the
 
00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
hundred and something pages you're happy
 
00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 align:start position:0%
with right so so
 
00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 align:start position:0%
if you want to visualize
 
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's short huh yeah so you pass
 
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
that one yeah they know what it says
 
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm pretty sure we do
 
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.670 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm pretty sure we do
so

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
both of these passed the senate
 
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
this was a separate bill the steel bill
 
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
was a separate bill and it passed the
 
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.629 align:start position:0%
was a separate bill and it passed the
house

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
my understanding is you guys killed it
 
00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
no no no no no no
 
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
no no well you passed it in the house
 
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.710 align:start position:0%
no no well you passed it in the house
correct

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.990 align:start position:0%
correct
and

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
and do you know where the bill is now
 
00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
if i can because i have a copy of the
 
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
docket of the bill right yeah it passed
 
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
the uh senate on march 31 2022 ought to
 
00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
pass right voice vote
 
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
come down to the house
 
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
um the majority was
 
00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
on 4 28 22 vote ought to pass on the
 
00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.230 align:start position:0%
on 4 28 22 vote ought to pass on the
committee

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
on the floor on 504 222
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
um it was ought to pass with amendment
 
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
from the house from the house and then
 
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
what did the senate do what does the
 
00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 align:start position:0%
last line say that yep we moved to
 
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
non-concur with the house amendment
 
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
because of what you attached to it right
 
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
but so
 
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
your motion of non-concur and you've
 
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
been doing this probably as long as i
 
00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:45.759 align:start position:0%
have none concurred with that killed the
 
00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
bill right
 
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
so so you killed it we killed it
 
00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
because we did not accept what the house
 
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
had done to the bill
 
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
because the house attached another bill
 
00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
to that bill and we said we're not
 
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
accepting that and then we took the bill
 
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
that we passed and attached it to this
 
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.749 align:start position:0%
that we passed and attached it to this
bill

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
which everyone agreed to which everyone
 
00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
has agreed to well like you said is that
 
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
the house you know in terms of what we
 
00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
did is we sent you the bill and you
 
00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 align:start position:0%
that is the bill but you've gone through
 
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
something that we
 
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
killed but
 
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
that the house commerce committee which
 
00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
was the proponent of 1503 right
 
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
never saw
 
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
that steel issue at all we never had
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
anything to do with that bill and and
 
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
frankly it's offensive to be on 1503
 
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.309 align:start position:0%
frankly it's offensive to be on 1503
well

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
and representative i will tell you that
 
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of offensive things
 
00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 align:start position:0%
going on
 
00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
between the house and the senate
 
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
especially the way that the bills the
 
00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
senate bills were handled by the house
 
00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:52.550 align:start position:0%
senate bills were handled by the house
so

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
you know it as i said this is the silly
 
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
season people are attaching things left
 
00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
and right
 
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
and so if that's the way the game's
 
00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 align:start position:0%
going to be played then that's the way
 
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
the game's going to be played this was a
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
bill that passed the senate it passed
 
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
the senate committee five to nothing it
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
passed the floor on a voice vote came
 
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
over to the house
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
it passed the committee the house
 
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
committee until it got to the house
 
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.309 align:start position:0%
committee until it got to the house
floor

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
floor
 
00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
and then someone from senate judiciary
 
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
attached a bill that we killed i know
 
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me edna that we killed attached
 
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
it to that bill and we said we're not
 
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
doing that absolutely not we wanted to
 
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
save this bill this bill was important
 
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
to the senate and we attached it to this
 
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.029 align:start position:0%
to the senate and we attached it to this
bill

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
so that's where we are today
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's it that's it so but like i say
 
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
i'm you know that
 
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.189 align:start position:0%
i'm you know that
this

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
ucc bill
 
00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
um obviously it's going to become a law
 
00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:50.390 align:start position:0%
um obviously it's going to become a law
eventually

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
eventually
 
00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:52.150 align:start position:0%
all right
and

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
you and i have both been around long
 
00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:55.759 align:start position:0%
enough to know if it doesn't happen this
 
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
year then it'll happen next year it'll
 
00:07:59.909 --> 00:07:59.919 align:start position:0%
happen and and it's a shame that that
 
00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
would happen i agree i agree that the
 
00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
game was even begun yeah but the first
 
00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
shot didn't come from us well so i i'm
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
just saying if we're going to start
 
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
pointing fingers at each other right
 
00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start position:0%
it's important to realize that the
 
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
senate did not fire the first shot
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
it didn't come from us
 
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
the bill was attached
 
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
during a senate's during a house session
 
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
should never have happened why it
 
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
happened i can't speak to that that's
 
00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:29.039 align:start position:0%
house business
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
but this bill was important to the
 
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.230 align:start position:0%
but this bill was important to the
senate

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
and we wanted wanted to keep it alive
 
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
and that's exactly what we did
 
00:08:37.599 --> 00:08:41.269 align:start position:0%
and that's exactly what we did
so

00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
so what do you what do you want to do
 
00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
you want us to walk away
 
00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:46.150 align:start position:0%
you want us to walk away
um

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.070 align:start position:0%
um
well

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
you know i've been doing this for how
 
00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:51.519 align:start position:0%
many years 36 years you know if you
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
really want to wait till next year
 
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
because you want to fall on your sword
 
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
over this issue all i'm just saying is
 
00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
think about what you know here we are in
 
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
you know i know i've put in the trust
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
laws i've done everything possible to
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
make us cutting edge
 
00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:09.519 align:start position:0%
when it comes to financial services
 
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
and here we have this off the golden
 
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.949 align:start position:0%
and here we have this off the golden
opportunity

00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
and to to put in a
 
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.670 align:start position:0%
and to to put in a
um

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
in my opinion of the steel bill is you
 
00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:20.959 align:start position:0%
know that this is a
 
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayer subsidy for for an old industry
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
and it's just not appropriate because it
 
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
opens up a can of worms because what
 
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
about lumber i mean there's the
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
canadians do a lot more than just steel
 
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
i mean there's a lot of things that they
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
do are we gonna if we're just gonna end
 
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
up having to subsidize every one of
 
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
these industries that the canadians and
 
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
i don't even ensure how the canadians
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
are you know i guess maybe because they
 
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
provide health insurance or something
 
00:09:46.949 --> 00:09:46.959 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure where the advantages are
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
but all i know is if you start with this
 
00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
steel bill next is going to be lumber
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
representative we will take them as we
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
get them as you know with any bill and
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
if someone wants to put in a bill
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
concerning lumber this legislature or
 
00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
the next legislature will consider it we
 
00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
had this bill concerning steel we
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
considered it we have steel
 
00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
companies that manufacture steel here in
 
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire that provide
 
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
good paying jobs for people of the state
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire so we are protecting
 
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
those businesses and those people that
 
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
are working
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
we don't want to see people skilled
 
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
labor by the way
 
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
lose their jobs and leave this state to
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
have to go someplace else
 
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.110 align:start position:0%
have to go someplace else
so

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
um that is part of our position it's
 
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
very important to us it's important that
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
we protect those jobs and we protect
 
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
those industries even if it is an old
 
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
industry we need those people and we
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
need that industry
 
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
but once you do it then then when the
 
00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
lumber comes in next year
 
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
the lord knows who else we can once you
 
00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519 align:start position:0%
pass this this you can open the can of
 
00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:52.870 align:start position:0%
pass this this you can open the can of
worms

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
worms
 
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:53.590 align:start position:0%
worms
well

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
then it'll be a can of worms
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
representative and we'll deal with it so
 
00:10:57.279 --> 00:10:58.069 align:start position:0%
representative and we'll deal with it so
chris

00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
chris
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
if if i can make a comment i'm i'm all
 
00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:03.519 align:start position:0%
for the steel bill i i think it makes a
 
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
lot of sense uh i think it uh
 
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
helps our constituents um if lumber
 
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
comes up next year we
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
again i think
 
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
you make a very good point we would have
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
to face that when it comes but right now
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
we got this on the table it it doesn't
 
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
look like it fits but i can think of the
 
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.590 align:start position:0%
look like it fits but i can think of the
uh

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
the budget bill that we passed uh last
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
year that
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
many things didn't fit and yet they were
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
put in there anyway so i i'm all for it
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
with the with the steel thank you
 
00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:33.350 align:start position:0%
with the with the steel thank you
the

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
senate bill 2 is the only legislation
 
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
only bill is allowed to have all those
 
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
non-german amendments added to it
 
00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.350 align:start position:0%
non-german amendments added to it
so

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
but i mean uh you know i don't know how
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
you feel if you want to we'll pick this
 
00:11:48.069 --> 00:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
up again next week but at this point
 
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
um you know we we
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
we really need to have that out of this
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
bill i mean that that is just an
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
inappropriate amendment
 
00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:56.959 align:start position:0%
a it's a slap in the face of what the
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
what the bill is trying to do
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
um and i think the best thing you know
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
for us to do is uh and i would urge you
 
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959 align:start position:0%
to do with the other bills just clean
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
them up and get get the things that you
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
you feel is the are the right things and
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
have them in the bill and that's the way
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
they should be passed
 
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
well um i'm not the chair of this
 
00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
committee senator francis john we'll
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
come back next week but i really would
 
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
like you to reconsider your position
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
when we do i really think this is an
 
00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
important underlying bill and the bill
 
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
we've added
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
does not destroy it
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
i really would like you to think that
 
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.990 align:start position:0%
i really would like you to think that
through

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
i don't know if we have the support on
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
our side to pass this without
 
00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:45.519 align:start position:0%
so you put us in a real difficult time
 
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
sorry to do that to you because you know
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
i know you've had a lot of great working
 
00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
years together
 
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
we'll miss you when you're not chairman
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
next year but but uh well you might get
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
kevin no
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
kevin back yeah
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
so but anyway i i just give it some
 
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
thought yeah and set up another meeting
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
for next week
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
and talk to your caucus see where they
 
00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.750 align:start position:0%
and talk to your caucus see where they
are

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
this bill should this underlying bill
 
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
so let's do it
 
00:13:19.829 --> 00:13:19.839 align:start position:0%
okay well obviously to me it's it's
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
really offensive
 
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
it really is offended it's a slap in the
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
face of of this you know here we are of
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
the of what we're trying to do um
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
the fight
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
look at it this way the steel bill came
 
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
to commerce yeah it wouldn't have passed
 
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
because it would have been a precedent
 
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
that we didn't want to we wouldn't want
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
to go down yeah okay
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
so the fact that it did pass i you know
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
obviously i i hear you you never voted
 
00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
for something you didn't like ever in
 
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
your 47 years here
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
give a take
 
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.150 align:start position:0%
give a take
um

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
i i have to say is that i i have to i
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
have to figure out rationale how how i
 
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
can get my answers
 
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:06.870 align:start position:0%
can get my answers
and

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
yeah you have to turn your mic on chris
 
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
um just
 
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
one additional comment um
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of democrats are very suspicious
 
00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959 align:start position:0%
of 1503
 
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
i think adding the steel bill to it
 
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
would uh
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
almost guarantee that the democrats
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
would support the whole package other
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
than that
 
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
you take the seal bill out i don't think
 
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to get the democratic
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
fair enough
 
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
i understand why you're offended and i
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
can honestly say i'm probably just as
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
more as offended as you are
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
because a bill dealing with cosmetology
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
was attached to the steel bill
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
now please tell me how that works
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
it should never have happened but that's
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
house business and that's how you chose
 
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
to handle your bills
 
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have anything to say about it
 
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
so while you're
 
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
offended i'm equally as offended but i'm
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
trying to find a solution here
 
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
so we can get a bill that has passed the
 
00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.430 align:start position:0%
so we can get a bill that has passed the
senate

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
as well as the house committee
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
passed into law
 
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.949 align:start position:0%
passed into law
so

00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:26.959 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
like that i mean no i hear you but but
 
00:15:29.199 --> 00:15:30.150 align:start position:0%
like that i mean no i hear you but but
sharon

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
sharon
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
why didn't you go to comedian conference
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
why did you kill it
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
not playing games this is just
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
what are you going to do so you're
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
saying if i should have just killed this
 
00:15:39.839 --> 00:15:41.110 align:start position:0%
saying if i should have just killed this
bill

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
not to play games so the fact that you
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
added the steel one to it would have
 
00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:45.759 align:start position:0%
been way way way too many committees a
 
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
conference way way way too many
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
conference committees conferences take a
 
00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:51.519 align:start position:0%
look at all the bills that we
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
non-concurred with
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
because bills were attached that made no
 
00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
sense whatsoever
 
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
so what we did was we focused on the
 
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
bills that were important to the senate
 
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
well that's great but
 
00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
the question i'm sure because this bill
 
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
is important to the house this bill is
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
okay so at any rate i i guess we'll be
 
00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
meeting again on committee conferences
 
00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
on bills that that died in commerce
 
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
and suddenly appeared on
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
totally non-germane health and human
 
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
services committee so
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
you know this is
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
so you can say that you know we started
 
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
it but you obviously ran with it because
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
you were here
 
00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
until midnight and we've decided to go
 
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
home by then so that we weren't going to
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
play this tit for tad for you know all
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
night long so
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.870 align:start position:0%
um you know
i

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
i'm not i don't play these games this is
 
00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
you know commerce is we've never had
 
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
these kind of issues before this is this
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
is new to me to have that all my years
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
to have bills that that uh that
 
00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
that congress never had get attached to
 
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
an important issue but let alone the
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
fact that we will be meeting again on
 
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
monday on another bill you know that
 
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
commerce bill that we killed that now is
 
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
just found in a new home
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
so i mean i just i agree with you this
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
this is very frustrating and this is
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
so we just have to find some way we can
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
do the right thing
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
and do the right thing for new hampshire
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
 
you
