00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
reviewing findings and
 
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 align:start position:0%

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.509 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh after the followup
from

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:51.439 align:start position:0%
natural uh and cultural resources and
 
00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
treasure it be nice to have the treasure
 
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
and and natural and cultural resources
 
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.550 align:start position:0%
and and natural and cultural resources
still

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 align:start position:0%
here that
 
00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I couldn't oh
 
00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
sorry uh it'd be nice to have the
 
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
treasure and natural and cultural
 
00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
resources still here when we're
 
00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 align:start position:0%
reviewing findings since they've got an
 
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
today all right I I was kind of hoping
 
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
that the treasurer's
 
00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
time we we could let her go after her
 
00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.230 align:start position:0%
time we we could let her go after her
part

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
part
 
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
so but it's it's um up to her whether
 
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
she has time or
 
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
not okay fine all right um yeah if you
 
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 align:start position:0%
want to work on your phone or something
 
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 align:start position:0%
that's it's fine with me all right so
 
00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
um any uh any other changes to the
 
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 align:start position:0%

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
we have an agenda all right I welcome uh
 
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
treasur mapelli
 
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
Madam Treasurer I
 
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
guess um I had a couple of question the
 
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
reason I asked her to come is um a
 
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
couple of things came up from our last
 
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
meeting that I had I sent her questions
 
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 align:start position:0%
and she sent responses but I thought
 
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
that maybe other members you know might
 
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
like to ask questions
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
also um so I'll just we'll just get into
 
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
what I asked and what you responded so
 
00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 align:start position:0%
um if you remember the Dr
 
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
had a fund that was paying off their um
 
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
their new information system right so it
 
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 align:start position:0%
was the revenue information system
 
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
manage fund which was
 
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
um fund number 337 accounting unit
 
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
5773 and um it seemed like a weird fund
 
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
because it was just accumulating money
 
00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
to get to $40
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
million um
 
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 align:start position:0%
but at the same time we've borrowed
 
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
money right so we're paying interest on
 
00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:06.759 align:start position:0%
this borrowed money and we're
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
accumulating money and so I asked the
 
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
question of can't we you know pay off
 
00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 align:start position:0%
these bonds early since we have this
 
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
extra money accumulating and um her
 
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.390 align:start position:0%
extra money accumulating and um her
response

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
response
 
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
was we can't because when we Bond things
 
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
we don't just send out a bond for this
 
00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 align:start position:0%
particular information system we send
 
00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 align:start position:0%
out a bond for everything that the that
 
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 align:start position:0%
the state is borrowing and secondly that
 
00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
when we make bonds they're not callable
 
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
for 10 years so we're committed to
 
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
paying off those bonds over 10 years
 
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
plus um and then
 
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
thirdly um the money when we have spare
 
00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 align:start position:0%
money we're earning more interest on it
 
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
than we're paying interest on these
 
00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:54.879 align:start position:0%
bonds so we wouldn't want to do it
 
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
anyways is all that
 
00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.240 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct good morning uh
 
00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
for the director State treasure Monica
 
00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
mapelli that is correct so I was trying
 
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:07.720 align:start position:0%
to explain that um when we look at um
 
00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
just one project or One Fund is not that
 
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
simple to separate uh the debt for just
 
00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
that project um because we issue bonds
 
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:21.160 align:start position:0%
and we when we issue bonds we um gather
 
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
all of the eligible projects uh all the
 
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
project all of the agencies have spent
 
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
money on particular project so then we
 
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
say okay it's time to bond and so so we
 
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
grab those and those are the ones that
 
00:07:33.869 --> 00:07:33.879 align:start position:0%
we fund we with the bond proceeds we pay
 
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
for those projects so so it's not that
 
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
simple to separate once in a while we do
 
00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:41.919 align:start position:0%
have specifics and we're able to um
 
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
issue something in particular but for
 
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
the most part our general processes to
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
just uh um essentially just grab all
 
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
those projects and and and fund them
 
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
with the bond proceeds um we do on a
 
00:07:56.589 --> 00:07:56.599 align:start position:0%
regular basis we do review what's cable
 
00:07:59.869 --> 00:07:59.879 align:start position:0%
so um and when that when that happens we
 
00:08:02.189 --> 00:08:02.199 align:start position:0%
have essentially the opportunity to try
 
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
to see if we if it makes sense to re
 
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
refund those bonds to to issue refund
 
00:08:10.149 --> 00:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
and bonds um so so we'll have that
 
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity so we issue in general once
 
00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
once a year we issue bonds so in general
 
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
um we'll do it in March again and during
 
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:19.400 align:start position:0%
that time we'll see uh bonds that have
 
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
reached that date to see if it feasible
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
if it makes sense to to issue refunding
 
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
bonds so that's sort of the process so
 
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
looking at just rims and spe
 
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.350 align:start position:0%
looking at just rims and spe
specifically

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:35.240 align:start position:0%
that rims fund was in house bille 25
 
00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
when that was when that was uh enacted
 
00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
it was um the plan the way the law was
 
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
written is that the general fund was
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
going to pay for6 million and then the
 
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
rest of the funding of the rest of like
 
00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
24 million was going to come from this
 
00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:54.200 align:start position:0%
additional Revenue that was going to be
 
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
generated from the system it was going
 
00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
to be placed in this specific fund and
 
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:00.680 align:start position:0%
then the debts service was going to be
 
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
paid from that from those money so
 
00:09:06.509 --> 00:09:06.519 align:start position:0%
that's why I believe it's okay that if
 
00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
they just accumulate unfortunately we
 
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
can't just take the money and pay off
 
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
the bonds we just have to make sure
 
00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
there is enough money when it's time to
 
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
pay that service that money comes from
 
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
the fund and not the general fund so we
 
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
take so um so we make sure that those
 
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
the bonds are being paid the portion
 
00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
related to RS comes from that those
 
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.110 align:start position:0%
related to RS comes from that those
other

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:09:31.949 --> 00:09:31.959 align:start position:0%
monies so Ros thank you thank you for
 
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
that for trying to make it at my level
 
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
but it's okay just have we been able to
 
00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:43.640 align:start position:0%
generate higher
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
interest on those bonds then we need to
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
pay off the rims fund the rims expense
 
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
is there any I know we're limited to I
 
00:09:58.269 --> 00:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
think it's 4 million a year or something
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
are we making more more money than we
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
fund so
 
00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
um I don't fully understand the
 
00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:13.160 align:start position:0%
methodology of what gets recorded in
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
that fund I believe there's a
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
methodology Dr puts it together so
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
um in terms of paying the bonds I think
 
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
the intent of the law was to make sure
 
00:10:25.389 --> 00:10:25.399 align:start position:0%
there was enough money in there to pay
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
the debt service where there is more
 
00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
right now that should be is is is is
 
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
really uh difficult for me to answer um
 
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
what I know is that fund by itself
 
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't earn interest as you know we
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
pull all of the cash on the funds that
 
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
earn interest
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
are that's that's that's written in law
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
so if there's a dedicated fund entitled
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
to our interest is specifically written
 
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
the law and those are the ones that when
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
we when we look at all the interest that
 
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
we earn then we need to see all of the
 
00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:02.519 align:start position:0%
funds that have an interest um that
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
entitled to receive interest and then we
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
allocate interest so for example the
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
rims fund does not get interest so the
 
00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:12.519 align:start position:0%
general fund keeps that portion um so
 
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
that was also part of your question why
 
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:18.440 align:start position:0%
can for example even the money uh
 
00:11:20.829 --> 00:11:20.839 align:start position:0%
why isn't that uh receiving interest is
 
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:23.560 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't written a lot that it
 
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:25.720 align:start position:0%
that interest is cred to that
 
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation I believe that was just an
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
appropriation from the last ban
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
and so it's just sitting there so if
 
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
it's sitting there we're investing the
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
money and the state is earning money um
 
00:11:39.629 --> 00:11:39.639 align:start position:0%
in terms of the interest rates um we've
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
been in in a an environment we've been
 
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
able to earn higher interest because of
 
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
you know the higher interest rates in
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
the short term the long term have have
 
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
been pretty consistent at about 4% so
 
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
those are typically normally those are
 
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
higher interest rates but because of the
 
00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
different interest interest right
 
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
environment that we've been uh
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
experiencing um we've been benefiting
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
from having all this cash and then
 
00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:07.240 align:start position:0%
earning we've been earning interest
 
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
that's going to change it's going to go
 
00:12:12.269 --> 00:12:12.279 align:start position:0%
back to long-term interest rates are
 
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
going to be higher than shortterm so but
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
right now while we go through the
 
00:12:17.629 --> 00:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
process that's going to occur over the
 
00:12:19.629 --> 00:12:19.639 align:start position:0%
next two years right now we're earning
 
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
more interest with those funds that are
 
00:12:22.079 --> 00:12:23.230 align:start position:0%
more interest with those funds that are
sitting

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:23.240 align:start position:0%
sitting
 
00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
there you're welcome so right now we're
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
paying like 4% and earning five or
 
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
okay but it's going into the general
 
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
fund it is going to the general fund if
 
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:39.160 align:start position:0%
it if the law doesn't say that those
 
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
funds uh get interest then the the
 
00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:44.839 align:start position:0%
general fund is getting all of that
 
00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:46.839 align:start position:0%
right that's what you see in the um
 
00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue Focus all right so how about the
 
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
management of of the Dr fund should that
 
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
be in your office instead of theirs
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
because it didn't seem
 
00:12:59.310 --> 00:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
like they knew much about it except that
 
00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
they are putting money into it sort of
 
00:13:03.069 --> 00:13:03.079 align:start position:0%
right I think it's more of an accounting
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
transaction I mean that they just handle
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
the accounting again we pull all the
 
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
cash we do we invest all of the funds so
 
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
um regardless of where the funds are
 
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
being recorded what agency has it we we
 
00:13:18.629 --> 00:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
we handle all the cash ourselves so in
 
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
essence we are managing the fund and
 
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:23.720 align:start position:0%
then when it's time to allocate interest
 
00:13:25.189 --> 00:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
then we look at all those individual
 
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
funds of all of the agencies and then we
 
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
all right uh yes represent of
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
all yes I'm sorry Dr a isn't here I
 
00:13:40.949 --> 00:13:40.959 align:start position:0%
think um but
 
00:13:46.189 --> 00:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
um what happens at the end of the period
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
when we've got 40 thou 40 million in in
 
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
that account if that is more than is
 
00:13:58.189 --> 00:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
needed to finish paying off the bonds um
 
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
does it go directly to General funds I
 
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
believe so I think the law considered
 
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
that that piece um I can find a
 
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
reference in the Statue I think it was
 
00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.189 align:start position:0%
reference in the Statue I think it was
either

00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0%
um it's in that the the rims law that
 
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:18.680 align:start position:0%
says if there's access fund it can go
 
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
back to the general
 
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.629 align:start position:0%
back to the general
fund

00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
um so if they at that point needed to do
 
00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839 align:start position:0%
some kind of update which they think is
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
going to be rare because we don't have
 
00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
sales and income taxes um
 
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
then on they'd have to start over again
 
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
getting it out of the
 
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
budget right so so right here is uh is s
 
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.470 align:start position:0%
budget right so so right here is uh is s
say

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:14:48.749 --> 00:14:48.759 align:start position:0%
21j um column 1B paragraph 3 it does
 
00:14:51.069 --> 00:14:51.079 align:start position:0%
talk about sending the excess money to
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
thanks right and then the other question
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
I asked there was about um uh fund
 
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
number 104 accounting unit 3 3705 the
 
00:15:10.269 --> 00:15:10.279 align:start position:0%
Canon Mountain Capital Improvement fund
 
00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's used to make improvements
 
00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:22.519 align:start position:0%
to the ski area and we've borrowed as I
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
remembered something like $6
 
00:15:27.749 --> 00:15:27.759 align:start position:0%
million over over the years and so
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
they're paying
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
you know those are borrowed monies and
 
00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
they're paying off the debt but at the
 
00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:37.720 align:start position:0%
same time we also borrowed like we also
 
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
allocated something like 18 million to
 
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
help Canam Mountain replace their tram
 
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:45.160 align:start position:0%
and they're still trying to find a
 
00:15:47.309 --> 00:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
vendor and doing other stuff so my
 
00:15:47.319 --> 00:15:48.350 align:start position:0%
vendor and doing other stuff so my
question

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
was um since the 18 million is sitting
 
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
there earning interest and since you
 
00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
know we've borrowed 6 million for
 
00:15:58.509 --> 00:15:58.519 align:start position:0%
essentially similar purposes should we
 
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
just pay that off but the the answer was
 
00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:02.839 align:start position:0%
we can't and we shouldn't because
 
00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
because of the interest difference um
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
but the other question and and she she
 
00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
touched on it was maybe the interest on
 
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:13.160 align:start position:0%
the $18 million that's sitting around
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
ought to go to this fund whereas right
 
00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
now it's going to the general fund it is
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
and I just I I went to um it was House
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 uh where the funds were
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
appropriated it was just um 18 million
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
was appropriated and the the only the
 
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
only language added in that section was
 
00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
that the funds are non lapsing so
 
00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
there's silent on on interest so when we
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
again for us it's black and white if we
 
00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
don't see it we don't allocate interest
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
um to something that is silent um and it
 
00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:49.480 align:start position:0%
gets really difficult right now we have
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
interest to allocate but it was very
 
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
difficult when it was uh absolutely not
 
00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
we weren't earning any interest those
 
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.430 align:start position:0%
we weren't earning any interest those
years

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:00.440 align:start position:0%
so okay so I would just suggest that
 
00:17:03.309 --> 00:17:03.319 align:start position:0%
maybe we to that non-aps and we say an
 
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:05.720 align:start position:0%
interest is credited to the fund or
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
something like that how however I don't
 
00:17:10.189 --> 00:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
believe this is a dedicated fund this is
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
just an
 
00:17:14.029 --> 00:17:14.039 align:start position:0%
appropriation um that says It's Not
 
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
absent but it's not a typical oh it's
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
not a dedic it's not a typical dedicated
 
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
fund that is listed in irsi 12 this is
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
just an appropriation that is not
 
00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
lapsing money I go you that's my
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
understanding all right Senator Rosell
 
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:31.640 align:start position:0%
well um I recall from last week we had a
 
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion about the difference
 
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
between Canon
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
Mountain as part of the ski area and
 
00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
Fran coni and N State Park and they seem
 
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
different um the tram I think mostly
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
functions mostly
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
brings visitors in the summer rather
 
00:17:59.789 --> 00:17:59.799 align:start position:0%
than during the ski season it operates
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
in the winter but it's really more of a
 
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:07.720 align:start position:0%
summer and fall draw so
 
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
um it it does
 
00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:16.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:19.149 --> 00:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
system because it brings in so much
 
00:18:22.029 --> 00:18:22.039 align:start position:0%
money well I'm not sure about that
 
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
because I mean isn't there for skiers
 
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
lift tickets and and they have to go up
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
the tram I mean how else do they no they
 
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
don't have to go up the trm excuse me
 
00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
okay they we could
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
bring the experts here so all right
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay good morning Brian Wilson director
 
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
of division of Parks and Recreation uh
 
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
so for to to clarify the um the overall
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
Park fund is separated into various
 
00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
accounts within the fund the ski area
 
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
count which is the operation of Canon
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
Mountain ski areas you you think of
 
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
winter operations but in the the tram is
 
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
part of the legislatively part of um uh
 
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
the the ski area account so uh it does
 
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
the tram
 
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
subsidizes uh the ski area overall
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
operation um they are very very
 
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
intertwined although the primary
 
00:19:26.149 --> 00:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
ridership is taking place in the uh in
 
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
non non- winter season um just like like
 
00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
any other ski area you know that Four
 
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
Season revenue is essential uh whether
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's you know lodging opportunities or
 
00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
other uh um opportunities within the
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
venue to create Revenue outside of the
 
00:19:44.669 --> 00:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
ski the W the short winter season uh is
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
really essential for us to sustain that
 
00:19:48.029 --> 00:19:48.039 align:start position:0%
account if
 
00:19:50.909 --> 00:19:50.919 align:start position:0%
that so my question is how do skiers get
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
to the top of the mountain so um there's
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
a number of lifts 10 10 or okay so there
 
00:19:59.549 --> 00:19:59.559 align:start position:0%
are chair lifts and in in the winter
 
00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:02.360 align:start position:0%
time the tram um does not operate um
 
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:04.919 align:start position:0%
every day um it's um partially its
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
weather uh conditions but generally on
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh Peak visitation you know vacation
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
weeks weekends um is is is when it's
 
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
operating so it's not it's not essential
 
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh to to the the skier experience but it
 
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
is an element that we do utilize uh
 
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
during the winter
 
00:20:24.909 --> 00:20:24.919 align:start position:0%
time I didn't understand that
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
so right exactly I was thinking that's
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
how you get there to ski right but
 
00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
apparently not so um so it's really more
 
00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.430 align:start position:0%
apparently not so um so it's really more
like

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:35.720 align:start position:0%
sunap right it's a it's a separate
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
source of Revenue that happens you
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
know but but it's used by the by the
 
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
skier right except okay except okay
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
representative except it is owned by the
 
00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
state and it is falling
 
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
apart so in that it is not like cipe at
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
all it's in danger of reducing the
 
00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
amount of money available for the ski
 
00:21:03.679 --> 00:21:05.430 align:start position:0%
amount of money available for the ski
area

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.590 align:start position:0%
area
sure

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:21:11.549 --> 00:21:11.559 align:start position:0%
okay so let let me ask you for a number
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
how much revenue comes from the tram
 
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
every year uh uh gross revenue is uh
 
00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:19.799 align:start position:0%
about $1.5 million uh directly
 
00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:21.799 align:start position:0%
attributed to the tram now there's other
 
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
components to that we have retail and
 
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
Concession operations both at the base
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
and the summit of the tram facility that
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
aren't accessible by other means within
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
the skia so um when you start to include
 
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:35.480 align:start position:0%
those um ancillary revenue streams as
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
well too it it it it adds up to a
 
00:21:39.549 --> 00:21:39.559 align:start position:0%
significant amount that all directly
 
00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
area Senator gray and I take exception
 
00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:50.919 align:start position:0%
to the words it's falling apart okay it
 
00:21:54.029 --> 00:21:54.039 align:start position:0%
is costing more to maintain it and it's
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
reaching the end of its life which are
 
00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:00.799 align:start position:0%
softer words but we don't want our our
 
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
visitors to think that they can't go on
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
the trm because it's falling apart good
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
mustard representative aling yeah and do
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
you have any idea what the significant
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
amount of concession money that's
 
00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
attached to it
 
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
is um that that's in the in the hundreds
 
00:22:25.269 --> 00:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
of thousands of dollars a few few
 
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
hundred thousands of dollars and and um
 
00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:29.559 align:start position:0%
and again that's you know Four Season
 
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:31.640 align:start position:0%
Revenue so that's attributed to you know
 
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:33.880 align:start position:0%
what's going on at the park on any given
 
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
day for instance I was there yesterday
 
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
um at the park with our general manager
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
Jace worth who's here in the audience um
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
I just just a quick little antidote um I
 
00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
did a just a cruise through the parking
 
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
lot um on a Tuesday there were uh
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
license plates from 33 different states
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
three different uh Canadian provinces
 
00:22:57.269 --> 00:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
and one car from uh Estonia um so U it's
 
00:23:00.029 --> 00:23:00.039 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a very hling place here
 
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
during the and all of these things are
 
00:23:03.149 --> 00:23:03.159 align:start position:0%
tied together folks are visiting The
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
Flume Gorge where encouraging them to go
 
00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:07.880 align:start position:0%
up the road to go visit the tram and
 
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
vice versa so there there's a lot of
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
interconnectivity between the tram
 
00:23:12.909 --> 00:23:12.919 align:start position:0%
operation and the summertime which is
 
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
supporting the ski area but also uh the
 
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
residual effects both from the parks uh
 
00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
you know down the road at The Flume and
 
00:23:20.669 --> 00:23:20.679 align:start position:0%
our campgrounds and everything that Fran
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
offer and presumably you could use an
 
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
extra 75,00
 
00:23:32.909 --> 00:23:32.919 align:start position:0%
a month of interest on this $18
 
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
million that that that would be great we
 
00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
can use every resource that we can for
 
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh for the park system yes okay y now
 
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
let's as long as you're here let's talk
 
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.909 align:start position:0%
let's as long as you're here let's talk
about

00:23:44.909 --> 00:23:44.919 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
um you have two different accounting
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
units in this one dedicated fund right
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
one for all the parks and one for the
 
00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
ski area um would it be useful to have
 
00:23:58.990 --> 00:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
two separate dedicated funds
 
00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
I mean they would still essentially
 
00:24:03.149 --> 00:24:03.159 align:start position:0%
operate the same way but um yeah I know
 
00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
this came up a couple weeks ago and we
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
were we were here before you and I know
 
00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
Chris Marino who's here is maybe perhaps
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
better to to to speak to that because
 
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
he's the one helping you know work work
 
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:15.400 align:start position:0%
our books I mean I think from from our
 
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
standpoint the structure from my
 
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
position the structure of the park
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
system is that these Al those separate
 
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
accounting units within the fund um were
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
created and we have the ability to
 
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
support each other in times of needs for
 
00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:30.520 align:start position:0%
instance there's been years where Canon
 
00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
has done really well in the park system
 
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
not so much and we have the ability to
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
move resources back and forth within the
 
00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
fund uh to help bolster one one account
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
or another so if if some things like
 
00:24:44.669 --> 00:24:44.679 align:start position:0%
that we're able to still sustain um I I
 
00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
I would defer to to to Chris for some
 
00:24:48.669 --> 00:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
guidance on
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
that yeah I'm happy to clarify Chris
 
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
Marino natural cultural resources and
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
yes I do recall this coming up and this
 
00:24:59.590 --> 00:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
is related to uh number 33 fund number
 
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
33 which the the number 33 captures two
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
components of the entire park system so
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
on the one hand you have the Canon
 
00:25:10.389 --> 00:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
Mountain scary account which is a
 
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
component of the broader Park fund and
 
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
then you have the multiple accounting
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
units that comprise the state park
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
account which is the other sort of half
 
00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
of the entire park fund so I understand
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
it's seems a little confusing but there
 
00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
are two distinct accounts within that
 
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
Park fund
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
so to to answer your question yeah I
 
00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
think it would it would be probably make
 
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
sense to go ahead and separate those
 
00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
into two separate uh itemized account
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
numbers under under under RSA 612 um
 
00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:44.440 align:start position:0%
we're happy to do that and um
 
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
we would if it would be helpful we're
 
00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:48.200 align:start position:0%
we're certainly supportive of
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
that name thank you all right other
 
00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
representative Al me yeah sorry could
 
00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:55.480 align:start position:0%
you remind me of your name again I'm
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
clarking I apiz my name is Chris Marino
 
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
Marino yes thank you Senator gray on oh
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
did you have Senator yeah I just wanted
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
to say that it it sounds in the books as
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
if we're talking just about Canan
 
00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
Mountain not about the entire Park
 
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
Service which is what actually 333b
 
00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
is I agree yes right so we could have a
 
00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
more a better title yes Senator Grant uh
 
00:26:31.149 --> 00:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
again the end of your statement confused
 
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
me a little do you want two separate
 
00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:35.720 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds or just two accounting
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
units under the one dedicated
 
00:26:42.669 --> 00:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
fund we we maintain two dedicated fund
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
accounts uh we should have two dedicated
 
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
fund accounts in this case we are
 
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
technically creating them separately we
 
00:26:51.909 --> 00:26:51.919 align:start position:0%
have the Canon Mountain dedicated fund
 
00:26:53.789 --> 00:26:53.799 align:start position:0%
which is the ski account fund and we
 
00:26:57.549 --> 00:26:57.559 align:start position:0%
have the multi account state park fun uh
 
00:26:59.230 --> 00:26:59.240 align:start position:0%
account which which is the other half of
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
the park fund but they both have number
 
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
they're both assigned the same dedicated
 
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
fund number so we'd want to separate
 
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
those and make those distinct dedicated
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
fund numbers to establish them clearly
 
00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
as separate dedicated
 
00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
funds so in my opinion that would be
 
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate for this but the tram
 
00:27:24.549 --> 00:27:24.559 align:start position:0%
interest would not be appropriate for
 
00:27:27.549 --> 00:27:27.559 align:start position:0%
the bill that this comp is going to do
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
because it is not a dedicated fund it's
 
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
just I need to be added to one of the
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds so if you want to add
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
interest or language related to interest
 
00:27:43.389 --> 00:27:43.399 align:start position:0%
you want to do it on a fund that has a
 
00:27:46.269 --> 00:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
balance because again we just Creed an
 
00:27:48.029 --> 00:27:48.039 align:start position:0%
interest and we look at the balances at
 
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
the end of the quarter um so we want to
 
00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
make sure there is a balance in one of
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
those dedicated FS right and there is a
 
00:27:58.509 --> 00:27:58.519 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund that's borrowed the $6
 
00:28:02.909 --> 00:28:02.919 align:start position:0%
million for Canon uh related
 
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
maintenance right
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
so that would be the appropriate fund I
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
would think yeah if I may um so that
 
00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
dedicated cam was again similar to the
 
00:28:17.389 --> 00:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
rims it was created uh back in 1998 to
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
um so so the the the capital Improvement
 
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
fund is unique is it is a revolving fund
 
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
is is a revolving Fund in a way that you
 
00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:31.039 align:start position:0%
have um there is this authority to bond
 
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis up to $6 million so
 
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
it's very unique than all of the capital
 
00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
projects that are bonded by the state
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
because those go through House Bill 25
 
00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:43.640 align:start position:0%
this particular Authority is very unique
 
00:28:47.549 --> 00:28:47.559 align:start position:0%
so in order to so so so um K man has the
 
00:28:50.909 --> 00:28:50.919 align:start position:0%
ability to um on a regular basis borrow
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
money and just if there is if there is
 
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
capacity they can keep borrowing uh and
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
repay those funds so that dedicated
 
00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:02.200 align:start position:0%
account is to uh maintain s Revenue the
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
revenue from sop and with that The Debt
 
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
Service gets paid that's how the
 
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:08.799 align:start position:0%
language is
 
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
written so I'm not really sure you want
 
00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
to add interest to that you
 
00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
you could I'm not sure yeah if I may
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
just just to if I'm understanding what
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting is essentially you're
 
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
suggesting diverting the interest that
 
00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
is being earned on the $18 million which
 
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
talking about that to divert that to
 
00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
support the additional paying of The
 
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
Debt Service against this Canon Mountain
 
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
Capital Improvement fund so it' be money
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
to support payoff of The Debt Service in
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
addition to the SOP Revenue that comes
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
in is that capsules caps what we're
 
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
talking okay yeah we're very supportive
 
00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:50.039 align:start position:0%
of that idea because it's
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
really we allocated this 18
 
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
million for Canon right I mean it's not
 
00:29:59.149 --> 00:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
really for uh for the tram I mean but
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
it's not really for the general fund
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
right so it's for the it's to support
 
00:30:06.909 --> 00:30:06.919 align:start position:0%
the tram but as the treasure has has
 
00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
pointed out a language is silent on
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
doing anything with any interest earned
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
on that in that case because there is
 
00:30:13.679 --> 00:30:14.710 align:start position:0%
on that in that case because there is
nothing

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
specifically prescribing what to do with
 
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
the interest that is earned from that
 
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
funds it stays within the general and
 
00:30:21.789 --> 00:30:21.799 align:start position:0%
maybe by the time we could get a bill
 
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
done You' you will have already spent it
 
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:26.360 align:start position:0%
on the tram right so I don't know is
 
00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.750 align:start position:0%
on the tram right so I don't know is
that

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
I suppose anything's possible I couldn't
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
speak to that okay in six months well I
 
00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
don't know how close is the contract to
 
00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:41.480 align:start position:0%
being signed and all that we
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
are we are probably uh i' I'd say at
 
00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799 align:start position:0%
least another two years out uh um um and
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
that's you know where're we're kind of
 
00:30:53.549 --> 00:30:53.559 align:start position:0%
in between a a place here where we've
 
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
already bid the projects and uh that
 
00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
cost came in well over the $18 million
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
so we're we're still kind of in a in a
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
in a gap here of trying to um understand
 
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:05.240 align:start position:0%
through this next budget cycle hopefully
 
00:31:06.669 --> 00:31:06.679 align:start position:0%
where what direction we're going to be
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
going Senator
 
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
Ros it it I think it makes sense to keep
 
00:31:14.279 --> 00:31:15.950 align:start position:0%
Ros it it I think it makes sense to keep
Canon

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
Canon
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
Mountain um and frankonia Notch State
 
00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:23.480 align:start position:0%
Park separate
 
00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
from other Parks because they're parks
 
00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
that also charge charge fees that get
 
00:31:33.269 --> 00:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
approved by fiscal so they they have
 
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
another Revenue source and um some of
 
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
most of our state parks I don't think
 
00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:44.120 align:start position:0%
charge even for parking
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
but every year we
 
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
approve fees for usage of both camping
 
00:31:56.669 --> 00:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
in Franconia Notch and skiing at Canon
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
so it it seems to me to make sense to
 
00:32:04.269 --> 00:32:04.279 align:start position:0%
separate those fonts from the rest of
 
00:32:07.629 --> 00:32:07.639 align:start position:0%
the park system all right thank
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
you other comments okay yes represent of
 
00:32:16.629 --> 00:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
Al me I didn't hear you discussing that
 
00:32:17.909 --> 00:32:17.919 align:start position:0%
option at
 
00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
all to take
 
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:27.039 align:start position:0%
33 and separate it into three parts as I
 
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:29.240 align:start position:0%
understand it one which would
 
00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
be the ski area one which would be
 
00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
Franconia Notch and one which would be
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
every other Park in the
 
00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:41.480 align:start position:0%
state okay uh just to clarify it would
 
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
it would only be a division of two not
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
three franconian Notch State Park
 
00:32:48.909 --> 00:32:48.919 align:start position:0%
although residing at the same location
 
00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
as Canon mountain is captured already in
 
00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:55.240 align:start position:0%
the state park account component yeah
 
00:32:56.509 --> 00:32:56.519 align:start position:0%
which is the other half so it would
 
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
already be included Ed so therefore two
 
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
two would be would be fine to capture
 
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.870 align:start position:0%
two would be would be fine to capture
everything

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:07.480 align:start position:0%
properly Senator rosal's okay with that
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
I see you're nodding okay all right um
 
00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
other questions for uh Treasurer
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
metell I seeing none thank you very much
 
00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
all right um so I think the next thing
 
00:33:26.669 --> 00:33:26.679 align:start position:0%
on our agenda was uh the um Connecticut
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
Lakes three fund you were going to get
 
00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
that and in the book let's
 
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:59.070 --> 00:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
221 there
 
00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.629 align:start position:0%
221 there
for

00:34:00.629 --> 00:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:26.310 align:start position:0%
 
start

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
all and in the
 
00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:32.109 align:start position:0%
all and in the
report

00:34:32.109 --> 00:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:45.869 --> 00:34:45.879 align:start position:0%
29 I'm not sure we in their
 
00:34:49.869 --> 00:34:49.879 align:start position:0%
report oh here we go so yeah so in the
 
00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
report that they sent us it's page 21 of
 
00:34:52.760 --> 00:35:02.670 align:start position:0%
report that they sent us it's page 21 of
36

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
go all right thank you so do we have did

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
really if I may there there hasn't been
 
00:35:29.069 --> 00:35:29.079 align:start position:0%
any additional uh information
 
00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
information or any handouts however I
 
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
did invite the treasurer to join us
 
00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
today to answer any specific questions
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
you had about the funds that you're
 
00:35:41.069 --> 00:35:41.079 align:start position:0%
inquiring about um okay to the extent
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
that we could elaborate a little bit on
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
your understanding of these funds is
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%

well I wanted to know there's an
 
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
endowment right so so isn't there there
 
00:35:53.069 --> 00:35:53.079 align:start position:0%
are three three end there are three
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
endowments but there should be you know
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
this one has $3 million that one as 12
 
00:35:59.829 --> 00:35:59.839 align:start position:0%
million you know whatever the numbers
 
00:36:03.069 --> 00:36:03.079 align:start position:0%

I worked with her to uh yeah clarify uh
 
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
an understanding of how we're
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
maintaining these and she is could I to
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
help us also I'm sorry where did this
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
endowment come from
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
and do they have strings
 
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
still so the endowment came from a the
 
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
acquisition there was there was land
 
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
that was acquired and this is a this is
 
00:36:43.069 --> 00:36:43.079 align:start position:0%
a document that gives a background uh
 
00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
going back to
 
00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
2003 um this air was managed um by the
 
00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:51.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Fish and Game
 
00:36:53.069 --> 00:36:53.079 align:start position:0%
department and the state of New
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire required a comprehensive
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
conservation easement of1 146,000 400
 
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
Acres um along with
 
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
that um established three separate
 
00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
endowments to
 
00:37:11.069 --> 00:37:11.079 align:start position:0%
benefit uh both dncr and the fishing
 
00:37:12.829 --> 00:37:12.839 align:start position:0%
game in the management of this of this
 
00:37:14.589 --> 00:37:14.599 align:start position:0%
area so there were three end three
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
endowments established each with a
 
00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.470 align:start position:0%
endowments established each with a
principal

00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:17.480 align:start position:0%
principal
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
balance um one was referred to as the
 
00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
monitoring endowment uh one was referred
 
00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:25.720 align:start position:0%
to as a stewardship
 
00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:29.240 align:start position:0%
endowment um and the third was a road
 
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance endowment um each having
 
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
their own principal amounts as
 
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
prescribed in in chapter law 2002
 
00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
chapter 148 laws of
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
2002 um so those were established as
 
00:37:44.109 --> 00:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
endowments with principal amounts under
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
this under the authority prescribed in
 
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
law at the time since that time those
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
funds are held in these endowments by
 
00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.190 align:start position:0%
funds are held in these endowments by
the

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
treasury who uh invests manages and so
 
00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
forth and over a period of time
 
00:38:00.589 --> 00:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
we are eligible to draw from these
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
endowments on a periodic basis certain
 
00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:06.839 align:start position:0%
amounts uh within limits as allowed to
 
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
use the funds to administer the
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
stewardship uh authorities that were
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
prescribed as for the purpose of these
 
00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
endowments so that is essentially
 
00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
fundamentally where these endowments
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
come from and what their purpose is how
 
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
they were established does that answer
 
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
the question for you so it was entirely
 
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
essentially all right so let's start
 
00:38:38.109 --> 00:38:38.119 align:start position:0%
with the first one uh number
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
219 so I'm guessing this has a balance
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
of a million dollar or something like
 
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
that so 219 in the book that would be
 
00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:50.920 align:start position:0%
the uh contic the heads track monitoring
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
endowment and the track monitoring
 
00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
endowment started with a principal
 
00:38:58.309 --> 00:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
balance of 1.25 5
 
00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
3747 and of course has grown
 
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
substantially in that time um so it
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
currently does have an ending
 
00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
balance right
 
00:39:13.359 --> 00:39:14.990 align:start position:0%
balance right
now

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
so is there any reason why that can't be
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
report um so it can be on the report
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative I had a conversation with
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
the com controller actually this morning
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
so this report has always been designed
 
00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.430 align:start position:0%
so this report has always been designed
to

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
depict the states what what they call
 
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
their Ledger balances um so essentially
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
the report is only showing you as you as
 
00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
you I'm sure you've
 
00:39:54.069 --> 00:39:54.079 align:start position:0%
surmised what we're spending and
 
00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
obviously the draws from the fund to pay
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
for it so gives no insight as you
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
obviously into these These funds
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
themselves what we can do is we can
 
00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
expand the narrative component of this
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
report to
 
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
elaborate to include that additional
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
information so that you have a broader
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
understanding as you read this this
 
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
report to understand in terms of the
 
00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:19.400 align:start position:0%
activity on the table what you're seeing
 
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
is the ins and you're seeing the the
 
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
amount being expended and of course the
 
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
draw to cover it but we can elaborate
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
with a separate uh part of this report
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
to clarify that information so you
 
00:40:32.109 --> 00:40:32.119 align:start position:0%
understand the beginning ending balance
 
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
of this endowment and any additional
 
00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
information related to it I just a
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
moment so why was the revenue only
 
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
$5,600 if you have $3 million
 
00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
invested in this particular endowment
 
00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
this is the track monitoring endowment
 
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
which is the least active of the three
 
00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
endowments uh that's essentially what
 
00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
that what that indicates is there was
 
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
just very little
 
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
activity occurring relative to the
 
00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
monitoring of the tra monitoring that
 
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
was necessary oh are you saying the $3
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
million is the sum of the three the the
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
$3 million no is is the value of the
 
00:41:14.829 --> 00:41:14.839 align:start position:0%
Endowment for this specific
 
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
purpose however yes there was only
 
00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:20.200 align:start position:0%
$5,600 actually spent out of the
 
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
endowment out of the $3 million
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
Endowment in total um due to very little
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
activity related to the need to um all
 
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
right so is is $3 million there for
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
monitoring compliance yes the $3 million
 
00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
that is in that account right now is
 
00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
specifically uh established for the
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
purpose of track monitoring which
 
00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
encompasses you know um right and
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
stewardship is yet another some some
 
00:41:52.349 --> 00:41:52.359 align:start position:0%
stewardship is another are another one
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
and road maintenance the other yes that
 
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
is correct all right thank you
 
00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
representative Aly yes um um at least
 
00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
the last time I heard the AG's office
 
00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
was and a lot of other people were
 
00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
heavily involved in uh in
 
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
protecting that particular
 
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
monitoring endowment that is that the
 
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
the the new owner of a large tract
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
within there was trying had come in with
 
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
the intention of turning the whole place
 
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
Place into a permanent forest with no
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
logging and no pretty much nothing else
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh so that he could get CR re not Reggie
 
00:42:45.549 --> 00:42:45.559 align:start position:0%
credits credits from the the uh the
 
00:42:49.829 --> 00:42:49.839 align:start position:0%
national um anti uh climate
 
00:42:54.109 --> 00:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
mitigation project and
 
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
um and that was being a opposed by quite
 
00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of people that live
 
00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:03.309 align:start position:0%
a lot of people that live
on

00:43:03.309 --> 00:43:03.319 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
timbering in that area and by the fact
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
that the endowment itself the the
 
00:43:14.109 --> 00:43:14.119 align:start position:0%
easement specifies that a certain amount
 
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
of logging is going to go on in every
 
00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
year and that a certain amount of of uh
 
00:43:22.829 --> 00:43:22.839 align:start position:0%
Sports Recreation is going to go on and
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
every year in the whole track on who
 
00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:31.720 align:start position:0%
who's paying for for the AG's office Etc
 
00:43:35.069 --> 00:43:35.079 align:start position:0%
is that not not an expense that should
 
00:43:38.109 --> 00:43:38.119 align:start position:0%
be in there so I'm I'm going to defer
 
00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
any clarifications to the commissioner
 
00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
she's obviously heavily involved Ching
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
at the bit to talk about
 
00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
this Sarah Stewart commissioner of the
 
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural and cultural
 
00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:51.109 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural and cultural
resources

00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
so there was an easen
 
00:43:56.109 --> 00:43:56.119 align:start position:0%
established 20 years ago the state paid
 
00:44:00.549 --> 00:44:00.559 align:start position:0%
$20 million for that um so um a very
 
00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
substantial investment to ensure Public
 
00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:09.160 align:start position:0%
Access Hunting Fishing uh Recreation Etc
 
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
um on this uh amazing track of land um
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
and over the past 20 years there's been
 
00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:18.440 align:start position:0%
several sales and purchases of the the
 
00:44:23.309 --> 00:44:23.319 align:start position:0%
fee owner of that land and um and over
 
00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:25.640 align:start position:0%
the years that land has been uh
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
harvested for Timber successfully the
 
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
easement does not
 
00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
include um a a minimum um amount of of
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
logging it only it the conversation at
 
00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:41.240 align:start position:0%
the time around the easement was so
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
focused on we don't want to see this
 
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
property clearcut that they established
 
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
a ceiling um but not a not a
 
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
floor um and so we we are still in the
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
process of receiving public comment
 
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
we've had several public meetings
 
00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
um my agency and Fish and Game are
 
00:45:04.109 --> 00:45:04.119 align:start position:0%
working closely with our um attorneys
 
00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
that are already provided to us for a
 
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
number of reasons um from the AG's
 
00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
office so this is just part of their
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
portfolio of work um so they're not
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
being we're not billing there's no
 
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
billing for their um investment of time
 
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
to understand the easement and to work
 
00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:24.280 align:start position:0%
with us and Aurora which is the fee
 
00:45:29.309 --> 00:45:29.319 align:start position:0%
owner um to make sure their uh
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
stewardship plan for this property is in
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
line with the easement and so over the
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
last several months we've been
 
00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
um we've been negotiating might be too
 
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
strong a word in conversations with them
 
00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
they've submitted uh a draft plan that's
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
public uh the public comment closes on
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
Friday we have a meeting up up in
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh um on Friday a regularly
 
00:45:56.589 --> 00:45:56.599 align:start position:0%
scheduled meeting at the close of that
 
00:45:56.599 --> 00:45:57.430 align:start position:0%
scheduled meeting at the close of that
meeting

00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:45:58.910 --> 00:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
you know we'll evaluate the public
 
00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
comment and get back to Aurora and and
 
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
there'll be some more iterations of that
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
plan before the state is in a position
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
to approve it but there will there still
 
00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:09.640 align:start position:0%
is logging on the property there is a
 
00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:11.480 align:start position:0%
lot of rumors out there that there isn't
 
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
there still is and we're committed to
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
that tradition and economic uh support
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:46:24.309 --> 00:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
region follow up go ahead yeah uh the so
 
00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
the cost of all of this is is is found
 
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
inside of your general administrative
 
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.510 align:start position:0%
inside of your general administrative
costs

00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
yeah and the AG's office
 
00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
is not financially involved shall we say
 
00:46:43.549 --> 00:46:43.559 align:start position:0%
they're just our advisors um as they are
 
00:46:46.349 --> 00:46:46.359 align:start position:0%
for many of our issues uh in this agency
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
Firm all right well so my main thing is
 
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think this report is is
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
acceptable you know this page 147 149
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
150 because it should be reported just
 
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
like any other F fund right there should
 
00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
be a balance which went from 1.25
 
00:47:14.109 --> 00:47:14.119 align:start position:0%
million to 3 million there should be
 
00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
Revenue which is the actual revenue on
 
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
that amount there should be expenses
 
00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:19.720 align:start position:0%
which are the actual expenses you're
 
00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
reporting as though the revenue and the
 
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
expenses are equal well they're not
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
right the fund is growing so so you know
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
can can you get us new reports
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely and and I'll be I will be
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
like I said I spoke with the com
 
00:47:35.309 --> 00:47:35.319 align:start position:0%
controller this morning we're going to
 
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:39.800 align:start position:0%
work to revise the report to give you
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
that additional information to be seen
 
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
on these reports um so that we go beyond
 
00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
just the basic Ledger requirements which
 
00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
which this is a depiction of and give
 
00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
you a true understanding of of what
 
00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
these endowments are how much what their
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
value is even a history of what has been
 
00:47:58.349 --> 00:47:58.359 align:start position:0%
drawn from them and the earnings and so
 
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
forth so we will work to uh revise these
 
00:48:04.349 --> 00:48:04.359 align:start position:0%
right so if for example you decided you
 
00:48:07.309 --> 00:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
needed a major monitoring project right
 
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
to put cameras all over the place or
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
something like that then there's some
 
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
money here to do it and you wouldn't
 
00:48:16.109 --> 00:48:16.119 align:start position:0%
have to come to us to say Alec give me
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
some more you know borrow money or
 
00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
general fund money or something for this
 
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:23.240 align:start position:0%
project right yes and that's typically
 
00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:25.480 align:start position:0%
how we've managed the support of the
 
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
conc headquarters Rel relative to these
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
to these endowments okay thank you
 
00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:33.880 align:start position:0%
representative thank you but
 
00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:38.559 align:start position:0%
on my impression is that when we get
 
00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
this that on very small percentage of
 
00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
the money in that particular endowment
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
would be being
 
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
used uh
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
whereas from the
 
00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:52.870 align:start position:0%
whereas from the
reports

00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
reports
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
the endowment that is to maintain the
 
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
roads is feeling quite
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
underfunded and
 
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:07.640 align:start position:0%
the the other one I'm
 
00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:11.480 align:start position:0%
not not so sure of the Endowment for
 
00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:13.960 align:start position:0%
habitat and public use management which
 
00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
seems to overlap with roads all right
 
00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
let's go on to any more questions about
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
stu um
 
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
monitoring no okay let's go on to the
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
next one which is
 
00:49:32.109 --> 00:49:32.119 align:start position:0%
um stewardship this is
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
um management what is the next one
 
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
habitat stewardship Ste is one way of
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
putting it but they also say another one
 
00:49:39.839 --> 00:49:40.910 align:start position:0%
putting it but they also say another one
is

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
stewardship yeah
 
00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:45.079 align:start position:0%
well there's monitoring there's
 
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
stewardship and there's roads right so
 
00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:49.240 align:start position:0%
let's go to the stewardship correct so
 
00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:51.880 align:start position:0%
stewardship uh again was also
 
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
established as a $1 million principal
 
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
amount uh for the purpose of habitat and
 
00:49:59.789 --> 00:49:59.799 align:start position:0%
public use management of 25,000 Acres of
 
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
natural areas owned by the state of New
 
00:50:03.789 --> 00:50:03.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and for the purpose of
 
00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
recreation use and the conservation
 
00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
easement management of the 146,00 Acres
 
00:50:10.789 --> 00:50:10.799 align:start position:0%
on which the state shall hold a
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
conservation easement so again it was
 
00:50:15.789 --> 00:50:15.799 align:start position:0%
another endowment established with a
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
specific purpose in mind and it has been
 
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
time and the current value the current
 
00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
value on that
 
00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
one Swit one
 
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
2.6 2613 million yes two $2.6 million
 
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:43.720 align:start position:0%
okay so this one is healthy I guess yes
 
00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:47.720 align:start position:0%
okay all right questions on this no all
 
00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
right I I just represent well me I find
 
00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
is so overlapping stewardship includes
 
00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
monitoring stewardship
 
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
includes uh all the rest of this stuff
 
00:51:04.829 --> 00:51:04.839 align:start position:0%
and yeah to call any part of it
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
stewardship is representative I I I'm
 
00:51:12.109 --> 00:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
hearing what you're saying um and
 
00:51:14.789 --> 00:51:14.799 align:start position:0%
perhaps after we talk about the roads um
 
00:51:17.309 --> 00:51:17.319 align:start position:0%
I would like to at the risk of causing
 
00:51:17.319 --> 00:51:18.870 align:start position:0%
I would like to at the risk of causing
unintended

00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
unintended
 
00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
consequences um talk a little bit more
 
00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:23.240 align:start position:0%
broadly about how you know if we have
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
resources that are underutilized but we
 
00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
have a really big need over here and
 
00:51:29.589 --> 00:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
we're not allowed to um it's worth a
 
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
conversation to see if we can um you
 
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
know there there could have been a very
 
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
specific reason um in 2003 that they
 
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
were set up separately but here we are
 
00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
and we have over 200 miles of roads and
 
00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:46.280 align:start position:0%
culverts are very expensive and there's
 
00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
engineering involved and that's that
 
00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
fund is never going to be enough um so
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
perhaps we can hear a little specific
 
00:51:56.829 --> 00:51:56.839 align:start position:0%
about the roads fund and then talk about
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
what is possible to balance this
 
00:52:03.069 --> 00:52:03.079 align:start position:0%
out all right thank you so uh let's go
 
00:52:08.349 --> 00:52:08.359 align:start position:0%
to roads then which is number
 
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
221 right uh so as the commissioner rly
 
00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
pointed out it is another separate
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
endowment with a specific purpose in
 
00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
mind this was again established at $1.25
 
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
million uh in funds from TPL and the
 
00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
Society of protection of New Hampshire
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
forests for the purpose of of ensuring a
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
Perpetual sourcer of funds to maintain
 
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
the system of roads that exists within
 
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
the easement and property interests
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
acquired by the state in the Connecticut
 
00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
Elite Headwaters tract so again very
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
spec each one is is clarified with a
 
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
specific intent but we are
 
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
seeing uh the need to possibly
 
00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
consolidate or have the latitude to
 
00:52:53.549 --> 00:52:53.559 align:start position:0%
overlap for example the monitoring
 
00:52:56.109 --> 00:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
endowment um which was to ensure a
 
00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
perpet ual source for monitoring
 
00:52:59.309 --> 00:52:59.319 align:start position:0%
compliance with the terms and conditions
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:02.680 align:start position:0%
easement is over $3
 
00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
million um it would be it would be good
 
00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:08.200 align:start position:0%
for us to be able to divert some of that
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
available resource to the other
 
00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
components of the of the stewardship of
 
00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:14.680 align:start position:0%
this area specifically the road
 
00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance um so it would be helpful to
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
be able to do that what's the balance on
 
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
all right could could I just yes
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
represent you just uh spoke of TPL and
 
00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:37.880 align:start position:0%
which I don't know what that stands for
 
00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:39.880 align:start position:0%
and the society for I'm Sor Trust for
 
00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
Public Lands Trust for Public Lands
 
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's a national one isn't
 
00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
it the Trust for Public Lands um I
 
00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:49.990 align:start position:0%
it the Trust for Public Lands um I
believe

00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:54.680 align:start position:0%
is is that specifically a a national
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
National National non
 
00:53:59.870 --> 00:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
yeah and the society for protection of
 
00:54:02.829 --> 00:54:02.839 align:start position:0%
forests is unique to New Hampshire
 
00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:05.720 align:start position:0%
correct this Cas what brought us
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
back our
 
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
trees from total disaster um
 
00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:19.640 align:start position:0%
and and they do they hold the
 
00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
supervision of the state easement or why
 
00:54:26.549 --> 00:54:26.559 align:start position:0%
did you mention them
 
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
I I was just clarifying for you the
 
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
source of the funds that established
 
00:54:33.549 --> 00:54:33.559 align:start position:0%
these endowments in the case of yeah
 
00:54:35.549 --> 00:54:35.559 align:start position:0%
they provided the funds correct in the
 
00:54:37.829 --> 00:54:37.839 align:start position:0%
case of the monitoring endowment uh
 
00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
Trust for Public Lands provided the 1.25
 
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
million in the case of the stewardship
 
00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
endowment it was a com it was
 
00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
a combination of the nature
 
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
conservancy and and the trust Republic
 
00:54:52.589 --> 00:54:52.599 align:start position:0%
lands and then for the uh road
 
00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance endowment was a combination
 
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
of of funding from the trust for public
 
00:54:58.190 --> 00:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
lands and the society for the protection
 
00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
of Hampshire forests
 
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
wow so they have some kind of
 
00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:08.799 align:start position:0%
legal ability to oversee what we're
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
doing with these don't they uh I'm not
 
00:55:14.789 --> 00:55:14.799 align:start position:0%
entirely sure I don't think so I think
 
00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:18.280 align:start position:0%
they just um believed in the cause and
 
00:55:20.829 --> 00:55:20.839 align:start position:0%
chipped in so that there would be these
 
00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
These funds
 
00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
established um I I don't I don't need to
 
00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
um okay per I don't need to run the
 
00:55:32.029 --> 00:55:32.039 align:start position:0%
easement by them you know in terms of
 
00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
like the annual operating plan or the
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
management plan they they're not I think
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
it was just part of their mission to
 
00:55:40.029 --> 00:55:40.039 align:start position:0%
help establish the
 
00:55:45.029 --> 00:55:45.039 align:start position:0%
funds so we're under a a third now of
 
00:55:47.789 --> 00:55:47.799 align:start position:0%
our land in Lebanon which is conserved
 
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
is is under them we left because it and
 
00:55:54.270 --> 00:55:54.280 align:start position:0%
are working with another group because
 
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
they're easier to
 
00:55:58.950 --> 00:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
to work with but
 
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
um and they were
 
00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:05.270 align:start position:0%
um and they were
extremely

00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
um we had to spend a huge amount of
 
00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:10.559 align:start position:0%
money at one point when someone broke an
 
00:56:13.349 --> 00:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
easement on one of those yeah and we
 
00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
could not force him without about four
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
years of lawyers to uh get out of of our
 
00:56:23.950 --> 00:56:23.960 align:start position:0%
property no they don't have any clause
 
00:56:30.829 --> 00:56:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
management so is there any legal reason
 
00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
why we couldn't combine these three
 
00:56:38.109 --> 00:56:38.119 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds into a single Endowment
 
00:56:40.829 --> 00:56:40.839 align:start position:0%
for the Connecticut headquarters tract
 
00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
and let
 
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
you use them as necessary for different
 
00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:48.200 align:start position:0%
kinds of projects uh well I think that I
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
think primarily the the legal reason why
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
we have them separate is because they
 
00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:55.720 align:start position:0%
were designated specifically each with
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
its own AR RSA designation so we'd have
 
00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:02.440 align:start position:0%
to seek to revise the RSA to allow that
 
00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
combin yes
 
00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
yeah Senator gray are we sure that the
 
00:57:12.069 --> 00:57:12.079 align:start position:0%
money when it was endowed to us didn't
 
00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
have these three funds set up because if
 
00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:17.480 align:start position:0%
it did then you got to go back through
 
00:57:20.109 --> 00:57:20.119 align:start position:0%
the AG and petition the courts to be
 
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
able to change it I no but it sounded
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
like it was the state allocated the
 
00:57:28.029 --> 00:57:28.039 align:start position:0%
money to create these endowments yes it
 
00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:31.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't like endowed by Rockefeller or
 
00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:33.640 align:start position:0%
something the state provided the
 
00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
authority to allow us to proceed with
 
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
getting endowments established and then
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
the sources of
 
00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
funding were brought forward to actually
 
00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:47.960 align:start position:0%
fund the endowments themselves so in the
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
case of each the trust Republic lands is
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
in each one of them but in the case of
 
00:57:57.069 --> 00:57:57.079 align:start position:0%
one the nature conserv has contributed
 
00:57:58.510 --> 00:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
some funding in the case of another of
 
00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
the Society of protection of New
 
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Forest oh I see um I'm not
 
00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
sure if there would be any concern or
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
consideration over the fact that the
 
00:58:10.029 --> 00:58:10.039 align:start position:0%
society for New Hampshire protection
 
00:58:14.029 --> 00:58:14.039 align:start position:0%
Forest gave their their part towards
 
00:58:16.349 --> 00:58:16.359 align:start position:0%
road maintenance so if the state were to
 
00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
now say we're not Discerning anymore
 
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
between these functions it's all all to
 
00:58:24.069 --> 00:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
the good of any of them wherever it's
 
00:58:25.950 --> 00:58:25.960 align:start position:0%
needed I don't know if there might be
 
00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:28.760 align:start position:0%
any into consideration to allow the
 
00:58:30.910 --> 00:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
donors who who gave the money at the
 
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
time to you know need to be able to say
 
00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:35.240 align:start position:0%
well we gave it for this but we didn't
 
00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
give it for that that commissioner can
 
00:58:36.799 --> 00:58:37.589 align:start position:0%
give it for that that commissioner can
you

00:58:37.589 --> 00:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
comment I wasn't here um when these
 
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
conversations uh were originally had um
 
00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
but I think we need to do a little
 
00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:47.240 align:start position:0%
homework to figure out what strings
 
00:58:49.069 --> 00:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
perhaps were attached or promises made
 
00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:52.280 align:start position:0%
to for each of the funds um so there's a
 
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
there's a legal path here but there's
 
00:58:56.589 --> 00:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
also a political path um
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
I think the good news is um by the time
 
00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:01.960 align:start position:0%
there's a new legislative session we
 
00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
will have I believe we will have
 
00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
successfully um worked out um negotiated
 
00:59:10.829 --> 00:59:10.839 align:start position:0%
and and concluded our negotiations with
 
00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
Aurora to establish the the 10-year
 
00:59:15.069 --> 00:59:15.079 align:start position:0%
management plan I think that's a great
 
00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:17.240 align:start position:0%
time to have an overlapping conversation
 
00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:19.160 align:start position:0%
about how we're going to fund the
 
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
stewardship of this property and and
 
00:59:26.109 --> 00:59:26.119 align:start position:0%
road maintenance is really key to um the
 
00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
promise of Public Access it's also key
 
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
to get around to do the monitoring um so
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
it does all tie together I think we have
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
some leg work to do to figure out the
 
00:59:38.589 --> 00:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
logistics to see if it's POS if there's
 
00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839 align:start position:0%
a path forward um and and talk through
 
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
any unintended consequences and there's
 
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
also a narrative that we would have to
 
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
share with some of these stakeholders
 
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
who have um been very um interested in
 
00:59:52.829 --> 00:59:52.839 align:start position:0%
the future of this
 
00:59:55.150 --> 00:59:55.160 align:start position:0%
property all right so that'll be a task
 
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
for you I guess
 
00:59:59.870 --> 00:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
um other comments from the
 
01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:02.920 align:start position:0%
committee no okay good all right so
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
you're going to get us um more
 
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate um paperwork here right yes
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to enhance these this report
 
01:00:14.829 --> 01:00:14.839 align:start position:0%
to include a section that will reflect
 
01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
the actual endowment that we've
 
01:00:18.190 --> 01:00:18.200 align:start position:0%
discussed today including the figures
 
01:00:21.069 --> 01:00:21.079 align:start position:0%
related to the endowment yes all right
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
thank you so um all right now I have a
 
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
note here that uh um Miss mapelli would
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
like to talk to us
 
01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:31.890 align:start position:0%
like to talk to us
about

01:00:31.890 --> 01:00:31.900 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:33.630 align:start position:0%
about
[Music]

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:33.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:42.190 --> 01:00:42.200 align:start position:0%
accounts so this this is seate any any
 
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
further questions for dncr on I may have
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
some we all right hold on a second so
 
01:00:57.390 --> 01:00:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:01.720 align:start position:0%
I I wrote notes on things that I thought
 
01:01:05.349 --> 01:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
um were either useful to understand what
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:15.599 --> 01:01:18.950 align:start position:0%
 
heritage

01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
is has got a major funding problem it
 
01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
looks like or rather a problem which is
 
01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:26.630 align:start position:0%
looks like or rather a problem which is
growing

01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
growing
 
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh and I was wondering about whether you
 
01:01:33.150 --> 01:01:33.160 align:start position:0%
have the opport ability to increase the
 
01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.910 align:start position:0%
have the opport ability to increase the
developer

01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
developer
 
01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
fees which seems to be the only place
 
01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:39.640 align:start position:0%
the money could come
 
01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
from uh which fund are you talking yeah
 
01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
this is on
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
61224 Au
 
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
3407 Bureau of natur natural heritage
 
01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:55.559 align:start position:0%
which is all by itself towards the end
 
01:01:55.559 --> 01:01:56.950 align:start position:0%
which is all by itself towards the end
of

01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.829 align:start position:0%
of
the

01:01:58.829 --> 01:01:58.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:01.960 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet 34 oh yeah inreasing
 
01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
developer fees oh all right number 240
 
01:02:08.269 --> 01:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
yeah on page 26 of my
 
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
report so they do the as far as I know
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
the main place that they get money from
 
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
is that developers decide that they want
 
01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
to build something on land that is
 
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
relatively undisturbed and um that they
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
are required by our law to to go and get
 
01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
the bureau to tell them
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
whether there's something that needs to
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
be protected in there yeah this is page
 
01:02:43.549 --> 01:02:43.559 align:start position:0%
26 this is page 26 of 36 in your
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
report yes and the the funding source is
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
clarified on page 27 under RSA 217 87a
 
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
Section 1 essentially the the funding
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
this is funded primarily by fees that
 
01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
are charged as you've described um when
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
developers or interested parties go on
 
01:03:06.430 --> 01:03:06.440 align:start position:0%
to certain land they have to uh inquire
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not there are any
 
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
concerns or consideration that might
 
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
disrupt the natural habitat areas so
 
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
they need to make inquiry in doing so
 
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
there is a fee associated with that um
 
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
in order to provide that reporting and
 
01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:21.160 align:start position:0%
information if it comes back that there
 
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
is concern or consideration we do
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
collect the the fee for that inquiry um
 
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
and that goes through the Environmental
 
01:03:31.109 --> 01:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
Services um does does that clarify the
 
01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
answer the question well it looks to me
 
01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
like your fees are in your rules right
 
01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:37.160 align:start position:0%
they're not in law they're they're
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
defined in rules the rules clarify what
 
01:03:43.029 --> 01:03:43.039 align:start position:0%
the cost of the fees so for examp these
 
01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:45.039 align:start position:0%
fees are inadequate because the fund
 
01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
looks like it constantly has a negative
 
01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
balance then you might have to change
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
your R I believe the bureau
 
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
administrator would agree wholeheartedly
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
with you in fact as I understand it they
 
01:03:57.230 --> 01:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
are seeking to make a rules change to
 
01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
increase the fees substantially at time
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
that is true we're working closely with
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
Dees to to make sure we're appropriately
 
01:04:08.789 --> 01:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
in what is fair market on this um uh and
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
we've had productive conversations with
 
01:04:14.069 --> 01:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
um commissioner Bob Scott and Adam crepo
 
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
um to to a commitment to work through
 
01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
this together so I'm
 
01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:21.640 align:start position:0%
hoping that sooner rather than later we
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
will have an opportunity to make that
 
01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:26.870 align:start position:0%
will have an opportunity to make that
case

01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:29.789 --> 01:04:29.799 align:start position:0%
thank you all right any other questions
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
on this or other
 
01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:38.200 align:start position:0%
map uh well the historic sites fund is
 
01:04:41.309 --> 01:04:41.319 align:start position:0%
perpetually uh but it is in better shape
 
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
now because it has robbed money from the
 
01:04:46.589 --> 01:04:46.599 align:start position:0%
state park
 
01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
fund but um
 
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
so they are starting to get enough money
 
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
to make some improvement
 
01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
to places that frequently are just they
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
try to keep the mold down yeah and we
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
we've benefited from some arpa funding
 
01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
to make improvements at specific
 
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
historic sites which will be really
 
01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
helpful um it gave us you know that that
 
01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:17.240 align:start position:0%
boost um uh so so those projects are you
 
01:05:19.309 --> 01:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
know are are the contracts are being
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
wrapped up right now so that we hit the
 
01:05:23.109 --> 01:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
deadline um and that'll help I think
 
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
with revenue and Longevity um but yeah
 
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
historic sites I think there's a lot of
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity as a history major I think
 
01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more opportunity um uh
 
01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
with these sites uh but they do need a
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
constant amount of work anyone who owns
 
01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
a old house would understand that
 
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
clearly yes all right let's move on to
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
the treasurer thank you very much thank
 
01:05:54.269 --> 01:05:54.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
department thank you Mr chairman I won't
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
I won't take uh time I I just um the
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
note that you receiv received is um we
 
01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
the treasury is trying to do some
 
01:06:08.269 --> 01:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
cleanup of the RSA um of the dedicate
 
01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
account so um you heard us talking about
 
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
the off book accounts so we have a a
 
01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
plan to first of all put those off book
 
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
accounts in the accounting system with
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
the um with the upgrade of the the new
 
01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
accounting system um there is a there's
 
01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
a functionality there's a module that
 
01:06:30.029 --> 01:06:30.039 align:start position:0%
will be able to um move those
 
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
essentially put them in the accounting
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
system but we will have a special
 
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
treatment uh so that's a plan for next
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
year but part of that is we're trying to
 
01:06:38.549 --> 01:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
figure out what's already in the
 
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
accounting system what is not and and
 
01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
the the correct place where they they
 
01:06:46.269 --> 01:06:46.279 align:start position:0%
should be um recorded So this is part of
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
the cleanup we have we have about 30
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
something accounts of book and and those
 
01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
some of them are accounts really that at
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
some point agencies asked us to open
 
01:07:01.109 --> 01:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
special accounts or investment accounts
 
01:07:03.309 --> 01:07:03.319 align:start position:0%
for those those are the type of accounts
 
01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
that we are putting back into the
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
regular business of the state we're not
 
01:07:10.589 --> 01:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
going to have special accounts for those
 
01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:12.920 align:start position:0%
uh we only would like to keep um
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
essentially separate what our trust in
 
01:07:18.349 --> 01:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
escco accounts and custodial accounts
 
01:07:21.309 --> 01:07:21.319 align:start position:0%
things are shouldn't be part of gu they
 
01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
need to be treated differently so uh so
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
part of that cleanup we're trying to
 
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
identify by um those accounts in already
 
01:07:30.029 --> 01:07:30.039 align:start position:0%
in RSA
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
612 um they are called dedicated
 
01:07:35.349 --> 01:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
accounts and there's another section
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
that are called trusting agency accounts
 
01:07:41.069 --> 01:07:41.079 align:start position:0%
and there's another one that's called uh
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
trusting um escrow and so so we want to
 
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
clean those up there are some accounts
 
01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
are not there others that should be
 
01:07:50.589 --> 01:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
removed because no longer exist bottom
 
01:07:53.230 --> 01:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
line is we're working on that cleanup
 
01:07:56.430 --> 01:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
and and and and my hope is as part of
 
01:07:59.150 --> 01:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
your agenda we're able to provide you
 
01:08:03.029 --> 01:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
with um a recommendation a draft of what
 
01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
should look the law should look like and
 
01:08:06.510 --> 01:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps that's something this committee
 
01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
could consider as part of the work that
 
01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:12.279 align:start position:0%
you do so if there is time still in your
 
01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
in your schedule of this dedicated funds
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
committee uh I would love to come back
 
01:08:19.789 --> 01:08:19.799 align:start position:0%
and and show you or work with you to to
 
01:08:22.189 --> 01:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
um to see even I mean I have some ideas
 
01:08:23.789 --> 01:08:23.799 align:start position:0%
of what how that should look like but
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps you have other but you know
 
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
again part of your your what you do your
 
01:08:30.269 --> 01:08:30.279 align:start position:0%
objectives happy to work with you uh
 
01:08:32.269 --> 01:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
with this work but but I think it will
 
01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:34.600 align:start position:0%
be important to have a clear definition
 
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
in the law of what should be kept
 
01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
separate uh or or you know if we're
 
01:08:41.229 --> 01:08:41.239 align:start position:0%
going to have investment accounts for
 
01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:43.880 align:start position:0%
those we we can still have those but
 
01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
there are others that simply need to go
 
01:08:47.950 --> 01:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
back their their the funds that they
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
just agencies need to put it back into
 
01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
their business and we shouldn't have
 
01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
anything uh special for them so would
 
01:08:57.669 --> 01:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
you be ready in about two weeks to
 
01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:00.279 align:start position:0%
suggest legislation I could I could I
 
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
could have some type of draft and again
 
01:09:05.149 --> 01:09:05.159 align:start position:0%
can show it to you again it's just what
 
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
I think should look like but again I'm
 
01:09:09.829 --> 01:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
happy to work with you and your in your
 
01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
thoughts your Visions as to how those
 
01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
accounts really should Bel where they
 
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
belong like I said some of them are we
 
01:09:17.669 --> 01:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
have special accounts and accounting or
 
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
the um State's Financial STS are are
 
01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
presented as feary funds but they're
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
listed right now as just a typical dedic
 
01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
accounts so those are the ones that
 
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
again it's a simple cleanup but I'll be
 
01:09:32.349 --> 01:09:32.359 align:start position:0%
happy to share that with you yeah so
 
01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
come up with a list right in in about
 
01:09:37.630 --> 01:09:37.640 align:start position:0%
two weeks I think and we'll work out a a
 
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
meeting dat represent W me yeah there is
 
01:09:44.910 --> 01:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
one that I've been dealing with since I
 
01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
started this process 20s something years
 
01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
ago on the government of Japan because
 
01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.470 align:start position:0%
ago on the government of Japan because
we

01:09:53.470 --> 01:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:09:58.189 --> 01:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
facilitated on the process of of coming
 
01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:01.400 align:start position:0%
to a a
 
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
treaty uh with was it Korea at the time
 
01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
uh on gave
 
01:10:14.189 --> 01:10:14.199 align:start position:0%
us the money to plant cherry trees
 
01:10:15.229 --> 01:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
around New
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that sat there for a very
 
01:10:21.149 --> 01:10:21.159 align:start position:0%
long time uh after they planted a bunch
 
01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
of them and uh it was still there when I
 
01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:25.830 align:start position:0%
of them and uh it was still there when I
was

01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
looking at it and it got turned somehow
 
01:10:33.189 --> 01:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
into an account to
 
01:10:36.669 --> 01:10:36.679 align:start position:0%
allow uh three members of state
 
01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
government to decide that one or another
 
01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
um employee of the state was worthy of
 
01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
getting a small
 
01:10:50.910 --> 01:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
Grant which seemed very
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
peculiar and and I don't know how they
 
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
achieved that they're hardly using the
 
01:10:59.950 --> 01:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
money by the way um but um I don't know
 
01:11:02.669 --> 01:11:02.679 align:start position:0%
how they achieved changing it over like
 
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
that when it was a trust from the
 
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
government of Japan
 
01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:09.270 align:start position:0%
government of Japan
um

01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:12.510 --> 01:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
but there it is I don't know what you do
 
01:11:15.310 --> 01:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
with something like that that that's a
 
01:11:17.149 --> 01:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
great question person alme um so that's
 
01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
a that's an account we have in in and
 
01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:21.400 align:start position:0%
I'm a member of the board so you are
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
correct we there's not a lot of activity
 
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
in that account um one of the work again
 
01:11:27.189 --> 01:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
this is this is just cleanup work but
 
01:11:29.229 --> 01:11:29.239 align:start position:0%
one of the work for that for that boore
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
is really to define a purpose re review
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
exactly that is correct that is my
 
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
understanding that's what the fund is
 
01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
for uh but one of the things that um
 
01:11:40.270 --> 01:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
that department of justice has suggested
 
01:11:42.629 --> 01:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
is we need to really clarify objectives
 
01:11:44.189 --> 01:11:44.199 align:start position:0%
of that fund so there's an opportunity
 
01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
to to Really reestablish or or or review
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
the mission of that fund um and and
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
Define it and so we can proceed with a
 
01:11:55.790 --> 01:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
correct policy um so
 
01:11:57.510 --> 01:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
there will be more work on that for sure
 
01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
at least be given to the state
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
Nursery the the the other one that um
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
just just briefly uh the other one that
 
01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
I think in the past I've reported to you
 
01:12:09.390 --> 01:12:09.400 align:start position:0%
uh was the is the Ben Thompson trust
 
01:12:13.390 --> 01:12:13.400 align:start position:0%
fund that that fund um requires some
 
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
change this requires a review but also
 
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
um because of the way the law is written
 
01:12:23.470 --> 01:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
a very old law um so that needs to re
 
01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:25.400 align:start position:0%
revised so I've been having conversation
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
with Department of Justice charal trust
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
and also with the university system of
 
01:12:31.669 --> 01:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and right now what we
 
01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
would like to do is is essentially um we
 
01:12:40.229 --> 01:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
we have a plan to move that fund to the
 
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
university system endowment so they will
 
01:12:46.030 --> 01:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
oversee the endowment follow the will of
 
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
Ben Thompson um in and again it will be
 
01:12:51.629 --> 01:12:51.639 align:start position:0%
managed uh probably more appropriately
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
um so right now we're in the work so
 
01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
there are two things that need to happen
 
01:12:56.629 --> 01:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
with that one is Department of Justice
 
01:12:58.590 --> 01:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
and there needs to be a court proceeding
 
01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
the other one is to repeal the law so I
 
01:13:02.990 --> 01:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
already started um with through the
 
01:13:04.990 --> 01:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
process of house bill to to the agency
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
budget process we at least um we are
 
01:13:10.189 --> 01:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
recommending to repeal the laws related
 
01:13:12.910 --> 01:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
to Ben Thompson so you'll see that work
 
01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:16.360 align:start position:0%
um when you deal with the budget um but
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
um but if not that would have been
 
01:13:20.350 --> 01:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
another work uh apprpriate work for this
 
01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
this committee to to review but in case
 
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
if Ina if if things don't go well with
 
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
House Bill too perhaps um you know we'll
 
01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
can have a discussion again because I
 
01:13:32.229 --> 01:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
think um all parties that I've had
 
01:13:34.629 --> 01:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
conversations with are in favor of this
 
01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
plan and it sounds like it would be a
 
01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
good path for providing this funds to
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
the university system they'll manage it
 
01:13:43.629 --> 01:13:43.639 align:start position:0%
just like they do um any of you know
 
01:13:46.590 --> 01:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
their endowments that they hold
 
01:13:50.229 --> 01:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
so right thank you all right so we'll
 
01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
we'll schedule something um
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
offline for when our next meting
 
01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for done all right
 
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
so next I'd like to go uh approve the
 
01:14:06.189 --> 01:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
minutes of the last two
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
meetings don't move uh I have I have
 
01:14:11.310 --> 01:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
some I have a
 
01:14:14.510 --> 01:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
change a correction or whatever so let's
 
01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
start with the me the minutes of um
 
01:14:23.189 --> 01:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
the uh 16th September
 
01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
16th um on the second
 
01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
page uh under 6 612 uh fund 178 it's
 
01:14:36.189 --> 01:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
listed you you wrote School building Aid
 
01:14:40.189 --> 01:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
it's actually School building authority
 
01:14:43.149 --> 01:14:43.159 align:start position:0%
uhhuh so I thought it was Aid in one
 
01:14:43.159 --> 01:14:44.750 align:start position:0%
uhhuh so I thought it was Aid in one
place

01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
but yeah it's it's well in the book and
 
01:14:49.950 --> 01:14:49.960 align:start position:0%
all that it's School building
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
authority um they they approve
 
01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
applications for Aid or whatever ever
 
01:14:58.709 --> 01:14:58.719 align:start position:0%
but it anyways it should be Authority um
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
well given that why I did bold things in
 
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
both of these that we needed to look at
 
01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
no I thought that was a good
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
idea yeah and this one is obviously not
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
able to use all the money that the
 
01:15:18.669 --> 01:15:18.679 align:start position:0%
general fund keeps giving
 
01:15:18.679 --> 01:15:20.990 align:start position:0%
general fund keeps giving
it

01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
right right exactly so um
 
01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
that one I have kind of an action item
 
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
5-m yeah 200-m colon 5 yeah okay so
 
01:16:07.270 --> 01:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
those are the only changes I had anybody
 
01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:10.790 align:start position:0%
those are the only changes I had anybody
else

01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
well I was uh I did put a lot of these
 
01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
in Bolding to see if people agreed or
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
disagreed with different ideas that had
 
01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
come up um the first first one is the
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
second item on page two uh yes they
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:16:38.430 --> 01:16:38.440 align:start position:0%
on the 137 is the board of lure of
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
interpreters for deaf and Harden hearing
 
01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:43.669 align:start position:0%
interpreters for deaf and Harden hearing
on

01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
and they have they are just allowing the
 
01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
the money in that fund to grow uh
 
01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
without doing anything with it well just
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
and they they did say at the time that
 
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
they would be fine with moving that over
 
01:17:04.149 --> 01:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
to oplc which is good at at
 
01:17:06.669 --> 01:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:17:10.590 --> 01:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
streamlining no I I I approve of the
 
01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:13.639 align:start position:0%
Bolding and I we will be talking about
 
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
actions in a moment oh so we're doing
 
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
but as far as approving the minutes okay
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
as minutes okay all right so any other
 
01:17:25.629 --> 01:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
changes all right all those in favor say
 
01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
I I I any opposed no okay unanimous now
 
01:17:33.629 --> 01:17:33.639 align:start position:0%
the other one September
 
01:17:38.590 --> 01:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
18th um I only noticed one little thing
 
01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
here let's
 
01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
see uh this is a long one so under the
 
01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:47.189 align:start position:0%
see uh this is a long one so under the
State

01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
State
 
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
Library uh which is
 
01:17:52.350 --> 01:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
like the third from the end yeah
 
01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
something like that um
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
heard from the end right I had a note
 
01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
that on on fund 6121
 
01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
179 um that uh I had a note that the the
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
title or the it references something
 
01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
called The Family Resource connection
 
01:18:19.709 --> 01:18:19.719 align:start position:0%
yes they said that they had stopped
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
doing that that's right and so I have a
 
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
note that uh we we mentioned that we
 
01:18:30.510 --> 01:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
should check RSA 2011- a Col
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
10 um and and possibly
 
01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
delete uh this reference to Family
 
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
Resource connection as a defunct term
 
01:18:47.669 --> 01:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
a yeah okay I didn't realize that was
 
01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:02.830 --> 01:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
motion okay second all right all those
 
01:19:06.430 --> 01:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
in favor say I I any poos all right
 
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
anounce all right good now as far as
 
01:19:13.470 --> 01:19:13.480 align:start position:0%
timing um do we want to kind of go
 
01:19:16.110 --> 01:19:16.120 align:start position:0%
through the spreadsheet
 
01:19:21.149 --> 01:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
and uh see what kind of actions should
 
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
be in in any bill that comes from this
 
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
committee or any other bill that members
 
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
might want
 
01:19:32.629 --> 01:19:32.639 align:start position:0%
to to do
 
01:19:35.629 --> 01:19:35.639 align:start position:0%
um do we have time right now does or do
 
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
people want to come back and do that
 
01:19:40.149 --> 01:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
some other time all right we why don't
 
01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
we do that now all
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
right so um I would like to point out
 
01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
that I did not always put on
 
01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
the this one I did put on the
 
01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:57.310 align:start position:0%
the this one I did put on the
sheet

01:19:57.310 --> 01:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
sheet
 
01:20:01.870 --> 01:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
okay all right so so starting with um
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
banking I don't think there's any
 
01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:07.550 align:start position:0%
banking I don't think there's any
change

01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
right then Veterans Home same
 
01:20:15.070 --> 01:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
thing those all seem
 
01:20:17.830 --> 01:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
good then Department of Education so we
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
have the one we just talked about move
 
01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:21.950 align:start position:0%
have the one we just talked about move
to

01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
is that something we can all do as a
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
committee uh send this licensure and
 
01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
certification fund to
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:44.629 --> 01:20:44.639 align:start position:0%
hb2 well or like I said it could be in
 
01:20:48.550 --> 01:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
our bill yeah yeah file a bill okay all
 
01:20:50.629 --> 01:20:50.639 align:start position:0%
right so that's that's that one that's
 
01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
fund number uh 137 yeah now I noticed
 
01:20:57.709 --> 01:20:57.719 align:start position:0%
you have yellow on 167 but I didn't have
 
01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:00.199 align:start position:0%
any notes to make any
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
changes uh well the yellow see that's
 
01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
you don't I think what see
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
here yeah I removed all those in the
 
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
end U 167 two small dormant private
 
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
trust funds oh this is the hat and
 
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
Harriet yeah yeah the hat and the
 
01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
Harriet okay um and and they say they
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
can't send them over to
 
01:21:31.149 --> 01:21:31.159 align:start position:0%
unnh even though they're sending another
 
01:21:31.159 --> 01:21:33.030 align:start position:0%
unnh even though they're sending another
one

01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
over um so maybe this is in the same
 
01:21:38.629 --> 01:21:38.639 align:start position:0%
category as the Cherry treat but what
 
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
they're talking about is writing rules
 
01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
to set up a joint grant
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
program uh themselves which
 
01:21:51.709 --> 01:21:51.719 align:start position:0%
seems kind of ridiculously
 
01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
expensive or um just pulling the money
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
and sending it to the two State
 
01:22:03.870 --> 01:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
University and State College uh on from
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
the trusts every year for scholarships
 
01:22:11.229 --> 01:22:11.239 align:start position:0%
okay which would fit in pretty well with
 
01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
the intent of the donors okay I guess
 
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
not pooling it they'd have to do them
 
01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
separately because one of them is just
 
01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
ke and the other one is Kan and pus all
 
01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:23.320 align:start position:0%
right so I'll make a note to check
 
01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
whether they need need any RSA help in
 
01:22:31.229 --> 01:22:31.239 align:start position:0%
order to do that right so so
 
01:22:34.990 --> 01:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
interest to
 
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
scholarships okay
 
01:22:59.189 --> 01:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
all right next there was one above that
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
the private trust account for all kinds
 
01:23:07.229 --> 01:23:07.239 align:start position:0%
of assistance the legally blind yes
 
01:23:08.590 --> 01:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
which has
 
01:23:12.669 --> 01:23:12.679 align:start position:0%
been growing it's up to was up to
 
01:23:15.629 --> 01:23:15.639 align:start position:0%
$686,000 in
 
01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
2020 um had grown
 
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
50% since
 
01:23:24.189 --> 01:23:24.199 align:start position:0%
2020 and um the trouble is that there
 
01:23:27.310 --> 01:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
are all sorts of groups working in this
 
01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
area and so they and they don't probably
 
01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
give it much
 
01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:35.310 align:start position:0%
give it much
attention

01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
attention
 
01:23:37.709 --> 01:23:37.719 align:start position:0%
uh right but you have this note the
 
01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
department will look for ways to set up
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
grant program they said that they they
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
try to do that I don't know whether
 
01:23:45.149 --> 01:23:45.159 align:start position:0%
they're going to or not but that seemed
 
01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
good enough to me but okay anybody else
 
01:23:49.629 --> 01:23:49.639 align:start position:0%
just leave it like
 
01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
that you even got the Secretary of State
 
01:23:58.350 --> 01:23:58.360 align:start position:0%
V Mach stuff for for blind people so
 
01:23:59.750 --> 01:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
plenty of places
 
01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
expended got to be done future in sight
 
01:24:05.950 --> 01:24:05.960 align:start position:0%
is always trying to get money out of
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
me that's the main nonprofit that does
 
01:24:11.189 --> 01:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
things like send my father this
 
01:24:13.270 --> 01:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
incredible machine that allowed him to
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
read for a while
 
01:24:19.709 --> 01:24:19.719 align:start position:0%
longer and my and my father was also in
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
was in Handover
 
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
so all right
 
01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:26.709 align:start position:0%
so all right
but

01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
um okay so so then yeah go ahead yeah
 
01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:33.910 align:start position:0%
um okay so so then yeah go ahead yeah
then

01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
um there was this teacher competency
 
01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
thing which they are very occasionally
 
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
using to send someone to a
 
01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
conference where are we it's on between
 
01:24:54.109 --> 01:24:54.119 align:start position:0%
138 and and the two dormant funds it's
 
01:24:57.229 --> 01:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
just below it snuck
 
01:24:59.470 --> 01:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
together and they say they'll try to
 
01:25:01.669 --> 01:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
um more uses for
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
it which is all kind of vague and oh
 
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
fund 139 okay fine education is not very
 
01:25:16.830 --> 01:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
organized MH in fact if you look at at
 
01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:18.750 align:start position:0%
organized MH in fact if you look at at
their

01:25:18.750 --> 01:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:25:22.709 --> 01:25:22.719 align:start position:0%
statutes as has been done by the people
 
01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh at the head
 
01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:26.750 align:start position:0%
uh at the head
of

01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:25:30.430 --> 01:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
of on legislative
 
01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:32.550 align:start position:0%
of on legislative
services

01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:25:37.229 --> 01:25:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:41.310 --> 01:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:45.310 --> 01:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
organized I see the statutes contain
 
01:25:49.390 --> 01:25:49.400 align:start position:0%
things going back 150
 
01:25:52.629 --> 01:25:52.639 align:start position:0%
years that make no sense today so they
 
01:25:57.189 --> 01:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
need a recodification and new chapter
 
01:26:00.430 --> 01:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
yes well that's beyond my uh right it's
 
01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
beyond here but it's still anything that
 
01:26:07.510 --> 01:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
can be done that sends some of this
 
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
stuff to places where it can be used
 
01:26:10.990 --> 01:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
more easily
 
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.550 align:start position:0%
more easily
is

01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:26:19.629 --> 01:26:19.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
okay right so this
 
01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
one I what you're saying this one has
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
low expenses but a slowly growing
 
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
balance yeah right right and it's
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
another private trust fund that we
 
01:26:38.590 --> 01:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
can't change we can only
 
01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:43.030 align:start position:0%
can't change we can only
redirect

01:26:43.030 --> 01:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:05.629 --> 01:27:05.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:05.639 --> 01:27:11.870 align:start position:0%
 
what

01:27:11.870 --> 01:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:14.590 --> 01:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
wow but if it was just the RSA that
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:21.990 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:27:26.910 --> 01:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
was was that a other than our own law
 
01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
was that a
 
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
say oh
 
01:28:06.310 --> 01:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
my right so it sounds like somebody just
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
made a decision that yeah they wanted to
 
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
support teachers and here was a
 
01:28:17.470 --> 01:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
convenient source of money right so yeah
 
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
okay one thing I can think of
 
01:28:25.229 --> 01:28:25.239 align:start position:0%
is sending it
 
01:28:29.950 --> 01:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
to sending out a notice to to teacher
 
01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
training schools that this money is
 
01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
available to help the students certify
 
01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:48.070 align:start position:0%
 
MH

01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
MH
 
01:28:51.189 --> 01:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
okay but uh all right let's go on to the
 
01:28:54.550 --> 01:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
next page here so um then the next one
 
01:28:56.590 --> 01:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
was the school building authority we
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
talked about which uh we we previously
 
01:29:04.149 --> 01:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
said we should get rid of in laps this
 
01:29:06.430 --> 01:29:06.440 align:start position:0%
to the general fund because it's getting
 
01:29:08.109 --> 01:29:08.119 align:start position:0%
it's basically getting money and never
 
01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
has no expenses for five years right
 
01:29:15.550 --> 01:29:15.560 align:start position:0%
okay so that one
 
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
will um
 
01:29:24.149 --> 01:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah now the the one after that
 
01:29:28.109 --> 01:29:28.119 align:start position:0%
they are now use getting people to use
 
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
teachers that um spent their
 
01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
lives uh in
 
01:29:39.149 --> 01:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
AT&amp;T telephone program and are very good
 
01:29:42.430 --> 01:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
at Computing as in our
 
01:29:49.790 --> 01:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
major and um and retraining them on
 
01:29:54.350 --> 01:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
briefly through at to how to teach to
 
01:29:57.750 --> 01:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
young students and getting them into the
 
01:29:59.310 --> 01:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
school system
 
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
which seems like a useful thing to do at
 
01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:03.030 align:start position:0%
which seems like a useful thing to do at
this

01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
point so they're thinking that
 
01:30:09.030 --> 01:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
that that program that they only
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
developed recently is going to increase
 
01:30:15.470 --> 01:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
the number of teachers and therefore um
 
01:30:20.910 --> 01:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
they will be able to to use it on the
 
01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
number of teachers coming in
 
01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
I guess there will be enough people that
 
01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
yeah well the problem was the end of
 
01:30:33.790 --> 01:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
half because there weren't as many
 
01:30:41.430 --> 01:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
teachers but so I guess that that could
 
01:30:43.390 --> 01:30:43.400 align:start position:0%
stay and we might not see it in five
 
01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
years as a
 
01:30:47.550 --> 01:30:47.560 align:start position:0%
problem unlike some of the others of
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
these right but it has us sure but it
 
01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
has I mean it's considerable ongoing
 
01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
revenue and
 
01:30:59.550 --> 01:30:59.560 align:start position:0%
balance okay that one seemed okay all
 
01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:02.629 align:start position:0%
balance okay that one seemed okay all
right

01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
next um the blind vending machine thing
 
01:31:10.870 --> 01:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
it seemed like such a small this fun 296
 
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
right seemed like such a small
 
01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:15.790 align:start position:0%
right seemed like such a small
amount

01:31:15.790 --> 01:31:15.800 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:31:20.510 --> 01:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
um not to mess with you know I
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
don't yeah it can just go on as it is
 
01:31:31.229 --> 01:31:31.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
it two two 28 licensing of private
 
01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:48.990 --> 01:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
schools right they say their fees are
 
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
sent to 125% of cost mhm uh which is a
 
01:31:58.830 --> 01:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
ruling that doesn't didn't happen with a
 
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
lot of places but that education seems
 
01:32:04.350 --> 01:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
to be going with except that their
 
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
expenses exceed the revenues most of the
 
01:32:11.229 --> 01:32:11.239 align:start position:0%
time and so the end of year balance has
 
01:32:13.030 --> 01:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
gone down by about a
 
01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
third in the five years now how can
 
01:32:19.030 --> 01:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
their expenses exceed the revenues if
 
01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
you want to ask them I can ask unless
 
01:32:34.990 --> 01:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:36.910 --> 01:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
interest all right so we're talking
 
01:32:38.910 --> 01:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
about fund
 
01:32:43.470 --> 01:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
225 so maybe the fees were set to 125%
 
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
of cost in 20 10 and yeah there a lot
 
01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
going on and they don't bother to change
 
01:33:05.149 --> 01:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I think we'd run into that before
 
01:33:09.870 --> 01:33:09.880 align:start position:0%
they set them at 125% and then they
 
01:33:13.950 --> 01:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
don't change it inflation or
 
01:33:17.950 --> 01:33:17.960 align:start position:0%
anything right but so once again I mean
 
01:33:21.070 --> 01:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
this one seemed like it um had enough
 
01:33:25.149 --> 01:33:25.159 align:start position:0%
money in it to last another cycle yeah
 
01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
right and it does to last another cycle
 
01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:31.590 align:start position:0%
right and it does to last another cycle
probably

01:33:31.590 --> 01:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:33:34.910 --> 01:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
um could we just make a
 
01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
blanket uh statement that they ought to
 
01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
update all of their
 
01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
fees they should review their fees their
 
01:33:48.750 --> 01:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
Fe make a adjust exactly all right so
 
01:33:52.270 --> 01:33:52.280 align:start position:0%
fine in so in our report kind of yeah
 
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
01:34:00.669 --> 01:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:00.679 --> 01:34:02.510 align:start position:0%
 
report

01:34:02.510 --> 01:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:34:11.629 --> 01:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
fees to
 
01:34:14.719 --> 01:34:18.030 align:start position:0%
fees to
meet

01:34:18.030 --> 01:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:21.629 --> 01:34:21.639 align:start position:0%
expenses okay right all right good I
 
01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
would take care of a couple of them I
 
01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:28.149 align:start position:0%
would take care of a couple of them I
think

01:34:28.149 --> 01:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:33.189 --> 01:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
yeah and the the deceased veterans
 
01:34:35.709 --> 01:34:35.719 align:start position:0%
children yeah right but there aren't
 
01:34:40.669 --> 01:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
many there aren't very many and where
 
01:34:40.679 --> 01:34:47.669 align:start position:0%
many there aren't very many and where
that

01:34:47.669 --> 01:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.109 --> 01:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
go and they could provide a
 
01:34:54.990 --> 01:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
larger Grant
 
01:34:58.750 --> 01:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
or they or you could cut the money the
 
01:35:00.510 --> 01:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
general fund gives
 
01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:03.270 align:start position:0%
general fund gives
them

01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:35:06.189 --> 01:35:06.199 align:start position:0%
right right so that again that's not
 
01:35:09.950 --> 01:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
really our thing but yeah uh so maybe
 
01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
division two yeah general fund not
 
01:35:20.709 --> 01:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:28.229 --> 01:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:31.709 --> 01:35:31.719 align:start position:0%
all right we got the vending ma was the
 
01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
robotics team yeah that one seem to be
 
01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:35.229 align:start position:0%
robotics team yeah that one seem to be
going

01:35:35.229 --> 01:35:35.239 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:44.350 --> 01:35:44.360 align:start position:0%
not creating as many teams as it is
 
01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:45.590 align:start position:0%
not creating as many teams as it is
collecting

01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
collecting
 
01:35:48.070 --> 01:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
money and the IT collects the money
 
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
directly from you I
 
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
think right so this is GF right I think
 
01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:08.350 --> 01:36:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:11.229 --> 01:36:11.239 align:start position:0%
750,000 but it hasn't needed quite that
 
01:36:11.239 --> 01:36:16.109 align:start position:0%
750,000 but it hasn't needed quite that
much

01:36:16.109 --> 01:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:18.390 --> 01:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
that maybe because they're running out
 
01:36:24.270 --> 01:36:24.280 align:start position:0%
of schools that that do it that
 
01:36:27.109 --> 01:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
can do it I should imagine to be really
 
01:36:32.430 --> 01:36:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:37.629 --> 01:36:37.639 align:start position:0%
schools all right so again
 
01:36:39.510 --> 01:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
um we
 
01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:53.709 --> 01:36:53.719 align:start position:0%
this 324 324
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
324 okay so again division
 
01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:11.910 align:start position:0%
324 okay so again division
two

01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:14.470 align:start position:0%
 
reduce

01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
01:37:17.149 --> 01:37:17.159 align:start position:0%
okay we're expecting this to be a tough
 
01:37:20.109 --> 01:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
budget year so yeah places where we can
 
01:37:22.229 --> 01:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
reduce a little or
 
01:37:27.629 --> 01:37:27.639 align:start position:0%
welcome okay very tough budget year
 
01:37:29.790 --> 01:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
next now this next one's been losing
 
01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:35.430 align:start position:0%
next now this next one's been losing
money

01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:37:38.430 --> 01:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
considerably U but they may have
 
01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
finished what they're doing pretty
 
01:37:45.270 --> 01:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
much but they I think just got into
 
01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:46.589 align:start position:0%
much but they I think just got into
internet

01:37:46.589 --> 01:37:46.599 align:start position:0%
internet
 
01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
connectivity few years
 
01:37:53.229 --> 01:37:53.239 align:start position:0%
ago but they had all this arpa money for
 
01:37:53.239 --> 01:37:58.030 align:start position:0%
ago but they had all this arpa money for
it

01:37:58.030 --> 01:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
ni right so they did they spent a lot
 
01:38:05.550 --> 01:38:05.560 align:start position:0%
for ADA compliance I think also I spent
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
a lot for
 
01:38:10.109 --> 01:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
armor armoring
 
01:38:12.430 --> 01:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
oh at the beginning that's what the
 
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
whole thing was about at the beginning I
 
01:38:23.870 --> 01:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
right but in terms
 
01:38:29.350 --> 01:38:29.360 align:start position:0%
of it it looks like they tend to decide
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
let's do this kind of project like
 
01:38:34.669 --> 01:38:34.679 align:start position:0%
internet or whatever and then go find
 
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
money for it and use this fund as just
 
01:38:40.109 --> 01:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
sort of the the checking account
 
01:38:43.950 --> 01:38:43.960 align:start position:0%
right so I think it's okay maybe yeah
 
01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
yeah it could
 
01:38:51.189 --> 01:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
stay okay and then the next one
 
01:38:55.229 --> 01:38:55.239 align:start position:0%
um has been deleted but not from the 612
 
01:38:57.070 --> 01:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
list right so that's an obvious one that
 
01:39:00.189 --> 01:39:00.199 align:start position:0%
we we will put in our
 
01:39:00.199 --> 01:39:03.109 align:start position:0%
we we will put in our
bill

01:39:03.109 --> 01:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:39:03.119 --> 01:39:06.750 align:start position:0%
bill
okay

01:39:06.750 --> 01:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:09.470 --> 01:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
um and the last one you already
 
01:39:11.229 --> 01:39:11.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned right we already mentioned
 
01:39:13.709 --> 01:39:13.719 align:start position:0%
we're going to delete that
 
01:39:13.719 --> 01:39:16.189 align:start position:0%
we're going to delete that
one

01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:39:18.669 --> 01:39:18.679 align:start position:0%
um and I'm going to look it to this one
 
01:39:20.669 --> 01:39:20.679 align:start position:0%
that's at The X right even though it was
 
01:39:20.679 --> 01:39:25.109 align:start position:0%
that's at The X right even though it was
2023

01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
um I'll I'll talk to
 
01:39:33.669 --> 01:39:33.679 align:start position:0%
science This One X oh The X oh yes fund
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
X that oh I yeah I'm going to go read uh
 
01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:41.589 align:start position:0%
X that oh I yeah I'm going to go read uh
12

01:39:41.589 --> 01:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
12
 
01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
51a yeah and see and I'll talk to the
 
01:39:47.709 --> 01:39:47.719 align:start position:0%
Science and Tech yeah committee and see
 
01:39:47.719 --> 01:39:48.830 align:start position:0%
Science and Tech yeah committee and see
if

01:39:48.830 --> 01:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
um anything active is going on here it
 
01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:54.719 align:start position:0%
had to do with wind offshore wind well
 
01:40:05.310 --> 01:40:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:08.589 --> 01:40:08.599 align:start position:0%
wind yeah it's supposed to be have a
 
01:40:12.750 --> 01:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
committee the committee has not yet been
 
01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
formed and the committee on the Marine
 
01:40:20.470 --> 01:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
training part of it isn't even
 
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
in the write up of Bill
 
01:40:26.030 --> 01:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
it's just something they thought that
 
01:40:28.109 --> 01:40:28.119 align:start position:0%
maybe they'd be able to
 
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
do well well I have a note to go read
 
01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:41.470 --> 01:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
on okay so that takes you the 16
 
01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:43.430 align:start position:0%
on okay so that takes you the 16
right

01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
okay so information TCH no change right
 
01:40:56.589 --> 01:40:56.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
right the only question was whether to
 
01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
move this technically to the
 
01:41:04.510 --> 01:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
treasurer Maybe not maybe it's not worth
 
01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:06.310 align:start position:0%
treasurer Maybe not maybe it's not worth
doing

01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
um it is oh the the rims account well it
 
01:41:19.310 --> 01:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
already it the rims account is a very uh
 
01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:20.990 align:start position:0%
already it the rims account is a very uh
complex

01:41:20.990 --> 01:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
complex
 
01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
computer program
 
01:41:27.709 --> 01:41:27.719 align:start position:0%
on if you took it away and put it in the
 
01:41:32.189 --> 01:41:32.199 align:start position:0%
treasury that Dr couldn't
 
01:41:35.189 --> 01:41:35.199 align:start position:0%
function well no no this one is just to
 
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
pay off the bond yeah yeah and the the
 
01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:40.589 align:start position:0%
pay off the bond yeah yeah and the the
treasury

01:41:40.589 --> 01:41:40.599 align:start position:0%
treasury
 
01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
already the the account is in the
 
01:41:48.229 --> 01:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
treasury right the Dr just figures out
 
01:41:51.149 --> 01:41:51.159 align:start position:0%
how much it is and ships the money over
 
01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
to the account
 
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
so maybe leave it alone but the
 
01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
treasurer isn't going to be able to
 
01:42:01.709 --> 01:42:01.719 align:start position:0%
figure out whether this was the right
 
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
amount or not they do come to the ways
 
01:42:07.830 --> 01:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
and means committees and they say look
 
01:42:09.550 --> 01:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
this is how much we've gotten and this
 
01:42:12.790 --> 01:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
is how we calculated how much we right
 
01:42:15.990 --> 01:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
what we're saving we can send over okay
 
01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
all right we'll leave it alone all right
 
01:42:20.790 --> 01:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
next one uh
 
01:42:24.430 --> 01:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
oplc um
 
01:42:27.910 --> 01:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
is we need to repeal this uh
 
01:42:32.830 --> 01:42:32.840 align:start position:0%
61232 right okay that one's all
 
01:42:37.070 --> 01:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
set um but they've well we need to
 
01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
repeal a
 
01:42:43.589 --> 01:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
612 number yeah but they've left pieces
 
01:42:46.270 --> 01:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
in it about real estate apprais that
 
01:42:49.229 --> 01:42:49.239 align:start position:0%
have to be somewhere in the state law
 
01:42:51.709 --> 01:42:51.719 align:start position:0%
and so we don't want to repeal anything
 
01:42:53.790 --> 01:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
that's actually in the
 
01:42:57.910 --> 01:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
right the the um RSA
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
310b that's still there right keep they
 
01:43:06.990 --> 01:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
okay so it's just the 612 number that
 
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
has to
 
01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:15.109 align:start position:0%
has to
disappear

01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:15.119 --> 01:43:18.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:43:18.030 --> 01:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:19.629 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:43:19.629 --> 01:43:19.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:23.790 --> 01:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
so we don't want to touch 340 or
 
01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:26.270 align:start position:0%
so we don't want to touch 340 or
3

01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
3
 
01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:28.550 align:start position:0%
3
63

01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
63
 
01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:31.910 align:start position:0%
63
yeah

01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:35.149 --> 01:43:35.159 align:start position:0%
um right all right so this off book
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
thing we might hear from the treasure on
 
01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:41.790 align:start position:0%
thing we might hear from the treasure on
71

01:43:41.790 --> 01:43:41.800 align:start position:0%
71
 
01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so the next one I got a note on is
 
01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:47.830 align:start position:0%
yeah so the next one I got a note on is
um

01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:49.350 align:start position:0%
 
319

01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
319
 
01:43:54.270 --> 01:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
so uh oh way down there yeah so this one
 
01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
is the site evaluation committee has
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
this one employee who's like the matech
 
01:44:02.030 --> 01:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
repairman he has nothing to do right no
 
01:44:03.990 --> 01:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
I think that he works in
 
01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
others he this is a part-time part of
 
01:44:10.550 --> 01:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
his job exactly so he worked for the Pu
 
01:44:13.149 --> 01:44:13.159 align:start position:0%
basically right right and there's this
 
01:44:15.950 --> 01:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund that in case somebody
 
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
says I want to build a power plant yeah
 
01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
then he would swing into action kind of
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
and they would have to hire a bunch of
 
01:44:24.070 --> 01:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
other people they would have to hire a
 
01:44:26.189 --> 01:44:26.199 align:start position:0%
lot of consultants and do a bunch of
 
01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
stuff so but I'm wondering whether this
 
01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
guy can just be permanently part of the
 
01:44:34.990 --> 01:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
Pu and his his accounting be part of the
 
01:44:38.709 --> 01:44:38.719 align:start position:0%
Pu and not have this dedicated fund so
 
01:44:40.830 --> 01:44:40.840 align:start position:0%
that's I have a note to look into that
 
01:44:43.470 --> 01:44:43.480 align:start position:0%
well he did say
 
01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
that he
 
01:44:51.589 --> 01:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
he they got rid of the previous person
 
01:44:55.070 --> 01:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
by uh taking her into another job in
 
01:44:58.990 --> 01:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
another place on and for a year there
 
01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
was nobody there and he said that's why
 
01:45:06.149 --> 01:45:06.159 align:start position:0%
he said that he kept busy last year with
 
01:45:09.430 --> 01:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
two years of accumulated dockets and
 
01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
complaints and um so there that function
 
01:45:16.430 --> 01:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
will still be there very at various
 
01:45:18.990 --> 01:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
times okay I don't know how much of his
 
01:45:23.310 --> 01:45:23.320 align:start position:0%
salary they put they put there but
 
01:45:27.229 --> 01:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
it's the Pu stuff for me is kind of hard
 
01:45:27.239 --> 01:45:28.830 align:start position:0%
it's the Pu stuff for me is kind of hard
to

01:45:28.830 --> 01:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:45:32.270 --> 01:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
yeah to follow well I I will look into
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
that okay and
 
01:45:38.350 --> 01:45:38.360 align:start position:0%
then this other
 
01:45:44.229 --> 01:45:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
253 which okay is the whole all of the
 
01:45:50.390 --> 01:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
Reggie money coming
 
01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
in and it the audited expenses that
 
01:45:58.310 --> 01:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:00.189 align:start position:0%
 
$4,275

01:46:00.189 --> 01:46:00.199 align:start position:0%
$4,275
 
01:46:04.589 --> 01:46:04.599 align:start position:0%
th000 uh for the five for the five years
 
01:46:07.709 --> 01:46:07.719 align:start position:0%
but then in the same page below they
 
01:46:11.709 --> 01:46:11.719 align:start position:0%
list the expenses which total
 
01:46:11.719 --> 01:46:13.750 align:start position:0%
list the expenses which total
20,

01:46:13.750 --> 01:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
20,
 
01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:18.709 align:start position:0%
20,
241,000

01:46:18.709 --> 01:46:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:22.350 --> 01:46:22.360 align:start position:0%
and and then they tell us the only place
 
01:46:24.390 --> 01:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
where they tell us because the breakdown
 
01:46:26.470 --> 01:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
is for that 20
 
01:46:30.229 --> 01:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
million 18% was compensating the
 
01:46:31.390 --> 01:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
department of
 
01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:33.750 align:start position:0%
department of
energy

01:46:33.750 --> 01:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh oh now 18% was compensating
 
01:46:39.709 --> 01:46:39.719 align:start position:0%
Department of energy and the Department
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services for their
 
01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
expenses 45% was for wood pellet boets
 
01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
and residential commercial and
 
01:46:51.950 --> 01:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
Industrial so solar en installation
 
01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
projects and 37% for competitive grants
 
01:46:58.350 --> 01:46:58.360 align:start position:0%
for commercial industrial renewable
 
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
energy and and low moderate income
 
01:47:08.109 --> 01:47:08.119 align:start position:0%
program group together and then
 
01:47:08.119 --> 01:47:09.990 align:start position:0%
program group together and then
2,33

01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
2,33
 
01:47:13.950 --> 01:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:15.709 align:start position:0%
 
for

01:47:15.709 --> 01:47:15.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:47:18.790 --> 01:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
and this gives you
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
no real information on the things that
 
01:47:27.430 --> 01:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
they say that they're supposed to be be
 
01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:28.430 align:start position:0%
they say that they're supposed to be be
um

01:47:28.430 --> 01:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:31.870 --> 01:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
doing how much money went into each
 
01:47:36.709 --> 01:47:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
program I see which include the office
 
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
of offshore wind and energy Innovation
 
01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
yet but which also includes solar
 
01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
projects um a capped uh renewable and
 
01:47:58.910 --> 01:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
thermal energy projects low moderate
 
01:48:02.270 --> 01:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
residential separated off um
 
01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:03.870 align:start position:0%
residential separated off um
non-residential

01:48:03.870 --> 01:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
non-residential
 
01:48:08.470 --> 01:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:11.470 align:start position:0%
 
projects

01:48:11.470 --> 01:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:48:14.189 --> 01:48:14.199 align:start position:0%
and it really seems pretty much like the
 
01:48:20.830 --> 01:48:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:23.709 --> 01:48:23.719 align:start position:0%
me so do you want to get them back to
 
01:48:26.589 --> 01:48:26.599 align:start position:0%
ask them more questions or that would be
 
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
nice to see if we could get any more
 
01:48:32.629 --> 01:48:32.639 align:start position:0%
information out of them about how much
 
01:48:37.149 --> 01:48:37.159 align:start position:0%
of of this is going to each of the the
 
01:48:37.159 --> 01:48:38.950 align:start position:0%
of of this is going to each of the the
targets

01:48:38.950 --> 01:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
targets
 
01:48:44.470 --> 01:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
which which are in the states regie
 
01:48:47.430 --> 01:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
application that I think is is the ones
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
I was just listing off okay and to
 
01:48:53.229 --> 01:48:53.239 align:start position:0%
different parts of it because the parts
 
01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
are supposed to be responsibly balanced
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
okay all right well why don't you come
 
01:49:02.550 --> 01:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
up with a list of questions we'll send
 
01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
it to them and ask them to come in two
 
01:49:10.430 --> 01:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:13.950 --> 01:49:13.960 align:start position:0%
okay and the the other parts
 
01:49:16.870 --> 01:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
just pretty much I think live off of
 
01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:17.870 align:start position:0%
just pretty much I think live off of
that

01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:49:21.149 --> 01:49:21.159 align:start position:0%
money right so so are we talking about
 
01:49:25.589 --> 01:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
272 um I'm talking about 253 because
 
01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
that's where they got into more
 
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
specifics okay but the specifics don't
 
01:49:38.189 --> 01:49:38.199 align:start position:0%
add up all right follow me list of
 
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:46.189 --> 01:49:46.199 align:start position:0%
question all right so Jennifer you'll
 
01:49:48.430 --> 01:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
invite them back once you get the
 
01:49:54.109 --> 01:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
questions sent yeah okay all right
 
01:49:59.189 --> 01:49:59.199 align:start position:0%
so anything else pu um
 
01:50:01.390 --> 01:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
energy Energy
 
01:50:04.430 --> 01:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
Efficiency yeah I
 
01:50:07.790 --> 01:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
didn't okay see any particular problem
 
01:50:10.430 --> 01:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
or that that all fuels thing was kind of
 
01:50:13.550 --> 01:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
weird but it gets sent to New Hampshire
 
01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:16.950 align:start position:0%
weird but it gets sent to New Hampshire
saves

01:50:16.950 --> 01:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
MH all right good
 
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:26.950 --> 01:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
yeah all right so we've we've talked
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
with them about separating the Canon
 
01:50:36.030 --> 01:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
skap from the parks I I think it makes
 
01:50:40.030 --> 01:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
sense all right so we'll add that to
 
01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:49.390 --> 01:50:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:53.199 align:start position:0%
fund okay and they're working on the
 
01:50:56.229 --> 01:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
issues that I had with the
 
01:50:59.589 --> 01:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Lakes
 
01:51:02.109 --> 01:51:02.119 align:start position:0%
Headwaters right endowment right so
 
01:51:04.510 --> 01:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
they'll work on they'll they'll make
 
01:51:06.270 --> 01:51:06.280 align:start position:0%
they'll give us an opinion on whether we
 
01:51:08.229 --> 01:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
can combine those three funds into a
 
01:51:08.239 --> 01:51:09.270 align:start position:0%
can combine those three funds into a
single

01:51:09.270 --> 01:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
single
 
01:51:12.990 --> 01:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
one right so therefore they have more
 
01:51:17.149 --> 01:51:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah now you're working off this and
 
01:51:24.030 --> 01:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
I'm working off of the separate
 
01:51:27.310 --> 01:51:27.320 align:start position:0%
between programs which made it I thought
 
01:51:30.830 --> 01:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
would make it easier but all right go
 
01:51:33.709 --> 01:51:33.719 align:start position:0%
ahead so
 
01:51:36.709 --> 01:51:36.719 align:start position:0%
um that one
 
01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
is where Parkson and Rec has 10 funds is
 
01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the fifth page
 
01:51:49.790 --> 01:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
right um and we already discussed that
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
pretty well
 
01:51:56.189 --> 01:51:56.199 align:start position:0%
M oh and I did I we should have asked
 
01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
the treasurer this question we've got
 
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
the Hampton meters as a
 
01:52:06.510 --> 01:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
612 and we have the Hampton meters
 
01:52:12.390 --> 01:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
inside of an accounting unit in
 
01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
61233 b as I'm calling it I see so are
 
01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
we double counting
 
01:52:21.229 --> 01:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
them I
 
01:52:23.189 --> 01:52:23.199 align:start position:0%
see so
 
01:52:28.510 --> 01:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
so where is the Hampton Hampton meters
 
01:52:31.310 --> 01:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
managing apartment oh so this fun
 
01:52:36.550 --> 01:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
105 right fund 105 accounting unit 7300
 
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
yeah right so what it your note
 
01:52:43.310 --> 01:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
says the first 200,000 goes into this
 
01:52:48.550 --> 01:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:52.510 --> 01:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
33 so that's why it's in fund 33 fund 33
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
is the main one yeah right 133 is the
 
01:52:57.669 --> 01:52:57.679 align:start position:0%
main one so so by
 
01:53:02.910 --> 01:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
law 200,000 is specific lead to to uh
 
01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:04.629 align:start position:0%
law 200,000 is specific lead to to uh
fund

01:53:04.629 --> 01:53:04.639 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:53:10.390 --> 01:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:14.950 --> 01:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
with with only 200,000 a year being
 
01:53:20.629 --> 01:53:20.639 align:start position:0%
showing up in in fund 105 yes but back
 
01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:22.639 align:start position:0%
on 33
 
01:53:26.350 --> 01:53:26.360 align:start position:0%
says should be separated
 
01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
so yeah we want to separate if you're
 
01:53:33.750 --> 01:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
fund from have the funds go back to 33
 
01:53:36.430 --> 01:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
then you need to say what part of 33
 
01:53:38.950 --> 01:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
right it's the state parks it's it's not
 
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
the SK area yeah right that's why I
 
01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
talked about the park fund right that's
 
01:53:49.830 --> 01:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
just to show you I was awake then yeah
 
01:53:52.629 --> 01:53:52.639 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah
 
01:53:56.229 --> 01:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
okay so um so I think that one's okay
 
01:53:59.430 --> 01:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah I think they've done a
 
01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
great job of cleaning
 
01:54:05.470 --> 01:54:05.480 align:start position:0%
up five years ago this was impossible
 
01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
right and I have a note on fund 107 the
 
01:54:10.069 --> 01:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
the mining
 
01:54:10.079 --> 01:54:11.790 align:start position:0%
the mining
permits

01:54:11.790 --> 01:54:11.800 align:start position:0%
permits
 
01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:13.709 align:start position:0%
permits
to

01:54:13.709 --> 01:54:13.719 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
um read the RSA and see if it if it
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
needs some
 
01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
updating um uh you you said should this
 
01:54:24.669 --> 01:54:24.679 align:start position:0%
fun continued to exist I have should it
 
01:54:28.510 --> 01:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:32.069 --> 01:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
geologist so I'm what else the state
 
01:54:34.870 --> 01:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
geologist does um whether he's
 
01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:37.229 align:start position:0%
geologist does um whether he's
overworked

01:54:37.229 --> 01:54:37.239 align:start position:0%
overworked
 
01:54:40.350 --> 01:54:40.360 align:start position:0%
already yeah and would not appreciate
 
01:54:42.510 --> 01:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
somebody coming in and asking him if he
 
01:54:44.910 --> 01:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
can get a mining permit for two acres of
 
01:54:47.669 --> 01:54:47.679 align:start position:0%
land in North Conway
 
01:54:51.790 --> 01:54:51.800 align:start position:0%
yeah right so I I I want to go I'll I'll
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
have an action item to to look into that
 
01:54:56.350 --> 01:54:56.360 align:start position:0%
a little more all
 
01:54:56.360 --> 01:54:58.950 align:start position:0%
a little more all
right

01:54:58.950 --> 01:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:55:02.109 --> 01:55:02.119 align:start position:0%
um all right and then on fund 179 the
 
01:55:05.870 --> 01:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
state librarian we had is it
 
01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
defunct does the RSA need some
 
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
updating are we not there yet the state
 
01:55:15.069 --> 01:55:15.079 align:start position:0%
librari oh I see we're going in a
 
01:55:20.950 --> 01:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:23.310 --> 01:55:23.320 align:start position:0%
um okay well well in any case so we
 
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
solve the so so the the parking meters
 
01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
are okay right yeah okay State library
 
01:55:32.069 --> 01:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
right yeah isn't that the next one it it
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
gets 1.5 million a year from the general
 
01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:54.990 --> 01:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:12.510 align:start position:0%
 
101

01:56:12.510 --> 01:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:15.629 --> 01:56:15.639 align:start position:0%
yeah it seemed pretty
 
01:56:15.639 --> 01:56:19.189 align:start position:0%
yeah it seemed pretty
clear

01:56:19.189 --> 01:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
right so that's that's not related to
 
01:56:40.430 --> 01:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
this well I mean the general this
 
01:56:42.430 --> 01:56:42.440 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund doesn't get 1 and a half
 
01:56:45.629 --> 01:56:45.639 align:start position:0%
million yeah right separate from this
 
01:56:48.030 --> 01:56:48.040 align:start position:0%
account yeah that's just part of their
 
01:56:50.629 --> 01:56:50.639 align:start position:0%
budget yeah right yeah that's what keeps
 
01:56:56.229 --> 01:56:56.239 align:start position:0%
their budget alive that so the next one
 
01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:00.719 align:start position:0%
102 lost damaged or lost book account
 
01:57:00.719 --> 01:57:02.589 align:start position:0%
102 lost damaged or lost book account
receives

01:57:02.589 --> 01:57:02.599 align:start position:0%
receives
 
01:57:05.790 --> 01:57:05.800 align:start position:0%
fines I wasn't quite sure from the write
 
01:57:08.189 --> 01:57:08.199 align:start position:0%
up and what they were telling us the
 
01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
state librarian was telling us whether
 
01:57:13.069 --> 01:57:13.079 align:start position:0%
they are getting fines or donations that
 
01:57:18.270 --> 01:57:18.280 align:start position:0%
is is it voluntary to pay them for the
 
01:57:21.069 --> 01:57:21.079 align:start position:0%
damage no I think it is fin right
 
01:57:24.069 --> 01:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
somebody loses the book or whatever lost
 
01:57:26.109 --> 01:57:26.119 align:start position:0%
in damaged books and brings them back
 
01:57:26.119 --> 01:57:28.270 align:start position:0%
in damaged books and brings them back
late

01:57:28.270 --> 01:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
late
 
01:57:31.910 --> 01:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah they didn't even mention late
 
01:57:34.750 --> 01:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
finds no this most of the libraries are
 
01:57:36.270 --> 01:57:36.280 align:start position:0%
doing away with
 
01:57:41.430 --> 01:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
them with with the late finds
 
01:57:48.189 --> 01:57:48.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:52.870 --> 01:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:55.550 --> 01:57:55.560 align:start position:0%
I mean they still have a good balance
 
01:57:59.629 --> 01:57:59.639 align:start position:0%
but it is declining yeah because so so
 
01:58:03.069 --> 01:58:03.079 align:start position:0%
they may have to charge more yeah but he
 
01:58:09.310 --> 01:58:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:11.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:14.719 align:start position:0%
but yeah so that's but I don't think
 
01:58:17.709 --> 01:58:17.719 align:start position:0%
it's in in law what he charges for for
 
01:58:19.270 --> 01:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
books right
 
01:58:22.229 --> 01:58:22.239 align:start position:0%
so well it couldn't be in laws for well
 
01:58:25.950 --> 01:58:25.960 align:start position:0%
it could be in law for the the cost of a
 
01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
total repair and that would be Beyond a
 
01:58:31.229 --> 01:58:31.239 align:start position:0%
number of
 
01:58:33.310 --> 01:58:33.320 align:start position:0%
blenders well if you want me to I will
 
01:58:35.870 --> 01:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
go read the
 
01:58:42.840 --> 01:58:42.850 align:start position:0%
law um which would be read okay
 
01:58:42.850 --> 01:58:44.750 align:start position:0%
law um which would be read okay
[Music]

01:58:44.750 --> 01:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:59:15.950 --> 01:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:19.229 --> 01:59:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:24.510 --> 01:59:24.520 align:start position:0%
we what was next well you put something
 
01:59:30.310 --> 01:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
on on 179 the yes I have a note to do
 
01:59:35.510 --> 01:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
something check 20 1 A10 and delete
 
01:59:38.830 --> 01:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
delete something I'm not sure what uh
 
01:59:46.109 --> 01:59:46.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:46.119 --> 01:59:49.550 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:59:49.550 --> 01:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:53.470 --> 01:59:53.480 align:start position:0%
okay that's it CU they aren't doing
 
01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
oh but we we skipped did we skip
 
02:00:01.550 --> 02:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:05.629 --> 02:00:05.639 align:start position:0%
Summit the trails Bureau and donations
 
02:00:09.109 --> 02:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
to state parks we skipped over right but
 
02:00:10.510 --> 02:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
I didn't have any notes that we wanted
 
02:00:13.270 --> 02:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
to do anything
 
02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I don't
 
02:00:20.109 --> 02:00:20.119 align:start position:0%
either I think those are okay the only
 
02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
thing is somewhere but I think I think
 
02:00:26.589 --> 02:00:26.599 align:start position:0%
it may already have been done to take I
 
02:00:28.910 --> 02:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
think it was just in their reports
 
02:00:31.669 --> 02:00:31.679 align:start position:0%
talking about the Dartmouth
 
02:00:35.629 --> 02:00:35.639 align:start position:0%
College um bonding that they were paying
 
02:00:38.550 --> 02:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
off which they paid off in
 
02:00:42.310 --> 02:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
20 right that was a long time yeah it's
 
02:00:44.750 --> 02:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
irrelevant at this
 
02:00:50.189 --> 02:00:50.199 align:start position:0%
point all right so then we come
 
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:57.550 --> 02:00:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
preservation uh the coastal
 
02:01:03.910 --> 02:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
resilience I have
 
02:01:07.790 --> 02:01:07.800 align:start position:0%
talked with the sponsor who is David
 
02:01:10.950 --> 02:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
Waters um about this which one are you
 
02:01:15.709 --> 02:01:15.719 align:start position:0%
on I'm I'm close to 358 358 yeah it's
 
02:01:19.430 --> 02:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
been sitting there it was put into law
 
02:01:22.709 --> 02:01:22.719 align:start position:0%
just before Co hit mhm
 
02:01:27.629 --> 02:01:27.639 align:start position:0%
and um that made it complicated getting
 
02:01:29.470 --> 02:01:29.480 align:start position:0%
started but the thing that made it more
 
02:01:32.109 --> 02:01:32.119 align:start position:0%
complicated getting starting started was
 
02:01:36.030 --> 02:01:36.040 align:start position:0%
a former Senator uh in his district who
 
02:01:39.950 --> 02:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
insisted that they invite everybody and
 
02:01:43.069 --> 02:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
their brother to the
 
02:01:45.629 --> 02:01:45.639 align:start position:0%
commission uh which made it impossible
 
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
to get a
 
02:01:49.750 --> 02:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
quorum oh it's one of those things that
 
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
had a 25 member Mission and yeah or more
 
02:01:56.589 --> 02:01:56.599 align:start position:0%
and six people show up or something more
 
02:02:02.669 --> 02:02:02.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:02.679 --> 02:02:04.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:02:04.229 --> 02:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:08.470 --> 02:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
he he is now on saying that he would
 
02:02:11.589 --> 02:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
like to bring put some stuff together
 
02:02:13.069 --> 02:02:13.079 align:start position:0%
maybe I don't know if he could do it in
 
02:02:15.510 --> 02:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
the next two weeks who are we talking
 
02:02:17.390 --> 02:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
about um this is David
 
02:02:22.750 --> 02:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
Waters um because a number of the town
 
02:02:26.310 --> 02:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
have on their own because of this being
 
02:02:29.149 --> 02:02:29.159 align:start position:0%
an important issue for them I see have
 
02:02:31.830 --> 02:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
come up with different
 
02:02:35.229 --> 02:02:35.239 align:start position:0%
projects and he thinks that some kind of
 
02:02:39.470 --> 02:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
coordinating of that would be
 
02:02:43.109 --> 02:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
useful so he may bring it in next year
 
02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
as a separate bill or he might have
 
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
something together in time to come and
 
02:02:52.350 --> 02:02:52.360 align:start position:0%
talk to us about it okay
 
02:02:55.030 --> 02:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
going within within this framework sure
 
02:03:02.470 --> 02:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:06.950 --> 02:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay but um they are getting serious
 
02:03:09.990 --> 02:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
erosion on the coast
 
02:03:12.990 --> 02:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
MH and a lot of
 
02:03:16.950 --> 02:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
historic buildings and things sit on the
 
02:03:19.109 --> 02:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
coastal Shores
 
02:03:25.750 --> 02:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:28.550 --> 02:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
them all right but our default is
 
02:03:30.390 --> 02:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
probably to get rid of this fund
 
02:03:32.629 --> 02:03:32.639 align:start position:0%
regardless right okay the default would
 
02:03:37.149 --> 02:03:37.159 align:start position:0%
be just just get rid of the fund and the
 
02:03:39.149 --> 02:03:39.159 align:start position:0%
towns came in and maybe get some FEMA
 
02:03:43.390 --> 02:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
grants yeah well part of it has been
 
02:03:44.910 --> 02:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
they've gotten a little bit of FEMA
 
02:03:46.950 --> 02:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
grants I think they got a little of our
 
02:03:49.910 --> 02:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
money and things like that but
 
02:03:53.669 --> 02:03:53.679 align:start position:0%
um I think yeah I think that that fund
 
02:03:57.069 --> 02:03:57.079 align:start position:0%
is not going to work
 
02:04:01.950 --> 02:04:01.960 align:start position:0%
so but he I think he'd like
 
02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
to figure out pieces of the statute that
 
02:04:09.629 --> 02:04:09.639 align:start position:0%
could be kept in order to
 
02:04:14.229 --> 02:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
uh help the towns organize themselves on
 
02:04:18.270 --> 02:04:18.280 align:start position:0%
this more than they're doing right
 
02:04:21.510 --> 02:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
now and he admits he dropped the ball
 
02:04:25.830 --> 02:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
and after Co started to fade
 
02:04:29.069 --> 02:04:29.079 align:start position:0%
got all right so I told them I'd bring
 
02:04:29.079 --> 02:04:30.350 align:start position:0%
got all right so I told them I'd bring
it

02:04:30.350 --> 02:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:04:35.790 --> 02:04:35.800 align:start position:0%
up all right and so um then on fund 240
 
02:04:38.149 --> 02:04:38.159 align:start position:0%
we've already they already talked about
 
02:04:40.510 --> 02:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
raising their fees
 
02:04:44.510 --> 02:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
right I think um yeah we've we've talked
 
02:04:49.229 --> 02:04:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:52.149 --> 02:04:52.159 align:start position:0%
and commissioner right because this this
 
02:04:53.950 --> 02:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
is the one where we said their fees are
 
02:04:56.510 --> 02:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
in their rules and they were they're
 
02:05:00.109 --> 02:05:00.119 align:start position:0%
right working on changing it so do I
 
02:05:02.470 --> 02:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
think this one is
 
02:05:09.069 --> 02:05:09.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
okay as long as they don't raise them
 
02:05:14.870 --> 02:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
too much developers are building AR all
 
02:05:17.910 --> 02:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
right so I think we're done yeah all
 
02:05:20.629 --> 02:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
right I think so too
 
02:05:22.830 --> 02:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
imagine all right let's talk about the
 
02:05:22.840 --> 02:05:23.669 align:start position:0%
imagine all right let's talk about the
next

02:05:23.669 --> 02:05:23.679 align:start position:0%
next
 
02:05:28.390 --> 02:05:28.400 align:start position:0%

02:05:33.030 --> 02:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:37.229 --> 02:05:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:41.350 --> 02:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:44.910 --> 02:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
