00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:08.210 align:start position:0%
fiscal policy institute he previously
 
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:11.450 align:start position:0%
worked with Legislative Services and the
 
00:10:17.079 --> 00:10:17.089 align:start position:0%
audit department as I recall and he has
 
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
been been studying the New Hampshire
 
00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:22.700 align:start position:0%
economy I presume for a long time but
 
00:10:24.579 --> 00:10:24.589 align:start position:0%
particularly since he joined the
 
00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:26.529 align:start position:0%
Institute four years ago
 
00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:28.940 align:start position:0%
yes close to four years ago now three
 
00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
and a half we're looking forward to
 
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:36.950 align:start position:0%
hearing what you have to tell us about
 
00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
where you think things are going in our
 
00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
economy now in in the near future it's a
 
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
little hard to see past that but thank
 
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:51.110 align:start position:0%
you very much absolutely thank you very
 
00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:52.550 align:start position:0%
much to the committee for the
 
00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:53.930 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak thank you represent
 
00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:56.630 align:start position:0%
eval me for the introduction again my
 
00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:58.250 align:start position:0%
name is Jill Slaton I'm a policy a
 
00:10:59.650 --> 00:10:59.660 align:start position:0%
senior policy analyst at the New
 
00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:01.550 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fiscal policy institute which
 
00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:03.470 align:start position:0%
is an independent nonpartisan nonprofit
 
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:06.290 align:start position:0%
policy research organization based in
 
00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:08.420 align:start position:0%
Concord we focus on a state budget and
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
revenue policy of some health policy as
 
00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:12.770 align:start position:0%
well as the state economy which is what
 
00:11:14.019 --> 00:11:14.029 align:start position:0%
I've been asked to come talk to you
 
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
about today so I will share my screen in
 
00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:21.529 align:start position:0%
terms of questions let's see if I can my
 
00:11:24.579 --> 00:11:24.589 align:start position:0%
screen sharing is still disabled in
 
00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:27.770 align:start position:0%
terms of questions I'm happy to take
 
00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:29.720 align:start position:0%
questions throughout especially if there
 
00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:31.070 align:start position:0%
are a technical question about a slide
 
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:32.860 align:start position:0%
I'll be showing a fair number of graphs
 
00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:37.070 align:start position:0%
but but I I will leave it to the
 
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:39.290 align:start position:0%
discretion of the chair as to exactly
 
00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:42.230 align:start position:0%
the best way to to move forward on
 
00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:44.420 align:start position:0%
questions I'll try to I'll try to watch
 
00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:46.370 align:start position:0%
to see if there are people signaling I
 
00:11:48.519 --> 00:11:48.529 align:start position:0%
won't be able to share my screen and
 
00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:50.630 align:start position:0%
have the hand raised feature showing at
 
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:53.750 align:start position:0%
the same time I don't believe so I'll do
 
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
my best okay I'm going to be able to see
 
00:11:59.860 --> 00:11:59.870 align:start position:0%
the hands when you whenever you take a
 
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:01.610 align:start position:0%
short break if there's a hand I can
 
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:05.720 align:start position:0%
transmit it to you but Chris we need to
 
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:09.860 align:start position:0%
share the screen looks like I can now
 
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much all right now you
 
00:12:24.569 --> 00:12:24.579 align:start position:0%
should hopefully here we go
 
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
you should hopefully be able to see the
 
00:12:28.569 --> 00:12:28.579 align:start position:0%
slide deck next okay
 
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
great excellent so I'll I'll move I'll
 
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:34.010 align:start position:0%
move through these but I'll pause again
 
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:35.660 align:start position:0%
periodically to see if there are any
 
00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:39.019 align:start position:0%
questions so one thing that I do want to
 
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:40.850 align:start position:0%
note is this is an early overview
 
00:12:42.579 --> 00:12:42.589 align:start position:0%
because we only have so much information
 
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
at this point everything's moving very
 
00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:46.750 align:start position:0%
at this point everything's moving very
fast

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
fast
 
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:48.380 align:start position:0%
you know remarkably fast relative to
 
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:51.130 align:start position:0%
what we've seen in Prior economic
 
00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:53.630 align:start position:0%
contractions in certainly in the
 
00:12:55.569 --> 00:12:55.579 align:start position:0%
post-world War two ERA there are four
 
00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
key takeaways I want you to have from
 
00:12:59.650 --> 00:12:59.660 align:start position:0%
this and this is we'll discuss these in
 
00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:02.420 align:start position:0%
these slides this is not as sort of the
 
00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:03.649 align:start position:0%
order that we'll discuss them in and
 
00:13:05.079 --> 00:13:05.089 align:start position:0%
we're not discussing the details here
 
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:07.130 align:start position:0%
but the slides will tie back to these
 
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:09.410 align:start position:0%
first that they shock to the economy has
 
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:13.310 align:start position:0%
been swift and massive and second the
 
00:13:15.519 --> 00:13:15.529 align:start position:0%
crisis's impacts are disproportionate
 
00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:18.380 align:start position:0%
for those with the least ability to
 
00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:20.209 align:start position:0%
absorb these financial shocks and that
 
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:22.390 align:start position:0%
has implications for the broader economy
 
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:25.070 align:start position:0%
the last recovery may tell us something
 
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.010 align:start position:0%
about what is a potential for the next
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
recovery in terms of recovering from
 
00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
this economic contraction and it was a
 
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:34.610 align:start position:0%
long recovery it was the longest since
 
00:13:36.579 --> 00:13:36.589 align:start position:0%
we've started sort of recording how long
 
00:13:39.009 --> 00:13:39.019 align:start position:0%
recoveries are in the United States but
 
00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
it did leave many people in precarious
 
00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:43.850 align:start position:0%
financial situations and projections for
 
00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:45.620 align:start position:0%
future economic growth and economic
 
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:47.510 align:start position:0%
activity are very uncertain at this
 
00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:49.640 align:start position:0%
point but future growth will be
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
dependent on both public health factors
 
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
such as vaccines and the deployment of
 
00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:57.380 align:start position:0%
vaccines the deployment of treatments as
 
00:13:59.680 --> 00:13:59.690 align:start position:0%
well as the resources that individuals
 
00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:01.640 align:start position:0%
and families have to engage in the
 
00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:04.750 align:start position:0%
economy so keep those points in mind
 
00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:07.160 align:start position:0%
let's talk a little bit about what we're
 
00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:09.890 align:start position:0%
seeing in unemployment we have data now
 
00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:12.260 align:start position:0%
at the state level or what we
 
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:13.610 align:start position:0%
traditionally think of as what is the
 
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate and that is again
 
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
based on that's based on a survey a
 
00:14:20.769 --> 00:14:20.779 align:start position:0%
survey of households that's conducted
 
00:14:23.199 --> 00:14:23.209 align:start position:0%
nationally in the twelfth day of each
 
00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:25.910 align:start position:0%
so the April I pardon me in the week
 
00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:27.350 align:start position:0%
that includes the twelfth day of each
 
00:14:30.249 --> 00:14:30.259 align:start position:0%
month so April was the first month where
 
00:14:32.379 --> 00:14:32.389 align:start position:0%
we saw that impact in New Hampshire and
 
00:14:35.109 --> 00:14:35.119 align:start position:0%
as you can see on the graph here um
 
00:14:38.559 --> 00:14:38.569 align:start position:0%
the Great Recession during during leash
 
00:14:40.689 --> 00:14:40.699 align:start position:0%
in the shaded area here and there was a
 
00:14:43.059 --> 00:14:43.069 align:start position:0%
pretty substantial and steep increase in
 
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
the unemployment rate you can see New
 
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:48.410 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is in this green thinner line
 
00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:49.790 align:start position:0%
and the United States as a whole is in
 
00:14:52.419 --> 00:14:52.429 align:start position:0%
this thick blue line however that
 
00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:54.410 align:start position:0%
increase was not nearly as steep as what
 
00:14:56.679 --> 00:14:56.689 align:start position:0%
we just experienced in terms of the
 
00:15:00.129 --> 00:15:00.139 align:start position:0%
shock to employment you here we can see
 
00:15:01.239 --> 00:15:01.249 align:start position:0%
that the national unemployment rate
 
00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:03.860 align:start position:0%
which again these figures because
 
00:15:05.379 --> 00:15:05.389 align:start position:0%
they're based on household surveys it's
 
00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:06.860 align:start position:0%
probably gonna be difficult for them to
 
00:15:08.829 --> 00:15:08.839 align:start position:0%
settle out for a little while the Bureau
 
00:15:10.359 --> 00:15:10.369 align:start position:0%
of Labor Statistics actually believes
 
00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:12.740 align:start position:0%
that they're under counting unemployment
 
00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:15.050 align:start position:0%
because of the way that people respond
 
00:15:16.419 --> 00:15:16.429 align:start position:0%
to the questions and the questionnaires
 
00:15:20.109 --> 00:15:20.119 align:start position:0%
and categorize themselves so in the
 
00:15:21.819 --> 00:15:21.829 align:start position:0%
automatic categorization so there may be
 
00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:24.350 align:start position:0%
people who are identified as temporarily
 
00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:25.790 align:start position:0%
they're out of the labor force or
 
00:15:28.809 --> 00:15:28.819 align:start position:0%
temporarily not working that we might
 
00:15:29.949 --> 00:15:29.959 align:start position:0%
think of as more traditionally
 
00:15:31.989 --> 00:15:31.999 align:start position:0%
unemployed because they aren't able to
 
00:15:33.639 --> 00:15:33.649 align:start position:0%
work they may have not have been laid
 
00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:36.170 align:start position:0%
off from their job but they they've lost
 
00:15:38.859 --> 00:15:38.869 align:start position:0%
that income so the national employment
 
00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
rate estimated to be about fourteen
 
00:15:42.009 --> 00:15:42.019 align:start position:0%
point seven percent for April New
 
00:15:43.389 --> 00:15:43.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's is sixteen point three
 
00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:45.860 align:start position:0%
percent that's preliminary so that's
 
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
likely to move around some however it's
 
00:15:50.829 --> 00:15:50.839 align:start position:0%
unusual for the Hampshire to be higher
 
00:15:52.929 --> 00:15:52.939 align:start position:0%
than the nation as a whole and New
 
00:15:54.999 --> 00:15:55.009 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is right now higher than four
 
00:15:56.559 --> 00:15:56.569 align:start position:0%
of the five other New England states
 
00:15:58.319 --> 00:15:58.329 align:start position:0%
based on these sort of preliminary
 
00:16:02.079 --> 00:16:02.089 align:start position:0%
estimates at this point so that's that
 
00:16:03.759 --> 00:16:03.769 align:start position:0%
may not tell us very much at this point
 
00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:06.980 align:start position:0%
but that we we do know between the March
 
00:16:08.559 --> 00:16:08.569 align:start position:0%
in April reports that the estimate is
 
00:16:11.289 --> 00:16:11.299 align:start position:0%
that 152,000 fewer people were working
 
00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:13.670 align:start position:0%
in April than in March in New Hampshire
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
and when you're talking about a labor
 
00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:18.230 align:start position:0%
force of about 750,000 people then you
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
know it's a pretty significant amount
 
00:16:20.889 --> 00:16:20.899 align:start position:0%
and I'll note that the labor force size
 
00:16:22.929 --> 00:16:22.939 align:start position:0%
itself the people that are engaged in
 
00:16:24.489 --> 00:16:24.499 align:start position:0%
employment or looking for employment
 
00:16:27.609 --> 00:16:27.619 align:start position:0%
decreased by about 51,000 people between
 
00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:30.370 align:start position:0%
March and April based on these data
 
00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
another way that we can measure
 
00:16:35.199 --> 00:16:35.209 align:start position:0%
unemployment is through unemployment
 
00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:36.740 align:start position:0%
insurance claims or claims
 
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:38.930 align:start position:0%
for being being receiving unemployment
 
00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
compensation there are two lines here we
 
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
can see the initial unemployment claims
 
00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:46.750 align:start position:0%
is this line on the bottom that is a
 
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:49.910 align:start position:0%
relatively relatively small line on this
 
00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:52.700 align:start position:0%
in terms of its height on this graph but
 
00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:54.980 align:start position:0%
the peak was at the previous peak was
 
00:16:58.780 --> 00:16:58.790 align:start position:0%
about 3,600 people filing for initial
 
00:17:00.639 --> 00:17:00.649 align:start position:0%
unemployment claims meaning they work on
 
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:02.450 align:start position:0%
the unemployment they weren't receiving
 
00:17:03.699 --> 00:17:03.709 align:start position:0%
an unemployment compensation the week
 
00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:05.750 align:start position:0%
before in the week following the
 
00:17:08.199 --> 00:17:08.209 align:start position:0%
recession it apart me in the period
 
00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
following the last recession that has
 
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
spiked to 39,000 in the peak number that
 
00:17:17.199 --> 00:17:17.209 align:start position:0%
we have here and then it has decline
 
00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:18.860 align:start position:0%
because these are initial claims they
 
00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:20.660 align:start position:0%
have declined but the continued claims
 
00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:23.540 align:start position:0%
you can see a dwarf whatever if the
 
00:17:25.299 --> 00:17:25.309 align:start position:0%
highest levels that we saw during the
 
00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:27.650 align:start position:0%
recession which was about 27,000 people
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
we can see that the continued
 
00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:30.950 align:start position:0%
unemployment claims many people that
 
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
were on from the previous week continues
 
00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:35.900 align:start position:0%
to climb to levels that aren't seen and
 
00:17:38.169 --> 00:17:38.179 align:start position:0%
haven't been seen in this dataset and
 
00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:39.860 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's unemployment rate that
 
00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:41.420 align:start position:0%
was on the last data set is also the
 
00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:44.510 align:start position:0%
highest that that we've seen in that
 
00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:46.250 align:start position:0%
data sets history for in New Hampshire
 
00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:49.940 align:start position:0%
specifically I want to I'll show a
 
00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:51.500 align:start position:0%
little bit more about those initial
 
00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:52.970 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance claims to get
 
00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:55.070 align:start position:0%
into some of the industries you can see
 
00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:58.220 align:start position:0%
on the left the New Hampshire the
 
00:17:59.950 --> 00:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Employment Security has
 
00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:01.640 align:start position:0%
sort of collected together industry
 
00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
groups into three categories that they
 
00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
summarized in their reports now the
 
00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
foodservice industry retail industries
 
00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:11.059 align:start position:0%
and the healthcare industries and we can
 
00:18:13.299 --> 00:18:13.309 align:start position:0%
see in the blue bars from March 15
 
00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:17.150 align:start position:0%
through May 2nd what was the increase in
 
00:18:19.299 --> 00:18:19.309 align:start position:0%
initial unemployment claims from that
 
00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:21.380 align:start position:0%
industry in aggregate and then through
 
00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:23.390 align:start position:0%
May 9th so adding on another week what's
 
00:18:25.419 --> 00:18:25.429 align:start position:0%
the initial injury what's the increase
 
00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:27.530 align:start position:0%
in initial claims and you can see that
 
00:18:29.049 --> 00:18:29.059 align:start position:0%
foodservice retail and healthcare have
 
00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
all gone up between these two weeks so
 
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
they're continuing to contribute maybe
 
00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:34.580 align:start position:0%
healthcare is contributing a little bit
 
00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:37.130 align:start position:0%
faster at this point the the impact may
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
have been more direct and immediate on
 
00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:40.820 align:start position:0%
food service and retail and a little bit
 
00:18:43.419 --> 00:18:43.429 align:start position:0%
more latent on healthcare if we look to
 
00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:46.190 align:start position:0%
the right then you can see that there's
 
00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:49.950 align:start position:0%
an increase in each of the sort of
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
sub-sector industry or by more narrowly
 
00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:54.500 align:start position:0%
defined industries and we can see that
 
00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:56.190 align:start position:0%
restaurants are the hardest hit
 
00:18:58.250 --> 00:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
alongside hospitals doctors and dentists
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
offices hotels and motels childcare
 
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:02.730 align:start position:0%
elementary and secondary schools as well
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
as bus drivers and higher education
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
car dealerships beauty salons this shows
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
the industries that have all seen have
 
00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
all been the source of at least a
 
00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:12.810 align:start position:0%
thousand initial unemployment insurance
 
00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:15.630 align:start position:0%
claims so I'll pause here I want to make
 
00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
sure I can address any questions about
 
00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:19.610 align:start position:0%
these before moving on a little bit I
 
00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:22.830 align:start position:0%
don't see any yet but Phil do you is
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
there any way to look at the total
 
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:31.110 align:start position:0%
unemployment relative to the total total
 
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
employment and say January for each of
 
00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:39.150 align:start position:0%
those for each of those yes so in terms
 
00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:41.030 align:start position:0%
of where in terms of the traditional
 
00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
unemployment survey that's a little bit
 
00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:47.310 align:start position:0%
more difficult to do but at least at
 
00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:48.300 align:start position:0%
this point it's definitely more
 
00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:49.710 align:start position:0%
difficult to do I can tell you that
 
00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
these initial unemployment claims again
 
00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:53.430 align:start position:0%
this is the March 15th to the weeks
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
ending March 15th to May 9th so there's
 
00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
two things about the initial claims that
 
00:19:59.690 --> 00:19:59.700 align:start position:0%
are important to know one is unlike a
 
00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:01.650 align:start position:0%
survey it requires actions on the parts
 
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
of individuals right they have to apply
 
00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:06.390 align:start position:0%
for the unemployment compensation and we
 
00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
don't know if they've subsequently got
 
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
the job afterwards right because these
 
00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:11.700 align:start position:0%
are the initial claims over a period of
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
time that being said in in this economic
 
00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:16.500 align:start position:0%
environment there aren't that many
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
people who are being presumably being
 
00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
added to to employment in the in
 
00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:23.970 align:start position:0%
especially in some of these industries
 
00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:27.180 align:start position:0%
so but that's a caveat for understanding
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
these conditional unemployment claims in
 
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:35.220 align:start position:0%
Prior weeks before March 15th you saw
 
00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:36.540 align:start position:0%
we're quite low you know we're talking
 
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
hundreds hundreds of people would be in
 
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:42.210 align:start position:0%
aggregate as opposed to you know we saw
 
00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:45.930 align:start position:0%
with the week of April 4 39,000 so this
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
this probably gives us as best as
 
00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:50.070 align:start position:0%
snapshot as we have now in terms of
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
where the unemployment has been
 
00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:54.330 align:start position:0%
occurring since January but I will show
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
a pie chart showing what employment was
 
00:20:59.390 --> 00:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
in those sectors in January okay
 
00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:01.710 align:start position:0%
thank you Arif cinema Brown he has his
 
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:18.300 align:start position:0%
should be talking now okay Phil thanks
 
00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:20.850 align:start position:0%
um I don't see manufacturing on here
 
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
which is interesting that it seems like
 
00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:25.980 align:start position:0%
our manufacturers have been least impact
 
00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:28.590 align:start position:0%
that it's not a quick statement I don't
 
00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:30.870 align:start position:0%
know about least impacted but because
 
00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:32.910 align:start position:0%
they are more you know they are more
 
00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:33.930 align:start position:0%
likely to fall into the essential
 
00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
businesses category and and because you
 
00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:40.530 align:start position:0%
know some of their work maybe may be
 
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
easier to do social distancing with some
 
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
of their work and some easier to do some
 
00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:46.410 align:start position:0%
of the physical distancing it could be
 
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
that those employers have have been able
 
00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:52.170 align:start position:0%
to make it a safe environment so but in
 
00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:53.670 align:start position:0%
terms of where we see the initial
 
00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
unemployment claims it you know that
 
00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
given that manufacturing which you'll
 
00:21:59.710 --> 00:21:59.720 align:start position:0%
see on a subsequent slide is a
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
relatively significant employment sector
 
00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
in the economy it is noteworthy that we
 
00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:06.690 align:start position:0%
haven't seen at least among these these
 
00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
you know industries as they're laid out
 
00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:11.130 align:start position:0%
here we haven't seen those initial
 
00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:12.570 align:start position:0%
unemployment claims coming from there so
 
00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:14.730 align:start position:0%
I would say yes relative to many of
 
00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
these industries it's insulated thank
 
00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:21.180 align:start position:0%
you who is trying to talk at the same
 
00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:27.860 align:start position:0%
time without raising a hand okay
 
00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:31.820 align:start position:0%
remain anonymous thank you so go ahead
 
00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:34.770 align:start position:0%
absolutely so one of the things and
 
00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
getting to what this committee is going
 
00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:38.850 align:start position:0%
to be thinking about a little bit more
 
00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:42.950 align:start position:0%
directly is is we see the impacts on the
 
00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:45.210 align:start position:0%
restaurant industry in particular but
 
00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:47.670 align:start position:0%
also accommodations and car rentals in
 
00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
the meals and rentals tax revenue this
 
00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:50.820 align:start position:0%
is a graph that many of you have seen
 
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
before on the previous slide jects that
 
00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:57.300 align:start position:0%
I've shared but this shows the April
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
drop of about 40% in meals and rentals
 
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:03.210 align:start position:0%
tax revenue receipts which is again
 
00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:05.730 align:start position:0%
reflecting merge activity now one thing
 
00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:07.590 align:start position:0%
that I do want to note is that that
 
00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:09.990 align:start position:0%
suggests that even that half of March
 
00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
was affected roughly that suggests that
 
00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:14.180 align:start position:0%
was about an 80 percent drop in activity
 
00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:16.950 align:start position:0%
and and that
 
00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:18.870 align:start position:0%
is in line with the US Bureau of
 
00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:20.630 align:start position:0%
Economic Analysis reported that
 
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
accommodations and restaurant spending
 
00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:25.770 align:start position:0%
overall and in the u.s. was down sixty
 
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
to eighty percent in the last ten days
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
of March so it's in line with that one
 
00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:31.230 align:start position:0%
thing I'll note is that the initial the
 
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
early numbers oh did we lose the screen
 
00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:36.450 align:start position:0%
yes okay well I will share it again I
 
00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:39.510 align:start position:0%
don't know what happened there I just
 
00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:43.170 align:start position:0%
point out that the current unless
 
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:45.300 align:start position:0%
there's a readjustment at the end which
 
00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
they doesn't ever seem to be meals and
 
00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:49.770 align:start position:0%
rooms is down fifty nine percent this
 
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:53.310 align:start position:0%
month so it's not not anywhere near as
 
00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:56.610 align:start position:0%
bad as it wasn't beginning yes and that
 
00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:58.170 align:start position:0%
was where I was about to go when my
 
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
screen was interrupted but that he no no
 
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
you're quite right it's that that's that
 
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
it's looking a little bit better for for
 
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:09.330 align:start position:0%
April activity than our sort of worst
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
fears based on these initial data which
 
00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:14.550 align:start position:0%
is which is encouraging um
 
00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:16.230 align:start position:0%
I'll note that you know we talked a
 
00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:17.970 align:start position:0%
little bit about unemployment thus far
 
00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:19.890 align:start position:0%
that would directly affect the business
 
00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:22.110 align:start position:0%
enterprise tax but we can't really parse
 
00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:24.030 align:start position:0%
through that yet maybe the Department
 
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
revenue ministration will be able to and
 
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:28.110 align:start position:0%
in the next presentation but it's
 
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:29.730 align:start position:0%
difficult to parse through that yet at
 
00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:32.430 align:start position:0%
this point because it's mixed in with
 
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax and then
 
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:35.940 align:start position:0%
corporate profits speaking to the
 
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:39.090 align:start position:0%
business profits tax may not be tied as
 
00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:40.590 align:start position:0%
directly to employment may behave a
 
00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:41.970 align:start position:0%
little bit differently but the overall
 
00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:44.190 align:start position:0%
economy matters including how much
 
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
people do have to spend and that is also
 
00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:48.930 align:start position:0%
true for the real estate transfer tax
 
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:51.540 align:start position:0%
and which has seen a decline thus far in
 
00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:53.850 align:start position:0%
the early may numbers as far as we know
 
00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
before the month closes up so there was
 
00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:00.270 align:start position:0%
a there was a question about what
 
00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:02.430 align:start position:0%
employment looked like in January from
 
00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:04.470 align:start position:0%
representing valmy well this graph on
 
00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:06.930 align:start position:0%
the left the pie chart shows the
 
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:09.810 align:start position:0%
estimates for how many employees or what
 
00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:13.410 align:start position:0%
was employment in each sector in January
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
and you can see that it's broken out
 
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
into the sector's the sort of five
 
00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
largest sectors that make up more than
 
00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
half of the employment in the state and
 
00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:23.130 align:start position:0%
then you get to all the other sectors
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
which are the other half so you'll note
 
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
that in retail trade was the was the
 
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:30.330 align:start position:0%
leader for a long time
 
00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:31.350 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it's only been recently
 
00:25:33.139 --> 00:25:33.149 align:start position:0%
passed by health care and social
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
assistance and then adding an
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
accommodation and food services those
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
three sectors make up more than a third
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
of employment in New Hampshire at least
 
00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:42.570 align:start position:0%
prior to this remember that the numbers
 
00:25:44.029 --> 00:25:44.039 align:start position:0%
that we were talking about in terms of
 
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
loss of jobs in the food service
 
00:25:48.769 --> 00:25:48.779 align:start position:0%
industry was you know based on the
 
00:25:51.769 --> 00:25:51.779 align:start position:0%
initial unemployment numbers near 22,000
 
00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:54.450 align:start position:0%
or so which is a significant portion of
 
00:25:57.919 --> 00:25:57.929 align:start position:0%
that 61,000 um and one of the things
 
00:25:59.630 --> 00:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
that I do want to note as well is if you
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
look at the graph on the right you'll
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
see that relative to the average pay for
 
00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:06.750 align:start position:0%
all employees an average weekly wage for
 
00:26:08.659 --> 00:26:08.669 align:start position:0%
all employees in calendar year 2018
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
retail trade and accommodation and food
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
services are quite a bit lower than what
 
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:14.850 align:start position:0%
that statewide average is that you can
 
00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:16.919 align:start position:0%
see over here and then health care and
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
social assistance is about where that
 
00:26:19.879 --> 00:26:19.889 align:start position:0%
average is but there's a lot of
 
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
variation within it because remember
 
00:26:24.529 --> 00:26:24.539 align:start position:0%
this is an average one thing I will note
 
00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:26.070 align:start position:0%
as well is that durable goods
 
00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:27.860 align:start position:0%
manufacturing does show up on here to
 
00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:30.260 align:start position:0%
representative a Brahmans question
 
00:26:33.769 --> 00:26:33.779 align:start position:0%
durable goods manufacturing is is the
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
fifth largest sector based on how these
 
00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
sectors are broken up here but is is not
 
00:26:41.899 --> 00:26:41.909 align:start position:0%
does not appear to be as impacted at
 
00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:42.990 align:start position:0%
least based on those initial
 
00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:46.350 align:start position:0%
unemployment claims so and I see there's
 
00:26:48.009 --> 00:26:48.019 align:start position:0%
a question ah
 
00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:51.450 align:start position:0%
Southworth history yes I just wondered
 
00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:55.110 align:start position:0%
food services of course is quite low am
 
00:27:00.409 --> 00:27:00.419 align:start position:0%
I on that mean that food services does
 
00:27:03.049 --> 00:27:03.059 align:start position:0%
not include tips because I know wait
 
00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:06.110 align:start position:0%
people who make quite good weekly pay
 
00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:08.850 align:start position:0%
yes so these are reported by the
 
00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:12.990 align:start position:0%
employer so whether that includes tips
 
00:27:16.009 --> 00:27:16.019 align:start position:0%
beyond for example if they're if the for
 
00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:17.850 align:start position:0%
the food service the individual working
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
food services is making below minimum
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
wage the employer might you know
 
00:27:23.629 --> 00:27:23.639 align:start position:0%
depending on the practice might only
 
00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
verify up to minimum wage um that's a
 
00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:27.990 align:start position:0%
good question in terms of how these data
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
are collected and this is but these are
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
these are relatively complete data which
 
00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:35.220 align:start position:0%
is one of the because they're based on
 
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
some of the same data that are fed into
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
the unemployment insurance system and so
 
00:27:41.659 --> 00:27:41.669 align:start position:0%
it is it is not based on a survey
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit less error here on
 
00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.050 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit less error here on
that

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:44.060 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:46.550 align:start position:0%
but in terms of tips I don't know that
 
00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:48.140 align:start position:0%
there I don't know how they're all
 
00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:50.990 align:start position:0%
counted here especially beyond the
 
00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:52.700 align:start position:0%
minimum wage levels that sort of have to
 
00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:55.810 align:start position:0%
be insured by the employer thank you
 
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:00.010 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:04.310 align:start position:0%
okay so one thing that I do want to note
 
00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:06.980 align:start position:0%
is that you know this is this is a
 
00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:09.230 align:start position:0%
widespread loss of income and has been
 
00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:11.210 align:start position:0%
falling as we saw in the prior graphs
 
00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:13.610 align:start position:0%
I'm disproportionately on those who may
 
00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:15.320 align:start position:0%
not have had many savings to carry
 
00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
themselves through at this point it may
 
00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:18.650 align:start position:0%
not have had much income to serve as a
 
00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:22.580 align:start position:0%
buffer and so I'll quote a US Federal
 
00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:25.070 align:start position:0%
Reserve chair Jay Powell who a major
 
00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:27.410 align:start position:0%
13th noted that among people who were
 
00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:30.470 align:start position:0%
working in February almost 40% of those
 
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
in households making less than $40,000 a
 
00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:36.020 align:start position:0%
year had lost the job in March based on
 
00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:38.570 align:start position:0%
research that the US Federal Reserve
 
00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:40.490 align:start position:0%
Bank at the national level a Board of
 
00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:42.950 align:start position:0%
Governors had done and you can see on
 
00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:44.420 align:start position:0%
the graph on the right in New Hampshire
 
00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:47.390 align:start position:0%
and this is a this is a sort of an
 
00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:49.580 align:start position:0%
experimental initial survey done by the
 
00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:50.990 align:start position:0%
US Census Bureau that's called the
 
00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:54.230 align:start position:0%
household pulse survey and this is
 
00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:56.810 align:start position:0%
measuring through the week of May 12th
 
00:28:58.930 --> 00:28:58.940 align:start position:0%
how many respondents specifically in New
 
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are able to respond in the
 
00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:03.140 align:start position:0%
affirmative to some of these questions
 
00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:05.810 align:start position:0%
and I've highlighted a few here one is
 
00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:07.970 align:start position:0%
that 45 percent of households in New
 
00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:09.430 align:start position:0%
Hampshire reported a loss of income
 
00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:11.690 align:start position:0%
since March 13th
 
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:14.440 align:start position:0%
so since essentially the pandemic began
 
00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:17.900 align:start position:0%
34 percent expect a loss of income in
 
00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:19.610 align:start position:0%
the next four weeks and again this is
 
00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:21.470 align:start position:0%
results through the weekend March May
 
00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:24.830 align:start position:0%
12th and that has an impact on their
 
00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:27.320 align:start position:0%
ability to pay for goods and services in
 
00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:30.290 align:start position:0%
the economy 14 percent did not pay rent
 
00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
or mortgage on time or they have slate
 
00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
or no confidence that they will pay on
 
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
time this month and then 6% identified
 
00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
that in the last seven days there was
 
00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:40.850 align:start position:0%
some times they're often not enough to
 
00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:43.910 align:start position:0%
eat and that's in line you know with
 
00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:45.590 align:start position:0%
some of the numbers that we've seen in
 
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
terms of the constraints on consumer
 
00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:50.020 align:start position:0%
spending affecting even food security
 
00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:53.090 align:start position:0%
about one in five households based on
 
00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:54.830 align:start position:0%
two different surveys about one in five
 
00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
households nationally
 
00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:57.690 align:start position:0%
out of food and did not have enough
 
00:29:59.180 --> 00:29:59.190 align:start position:0%
money to buy more in the last 30 days
 
00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:02.990 align:start position:0%
and two and five households nationally
 
00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:06.630 align:start position:0%
which had mothers with children under 12
 
00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
years old ran out of food and could not
 
00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:09.570 align:start position:0%
afford more at some point since the
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic began now this has implications
 
00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:14.250 align:start position:0%
for consumer spending and consumer
 
00:30:17.779 --> 00:30:17.789 align:start position:0%
spending comprises about 70 percent of
 
00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:19.230 align:start position:0%
gross domestic product in the United
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
States and consumer spending contracted
 
00:30:25.659 --> 00:30:25.669 align:start position:0%
between February and March by 7.5% and
 
00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:28.110 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Economic Analysis actually
 
00:30:30.049 --> 00:30:30.059 align:start position:0%
estimates that in the last 10 days in
 
00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:31.770 align:start position:0%
March consumer spending was down almost
 
00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:34.590 align:start position:0%
28 percent now again that may be a look
 
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
that may be the sort of the lowest point
 
00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:39.750 align:start position:0%
but you know there are because so many
 
00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:41.070 align:start position:0%
households that we're seeing or in
 
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
responding to these surveys saying
 
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
they're having trouble affording food
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
that's likely leads to larger threats to
 
00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:48.210 align:start position:0%
consumer spending overall which of
 
00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:50.220 align:start position:0%
course is a threat to a very large
 
00:30:53.419 --> 00:30:53.429 align:start position:0%
portion of the economy and of course it
 
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
won't disappear all overnight but the
 
00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
the projections suggest that we'll stay
 
00:31:00.169 --> 00:31:00.179 align:start position:0%
low for a little bit and we'll talk
 
00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:02.850 align:start position:0%
about those in a moment now thinking
 
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
about the last economic recovery what
 
00:31:09.649 --> 00:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
what was economic growth you know around
 
00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:11.490 align:start position:0%
the time of the Great Recession the
 
00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:13.980 align:start position:0%
2007-2009 Great Recession and since then
 
00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:17.490 align:start position:0%
here you can see New Hampshire's new
 
00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:19.830 align:start position:0%
hampshire is the dark blue line here
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
where the remaining New England states
 
00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:23.610 align:start position:0%
are the Green Line and the United States
 
00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:26.940 align:start position:0%
overall is in light blue and you can see
 
00:31:28.399 --> 00:31:28.409 align:start position:0%
there was this period of time
 
00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire actually entered the
 
00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
recession earlier and there was this
 
00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:33.390 align:start position:0%
period of time where growth was quite
 
00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
slow in New Hampshire quite sluggish
 
00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
during the economic recovery um but then
 
00:31:40.039 --> 00:31:40.049 align:start position:0%
started to pick up a little after you
 
00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:42.390 align:start position:0%
know between 2014 and 2015 the economy
 
00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:44.610 align:start position:0%
started to pick up and do quite a bit
 
00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
better in terms of Gross State product
 
00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:49.650 align:start position:0%
growth the size of the state economy of
 
00:31:52.279 --> 00:31:52.289 align:start position:0%
course it's still lagging the US overall
 
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of its growth rate but that's
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
that's where sort of the positive
 
00:31:59.180 --> 00:31:59.190 align:start position:0%
picture was now what does that mean in
 
00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
terms of Owen was there a question I
 
00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:03.270 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that I dressed in a
 
00:32:04.039 --> 00:32:04.049 align:start position:0%
sexy one
 
00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
okay great what does what happened to
 
00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
people's wages during this
 
00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:12.630 align:start position:0%
time in New Hampshire specifically if we
 
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
look at the average of 2004 to 2006 and
 
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
compare that to the average of 2017 to
 
00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
2019 wages by decile and by decile means
 
00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:24.990 align:start position:0%
basically what percentile are you in in
 
00:32:28.039 --> 00:32:28.049 align:start position:0%
terms of where the wages are so for
 
00:32:30.139 --> 00:32:30.149 align:start position:0%
example the 50th percentile is the
 
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
median wage in the state the 10th
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
percentile 10% of wages are lower than
 
00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:38.130 align:start position:0%
that in the state 90th 10 percent are
 
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
higher and so we can see here the change
 
00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:43.350 align:start position:0%
over this time across this from the
 
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:45.210 align:start position:0%
prior to the last recession across the
 
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
economic recovery we saw that lower
 
00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:49.590 align:start position:0%
wages and median wages didn't grow very
 
00:32:51.799 --> 00:32:51.809 align:start position:0%
much and either about flat over this
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
time period and that has implications
 
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
for what the what the economic recovery
 
00:33:00.139 --> 00:33:00.149 align:start position:0%
looks like indeed if we look at if we
 
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
break it out year by year these are the
 
00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:04.409 align:start position:0%
same data although slimmed down so just
 
00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:06.990 align:start position:0%
we have the 10 to 20 50th 80th and 90th
 
00:33:09.139 --> 00:33:09.149 align:start position:0%
percentiles so think about green is
 
00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:13.350 align:start position:0%
lower income and the median 50th
 
00:33:15.889 --> 00:33:15.899 align:start position:0%
percentile is an orange and the blue are
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
the higher income household we can see
 
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:20.940 align:start position:0%
that there's a was a decline in sort of
 
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:23.010 align:start position:0%
real purchasing power inflation adjusted
 
00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:26.370 align:start position:0%
purchasing power from around the time of
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
the recession to about 2015 and only
 
00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:30.990 align:start position:0%
when that economic growth started
 
00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:33.630 align:start position:0%
picking up did we see that the wages
 
00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:35.370 align:start position:0%
rise on the lower level and that has a
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
positive feedback loop that helps the
 
00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:39.690 align:start position:0%
economy because then more consumers have
 
00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:42.750 align:start position:0%
more a larger ability to spend now I saw
 
00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:45.090 align:start position:0%
that there was a hand raised as well and
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
I want to address yes
 
00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:53.190 align:start position:0%
all right so Valerie Valerie yeah I'm
 
00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:55.230 align:start position:0%
trying to figure this mutant unmute
 
00:33:58.370 --> 00:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
thing thank you
 
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:02.010 align:start position:0%
Phil yeah mr. Slaton you spoke earlier
 
00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:05.190 align:start position:0%
about the comparison to the the
 
00:34:07.279 --> 00:34:07.289 align:start position:0%
recession back here in two thousand
 
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
seven eight nine cetera and trying to
 
00:34:16.579 --> 00:34:16.589 align:start position:0%
compare that to recovery from this the
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
two different lists apples and oranges
 
00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:20.970 align:start position:0%
there they may both be recovery but
 
00:34:22.399 --> 00:34:22.409 align:start position:0%
they're certainly not
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
similar yes wait and I don't sorry go
 
00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:26.809 align:start position:0%
similar yes wait and I don't sorry go
ahead

00:34:26.809 --> 00:34:26.819 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
well the question on that is if we have
 
00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:35.730 align:start position:0%
a v-shaped recovery versus a u-shaped
 
00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
recovery how is that going you know for
 
00:34:41.089 --> 00:34:41.099 align:start position:0%
lack of better terminology how would
 
00:34:43.309 --> 00:34:43.319 align:start position:0%
that affect New Hampshire which because
 
00:34:47.329 --> 00:34:47.339 align:start position:0%
of our broad tax base tends to be more
 
00:34:52.819 --> 00:34:52.829 align:start position:0%
rapid in every circumstance yeah so I
 
00:34:54.529 --> 00:34:54.539 align:start position:0%
think that it certainly the v-shape
 
00:34:56.599 --> 00:34:56.609 align:start position:0%
versus a u-shaped recovery question is
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
is a certainly one that's paramount when
 
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
you're thinking about this because there
 
00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:03.690 align:start position:0%
have been a lot of supports put in place
 
00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:06.030 align:start position:0%
to try to promote that v-shaped recovery
 
00:35:07.849 --> 00:35:07.859 align:start position:0%
and I'll talk about some of the
 
00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:10.710 align:start position:0%
projections a little bit you know on a
 
00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:13.980 align:start position:0%
subsequent slide but that if if we are
 
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
able to sort of maintain connections
 
00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
between employers and employees if we're
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
able to maintain income supports for
 
00:35:22.549 --> 00:35:22.559 align:start position:0%
individuals and families a lot of the
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
policies that we've seen particularly at
 
00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:26.220 align:start position:0%
the federal level but also at the state
 
00:35:28.309 --> 00:35:28.319 align:start position:0%
level have been targeted at doing that
 
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:29.730 align:start position:0%
sort of getting through this relief
 
00:35:32.329 --> 00:35:32.339 align:start position:0%
period so that the recovery is faster I
 
00:35:34.579 --> 00:35:34.589 align:start position:0%
think that you know that's that's a
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
scenario that we're looking for right
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
that's what we are aiming to be able to
 
00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:41.490 align:start position:0%
do right is to prove to support that
 
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
v-shaped recovery so that were able to
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
snap back into that position if we look
 
00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:49.770 align:start position:0%
at the last recession there's I think
 
00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
that presents risks right even in New
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that we are talking about a
 
00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:56.910 align:start position:0%
longer slower recovery and it really
 
00:35:59.180 --> 00:35:59.190 align:start position:0%
does depend I mean one of the key things
 
00:36:01.309 --> 00:36:01.319 align:start position:0%
here is the public health factor yeah
 
00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:04.650 align:start position:0%
does Public Health permit us to do the
 
00:36:06.289 --> 00:36:06.299 align:start position:0%
public health concerns permit us to be
 
00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:09.270 align:start position:0%
able to you know go you know move
 
00:36:11.269 --> 00:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
quickly back to a growing economy if
 
00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:12.750 align:start position:0%
there's a vaccine tomorrow when we're
 
00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:16.740 align:start position:0%
able to get you know a million vaccine
 
00:36:19.039 --> 00:36:19.049 align:start position:0%
doses deployed into New Hampshire in you
 
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
know in a short period of time then
 
00:36:22.819 --> 00:36:22.829 align:start position:0%
great I think that v-shape recovery is
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
much more likely I think that there's
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
going to be activities that are normal
 
00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:28.770 align:start position:0%
economic activities that's not to say
 
00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:30.690 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be replaced by something
 
00:36:32.029 --> 00:36:32.039 align:start position:0%
new but there are normal economic
 
00:36:35.329 --> 00:36:35.339 align:start position:0%
activities that will slow growth and
 
00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:36.270 align:start position:0%
curtail parts of
 
00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:39.390 align:start position:0%
the economy and I don't know that we'll
 
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
be able to replace those with other
 
00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
activities fast enough to really get us
 
00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:45.930 align:start position:0%
to that v-shape but if we but certainly
 
00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:48.180 align:start position:0%
the policies that have been put in place
 
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
are aimed at supporting the ability for
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
the economy to get to that v-shape and I
 
00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:55.860 align:start position:0%
hope I dressed your question and I see
 
00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:57.690 align:start position:0%
you have another raise your hand again
 
00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:06.950 align:start position:0%
so and yes no yep it's system and I have
 
00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:10.530 align:start position:0%
thank you for that the uu race two
 
00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:12.390 align:start position:0%
issues on there which are a little
 
00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:13.950 align:start position:0%
concerning to me one you're talking
 
00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:17.370 align:start position:0%
about I quote healthy or perfect
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
environment when it's never going to
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
happen because you know walking down the
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
street is actually more dangerous than
 
00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:27.870 align:start position:0%
catching colvin but particularly with
 
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
the speed people are driving these days
 
00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
but the question is we have a high debt
 
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:44.010 align:start position:0%
now that is being incurred that's going
 
00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:47.610 align:start position:0%
to stifle any recovery that may take
 
00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:50.970 align:start position:0%
place and while it may be a short-term
 
00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:54.180 align:start position:0%
stimulus it's gonna be a long-term drag
 
00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:57.990 align:start position:0%
on the economy will you be addressing
 
00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:01.410 align:start position:0%
that so in this presentation I am
 
00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:03.570 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they all know is that when we
 
00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:04.890 align:start position:0%
get to the Congressional Budget Office
 
00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:07.350 align:start position:0%
projections they do incorporate the
 
00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:10.140 align:start position:0%
effects of recent federal policies on
 
00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:15.270 align:start position:0%
the on economic growth one of the one of
 
00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
the interesting things about the
 
00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:17.850 align:start position:0%
environment that we're in is that we
 
00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:19.710 align:start position:0%
have a very low interest rate right now
 
00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:21.330 align:start position:0%
at the federal level I'm assuming you're
 
00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
talking about federal debt and federal
 
00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:26.790 align:start position:0%
public debt we have a very low interest
 
00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:29.190 align:start position:0%
rate right now at the federal level it
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
makes them it makes money relatively
 
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:35.210 align:start position:0%
cheap to borrow if you will and that
 
00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:38.790 align:start position:0%
that is something that you know for for
 
00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
better or for worse we're in a situation
 
00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
where we sort of have to take advantage
 
00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:44.940 align:start position:0%
of that to be able to make that v-shaped
 
00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:47.490 align:start position:0%
recovery or even a u-shaped recovery as
 
00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:50.070 align:start position:0%
possible as it can be given the
 
00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:53.070 align:start position:0%
circumstances that were in but you know
 
00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:55.710 align:start position:0%
in certainly the long-term debt
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
considerations that we have that has a
 
00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
potential economic impact down the road
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
it's unclear there's not a lot of
 
00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:04.140 align:start position:0%
evidence to suggest that it's going to
 
00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:06.810 align:start position:0%
be a near-term or medium-term economic
 
00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:09.660 align:start position:0%
impact but long-term there's certainly
 
00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:12.450 align:start position:0%
you know certainly reason to be thinking
 
00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:15.540 align:start position:0%
about how how the deficits especially
 
00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
and the long-term debt can be brought
 
00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:19.890 align:start position:0%
closer into balance but that is a that
 
00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:21.630 align:start position:0%
is a much longer-term consideration than
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
the time horizon that we're talking
 
00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:25.410 align:start position:0%
about here based on based on the
 
00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
evidence that we have around how that
 
00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:29.610 align:start position:0%
long-term that affects economic growth
 
00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:31.830 align:start position:0%
you know in in the immediate recovery
 
00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
period and I hope that answered your
 
00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:34.150 align:start position:0%
period and I hope that answered your
question

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
Thank You Phil we're gonna have to go
 
00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
faster yes if there's going to be enough
 
00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
time to talk with dr8 they've got an
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
awful lot of material yes absolutely so
 
00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:49.320 align:start position:0%
so going through these just a reminder
 
00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
that you know we saw a dip in real
 
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
purchasing power for a while and that
 
00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:55.590 align:start position:0%
probably means that even in folks low
 
00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:56.670 align:start position:0%
and even to a certain extent
 
00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
middle-income folks probably didn't
 
00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:01.740 align:start position:0%
weren't able to save as much and we're
 
00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:03.540 align:start position:0%
able to retain their savings during this
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
during this time period and we see that
 
00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:07.770 align:start position:0%
in other data to here's median household
 
00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:10.140 align:start position:0%
income for example from 2005 to 2018
 
00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:12.030 align:start position:0%
with the inflation adjustment and Orange
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
and the scale adjusted so you can see
 
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
the changes there was a long period
 
00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:18.410 align:start position:0%
where a median household income wasn't
 
00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:21.450 align:start position:0%
back to pre-recession levels until again
 
00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:24.690 align:start position:0%
we see this 2014 to 2015 period and
 
00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
there was a reminder we were talking
 
00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:28.050 align:start position:0%
about median household income we're
 
00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
talking about the middle of a
 
00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
distribution so this is the distribution
 
00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:34.590 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as of 2018 we can see
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
that roughly more than more than one out
 
00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:39.690 align:start position:0%
of four households in New Hampshire for
 
00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
bringing home $35,000 a year or less so
 
00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:44.820 align:start position:0%
given the giving cost of living that has
 
00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:47.490 align:start position:0%
implications for their you know for
 
00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:49.650 align:start position:0%
their ability to again continue to
 
00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
engage in the economy and potentially
 
00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:53.430 align:start position:0%
have savings that permit them to engage
 
00:40:57.860 --> 00:40:57.870 align:start position:0%
in their conduct details so and was
 
00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:00.870 align:start position:0%
there a question about that slide it
 
00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
looks like it's sorry it looks like it
 
00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.069 align:start position:0%
looks like it's sorry it looks like it
was

00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:41:08.539 --> 00:41:08.549 align:start position:0%
one out of four four seven seven yeah so
 
00:41:10.999 --> 00:41:11.009 align:start position:0%
it's almost it's more than whatever yeah
 
00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
and the reason I say more than one out
 
00:41:13.729 --> 00:41:13.739 align:start position:0%
of five is because if you account for
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
the margins of error and go to the
 
00:41:16.789 --> 00:41:16.799 align:start position:0%
extremes in each category then you're
 
00:41:18.469 --> 00:41:18.479 align:start position:0%
still you're still just a little bit
 
00:41:22.039 --> 00:41:22.049 align:start position:0%
over twenty percent so sorry but it's a
 
00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:23.660 align:start position:0%
band it's about one in three that are
 
00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
$50,000 or less as well so um so many
 
00:41:31.429 --> 00:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
households you know to sum up quickly
 
00:41:33.559 --> 00:41:33.569 align:start position:0%
here many households had few resources
 
00:41:35.839 --> 00:41:35.849 align:start position:0%
leading into this crisis and again that
 
00:41:38.299 --> 00:41:38.309 align:start position:0%
has impacts for what the what the
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
economy looks like immediately
 
00:41:42.049 --> 00:41:42.059 align:start position:0%
afterwards and how that interacts with
 
00:41:43.849 --> 00:41:43.859 align:start position:0%
what people are able to spend in the
 
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
economy immediately afterwards
 
00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:48.390 align:start position:0%
almost half of households in new renter
 
00:41:49.549 --> 00:41:49.559 align:start position:0%
households in New Hampshire were paying
 
00:41:51.319 --> 00:41:51.329 align:start position:0%
30% or more of their annual incomes in
 
00:41:54.769 --> 00:41:54.779 align:start position:0%
rent last year about $100,000 lived in
 
00:41:58.579 --> 00:41:58.589 align:start position:0%
poverty and a survey of US adults so not
 
00:41:59.929 --> 00:41:59.939 align:start position:0%
just New Hampshire but throughout the
 
00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
United States found that of about four
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
and ten US adults a little under that
 
00:42:07.669 --> 00:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
when faced with a hypothetical of
 
00:42:09.919 --> 00:42:09.929 align:start position:0%
expense of four hundred dollars said
 
00:42:11.929 --> 00:42:11.939 align:start position:0%
they would not be able to cover it or
 
00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:13.170 align:start position:0%
they would not cover it using cash
 
00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:14.670 align:start position:0%
savings or a credit card they would pay
 
00:42:15.769 --> 00:42:15.779 align:start position:0%
off at the end of the month they'd have
 
00:42:17.929 --> 00:42:17.939 align:start position:0%
to borrow money from someone sell an
 
00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:19.890 align:start position:0%
asset or they just wouldn't be able to
 
00:42:21.679 --> 00:42:21.689 align:start position:0%
pay it for twelve percent of them so
 
00:42:23.359 --> 00:42:23.369 align:start position:0%
that's it's a high number of people who
 
00:42:25.219 --> 00:42:25.229 align:start position:0%
have a relatively low amount of savings
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's probably a lower number in New
 
00:42:28.669 --> 00:42:28.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but it's still you know
 
00:42:30.679 --> 00:42:30.689 align:start position:0%
definitely a nonzero number in terms of
 
00:42:32.509 --> 00:42:32.519 align:start position:0%
people who don't have very many savings
 
00:42:33.969 --> 00:42:33.979 align:start position:0%
going into this crisis
 
00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:37.890 align:start position:0%
so now projections looking forward this
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
is a graph showing the Congressional
 
00:42:43.699 --> 00:42:43.709 align:start position:0%
Budget Office projections and these are
 
00:42:45.679 --> 00:42:45.689 align:start position:0%
updated some of you have seen a similar
 
00:42:47.719 --> 00:42:47.729 align:start position:0%
graph before these are may 19th
 
00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:49.619 align:start position:0%
projections so they've been updated
 
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
recently you can see historically the
 
00:42:56.269 --> 00:42:56.279 align:start position:0%
blue bars show the annualized change in
 
00:42:58.370 --> 00:42:58.380 align:start position:0%
gross and real gross domestic product
 
00:42:59.779 --> 00:42:59.789 align:start position:0%
and raise inflation adjusted gross
 
00:43:01.219 --> 00:43:01.229 align:start position:0%
domestic product here's the Great
 
00:43:04.009 --> 00:43:04.019 align:start position:0%
Recession you can see the rise in the
 
00:43:06.049 --> 00:43:06.059 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate which is this orange
 
00:43:09.019 --> 00:43:09.029 align:start position:0%
line here and when we get to the current
 
00:43:11.449 --> 00:43:11.459 align:start position:0%
period and the projections you can see a
 
00:43:14.749 --> 00:43:14.759 align:start position:0%
massive drop in the Congressional Budget
 
00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:16.930 align:start position:0%
Office's projections for
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
the quarter that we're currently in
 
00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:20.470 align:start position:0%
quarter two of 2020 now again this is
 
00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:22.810 align:start position:0%
annualized so if this pace were to
 
00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:24.580 align:start position:0%
continue throughout the year what is
 
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
what would that do to the economy but
 
00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:28.740 align:start position:0%
it's a thirty seven point seven percent
 
00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:31.210 align:start position:0%
contraction on an annualized basis is
 
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:33.010 align:start position:0%
what they're projecting now for the
 
00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:35.410 align:start position:0%
senton for this quarter now it does come
 
00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:37.240 align:start position:0%
back there's growth returning for the
 
00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:38.230 align:start position:0%
rest of the year
 
00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:41.710 align:start position:0%
the CBO does assume that the distancing
 
00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:42.910 align:start position:0%
measures that we've put in place for
 
00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:45.250 align:start position:0%
public health reasons would be relaxed
 
00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:46.690 align:start position:0%
over time and people would engage with
 
00:43:49.110 --> 00:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
each other more in sort of a more
 
00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:51.970 align:start position:0%
gradual fashion but it does not you know
 
00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:53.740 align:start position:0%
in under this modelling it does not
 
00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:55.930 align:start position:0%
suggest that v-shape recovery in terms
 
00:43:57.930 --> 00:43:57.940 align:start position:0%
of snapping back to immediately where we
 
00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:01.750 align:start position:0%
were before this crisis hit you know the
 
00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:04.120 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate is projected to be and
 
00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:06.310 align:start position:0%
these new numbers are out 8.6 percent in
 
00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:09.640 align:start position:0%
the last quarter of 2021 consumer
 
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
spending will still be lower and the
 
00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:13.510 align:start position:0%
economy will still be slightly smaller
 
00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:16.630 align:start position:0%
in that last quarter of 2021 again based
 
00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
on these projections one thing I do want
 
00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:21.130 align:start position:0%
to note about these projections is that
 
00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
there's a large amount of uncertainty
 
00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:25.690 align:start position:0%
and because this is a crisis unlike any
 
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
other economic crisis that we've seen in
 
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
the modern era it's not to say that
 
00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:32.890 align:start position:0%
economists can't model it well but it's
 
00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:35.230 align:start position:0%
very difficult to project and the
 
00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:37.090 align:start position:0%
economic indicators that we rely on such
 
00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:39.100 align:start position:0%
as unemployment may be unreliable for
 
00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
some time because of the Swift changes
 
00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:43.300 align:start position:0%
and public health concerns are again
 
00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:45.130 align:start position:0%
paramount when thinking about what's
 
00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:47.020 align:start position:0%
going to happen to economic activity um
 
00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:49.060 align:start position:0%
the persistence of unemployment is the
 
00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:51.730 align:start position:0%
key key unknown how well government
 
00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:54.340 align:start position:0%
responses are it's supporting people and
 
00:44:56.850 --> 00:44:56.860 align:start position:0%
making sure that people have incomes and
 
00:44:59.010 --> 00:44:59.020 align:start position:0%
businesses stay intact so that there's
 
00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:01.570 align:start position:0%
businesses for people to spend money at
 
00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:03.250 align:start position:0%
and so there's customers for those
 
00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:05.410 align:start position:0%
businesses um you know the government
 
00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:06.670 align:start position:0%
responses and the health of the
 
00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:08.650 align:start position:0%
financial system especially after some
 
00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:11.410 align:start position:0%
of those responses have been have been
 
00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
curtailed as are important variables and
 
00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:15.820 align:start position:0%
again the ability of the economy to
 
00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:17.560 align:start position:0%
bounce back depends on whether people
 
00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
have money which is why I've spent a
 
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:21.010 align:start position:0%
fair bit of time talking about where the
 
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
last recession over the last recovery
 
00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:25.650 align:start position:0%
sort of left us and what portions of
 
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
what portions of the economy are or what
 
00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:30.580 align:start position:0%
portions of the population have only
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
certain amounts of resources because you
 
00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:34.420 align:start position:0%
know it's important for understanding
 
00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:37.030 align:start position:0%
our ability to sort of you know to
 
00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:39.940 align:start position:0%
bounce back and to recover quickly from
 
00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:42.730 align:start position:0%
this so again your fork the four key
 
00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:44.170 align:start position:0%
takeaways and I hope we've addressed all
 
00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:46.750 align:start position:0%
of these is the shock to the economy has
 
00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:47.350 align:start position:0%
been Swift
 
00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:49.900 align:start position:0%
the crisis has been disproportionate on
 
00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:52.570 align:start position:0%
for those who have the least ability to
 
00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:54.970 align:start position:0%
absorb the financial impacts and that
 
00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:57.310 align:start position:0%
has implications for the coming recovery
 
00:45:59.400 --> 00:45:59.410 align:start position:0%
the last recovery left a lot of people
 
00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:01.300 align:start position:0%
in a situation where it's not not
 
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily easy for them to withstand
 
00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:06.250 align:start position:0%
this this impact and projections for
 
00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:08.530 align:start position:0%
future economic growth are are uncertain
 
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:11.140 align:start position:0%
they suggest however it's going to be a
 
00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:13.120 align:start position:0%
little bit slower than that v-shaped
 
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:15.010 align:start position:0%
recovery that we're all hoping for um
 
00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:17.860 align:start position:0%
because of future growth being dependent
 
00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:20.890 align:start position:0%
on both public health and I'll add in
 
00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:22.330 align:start position:0%
the resources that individuals and
 
00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:24.100 align:start position:0%
families have available to engage in the
 
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
economy so with that I'm happy to take
 
00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:28.900 align:start position:0%
any questions given the the time with
 
00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:31.060 align:start position:0%
the chair alots and I also want to hear
 
00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Revenue
 
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
administration to I'm very interested in
 
00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:36.220 align:start position:0%
what they have to say okay we have
 
00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
represent of Schamberg asking a question
 
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:43.240 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am thank you madam chair can you
 
00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:45.250 align:start position:0%
hear me yeah
 
00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:48.940 align:start position:0%
fill in the material that the follow-up
 
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:52.210 align:start position:0%
material you sent to chairman all me in
 
00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:54.990 align:start position:0%
the abstract by Jason Furman of Harvard
 
00:46:57.650 --> 00:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
under the portions title background on
 
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
cyclical pressures on state budgets it
 
00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
mentions that a 1% point increase in
 
00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:06.250 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate that there is an
 
00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:09.700 align:start position:0%
increase has been associated with a 3.7
 
00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
percent reduction in state tax revenues
 
00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:15.820 align:start position:0%
per capita are you able to determine
 
00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:17.770 align:start position:0%
maybe from the New Hampshire
 
00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
unemployment figures available to you an
 
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
estimate in the dollar amount on new
 
00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:24.970 align:start position:0%
hampshire revenue impact per capita yeah
 
00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:28.270 align:start position:0%
so per capita I can't say and that that
 
00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:29.560 align:start position:0%
formula as well and it's an excellent
 
00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
question that formula as well is based
 
00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:35.410 align:start position:0%
on sort of the national aggregate what's
 
00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:36.940 align:start position:0%
you know what's the what are state
 
00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:39.190 align:start position:0%
revenues at across the nation right
 
00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:40.810 align:start position:0%
including California including Texas
 
00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:43.930 align:start position:0%
including Florida and that comparing
 
00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:44.190 align:start position:0%
including Florida and that comparing
that

00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:47.530 align:start position:0%
the national unemployment rate so if you
 
00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:48.460 align:start position:0%
know you wouldn't want to use the New
 
00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:49.630 align:start position:0%
Hampshire unemployment rate you could
 
00:47:51.329 --> 00:47:51.339 align:start position:0%
use the national unemployment rate if
 
00:47:54.359 --> 00:47:54.369 align:start position:0%
you did that and you know your again
 
00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:56.650 align:start position:0%
assuming that New Hampshire's New
 
00:47:58.859 --> 00:47:58.869 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's revenue system responds in
 
00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
the same way to unemployment as the
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
national as the state's revenue systems
 
00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:05.910 align:start position:0%
in aggregate around the country respond
 
00:48:08.569 --> 00:48:08.579 align:start position:0%
and that's that's probably not the case
 
00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:13.420 align:start position:0%
so - and to you know sort of to provide
 
00:48:15.839 --> 00:48:15.849 align:start position:0%
an example of that I performed that
 
00:48:17.819 --> 00:48:17.829 align:start position:0%
calculation you know if the national
 
00:48:19.079 --> 00:48:19.089 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate has changed this much
 
00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:21.670 align:start position:0%
in a rough way what does that do to our
 
00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:23.380 align:start position:0%
general and education trust fund tax
 
00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:26.230 align:start position:0%
revenue just tax revenue and it suggests
 
00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:29.890 align:start position:0%
that in New Hampshire that in fiscal
 
00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:32.980 align:start position:0%
2021 we'd see a roughly 700 million
 
00:48:35.579 --> 00:48:35.589 align:start position:0%
dollar impact I think that's too high I
 
00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:37.240 align:start position:0%
don't think it's going to be that big of
 
00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:40.210 align:start position:0%
an impact in fiscal 2021 so I would
 
00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:42.970 align:start position:0%
really defer to what what you're about
 
00:48:44.339 --> 00:48:44.349 align:start position:0%
to hear for the rest of the day in terms
 
00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:46.300 align:start position:0%
of from the state agencies because
 
00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:47.950 align:start position:0%
they're going to have a more sort of
 
00:48:49.859 --> 00:48:49.869 align:start position:0%
precise idea tailored to our revenue
 
00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:52.030 align:start position:0%
system exactly you know as to what that
 
00:48:53.069 --> 00:48:53.079 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:55.240 align:start position:0%
however I think that national modeling
 
00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
that we saw from the Center on Budget
 
00:48:59.040 --> 00:48:59.050 align:start position:0%
and Policy Priorities based on what the
 
00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:00.990 align:start position:0%
shortfalls that are projected would be
 
00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:03.430 align:start position:0%
based on that sort of national formula
 
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
just looking at the nation's tax dollars
 
00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:07.900 align:start position:0%
tax revenue dollars an aggregate as a
 
00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:10.780 align:start position:0%
whole I think that's still informative
 
00:49:12.319 --> 00:49:12.329 align:start position:0%
for the committee to be able to
 
00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:15.190 align:start position:0%
understand the potential magnitude of
 
00:49:18.089 --> 00:49:18.099 align:start position:0%
this relative to what we saw in the
 
00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:20.980 align:start position:0%
Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 and what
 
00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:23.980 align:start position:0%
we saw in the early 2000s the 2001
 
00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:26.470 align:start position:0%
recession I think it's still important
 
00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:29.020 align:start position:0%
context but but I wouldn't be able I
 
00:49:30.839 --> 00:49:30.849 align:start position:0%
wouldn't recommend sort of applying that
 
00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:33.970 align:start position:0%
formula directly because of the the way
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
that formula was produced to understand
 
00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:38.230 align:start position:0%
the national picture I hope that answers
 
00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
your question
 
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
looks like it thank you
 
00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
you agree that there are two general on
 
00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:52.890 align:start position:0%
differences between New Hampshire and
 
00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:56.200 align:start position:0%
other states and in general if you're
 
00:49:57.339 --> 00:49:57.349 align:start position:0%
just looking at it
 
00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:00.890 align:start position:0%
one of them is our mix of industries and
 
00:50:04.529 --> 00:50:04.539 align:start position:0%
size of industries and the other one is
 
00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:08.210 align:start position:0%
our tech system Texas in very different
 
00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:11.660 align:start position:0%
ways than most states do yeah so I would
 
00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:13.940 align:start position:0%
definitely agree on the second point in
 
00:50:15.489 --> 00:50:15.499 align:start position:0%
the first point I think that the mix of
 
00:50:18.609 --> 00:50:18.619 align:start position:0%
industries in terms of this crisis in
 
00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:21.170 align:start position:0%
the immediate effect I would say that
 
00:50:24.099 --> 00:50:24.109 align:start position:0%
our mix of industries does put us sort
 
00:50:26.109 --> 00:50:26.119 align:start position:0%
of it just a little bit of a
 
00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
disadvantage in terms of in terms of the
 
00:50:31.529 --> 00:50:31.539 align:start position:0%
you know leisure and hospitality
 
00:50:33.579 --> 00:50:33.589 align:start position:0%
accommodation food services those
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
industries retail being important
 
00:50:38.469 --> 00:50:38.479 align:start position:0%
sectors here that being said you know in
 
00:50:39.969 --> 00:50:39.979 align:start position:0%
terms of employments the mix of
 
00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:41.420 align:start position:0%
industries isn't dramatically different
 
00:50:43.479 --> 00:50:43.489 align:start position:0%
from a lot of other states but in terms
 
00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:46.670 align:start position:0%
of income generated you know there there
 
00:50:49.059 --> 00:50:49.069 align:start position:0%
are likely some differences there that
 
00:50:50.859 --> 00:50:50.869 align:start position:0%
that do affect new hampshire but
 
00:50:53.049 --> 00:50:53.059 align:start position:0%
certainly the the tax revenue system
 
00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:55.160 align:start position:0%
point when we're comparing to other
 
00:50:56.529 --> 00:50:56.539 align:start position:0%
states and looking at other states
 
00:50:58.029 --> 00:50:58.039 align:start position:0%
forecasts and other states have been
 
00:51:01.479 --> 00:51:01.489 align:start position:0%
forecasting revenue or many other states
 
00:51:03.849 --> 00:51:03.859 align:start position:0%
have made an attempt to forecast revenue
 
00:51:06.579 --> 00:51:06.589 align:start position:0%
it is important to remember that we we
 
00:51:08.259 --> 00:51:08.269 align:start position:0%

00:51:13.749 --> 00:51:13.759 align:start position:0%
country thank you

00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:23.270 align:start position:0%
Commissioner from the Department of
 
00:52:25.330 --> 00:52:25.340 align:start position:0%
Revenue and as Chris mentioned I have
 
00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:28.490 align:start position:0%
Melissa Rollins senior financial analyst
 
00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:30.200 align:start position:0%
and devin roderick financial analyst
 
00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:34.910 align:start position:0%
with me as well and i guess this is a
 
00:52:40.450 --> 00:52:40.460 align:start position:0%
question for Chris did you want us to
 
00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:43.670 align:start position:0%
have video as well and be able to share
 
00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
our screens or were you going to share
 
00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:48.020 align:start position:0%
our presentation or did we want to just
 
00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:51.140 align:start position:0%
walk through it it's really up to the
 
00:52:55.349 --> 00:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:59.500 --> 00:52:59.510 align:start position:0%
we'd like to see the presentation on the
 
00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:06.410 align:start position:0%
screen I'm not sure so I can either put
 
00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:08.690 align:start position:0%
it up or we could allow for Lindsey or
 
00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:12.890 align:start position:0%
one of her staff to control it I would
 
00:53:16.359 --> 00:53:16.369 align:start position:0%
like do you want to control it
 
00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:18.530 align:start position:0%
yourselfer yeah I think it would be
 
00:53:20.050 --> 00:53:20.060 align:start position:0%
helpful if Melissa Rollins could put
 
00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:22.310 align:start position:0%
that up because she and I are alternate
 
00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:24.230 align:start position:0%
back and forth so that you don't have to
 
00:53:26.099 --> 00:53:26.109 align:start position:0%
hear just one of us the whole time
 
00:53:31.450 --> 00:53:31.460 align:start position:0%
okay good so I think Melissa should have
 
00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:41.450 align:start position:0%
some ability to do that now it'll just
 
00:53:42.849 --> 00:53:42.859 align:start position:0%
take a moment we have to change the
 
00:53:48.339 --> 00:53:48.349 align:start position:0%
roles of I'm making Melissa a co-host
 
00:53:55.810 --> 00:53:55.820 align:start position:0%
now also at least on my screen everybody
 
00:53:58.060 --> 00:53:58.070 align:start position:0%
is showing up at the bottom on the right
 
00:54:02.349 --> 00:54:02.359 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we can do anything about
 
00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:07.570 align:start position:0%
moving whoever is speaking there you are
 
00:54:13.810 --> 00:54:13.820 align:start position:0%
so so I think is able to share her
 
00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:16.270 align:start position:0%
screen now mm-hmm
 
00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:21.170 align:start position:0%
screen now mm-hmm
yep

00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:24.370 align:start position:0%
are you able to share your screen yeah
 
00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:30.070 align:start position:0%
there we go see sort of let me just get
 
00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:34.570 align:start position:0%
here have the right right top side of a
 
00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:38.710 align:start position:0%
page on meals and rental stacks on my
 
00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:57.390 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:01.300 align:start position:0%
okay but we can see it and then make it
 
00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:06.900 align:start position:0%
fullscreen right now it's better
 
00:55:12.090 --> 00:55:12.100 align:start position:0%
good yes okay so good morning thank you
 
00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:14.950 align:start position:0%
for having us today as I mentioned I'll
 
00:55:17.310 --> 00:55:17.320 align:start position:0%
do a little introduction and then
 
00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:18.850 align:start position:0%
Melissa and I'll kind of alternate the
 
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
tax type so what we've prepared is
 
00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:25.540 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates for fiscal year 20 and
 
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
also for fiscal year 21 for the larger
 
00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:31.890 align:start position:0%
tax types that the Department of Revenue
 
00:55:35.790 --> 00:55:35.800 align:start position:0%
administers the updates that we made two
 
00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:39.640 align:start position:0%
estimates were done by adjusting fiscal
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
year 2020 plan based on currently
 
00:55:45.810 --> 00:55:45.820 align:start position:0%
available data either through April or
 
00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:47.860 align:start position:0%
May depending on the tax type obviously
 
00:55:50.490 --> 00:55:50.500 align:start position:0%
May is not complete yet but for some
 
00:55:52.530 --> 00:55:52.540 align:start position:0%
taxes the majority of the revenue comes
 
00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:54.370 align:start position:0%
in before the end of the month so we
 
00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:56.170 align:start position:0%
tried our best to work off of the most
 
00:55:59.420 --> 00:55:59.430 align:start position:0%
recently available information we
 
00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:01.540 align:start position:0%
updated the estimates based on the
 
00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:04.450 align:start position:0%
expectation and result of revenue prior
 
00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:07.150 align:start position:0%
to Co vid so revenues kind of through
 
00:56:10.170 --> 00:56:10.180 align:start position:0%
February as well as the expected revenue
 
00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
impact digging into effect the kovat
 
00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:15.400 align:start position:0%
pandemic and we did that on a monthly
 
00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:17.650 align:start position:0%
basis both for fiscal year twenty and
 
00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:19.870 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 21 and we'll show that
 
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:24.010 align:start position:0%
for each of the tax types consideration
 
00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:25.690 align:start position:0%
was also given to the different payment
 
00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:28.570 align:start position:0%
types the tax periods that are paid in
 
00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:30.799 align:start position:0%
any given month and how those
 
00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:33.380 align:start position:0%
payments may be affected before during
 
00:56:35.769 --> 00:56:35.779 align:start position:0%
or after the current stay at home
 
00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:37.880 align:start position:0%
restrictions that were operating under
 
00:56:40.269 --> 00:56:40.279 align:start position:0%
lastly full disclosure obviously these
 
00:56:42.249 --> 00:56:42.259 align:start position:0%
estimates are subject to change revenues
 
00:56:43.809 --> 00:56:43.819 align:start position:0%
coming in and more information is
 
00:56:46.319 --> 00:56:46.329 align:start position:0%
available on a daily basis
 
00:56:48.939 --> 00:56:48.949 align:start position:0%
I'll just also mention to start
 
00:56:51.099 --> 00:56:51.109 align:start position:0%
obviously these are unprecedented times
 
00:56:53.319 --> 00:56:53.329 align:start position:0%
we're in uncharted territory
 
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
we don't have anything really to go off
 
00:56:59.799 --> 00:56:59.809 align:start position:0%
of in terms of historic impacts are the
 
00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:01.910 align:start position:0%
historic results so we've done our best
 
00:57:04.809 --> 00:57:04.819 align:start position:0%
to kind of aggregate a lot of
 
00:57:06.729 --> 00:57:06.739 align:start position:0%
information that's available publicly
 
00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:09.170 align:start position:0%
also take into account obviously what
 
00:57:11.169 --> 00:57:11.179 align:start position:0%
we're seeing in revenue and kind of
 
00:57:13.329 --> 00:57:13.339 align:start position:0%
dissect everything and do our best to
 
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
provide an estimate of where we think
 
00:57:18.969 --> 00:57:18.979 align:start position:0%
think things are going so I'll have
 
00:57:21.370 --> 00:57:21.380 align:start position:0%
Melissa flip to the second page and
 
00:57:24.339 --> 00:57:24.349 align:start position:0%
we'll get started though starting with
 
00:57:27.279 --> 00:57:27.289 align:start position:0%
the meals and rentals tax the historical
 
00:57:29.799 --> 00:57:29.809 align:start position:0%
breakdown of this tax is 80 percent
 
00:57:34.029 --> 00:57:34.039 align:start position:0%
meals 17% from rooms and three percent
 
00:57:37.209 --> 00:57:37.219 align:start position:0%
for motor vehicles and that's important
 
00:57:38.529 --> 00:57:38.539 align:start position:0%
because we've actually made adjustments
 
00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:42.380 align:start position:0%
to revenue based on that breakdown
 
00:57:45.309 --> 00:57:45.319 align:start position:0%
because the impact to meals may be
 
00:57:47.949 --> 00:57:47.959 align:start position:0%
different than the impact to rooms and
 
00:57:49.179 --> 00:57:49.189 align:start position:0%
so that's the breakdown that we're
 
00:57:53.769 --> 00:57:53.779 align:start position:0%
operating under we adjusted revenues
 
00:57:56.529 --> 00:57:56.539 align:start position:0%
compared to plan by just under 1% to
 
00:57:59.620 --> 00:57:59.630 align:start position:0%
start even prior to the COBIT pandemic
 
00:58:01.299 --> 00:58:01.309 align:start position:0%
it looks like M&amp;R was going to come in
 
00:58:03.819 --> 00:58:03.829 align:start position:0%
about 1% under plan so we made that
 
00:58:06.489 --> 00:58:06.499 align:start position:0%
adjustment to start and then as I
 
00:58:08.439 --> 00:58:08.449 align:start position:0%
mentioned the M&amp;R components we
 
00:58:11.079 --> 00:58:11.089 align:start position:0%
considered them separately in every
 
00:58:13.059 --> 00:58:13.069 align:start position:0%
month and we adjusted based on different
 
00:58:17.019 --> 00:58:17.029 align:start position:0%
scenarios so for example in April the
 
00:58:19.839 --> 00:58:19.849 align:start position:0%
April actual month-over-month change was
 
00:58:24.009 --> 00:58:24.019 align:start position:0%
a reduction of 37 percent in meals 54
 
00:58:27.459 --> 00:58:27.469 align:start position:0%
percent in hotel or rooms and 21 percent
 
00:58:29.979 --> 00:58:29.989 align:start position:0%
in motor vehicles and now obviously
 
00:58:33.219 --> 00:58:33.229 align:start position:0%
April revenue is for March activity and
 
00:58:35.799 --> 00:58:35.809 align:start position:0%
we know March was when we started to see
 
00:58:38.109 --> 00:58:38.119 align:start position:0%
the impacts of kovat the month of March
 
00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:39.890 align:start position:0%
started out fairly normal and very
 
00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:42.410 align:start position:0%
quickly turned to not be so normal
 
00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:43.259 align:start position:0%
quickly turned to not be so normal
anymore

00:58:43.259 --> 00:58:43.269 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
00:58:46.529 --> 00:58:46.539 align:start position:0%
so that's the initial impact that we saw
 
00:58:49.739 --> 00:58:49.749 align:start position:0%
and then moving into May obviously the
 
00:58:51.449 --> 00:58:51.459 align:start position:0%
month is it closed but based on what
 
00:58:54.029 --> 00:58:54.039 align:start position:0%
we've seen to date we anticipate that
 
00:58:56.969 --> 00:58:56.979 align:start position:0%
the change from March will be fifty four
 
00:58:59.669 --> 00:58:59.679 align:start position:0%
percent reduction in meals 88 percent
 
00:59:01.919 --> 00:59:01.929 align:start position:0%
reduction in hotels or room rentals and
 
00:59:05.429 --> 00:59:05.439 align:start position:0%
75 percent reduction in motor vehicles
 
00:59:08.249 --> 00:59:08.259 align:start position:0%
and again this is May revenue which is
 
00:59:10.529 --> 00:59:10.539 align:start position:0%
based on April activity in April is
 
00:59:12.329 --> 00:59:12.339 align:start position:0%
really the height of the impact from
 
00:59:14.819 --> 00:59:14.829 align:start position:0%
kovat so that we're kind of viewing as
 
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
our low point now that we're into May
 
00:59:21.209 --> 00:59:21.219 align:start position:0%
which the revenue will be reported in
 
00:59:23.039 --> 00:59:23.049 align:start position:0%
June we're starting to see some
 
00:59:25.229 --> 00:59:25.239 align:start position:0%
restrictions lifted so hopefully the
 
00:59:27.329 --> 00:59:27.339 align:start position:0%
revenues will start to trend back up and
 
00:59:29.579 --> 00:59:29.589 align:start position:0%
so it's we're anticipating that May is
 
00:59:32.159 --> 00:59:32.169 align:start position:0%
kind of the low point of the revenues in
 
00:59:38.339 --> 00:59:38.349 align:start position:0%
terms of M&amp;R we actually could I just
 
00:59:42.059 --> 00:59:42.069 align:start position:0%
interject for a minute and when you do
 
00:59:45.239 --> 00:59:45.249 align:start position:0%
the adjustment in each of these you
 
00:59:47.489 --> 00:59:47.499 align:start position:0%
talked said at one point you were doing
 
00:59:49.559 --> 00:59:49.569 align:start position:0%
it through February but in another point
 
00:59:52.499 --> 00:59:52.509 align:start position:0%
it looked like it was was through the
 
00:59:55.859 --> 00:59:55.869 align:start position:0%
March data or the April data right so
 
00:59:59.189 --> 00:59:59.199 align:start position:0%
sorry I'll back up for just a second we
 
01:00:02.519 --> 01:00:02.529 align:start position:0%
first made an adjustment to what we
 
01:00:06.719 --> 01:00:06.729 align:start position:0%
thought 2020 actual was going to be
 
01:00:10.739 --> 01:00:10.749 align:start position:0%
without the impact from coal bed prior
 
01:00:14.999 --> 01:00:15.009 align:start position:0%
to kovat so through February activity
 
01:00:17.549 --> 01:00:17.559 align:start position:0%
that was reported in March it looked
 
01:00:19.519 --> 01:00:19.529 align:start position:0%
like M&amp;R was going to underperform
 
01:00:22.409 --> 01:00:22.419 align:start position:0%
regardless of kovat by about 1% as
 
01:00:25.139 --> 01:00:25.149 align:start position:0%
compared to plan but we first made that
 
01:00:27.359 --> 01:00:27.369 align:start position:0%
adjustment to kind of true up where we
 
01:00:30.419 --> 01:00:30.429 align:start position:0%
thought plan was going to come in then
 
01:00:34.019 --> 01:00:34.029 align:start position:0%
for May and June as melissa is showing
 
01:00:37.349 --> 01:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
on the next screen in May and June we
 
01:00:41.129 --> 01:00:41.139 align:start position:0%
did the actual impacts from Ovid because
 
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
all of our investments are based on
 
01:00:45.209 --> 01:00:45.219 align:start position:0%
impact from plan and so we wanted to
 
01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:46.630 align:start position:0%
make sure we were starting with an
 
01:00:50.519 --> 01:00:50.529 align:start position:0%
accurate plan number thank you you're
 
01:00:50.529 --> 01:00:51.769 align:start position:0%
accurate plan number thank you you're
welcome

01:00:51.769 --> 01:00:51.779 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
so excuse me so for the other taxes that
 
01:00:56.730 --> 01:00:56.740 align:start position:0%
are not that are reported
 
01:01:02.310 --> 01:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
the same month those or on those are
 
01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
through February to make the adjustment
 
01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:09.490 align:start position:0%
yes the adjustment to plan yes we would
 
01:01:15.830 --> 01:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
so one thing then I'll note before we
 
01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:22.510 align:start position:0%
look at the specific months is fiscal
 
01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:25.150 align:start position:0%
year to date were 8.6 percent below plan
 
01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
and we are 3.6 below
 
01:01:31.950 --> 01:01:31.960 align:start position:0%
percent below prior year obviously the
 
01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:34.450 align:start position:0%
impacts of COBIT include the selling of
 
01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:37.810 align:start position:0%
meals the renting of rooms motor vehicle
 
01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
rental and then low increased
 
01:01:42.930 --> 01:01:42.940 align:start position:0%
unemployment rates and reduced consumer
 
01:01:45.690 --> 01:01:45.700 align:start position:0%
confidence resulting in people having
 
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
less disposable income or ability or
 
01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
desire to kind of eat out we notice
 
01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:53.260 align:start position:0%
though based on the preliminary May
 
01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:56.410 align:start position:0%
filings that the revenue will actually
 
01:01:59.640 --> 01:01:59.650 align:start position:0%
be better than we initially expected and
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
that's due to the performance of chain
 
01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:04.150 align:start position:0%
restaurants and fast food we had
 
01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:07.830 align:start position:0%
adjusted the entire meals category
 
01:02:11.070 --> 01:02:11.080 align:start position:0%
downward initially based on the impacts
 
01:02:13.859 --> 01:02:13.869 align:start position:0%
of restaurants and then what we've seen
 
01:02:16.290 --> 01:02:16.300 align:start position:0%
as may revenue has come in is that there
 
01:02:18.599 --> 01:02:18.609 align:start position:0%
are some subcategories like I mentioned
 
01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:21.250 align:start position:0%
like fast food that are doing better
 
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
than a regular brick-and-mortar table
 
01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:26.380 align:start position:0%
service restaurant so we did make some
 
01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
adjustments there onto the next slide
 
01:02:33.599 --> 01:02:33.609 align:start position:0%
the chart at the top you will see
 
01:02:36.090 --> 01:02:36.100 align:start position:0%
estimated revenue adjustments by month
 
01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:38.490 align:start position:0%
and this is where we do the monthly
 
01:02:42.030 --> 01:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
adjustment to plan you'll see the
 
01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:46.030 align:start position:0%
reduction of 61 percent in May is our
 
01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:50.070 align:start position:0%
low point with reductions decreasing
 
01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:54.280 align:start position:0%
moving through fiscal year 21 where we
 
01:02:56.070 --> 01:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
anticipate that we will get very close
 
01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
to plan by the end of fiscal year 21 the
 
01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:02.710 align:start position:0%
second chart in the middle of the page
 
01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:05.470 align:start position:0%
is just showing April actual and then
 
01:03:08.310 --> 01:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
May and June estimates compared to the
 
01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:09.650 align:start position:0%
original plan
 
01:03:12.009 --> 01:03:12.019 align:start position:0%
our revised plan and then what that
 
01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:15.650 align:start position:0%
difference looks like and then the
 
01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:18.410 align:start position:0%
bottom chart is just the summary of we
 
01:03:21.099 --> 01:03:21.109 align:start position:0%
anticipate our reduction compared to
 
01:03:23.319 --> 01:03:23.329 align:start position:0%
plan of forty six point nine million for
 
01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:25.910 align:start position:0%
fiscal year twenty and sixty three point
 
01:03:28.539 --> 01:03:28.549 align:start position:0%
seven million in fiscal year twenty one
 
01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:32.210 align:start position:0%
for M&amp;R these charts you'll see for
 
01:03:34.299 --> 01:03:34.309 align:start position:0%
every tax type so we'll kind of repeat
 
01:03:37.239 --> 01:03:37.249 align:start position:0%
this same analysis so I can answer any
 
01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:38.930 align:start position:0%
questions on these at this point yes
 
01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:42.170 align:start position:0%
well we have a question from them
 
01:03:47.859 --> 01:03:47.869 align:start position:0%
surnames yeah I'm just wondering on the
 
01:03:50.799 --> 01:03:50.809 align:start position:0%
fiscal year twenty one you've got a
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
month by month there's a set of
 
01:03:58.239 --> 01:03:58.249 align:start position:0%
percentages against plan and what aware
 
01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:00.710 align:start position:0%
of the plan numbered can we see the plan
 
01:04:02.109 --> 01:04:02.119 align:start position:0%
number is because I don't think we've
 
01:04:04.049 --> 01:04:04.059 align:start position:0%
got a plan for fiscal year twenty one
 
01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:12.410 align:start position:0%
its month by month right so at this
 
01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:15.410 align:start position:0%
point there isn't an official playing
 
01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:17.900 align:start position:0%
produced by das that gets produced in
 
01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
produced by das that gets produced in
July

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:18.650 align:start position:0%
July
 
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
however we sort of did a mock plan on
 
01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:24.799 align:start position:0%
our end so we could adjust these month
 
01:04:26.799 --> 01:04:26.809 align:start position:0%
by month because we knew there would be
 
01:04:28.779 --> 01:04:28.789 align:start position:0%
a gradual change and a gradual increase
 
01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
so that's what those those adjustments
 
01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:34.670 align:start position:0%
are and adjustments to the revenue so we
 
01:04:36.009 --> 01:04:36.019 align:start position:0%
could end up with a final number for
 
01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:45.230 align:start position:0%
fiscal year twenty one have a mock have
 
01:04:53.799 --> 01:04:53.809 align:start position:0%
the mock plan numbers yes if you could
 
01:04:58.739 --> 01:04:58.749 align:start position:0%
just give those to us for the entire
 
01:05:01.769 --> 01:05:01.779 align:start position:0%
presentation later that would be good
 
01:05:07.829 --> 01:05:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:10.779 --> 01:05:10.789 align:start position:0%
listen up so what's your assumption
 
01:05:14.799 --> 01:05:14.809 align:start position:0%
about about restaurants being fully
 
01:05:18.489 --> 01:05:18.499 align:start position:0%
opened but you know ensure inside
 
01:05:19.839 --> 01:05:19.849 align:start position:0%
service you must have made some
 
01:05:22.110 --> 01:05:22.120 align:start position:0%
assumption to that
 
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
our general assumption is that the
 
01:05:28.830 --> 01:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
stay-at-home order starts to be lifted
 
01:05:30.810 --> 01:05:30.820 align:start position:0%
in a greater effort at the beginning of
 
01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:35.950 align:start position:0%
June and based on how we receive the
 
01:05:38.790 --> 01:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
information we have it by category of
 
01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:41.470 align:start position:0%
restaurant but we don't necessarily know
 
01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:44.470 align:start position:0%
if there's only indoor dining or indoor
 
01:05:46.650 --> 01:05:46.660 align:start position:0%
and outdoor dining so we had to just
 
01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:48.250 align:start position:0%
kind of make a general assumption and
 
01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:50.710 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at is basically a 25%
 
01:05:54.570 --> 01:05:54.580 align:start position:0%
improvement month over month to get that
 
01:05:57.690 --> 01:05:57.700 align:start position:0%
gradual slope back to normal obviously
 
01:06:01.410 --> 01:06:01.420 align:start position:0%
if things happen sooner and restaurants
 
01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:04.210 align:start position:0%
are fully open by the middle of June
 
01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
then that might change this trajectory
 
01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:09.970 align:start position:0%
or if things stay locked down longer
 
01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
that might change it as well but this
 
01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:14.830 align:start position:0%
kind of like I said assumes a June first
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit of relaxation and then a
 
01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
25% increase going back though so my
 
01:06:27.690 --> 01:06:27.700 align:start position:0%
sense is that those states for this to
 
01:06:31.350 --> 01:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
that once they indoor restaurants open I
 
01:06:34.010 --> 01:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
think people will come back very quickly
 
01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to rooms I think
 
01:06:39.630 --> 01:06:39.640 align:start position:0%
they'll come back but not as fast as
 
01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:45.430 align:start position:0%
dead yeah I agree that is probably what
 
01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:47.410 align:start position:0%
we will likely to see and that is one of
 
01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
the reasons why we kind of looked at
 
01:06:52.350 --> 01:06:52.360 align:start position:0%
each of those categories meals rooms and
 
01:06:54.270 --> 01:06:54.280 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle rentals separately because
 
01:06:56.250 --> 01:06:56.260 align:start position:0%
obviously motor vehicle rentals we need
 
01:06:59.520 --> 01:06:59.530 align:start position:0%
people to be traveling by air again in
 
01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:00.910 align:start position:0%
order to be showing up at the airport
 
01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:03.640 align:start position:0%
and looking to rent a car and so we did
 
01:07:05.610 --> 01:07:05.620 align:start position:0%
look at each of those individually and
 
01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:10.630 align:start position:0%
adjust them accordingly one other thing
 
01:07:13.710 --> 01:07:13.720 align:start position:0%
I will mention about M&amp;R because we've
 
01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:15.190 align:start position:0%
been getting a lot of questions about
 
01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:20.110 align:start position:0%
this is whether or not the reduction in
 
01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:23.170 align:start position:0%
M&amp;R revenues will impact the amounts
 
01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:24.970 align:start position:0%
that are distributed to the cities and
 
01:07:30.030 --> 01:07:30.040 align:start position:0%
towns each year and and I did a
 
01:07:32.790 --> 01:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
preliminary analysis and the short
 
01:07:36.059 --> 01:07:36.069 align:start position:0%
answer is we do not anticipate
 
01:07:38.370 --> 01:07:38.380 align:start position:0%
impact for fiscal year 22 what's
 
01:07:40.229 --> 01:07:40.239 align:start position:0%
distributed to the cities and towns
 
01:07:42.839 --> 01:07:42.849 align:start position:0%
because the total amount that is
 
01:07:45.689 --> 01:07:45.699 align:start position:0%
distributed has been capped for a number
 
01:07:47.699 --> 01:07:47.709 align:start position:0%
of years and that's done in the budget
 
01:07:52.410 --> 01:07:52.420 align:start position:0%
bill in HB 2 here and we are currently
 
01:07:55.199 --> 01:07:55.209 align:start position:0%
capped at a distribution of sixty eight
 
01:07:59.009 --> 01:07:59.019 align:start position:0%
point eight million and even with this
 
01:08:01.739 --> 01:08:01.749 align:start position:0%
reduction in revenue the formula would
 
01:08:04.019 --> 01:08:04.029 align:start position:0%
still produce an amount in excess of
 
01:08:07.759 --> 01:08:07.769 align:start position:0%
that cap so we will trigger the cap
 
01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:13.930 align:start position:0%
again this year so you're suggesting we
 
01:08:21.539 --> 01:08:21.549 align:start position:0%
might not trigger it in 21 in 21 based
 
01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:23.170 align:start position:0%
on these initial estimates I believe we
 
01:08:25.470 --> 01:08:25.480 align:start position:0%
will trigger it again but most of the
 
01:08:27.419 --> 01:08:27.429 align:start position:0%
conversation to date has been with the
 
01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:29.770 align:start position:0%
municipalities about the money that they
 
01:08:36.599 --> 01:08:36.609 align:start position:0%
received that's good news for them yeah
 
01:08:38.609 --> 01:08:38.619 align:start position:0%
we've got to pay the full amount to the
 
01:08:41.789 --> 01:08:41.799 align:start position:0%
school districts correct correct in the
 
01:08:50.039 --> 01:08:50.049 align:start position:0%
counties so in the in 21 you're assuming
 
01:08:56.339 --> 01:08:56.349 align:start position:0%
that by the by the fall of 21 that will
 
01:09:00.689 --> 01:09:00.699 align:start position:0%
beginning back to nearly what the plan
 
01:09:04.879 --> 01:09:04.889 align:start position:0%
was for meals and rooms correct
 
01:09:07.829 --> 01:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
correct again this assumes that on June
 
01:09:13.589 --> 01:09:13.599 align:start position:0%
perks including hotels cars yep that we
 
01:09:15.539 --> 01:09:15.549 align:start position:0%
that the things we'll be returning
 
01:09:18.990 --> 01:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
towards normal obviously time will tell
 
01:09:21.359 --> 01:09:21.369 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of speculation about
 
01:09:24.269 --> 01:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
what will happen but we did need to make
 
01:09:28.589 --> 01:09:28.599 align:start position:0%
an assumption about how the economy will
 
01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:30.190 align:start position:0%
be reopened and so that has been our
 
01:09:33.899 --> 01:09:33.909 align:start position:0%
operating assumption at this point right
 
01:09:39.059 --> 01:09:39.069 align:start position:0%
so major has a question thank you madam
 
01:09:43.109 --> 01:09:43.119 align:start position:0%
chairman Lindsay have you done an
 
01:09:45.930 --> 01:09:45.940 align:start position:0%
analysis based upon a second wave
 
01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
analysis based upon a second wave
possibly

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:47.690 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
01:09:49.930 --> 01:09:49.940 align:start position:0%
burnings let us say second wave starts
 
01:09:55.689 --> 01:09:55.699 align:start position:0%
in September we have not anticipated a
 
01:09:58.930 --> 01:09:58.940 align:start position:0%
second wave in this analysis but since
 
01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:02.510 align:start position:0%
we know now the impact on revenues in
 
01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:05.870 align:start position:0%
May which may was like I said April
 
01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
activity and that was really kind of a
 
01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:10.250 align:start position:0%
full lockdown and we will know the
 
01:10:13.930 --> 01:10:13.940 align:start position:0%
impact once we have June revenues of
 
01:10:15.729 --> 01:10:15.739 align:start position:0%
what the month of May looked like as
 
01:10:18.490 --> 01:10:18.500 align:start position:0%
things were relaxed now that we have
 
01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:21.530 align:start position:0%
those data points we can forecast or
 
01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:24.830 align:start position:0%
model what a resurgence would look like
 
01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:26.900 align:start position:0%
or additional lock downs would look like
 
01:10:29.170 --> 01:10:29.180 align:start position:0%
in the future because we'll have the
 
01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:32.870 align:start position:0%
data to know what the restrictions do to
 
01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:38.930 align:start position:0%
impact revenue so you've done that we
 
01:10:40.959 --> 01:10:40.969 align:start position:0%
haven't specifically done it but we have
 
01:10:44.590 --> 01:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
the data to do that if that's something
 
01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:46.910 align:start position:0%
if there's specific scenarios that you
 
01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:49.850 align:start position:0%
would like us to run in terms of a
 
01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:52.550 align:start position:0%
resurgence that is something that we
 
01:10:57.729 --> 01:10:57.739 align:start position:0%
could do biggest there right now is
 
01:10:59.979 --> 01:10:59.989 align:start position:0%
whether or not this might be a second
 
01:11:02.410 --> 01:11:02.420 align:start position:0%
wave second wave could happen as a
 
01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:04.790 align:start position:0%
result of the way that we're opening
 
01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:05.630 align:start position:0%
things now
 
01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
and we don't know should be prepared
 
01:11:11.950 --> 01:11:11.960 align:start position:0%
yeah estimates if there is a second wave
 
01:11:20.459 --> 01:11:20.469 align:start position:0%
so sure right so you also don't know
 
01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:23.330 align:start position:0%
whether we're going to be better
 
01:11:26.350 --> 01:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
prepared for a second wave in terms of
 
01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:29.150 align:start position:0%
how we handle it and handle it
 
01:11:31.930 --> 01:11:31.940 align:start position:0%
differently than we handled it before
 
01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:34.910 align:start position:0%
and you haven't got the June data we're
 
01:11:37.479 --> 01:11:37.489 align:start position:0%
talking about it yet so right so if that
 
01:11:39.450 --> 01:11:39.460 align:start position:0%
is a good point when we once we have May
 
01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:41.510 align:start position:0%
information which is really like I said
 
01:11:43.870 --> 01:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
a worst-case scenario and then once we
 
01:11:46.959 --> 01:11:46.969 align:start position:0%
have June that is a slightly improved
 
01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:50.120 align:start position:0%
and the Mott the stay-at-home 2.0 the
 
01:11:53.229 --> 01:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
modified order we can then use those two
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
data points to say if we have a
 
01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:57.850 align:start position:0%
resurgence in the fall and we lock down
 
01:12:00.299 --> 01:12:00.309 align:start position:0%
fully for a month or fully
 
01:12:02.639 --> 01:12:02.649 align:start position:0%
two months or if we partially restrict
 
01:12:04.799 --> 01:12:04.809 align:start position:0%
for a couple months we have the data now
 
01:12:08.399 --> 01:12:08.409 align:start position:0%
to know what that would look like thank
 
01:12:10.319 --> 01:12:10.329 align:start position:0%
you we've got oh we've got three hands
 
01:12:10.329 --> 01:12:10.709 align:start position:0%
you we've got oh we've got three hands
now

01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:12:14.939 --> 01:12:14.949 align:start position:0%
rapture sounds worse thank you see that
 
01:12:16.349 --> 01:12:16.359 align:start position:0%
I'm unmuted
 
01:12:19.709 --> 01:12:19.719 align:start position:0%
I appreciate representative of Brahmas
 
01:12:22.079 --> 01:12:22.089 align:start position:0%
optimism but I'm very concerned about
 
01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:24.550 align:start position:0%
the restaurants I know some people have
 
01:12:27.209 --> 01:12:27.219 align:start position:0%
less money some restaurants are not
 
01:12:29.609 --> 01:12:29.619 align:start position:0%
going to reopen and people in the
 
01:12:31.319 --> 01:12:31.329 align:start position:0%
at-risk group whether we say they're
 
01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:34.030 align:start position:0%
over 70 whatever should not be eating in
 
01:12:37.559 --> 01:12:37.569 align:start position:0%
crowded restaurants at all so you know I
 
01:12:39.899 --> 01:12:39.909 align:start position:0%
sort of like the approach you took but
 
01:12:41.609 --> 01:12:41.619 align:start position:0%
it's hard for me to say any we'll see
 
01:12:43.979 --> 01:12:43.989 align:start position:0%
anyway restaurants can bounce back
 
01:12:46.799 --> 01:12:46.809 align:start position:0%
quickly I have a 90 year old mother our
 
01:12:49.079 --> 01:12:49.089 align:start position:0%
whole family's being told not to eat in
 
01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
restaurants at this time sure so I think
 
01:12:56.459 --> 01:12:56.469 align:start position:0%
like I said our operating assumption
 
01:12:59.909 --> 01:12:59.919 align:start position:0%
here was a 25% kind of improvement
 
01:13:02.609 --> 01:13:02.619 align:start position:0%
month-over-month which hopefully kind of
 
01:13:05.729 --> 01:13:05.739 align:start position:0%
strikes a balance between those that do
 
01:13:08.729 --> 01:13:08.739 align:start position:0%
want to get back into restaurants versus
 
01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:12.550 align:start position:0%
those that will be remain out of
 
01:13:14.609 --> 01:13:14.619 align:start position:0%
restaurants for a variety of reasons
 
01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:17.530 align:start position:0%
also something else to consider as well
 
01:13:19.169 --> 01:13:19.179 align:start position:0%
as it's probably some period of time
 
01:13:21.029 --> 01:13:21.039 align:start position:0%
before restaurants are back to full
 
01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:23.530 align:start position:0%
capacity even if they're able to have
 
01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:26.050 align:start position:0%
indoor dining it's likely that at least
 
01:13:28.079 --> 01:13:28.089 align:start position:0%
to start they'll need to operate at a
 
01:13:30.899 --> 01:13:30.909 align:start position:0%
reduced capacity so again this analysis
 
01:13:32.399 --> 01:13:32.409 align:start position:0%
kind of takes all of that into
 
01:13:35.179 --> 01:13:35.189 align:start position:0%
consideration with that periodic
 
01:13:38.299 --> 01:13:38.309 align:start position:0%
increase in the month-over-month
 
01:13:44.159 --> 01:13:44.169 align:start position:0%
reduction in revenue thank you very soon
 
01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:48.280 align:start position:0%
if a meme says a question again yeah
 
01:13:55.319 --> 01:13:55.329 align:start position:0%
again sorry yeah I just wanted to second
 
01:13:56.399 --> 01:13:56.409 align:start position:0%
if you will
 
01:14:00.029 --> 01:14:00.039 align:start position:0%
representative majors question about a
 
01:14:03.479 --> 01:14:03.489 align:start position:0%
resurgence and suggestion that it would
 
01:14:09.599 --> 01:14:09.609 align:start position:0%
be helpful to us and more broadly to try
 
01:14:13.589 --> 01:14:13.599 align:start position:0%
to reject out revenues
 
01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:18.070 align:start position:0%
with the assumption of a resurgence to
 
01:14:21.979 --> 01:14:21.989 align:start position:0%
use the word that was used a
 
01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:28.570 align:start position:0%
re-emergence of the of the virus sure
 
01:14:30.839 --> 01:14:30.849 align:start position:0%
and that's I'd like to see that if we
 
01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:32.710 align:start position:0%
could sure I think what would be helpful
 
01:14:36.149 --> 01:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
to us and if there are specific
 
01:14:39.209 --> 01:14:39.219 align:start position:0%
scenarios you'd like to see you know I
 
01:14:41.669 --> 01:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
don't want to say I'm not a public
 
01:14:43.050 --> 01:14:43.060 align:start position:0%
health expert I don't want to say when
 
01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:45.250 align:start position:0%
the resurgence will happen but if you
 
01:14:47.939 --> 01:14:47.949 align:start position:0%
wanted to give us some scenarios we can
 
01:14:50.669 --> 01:14:50.679 align:start position:0%
certainly run those through so if you
 
01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to see a resurgence with a
 
01:14:56.399 --> 01:14:56.409 align:start position:0%
partial lockdown starting in December or
 
01:14:59.629 --> 01:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
November we can definitely do that
 
01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:02.650 align:start position:0%
but I think it would be helpful to us if
 
01:15:05.310 --> 01:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
we had the parameters around when that
 
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
would happen just so that we're not the
 
01:15:10.319 --> 01:15:10.329 align:start position:0%
ones I'm saying when when and if a
 
01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:14.770 align:start position:0%
resurgence would occur I don't know how
 
01:15:18.899 --> 01:15:18.909 align:start position:0%
we do this but it seems to me that it
 
01:15:22.490 --> 01:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
would be reasonable to for the second
 
01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:27.730 align:start position:0%
number to assume the projectory that you
 
01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:31.270 align:start position:0%
have up to November and then then go
 
01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
back to the situation and was it May and
 
01:15:40.979 --> 01:15:40.989 align:start position:0%
come back down with a similar slope sure
 
01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:44.590 align:start position:0%
that's something that we can do and that
 
01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:49.030 align:start position:0%
would give us a highest loss possibility
 
01:15:51.959 --> 01:15:51.969 align:start position:0%
I think if we do that sure
 
01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:56.530 align:start position:0%
I'm representing with Brahmi yeah quick
 
01:15:58.530 --> 01:15:58.540 align:start position:0%
we get the revenue report just today
 
01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:01.270 align:start position:0%
from Chris it looks like we're 15 point
 
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
4 million down and wasn't room so you
 
01:16:06.419 --> 01:16:06.429 align:start position:0%
don't exist you'd normally don't get it
 
01:16:14.609 --> 01:16:14.619 align:start position:0%
was the last two days do we correct and
 
01:16:17.669 --> 01:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
representing nature thank you
 
01:16:23.399 --> 01:16:23.409 align:start position:0%
yeah I would like to see a another one
 
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
based upon September and the reason why
 
01:16:26.679 --> 01:16:26.689 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:16:29.589 --> 01:16:29.599 align:start position:0%
we're experimenting now we're opening up
 
01:16:32.589 --> 01:16:32.599 align:start position:0%
and then especially throughout the
 
01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:34.550 align:start position:0%
summer that's where people want to get
 
01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:38.150 align:start position:0%
yeah the horses so things something's
 
01:16:41.949 --> 01:16:41.959 align:start position:0%
going to happen within two weeks after
 
01:16:50.319 --> 01:16:50.329 align:start position:0%
this so look at September starting see
 
01:16:53.979 --> 01:16:53.989 align:start position:0%
that or we can do both a September
 
01:16:56.979 --> 01:16:56.989 align:start position:0%
resurgence and a November resurgence and
 
01:16:59.500 --> 01:16:59.510 align:start position:0%
if possible it may be helpful to wait to
 
01:17:02.049 --> 01:17:02.059 align:start position:0%
the middle of June so that we have June
 
01:17:04.449 --> 01:17:04.459 align:start position:0%
revenue to give us the start of that
 
01:17:10.679 --> 01:17:10.689 align:start position:0%
trajectory back up I think this may be
 
01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:15.070 align:start position:0%
its it'll be even more hypotheticals and
 
01:17:20.919 --> 01:17:20.929 align:start position:0%
then feasible if if we tried to do these
 
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
before we've got the June revenue right
 
01:17:30.959 --> 01:17:30.969 align:start position:0%
but I'm afraid of a triple double
 
01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:35.630 align:start position:0%
resurgence one one in August or
 
01:17:37.989 --> 01:17:37.999 align:start position:0%
September which would probably be
 
01:17:44.759 --> 01:17:44.769 align:start position:0%
smaller but then another one flu hits
 
01:17:47.409 --> 01:17:47.419 align:start position:0%
that the health people are worried about
 
01:17:47.419 --> 01:17:49.290 align:start position:0%
that the health people are worried about
most

01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:49.300 align:start position:0%
most
 
01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:53.030 align:start position:0%
so I think we've run out of questioners
 
01:17:55.989 --> 01:17:55.999 align:start position:0%
okay well we can move on to tobacco tax
 
01:18:03.609 --> 01:18:03.619 align:start position:0%
then all right tobacco tax this will be
 
01:18:05.259 --> 01:18:05.269 align:start position:0%
the same layout that Lindsay just went
 
01:18:08.439 --> 01:18:08.449 align:start position:0%
through for M&amp;R a little bit less to
 
01:18:12.909 --> 01:18:12.919 align:start position:0%
talk about with tobacco tax one one
 
01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:14.510 align:start position:0%
thing that we did find interesting is
 
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
that we saw a spike in March there was a
 
01:18:19.959 --> 01:18:19.969 align:start position:0%
50% increase in stamp sales are
 
01:18:28.239 --> 01:18:28.249 align:start position:0%
essentially stocking up for kovin 19 and
 
01:18:31.359 --> 01:18:31.369 align:start position:0%
with the stocking up in March we once we
 
01:18:34.179 --> 01:18:34.189 align:start position:0%
saw that was anticipated we kept a close
 
01:18:36.570 --> 01:18:36.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:42.350 align:start position:0%
April and May April we did see an
 
01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:44.810 align:start position:0%
increase which we had expected because
 
01:18:47.410 --> 01:18:47.420 align:start position:0%
if you remember tobacco stamps they're
 
01:18:51.010 --> 01:18:51.020 align:start position:0%
typically bought on the payment comes in
 
01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:56.530 align:start position:0%
the next month so April was a good month
 
01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
compared to plan it was about 35% ahead
 
01:19:02.439 --> 01:19:02.449 align:start position:0%
of plan and then we made an adjustment
 
01:19:05.709 --> 01:19:05.719 align:start position:0%
for me because as males come in we've
 
01:19:07.419 --> 01:19:07.429 align:start position:0%
been noticing and this is sort of what
 
01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:09.410 align:start position:0%
we anticipated that these stocking up
 
01:19:11.770 --> 01:19:11.780 align:start position:0%
are these extra purchases and purchasing
 
01:19:15.130 --> 01:19:15.140 align:start position:0%
of stem cells that occurred we're not
 
01:19:18.850 --> 01:19:18.860 align:start position:0%
all used up so again the industry saw
 
01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:21.410 align:start position:0%
this covin 19 coming they scooped up a
 
01:19:23.770 --> 01:19:23.780 align:start position:0%
bunch of a bunch of stamps in March and
 
01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:28.130 align:start position:0%
anticipation of some lock down they went
 
01:19:32.939 --> 01:19:32.949 align:start position:0%
through those stamps in April and then
 
01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:35.690 align:start position:0%
now we haven't seen as much stamp
 
01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:37.630 align:start position:0%
purchase and will end up being down
 
01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:41.030 align:start position:0%
slightly we adjusted it down slightly 5%
 
01:19:45.550 --> 01:19:45.560 align:start position:0%
but then we anticipate that analyzing in
 
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:49.010 align:start position:0%
June and if you see on the second on the
 
01:19:50.410 --> 01:19:50.420 align:start position:0%
chart their estimated revenue
 
01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:53.630 align:start position:0%
adjustments by month we didn't make any
 
01:19:56.910 --> 01:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
adjustment to tobacco for fiscal year 21
 
01:20:04.090 --> 01:20:04.100 align:start position:0%
partly in evidence that we've read in
 
01:20:05.770 --> 01:20:05.780 align:start position:0%
newspapers there's some interests that
 
01:20:07.150 --> 01:20:07.160 align:start position:0%
have been out there expecting the
 
01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:09.050 align:start position:0%
cigarettes will perform well stressful
 
01:20:09.050 --> 01:20:09.850 align:start position:0%
cigarettes will perform well stressful
environment

01:20:09.850 --> 01:20:09.860 align:start position:0%
environment
 
01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:13.090 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been any signs of people
 
01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:17.690 align:start position:0%
decreasing usage above normal and there
 
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't anything pleading to us that
 
01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:22.310 align:start position:0%
there would be a loss further than that
 
01:20:24.189 --> 01:20:24.199 align:start position:0%
we had already anticipated for fiscal
 
01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:26.210 align:start position:0%
year 21 so we didn't make any
 
01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:32.210 align:start position:0%
adjustments to to fiscal year 21 you
 
01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:34.850 align:start position:0%
have been keeping an eye on it we have
 
01:20:37.810 --> 01:20:37.820 align:start position:0%
looked at these cigarettes to see if
 
01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:39.350 align:start position:0%
there's anything that has increased
 
01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:43.670 align:start position:0%
their cigarettes having they haven't
 
01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:45.350 align:start position:0%
taken in a huge market of course we're
 
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:48.010 align:start position:0%
just getting ramped up with that still
 
01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:51.430 align:start position:0%
but they're not they're not excelling at
 
01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:52.870 align:start position:0%
a fast rate that we would think there
 
01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:54.730 align:start position:0%
would be any increase there are they
 
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
decreasing at a rate that we feel like
 
01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:01.690 align:start position:0%
they would adjust revenues so for fiscal
 
01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:04.390 align:start position:0%
year to date or 2.9 percent ahead of
 
01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:08.290 align:start position:0%
plan for tobacco and compared to prior
 
01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:11.850 align:start position:0%
year were four percent ahead of plan
 
01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:16.690 align:start position:0%
again you can see that looking at April
 
01:21:20.850 --> 01:21:20.860 align:start position:0%
we were ahead may we predicted the 5%
 
01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:27.310 align:start position:0%
decrease June we predict the where plan
 
01:21:30.479 --> 01:21:30.489 align:start position:0%
was for difference from April to June of
 
01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
an increase of 9% you just see that I
 
01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
think a question came in from
 
01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham oh yes sure
 
01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:49.090 align:start position:0%
that just the question I had is a lot of
 
01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:53.110 align:start position:0%
the national figures say that a lot of
 
01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:55.090 align:start position:0%
Lauterbach tobacco Stickles go to
 
01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:00.370 align:start position:0%
out-of-state people you know it was it
 
01:22:02.970 --> 01:22:02.980 align:start position:0%
was being considered that with fewer
 
01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
travelers to new hampshire because of
 
01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:07.450 align:start position:0%
the virus we may have fewer tobacco
 
01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
sales is is there any indication of why
 
01:22:17.310 --> 01:22:17.320 align:start position:0%
that was that assumption is incorrect or
 
01:22:19.770 --> 01:22:19.780 align:start position:0%
do you have any comment on that one way
 
01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
or the other or more the sales going in
 
01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:27.610 align:start position:0%
state if you know or is you know is
 
01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:30.670 align:start position:0%
breath perhaps the national reputation
 
01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:33.210 align:start position:0%
of us being an exporter of tobacco
 
01:22:33.210 --> 01:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
of us being an exporter of tobacco
unfounded

01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:34.390 align:start position:0%
unfounded
 
01:22:39.150 --> 01:22:39.160 align:start position:0%
thanks actually the figures we don't
 
01:22:41.070 --> 01:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
keep track of the house stamps are sold
 
01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
whether they're sold in state or out of
 
01:22:49.050 --> 01:22:49.060 align:start position:0%
state anecdotally I think we are keeping
 
01:22:50.490 --> 01:22:50.500 align:start position:0%
an eye on as closely I think you'll
 
01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:54.130 align:start position:0%
remember we had spoken about it several
 
01:22:57.660 --> 01:22:57.670 align:start position:0%
months ago June 1st Massachusetts put a
 
01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:00.110 align:start position:0%
flavor band
 
01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:03.350 align:start position:0%
they're tobacco cigarettes Mahnomen film
 
01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:05.930 align:start position:0%
in which every cigarettes and loose
 
01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
tobacco and we might see a buck from
 
01:23:15.250 --> 01:23:15.260 align:start position:0%
that to your point representative string
 
01:23:18.459 --> 01:23:18.469 align:start position:0%
them depending on how cross-border sales
 
01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:20.930 align:start position:0%
if people are not coming over the border
 
01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:24.290 align:start position:0%
to to purchase those and may not be a
 
01:23:26.050 --> 01:23:26.060 align:start position:0%
big spike and we're sort of keeping an
 
01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:27.560 align:start position:0%
eye on that at this point I don't think
 
01:23:30.430 --> 01:23:30.440 align:start position:0%
we have anything showing us any signs
 
01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:32.570 align:start position:0%
showing us that we're seeing a decrease
 
01:23:34.689 --> 01:23:34.699 align:start position:0%
based on cross-border sales
 
01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
I think the decrease really in May is
 
01:23:41.470 --> 01:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
based on that stocking up of stocking up
 
01:23:45.310 --> 01:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
of stamps in March I think June will be
 
01:23:53.890 --> 01:23:53.900 align:start position:0%
more telling in that area yes we have a
 
01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:57.530 align:start position:0%
situation where a lot of the large
 
01:24:03.939 --> 01:24:03.949 align:start position:0%
tobacco stores are in our border on the
 
01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:06.050 align:start position:0%
southern border and on the western
 
01:24:09.490 --> 01:24:09.500 align:start position:0%
border we have a big store tucked away
 
01:24:12.939 --> 01:24:12.949 align:start position:0%
in Lebanon that sells that and beer to
 
01:24:17.670 --> 01:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
the Vermonters and despite the Vermont
 
01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:20.510 align:start position:0%
but said that people who were working
 
01:24:22.479 --> 01:24:22.489 align:start position:0%
could not come across the border to work
 
01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:26.270 align:start position:0%
but people who were buying could come to
 
01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:28.190 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I haven't figured that one
 
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
out yet and I know that a lot of
 
01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts people have been coming to
 
01:24:37.930 --> 01:24:37.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire still despite the stay at
 
01:24:43.890 --> 01:24:43.900 align:start position:0%
home owners do you have any way to
 
01:24:47.439 --> 01:24:47.449 align:start position:0%
separate out the traditional cigarettes
 
01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:51.730 align:start position:0%
from from the other tobacco products
 
01:24:54.310 --> 01:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
after those are reported separately so
 
01:24:56.530 --> 01:24:56.540 align:start position:0%
cigarettes are reported based on stamp
 
01:25:00.370 --> 01:25:00.380 align:start position:0%
sales and other tobacco products OTP
 
01:25:04.890 --> 01:25:04.900 align:start position:0%
which is least tobacco pipe tobacco
 
01:25:07.330 --> 01:25:07.340 align:start position:0%
cigarettes those are reported on on a
 
01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:12.230 align:start position:0%
separate separate return yes
 
01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:15.590 align:start position:0%
is that it returns of the tobacco
 
01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:18.710 align:start position:0%
settlement how many cigarettes were
 
01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
selling is going to be important to next
 
01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:26.570 align:start position:0%
year's tobacco settlement money and I
 
01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:28.910 align:start position:0%
was wondering if you could give us the
 
01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:32.210 align:start position:0%
breakdown for your estimate for what
 
01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:35.750 align:start position:0%
cigarettes alone would be yeah I think
 
01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:37.430 align:start position:0%
and this is just going off the top of my
 
01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:39.890 align:start position:0%
head the bulk of the bulk of the sales
 
01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:43.910 align:start position:0%
have been I think it's about ninety six
 
01:25:46.450 --> 01:25:46.460 align:start position:0%
percent is cigarettes and four percent
 
01:25:49.210 --> 01:25:49.220 align:start position:0%
is other tobacco products the other
 
01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:53.630 align:start position:0%
tobacco products has been gaming gaming
 
01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:57.290 align:start position:0%
some speed over the last few years but
 
01:25:59.320 --> 01:25:59.330 align:start position:0%
but not enough I believe it used to be
 
01:26:00.729 --> 01:26:00.739 align:start position:0%
like two percent then we got three
 
01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:02.810 align:start position:0%
percent then it's up to a person I'm
 
01:26:04.690 --> 01:26:04.700 align:start position:0%
sure we'll continue to increase would
 
01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:06.710 align:start position:0%
the taxing on e-cigarettes because that
 
01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:10.370 align:start position:0%
falls under the OTP category but there's
 
01:26:12.430 --> 01:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
still obviously the the bulk of the
 
01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:16.430 align:start position:0%
sales are our cigarettes and then
 
01:26:17.770 --> 01:26:17.780 align:start position:0%
represent our string and I just also
 
01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:21.350 align:start position:0%
wanted to note that I believe it was in
 
01:26:24.340 --> 01:26:24.350 align:start position:0%
revenue I mean the Republican caucus
 
01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:26.330 align:start position:0%
where you had the Chamber of Commerce
 
01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:32.390 align:start position:0%
and the chain of Commerce women on in
 
01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:35.450 align:start position:0%
the Hampton area did say and this was a
 
01:26:38.410 --> 01:26:38.420 align:start position:0%
few weeks back that traffic was still
 
01:26:40.090 --> 01:26:40.100 align:start position:0%
pretty heavy and was mining the
 
01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:42.650 align:start position:0%
boulevard of Hampton Beach for with
 
01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:45.110 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts plates so if that's any
 
01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
indication of people still coming up we
 
01:26:51.970 --> 01:26:51.980 align:start position:0%
might be able to use that that evidence
 
01:26:53.410 --> 01:26:53.420 align:start position:0%
a little bit that people are still
 
01:26:56.530 --> 01:26:56.540 align:start position:0%
crossing the borders and the sale and
 
01:26:59.020 --> 01:26:59.030 align:start position:0%
the Chamber of Commerce person was quite
 
01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
eloquent about that being a mainstay of
 
01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:05.870 align:start position:0%
their economy there as well as a source
 
01:27:09.970 --> 01:27:09.980 align:start position:0%
of code in the area when when they came
 
01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:16.730 align:start position:0%
to our caucus so our episode of a
 
01:27:20.350 --> 01:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
brownie has a question but I would just
 
01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
climb my major two weekends ago and
 
01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:25.290 align:start position:0%
laughter cause with Massachusetts yeah
 
01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:28.290 align:start position:0%
that's not what not my question so
 
01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:29.730 align:start position:0%
that's why make sure we had the vaping
 
01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
hearings we had we heard from
 
01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:32.790 align:start position:0%
convenience stores that menthol
 
01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:34.530 align:start position:0%
cigarettes will be banned in mass is
 
01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
that what you were talking about yes
 
01:27:40.189 --> 01:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
and they anticipated that they'd be will
 
01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:43.770 align:start position:0%
increase in sales here so when you when
 
01:27:45.709 --> 01:27:45.719 align:start position:0%
you did your estimates going forward
 
01:27:48.110 --> 01:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
back to work center items point about
 
01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
maybe there would be some I would
 
01:27:52.970 --> 01:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
anticipate a little bit of a loss of
 
01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:56.790 align:start position:0%
sales to cross border but I think that's
 
01:27:58.459 --> 01:27:58.469 align:start position:0%
gonna be offset my sense it will be
 
01:28:02.030 --> 01:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
offset by the menthol cigarette sales is
 
01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:05.070 align:start position:0%
that safe to say I think it's fair at
 
01:28:07.459 --> 01:28:07.469 align:start position:0%
this point I believe it's June first
 
01:28:09.439 --> 01:28:09.449 align:start position:0%
that that menthol being goes into effect
 
01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts so we'll we'll see
 
01:28:13.870 --> 01:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
that coming up here shortly
 
01:28:16.490 --> 01:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
but I think that's a fair that's a fair
 
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
statement that they could offset each
 
01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:31.910 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:34.189 --> 01:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
like I said in March we saw some
 
01:28:40.490 --> 01:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
stocking up on stamps and who knows if
 
01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:41.850 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts they're doing the same
 
01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
thing at this point so we may not see
 
01:28:45.890 --> 01:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
that revenue right away right away if
 
01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
they are stocking up before those
 
01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:50.850 align:start position:0%
products are no longer on the shelves or
 
01:28:52.490 --> 01:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
if there's any black market activity
 
01:28:58.370 --> 01:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
that goes on at that point another thing
 
01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:00.750 align:start position:0%
that we don't know is how many of the
 
01:29:03.229 --> 01:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
people that that would consider coming
 
01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:05.070 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire have already been
 
01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
coming to New Hampshire that's that's
 
01:29:14.209 --> 01:29:14.219 align:start position:0%
there okay okay I don't see any further
 
01:29:16.490 --> 01:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
questions on this one so maybe we can go
 
01:29:21.130 --> 01:29:21.140 align:start position:0%
on to the interested in the dense tax
 
01:29:25.490 --> 01:29:25.500 align:start position:0%
okay so with the interest in dividends
 
01:29:27.709 --> 01:29:27.719 align:start position:0%
tax I'll try to go through this slowly
 
01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
we took a lot of things into account
 
01:29:31.729 --> 01:29:31.739 align:start position:0%
when coming up with these additional
 
01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:33.810 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates so just to start
 
01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:35.230 align:start position:0%
because we often
 
01:29:36.930 --> 01:29:36.940 align:start position:0%
talk about this we wanted to put these
 
01:29:39.510 --> 01:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
numbers up front the breakdown for the
 
01:29:42.959 --> 01:29:42.969 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tags 41% for tax
 
01:29:48.209 --> 01:29:48.219 align:start position:0%
year 17 was dividend income 35% were
 
01:29:51.870 --> 01:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
distributions 15% was interest income
 
01:29:54.990 --> 01:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
and then 9% was federally tax-exempt
 
01:29:57.540 --> 01:29:57.550 align:start position:0%
interest income so I know when we talk
 
01:29:59.100 --> 01:29:59.110 align:start position:0%
about interest in dividends interest
 
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
being the first word I think that's
 
01:30:03.090 --> 01:30:03.100 align:start position:0%
often where our mind goes but when you
 
01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:04.510 align:start position:0%
look at the breakdown from the tax
 
01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:07.480 align:start position:0%
interest income is really only 15% with
 
01:30:09.510 --> 01:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
dividends and distributions on being the
 
01:30:11.970 --> 01:30:11.980 align:start position:0%
vast majority so just putting that out
 
01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
there to start
 
01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
so the first adjustment that we made was
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
we reduced the fiscal year 20 plan by 4%
 
01:30:26.490 --> 01:30:26.500 align:start position:0%
and that's what I was talking to earlier
 
01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:30.370 align:start position:0%
about where we felt fiscal year 20 with
 
01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
land without koban so it was kind of a
 
01:30:34.890 --> 01:30:34.900 align:start position:0%
right sizing of the plan so first we did
 
01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:41.050 align:start position:0%
the 4% reduction then we looked at the
 
01:30:44.750 --> 01:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
individual payment types that we receive
 
01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:47.590 align:start position:0%
that we receive in any given year so
 
01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:50.890 align:start position:0%
estimates extensions returns and tax
 
01:30:55.470 --> 01:30:55.480 align:start position:0%
notices and we looked at when those
 
01:30:58.320 --> 01:30:58.330 align:start position:0%
amounts typically come in and what we
 
01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
thought the adjustment would be so the
 
01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:03.790 align:start position:0%
reason for doing that is obviously a
 
01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:08.410 align:start position:0%
return that we receive in April is for
 
01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:12.190 align:start position:0%
the prior calendar year but an estimate
 
01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:14.890 align:start position:0%
that we receive in April is for the
 
01:31:16.890 --> 01:31:16.900 align:start position:0%
first three months of the current year
 
01:31:20.250 --> 01:31:20.260 align:start position:0%
and so it's important to understand the
 
01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:22.210 align:start position:0%
different payment types and the time
 
01:31:25.169 --> 01:31:25.179 align:start position:0%
period that they are reflecting because
 
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
obviously this pandemic while we all may
 
01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:30.610 align:start position:0%
have known it was coming to some extent
 
01:31:32.580 --> 01:31:32.590 align:start position:0%
it did kind of come very quickly and the
 
01:31:34.860 --> 01:31:34.870 align:start position:0%
impact happened quickly and so we need
 
01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:36.850 align:start position:0%
to understand the timing or the
 
01:31:38.729 --> 01:31:38.739 align:start position:0%
underlying activity for which the
 
01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:40.870 align:start position:0%
payments that we're receiving that at
 
01:31:42.870 --> 01:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
what the time period is of that activity
 
01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
so that we can appropriately adjust our
 
01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
so that we can appropriately adjust our
estimates

01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:48.370 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
01:31:52.530 --> 01:31:52.540 align:start position:0%
the other thing to note with IND is that
 
01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:55.510 align:start position:0%
we did allow business individuals and
 
01:31:58.040 --> 01:31:58.050 align:start position:0%
businesses that pay this tax to
 
01:32:00.990 --> 01:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
essentially defer their payment that was
 
01:32:03.690 --> 01:32:03.700 align:start position:0%
due in April of their return payment in
 
01:32:06.030 --> 01:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
their estimate payment defer that
 
01:32:07.890 --> 01:32:07.900 align:start position:0%
payment without penalties and interest
 
01:32:12.990 --> 01:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
until June 15th so what that ultimately
 
01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:16.650 align:start position:0%
means is that we saw April underperform
 
01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:20.230 align:start position:0%
significantly but we will see May and
 
01:32:24.090 --> 01:32:24.100 align:start position:0%
June over perform compared to plan as
 
01:32:27.930 --> 01:32:27.940 align:start position:0%
that revenue moves from April into May
 
01:32:35.370 --> 01:32:35.380 align:start position:0%
and June based on what we saw in April
 
01:32:40.830 --> 01:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
we anticipate that the amount moving
 
01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:43.870 align:start position:0%
from April to June will be about 90
 
01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:45.790 align:start position:0%
percent 98 percent of what we
 
01:32:47.970 --> 01:32:47.980 align:start position:0%
anticipated in April we are gonna see a
 
01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:51.850 align:start position:0%
reduction in June it won't just be a
 
01:32:54.810 --> 01:32:54.820 align:start position:0%
straight move from April to June and
 
01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:57.010 align:start position:0%
that's most likely due to people's
 
01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:00.970 align:start position:0%
ability to pay obviously a lot of people
 
01:33:03.510 --> 01:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
even if they have interest in dividend
 
01:33:05.790 --> 01:33:05.800 align:start position:0%
income are facing financial hardships
 
01:33:08.220 --> 01:33:08.230 align:start position:0%
and so people's ability to pay is
 
01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:11.530 align:start position:0%
slightly reduced so we've adjusted the
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
estimate of the move from able to June
 
01:33:20.910 --> 01:33:20.920 align:start position:0%
down by 2% so flipping to the next slide
 
01:33:29.250 --> 01:33:29.260 align:start position:0%
Melissa could could we look at there's
 
01:33:32.910 --> 01:33:32.920 align:start position:0%
one I'm trying to find it on this this
 
01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:34.930 align:start position:0%
page seems to be different than the one
 
01:33:36.810 --> 01:33:36.820 align:start position:0%
we were sent two days ago the previous
 
01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:42.570 align:start position:0%
page however on at one point you
 
01:33:45.090 --> 01:33:45.100 align:start position:0%
mentioned on it and you may not have it
 
01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:49.810 align:start position:0%
there again that you are assuming that
 
01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:53.530 align:start position:0%
all the payers that didn't pay in April
 
01:33:58.939 --> 01:33:58.949 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:04.590 align:start position:0%
and I was wondering how you whether you
 
01:34:07.969 --> 01:34:07.979 align:start position:0%
had tried to look at for the largest
 
01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
payers we've been talking about looking
 
01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:13.670 align:start position:0%
at the largest payers to find out
 
01:34:17.719 --> 01:34:17.729 align:start position:0%
whether they may have gone out of
 
01:34:19.930 --> 01:34:19.940 align:start position:0%
business or something like that
 
01:34:22.430 --> 01:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
well her interest and dividends whether
 
01:34:24.739 --> 01:34:24.749 align:start position:0%
or not they were even for business
 
01:34:25.699 --> 01:34:25.709 align:start position:0%
whether or not they've gone out of
 
01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:28.170 align:start position:0%
business does not necessarily mean that
 
01:34:29.959 --> 01:34:29.969 align:start position:0%
they don't have an obligation because
 
01:34:32.089 --> 01:34:32.099 align:start position:0%
again when we're looking at especially
 
01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:34.590 align:start position:0%
in with respect to returns is activity
 
01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:43.050 align:start position:0%
that ended in December so for the most
 
01:34:46.370 --> 01:34:46.380 align:start position:0%
part like I said we saw those that did
 
01:34:49.879 --> 01:34:49.889 align:start position:0%
pay in April they paid very similar to
 
01:34:51.919 --> 01:34:51.929 align:start position:0%
what they paid in the prior year if not
 
01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:54.570 align:start position:0%
a little bit more in some cases and so
 
01:34:58.359 --> 01:34:58.369 align:start position:0%
we're not anticipating a drastic change
 
01:35:01.879 --> 01:35:01.889 align:start position:0%
in what in the revenue that will receive
 
01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:04.110 align:start position:0%
in that has been shifted to June
 
01:35:06.410 --> 01:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
it's just that 2% adjustment which is
 
01:35:13.069 --> 01:35:13.079 align:start position:0%
relatively small if they do go out of
 
01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:16.550 align:start position:0%
business and they declare bankruptcy
 
01:35:21.169 --> 01:35:21.179 align:start position:0%
on or simply disappear do we have a
 
01:35:25.339 --> 01:35:25.349 align:start position:0%
first lien in our taxes or we do have a
 
01:35:27.739 --> 01:35:27.749 align:start position:0%
priority standing when businesses come
 
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
into bankruptcy and so we if there is
 
01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:33.030 align:start position:0%
debt that is owed to the state
 
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
our legal team works very hard at making
 
01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:39.150 align:start position:0%
sure that we are able to receive what we
 
01:35:40.959 --> 01:35:40.969 align:start position:0%
can out of the bankruptcy proceedings
 
01:35:46.609 --> 01:35:46.619 align:start position:0%
thank you so again you'll see if you
 
01:35:48.169 --> 01:35:48.179 align:start position:0%
look at the chart in the middle of the
 
01:35:51.259 --> 01:35:51.269 align:start position:0%
page the 4% reduction and that was just
 
01:35:54.319 --> 01:35:54.329 align:start position:0%
kind of right sizing of the plan may
 
01:35:58.189 --> 01:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
revenue looks like it will come in above
 
01:36:00.469 --> 01:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
plan again that's partially due to the
 
01:36:03.319 --> 01:36:03.329 align:start position:0%
shifting that was allowed and then Jun
 
01:36:09.810 --> 01:36:09.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:12.939 --> 01:36:12.949 align:start position:0%
moving forward you'll see when you look
 
01:36:17.919 --> 01:36:17.929 align:start position:0%
month by month that the amounts kind of
 
01:36:19.959 --> 01:36:19.969 align:start position:0%
vary a little bit you'll see that you
 
01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:23.690 align:start position:0%
know July is a 20% reduction August is
 
01:36:28.180 --> 01:36:28.190 align:start position:0%
16 14 10% in in October and then you'll
 
01:36:30.729 --> 01:36:30.739 align:start position:0%
dip to a minus 21 percent in November
 
01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:33.110 align:start position:0%
that's because we took into account the
 
01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:35.390 align:start position:0%
actual filings in any given month and
 
01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:37.610 align:start position:0%
the time period for which they reflect
 
01:36:39.939 --> 01:36:39.949 align:start position:0%
so that's why it's not the same linear
 
01:36:42.189 --> 01:36:42.199 align:start position:0%
trend like we saw with meals and rentals
 
01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:44.690 align:start position:0%
it will fluctuate month month-to-month
 
01:36:47.650 --> 01:36:47.660 align:start position:0%
based on the filing that's due at that
 
01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
time also just for reference during the
 
01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
Great Recession IND tax revenues
 
01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:10.370 align:start position:0%
decreased by 16% going from fiscal year
 
01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:13.910 align:start position:0%
2008 to 2009 fourteen point eight
 
01:37:17.439 --> 01:37:17.449 align:start position:0%
percent from 2009 to 2010 and six point
 
01:37:20.229 --> 01:37:20.239 align:start position:0%
eight percent from 2010 to 2011
 
01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:23.330 align:start position:0%
again those are reference points this is
 
01:37:25.810 --> 01:37:25.820 align:start position:0%
not the same as the Great Recession but
 
01:37:28.419 --> 01:37:28.429 align:start position:0%
that is data that we have available and
 
01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
so we will be kind of looking to that to
 
01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:33.170 align:start position:0%
generally see if there's similarities
 
01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:35.570 align:start position:0%
between what we're experiencing now and
 
01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:52.010 align:start position:0%
thank you questions I can answer on Ind
 
01:37:54.439 --> 01:37:54.449 align:start position:0%
we have three hands all of a sudden
 
01:37:58.700 --> 01:37:58.710 align:start position:0%
represent of aims thank you
 
01:38:02.450 --> 01:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that the set of the
 
01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:05.550 align:start position:0%
unknown the big unknown around we can
 
01:38:15.410 --> 01:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
get in June probably relates because I
 
01:38:19.330 --> 01:38:19.340 align:start position:0%
don't think economically looking forward
 
01:38:25.370 --> 01:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
the projection of income for taxpayers
 
01:38:27.919 --> 01:38:27.929 align:start position:0%
whether its interest or dividends would
 
01:38:32.479 --> 01:38:32.489 align:start position:0%
be substantially different unless they
 
01:38:35.390 --> 01:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
had to sell their holdings I suppose and
 
01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:38.250 align:start position:0%
and use that money for something else
 
01:38:42.819 --> 01:38:42.829 align:start position:0%
but so the big thing is ability to pay
 
01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:48.170 align:start position:0%
both estimates and returns and and
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
I know that you know this better than I
 
01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:55.110 align:start position:0%
do that a significant number of our
 
01:38:57.319 --> 01:38:57.329 align:start position:0%
payers taxpayers in interest and
 
01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:00.530 align:start position:0%
dividends pay relatively small amounts
 
01:39:04.370 --> 01:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
reflecting perhaps the income that they
 
01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:06.630 align:start position:0%
rely on perhaps not but to some degree
 
01:39:13.220 --> 01:39:13.230 align:start position:0%
yes and so the the difficulty that I'm
 
01:39:16.339 --> 01:39:16.349 align:start position:0%
having that you're I'm having I'm sure
 
01:39:19.729 --> 01:39:19.739 align:start position:0%
as well is that we just don't know until
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
we get those returns those payments
 
01:39:28.479 --> 01:39:28.489 align:start position:0%
those estimates in mid-june correct
 
01:39:33.709 --> 01:39:33.719 align:start position:0%
maybe a good comment on that or so we
 
01:39:37.819 --> 01:39:37.829 align:start position:0%
did an analysis based on the number of
 
01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:41.070 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in the amount of revenue even
 
01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
the ability for them to move from April
 
01:39:45.140 --> 01:39:45.150 align:start position:0%
to June without interest in penalties
 
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
that provision was not available to
 
01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:49.810 align:start position:0%
everyone but we did an analysis
 
01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:51.970 align:start position:0%
to say how many we thought would move
 
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
from April to June and that analysis
 
01:39:56.130 --> 01:39:56.140 align:start position:0%
came in just about right
 
01:39:58.770 --> 01:39:58.780 align:start position:0%
so April revenue produced what we
 
01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:00.490 align:start position:0%
thought it would so you're a hundred
 
01:40:02.250 --> 01:40:02.260 align:start position:0%
percent correct that the big question
 
01:40:05.820 --> 01:40:05.830 align:start position:0%
mark for June is will taxpayers still
 
01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:07.330 align:start position:0%
have the ability to make those payments
 
01:40:11.130 --> 01:40:11.140 align:start position:0%
that were due in April in June and so we
 
01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:15.130 align:start position:0%
have adjusted slightly for that and only
 
01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:17.290 align:start position:0%
June will really tell at that point
 
01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:20.530 align:start position:0%
going forward in addition to the ability
 
01:40:24.090 --> 01:40:24.100 align:start position:0%
to pay we did also assume an overall
 
01:40:26.490 --> 01:40:26.500 align:start position:0%
reduction in interest in dividend income
 
01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:29.890 align:start position:0%
at least through December of 2020 our
 
01:40:33.390 --> 01:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
analysis assumes a 25% reduction through
 
01:40:36.330 --> 01:40:36.340 align:start position:0%
December of 2020 and that being due to
 
01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:39.450 align:start position:0%
interest rates being low and then also
 
01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:42.790 align:start position:0%
businesses their own cash needs etc
 
01:40:44.910 --> 01:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
likely decreasing the amount of
 
01:40:46.590 --> 01:40:46.600 align:start position:0%
distributions and dividends that they
 
01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:50.890 align:start position:0%
will be paying out following December we
 
01:40:54.210 --> 01:40:54.220 align:start position:0%
then modified that 25% reduction to a
 
01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:56.890 align:start position:0%
set 10 percent reduction from January to
 
01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:00.130 align:start position:0%
June of 21 anticipating that hopefully
 
01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
at that time businesses would be
 
01:41:03.510 --> 01:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
improving and there'd be more
 
01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:06.550 align:start position:0%
availability to make distributions and
 
01:41:09.450 --> 01:41:09.460 align:start position:0%
pay dividends but you're right it is the
 
01:41:13.130 --> 01:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
combination of the underlying
 
01:41:14.970 --> 01:41:14.980 align:start position:0%
distributions and dividends and interest
 
01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:18.930 align:start position:0%
that generate the tax coupled with
 
01:41:22.230 --> 01:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
people's ability to pay because it is a
 
01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:25.090 align:start position:0%
source of income for folks and given
 
01:41:28.590 --> 01:41:28.600 align:start position:0%
that the current situation results in a
 
01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:31.510 align:start position:0%
reduction of income for many people they
 
01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:34.210 align:start position:0%
may need to rely on this to a greater
 
01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:35.710 align:start position:0%
extent that they have in the past and
 
01:41:37.890 --> 01:41:37.900 align:start position:0%
that might not give them the additional
 
01:41:40.950 --> 01:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
cash or liquidity to make their tax
 
01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:47.319 align:start position:0%
cash or liquidity to make their tax
payments

01:41:47.319 --> 01:41:47.329 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:52.270 --> 01:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
so you're actually assuming that this
 
01:41:54.430 --> 01:41:54.440 align:start position:0%
recession will be over a lot quicker
 
01:42:00.330 --> 01:42:00.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:05.950 --> 01:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
stockholders receivers correct that you
 
01:42:09.010 --> 01:42:09.020 align:start position:0%
know that's the assumption that we've
 
01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:11.270 align:start position:0%
made in this analysis it's obviously
 
01:42:13.629 --> 01:42:13.639 align:start position:0%
something that we can modify if we would
 
01:42:15.899 --> 01:42:15.909 align:start position:0%
like to run different scenarios
 
01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:18.170 align:start position:0%
listening to the conversation earlier
 
01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:22.250 align:start position:0%
about is this gonna be a V recession is
 
01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:24.170 align:start position:0%
this going to be a u-shaped recession is
 
01:42:26.819 --> 01:42:26.829 align:start position:0%
this going to be a w-shaped recession
 
01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:30.530 align:start position:0%
that's all tough to know at this point I
 
01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:34.639 align:start position:0%
think and but as the picture becomes
 
01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:36.530 align:start position:0%
clearer if it to the extent that it does
 
01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:39.610 align:start position:0%
we can certainly make some modifications
 
01:42:44.290 --> 01:42:44.300 align:start position:0%
but we did anticipate a fairly quick
 
01:42:53.970 --> 01:42:53.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:56.229 --> 01:42:56.239 align:start position:0%
we went a little bit deeper than the
 
01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:57.650 align:start position:0%
Great Recession but we're covered up a
 
01:43:03.870 --> 01:43:03.880 align:start position:0%
little faster Southworth has question
 
01:43:06.939 --> 01:43:06.949 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm sorry if I missed it is
 
01:43:10.810 --> 01:43:10.820 align:start position:0%
there assumption all this that by the
 
01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:14.570 align:start position:0%
end of 2021 talent there will be a
 
01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:17.750 align:start position:0%
vaccine because it seems like your
 
01:43:20.049 --> 01:43:20.059 align:start position:0%
timeline of things bouncing back within
 
01:43:22.899 --> 01:43:22.909 align:start position:0%
a year does somewhat fit the timeline of
 
01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:26.510 align:start position:0%
having a vaccine by May or June of 2021
 
01:43:31.020 --> 01:43:31.030 align:start position:0%
I don't we did not make an assumption
 
01:43:33.669 --> 01:43:33.679 align:start position:0%
specifically about a vaccine but you are
 
01:43:36.629 --> 01:43:36.639 align:start position:0%
correct that our analysis in general
 
01:43:40.390 --> 01:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
assumes gradual loosening of
 
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
restrictions and expansion of the
 
01:43:45.129 --> 01:43:45.139 align:start position:0%
economy starting at the beginning of
 
01:43:48.609 --> 01:43:48.619 align:start position:0%
June and that may very well be dependent
 
01:43:50.169 --> 01:43:50.179 align:start position:0%
on a vaccine but we didn't make an
 
01:43:51.939 --> 01:43:51.949 align:start position:0%
assumption about the specific timing of
 
01:43:59.500 --> 01:43:59.510 align:start position:0%
a vaccine represented Brahmi there's a
 
01:43:59.510 --> 01:44:00.569 align:start position:0%
a vaccine represented Brahmi there's a
question

01:44:00.569 --> 01:44:00.579 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:44:03.399 --> 01:44:03.409 align:start position:0%
question is in a comment I mean the
 
01:44:05.319 --> 01:44:05.329 align:start position:0%
fundamentals of the economy world are
 
01:44:07.990 --> 01:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
very good before we fell off the edge
 
01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:13.730 align:start position:0%
here and under the cap of a V return and
 
01:44:18.629 --> 01:44:18.639 align:start position:0%
in terms of vaccine that may not happen
 
01:44:21.399 --> 01:44:21.409 align:start position:0%
you know we still don't have an AIDS
 
01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine yep that scenes sometimes
 
01:44:27.189 --> 01:44:27.199 align:start position:0%
they're only 50 percent 60 percent
 
01:44:32.050 --> 01:44:32.060 align:start position:0%
effective so you know I think economies
 
01:44:36.339 --> 01:44:36.349 align:start position:0%
is going to be opening the vaccine we'll
 
01:44:37.359 --> 01:44:37.369 align:start position:0%
see what happens
 
01:44:41.379 --> 01:44:41.389 align:start position:0%
that'll help I guess but let's look at
 
01:44:44.109 --> 01:44:44.119 align:start position:0%
the stock market yesterday and all the
 
01:44:46.629 --> 01:44:46.639 align:start position:0%
analysts that I heard said it born
 
01:44:48.100 --> 01:44:48.110 align:start position:0%
because of all the states that are
 
01:44:53.229 --> 01:44:53.239 align:start position:0%
opening up so and the markets reacted to
 
01:44:54.700 --> 01:44:54.710 align:start position:0%
it but that tells me that the farm
 
01:44:57.819 --> 01:44:57.829 align:start position:0%
metals are good that and I know I'm
 
01:44:59.410 --> 01:44:59.420 align:start position:0%
you're she here you have a 30% increase
 
01:45:01.589 --> 01:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
in the market since the fall or
 
01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:03.650 align:start position:0%
something like that it's covered by this
 
01:45:07.870 --> 01:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
a box here but you know I'm kind of
 
01:45:12.370 --> 01:45:12.380 align:start position:0%
green with you as to that I think the
 
01:45:13.990 --> 01:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
economy is going to be opening there may
 
01:45:18.510 --> 01:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
be a lag I agree with remains about
 
01:45:21.510 --> 01:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
about liquidity of certain individuals
 
01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:23.810 align:start position:0%
but there are a lot of individuals are
 
01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:27.010 align:start position:0%
quite liquid that will continue to pay
 
01:45:30.839 --> 01:45:30.849 align:start position:0%
their interest in dividends tax so I
 
01:45:33.819 --> 01:45:33.829 align:start position:0%
will say that's all I just wanted to
 
01:45:39.970 --> 01:45:39.980 align:start position:0%
comment thank you I was looking and I
 
01:45:42.430 --> 01:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
think it's with the businesses the
 
01:45:46.510 --> 01:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
analyses are fairly similar so maybe I
 
01:45:50.709 --> 01:45:50.719 align:start position:0%
should put that off but the question of
 
01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:53.690 align:start position:0%
how many of the people who were in the
 
01:45:56.290 --> 01:45:56.300 align:start position:0%
lower quarter of paying we're going to
 
01:45:58.600 --> 01:45:58.610 align:start position:0%
drop off altogether and people in the
 
01:46:02.229 --> 01:46:02.239 align:start position:0%
second quarter of painting we're going
 
01:46:05.859 --> 01:46:05.869 align:start position:0%
to fall down into the lower quarter next
 
01:46:10.330 --> 01:46:10.340 align:start position:0%
year but on representing names just had
 
01:46:13.299 --> 01:46:13.309 align:start position:0%
a question just a quick question going
 
01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:14.090 align:start position:0%
back to
 
01:46:18.460 --> 01:46:18.470 align:start position:0%
which said Lindsay about about your
 
01:46:21.070 --> 01:46:21.080 align:start position:0%
assumptions in the in your estimate for
 
01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:23.510 align:start position:0%
forecast for interest and dividends you
 
01:46:28.330 --> 01:46:28.340 align:start position:0%
use percentages of that what dividends
 
01:46:31.090 --> 01:46:31.100 align:start position:0%
would be down by and I didn't I didn't
 
01:46:33.460 --> 01:46:33.470 align:start position:0%
get that in my notes so could you go
 
01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:36.590 align:start position:0%
over that again or so we assume that
 
01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:38.570 align:start position:0%
interest and dividend income will be
 
01:46:44.490 --> 01:46:44.500 align:start position:0%
down by 25% through December of 2020 and
 
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
then 10% from January to June of 21 and
 
01:46:58.300 --> 01:46:58.310 align:start position:0%
again the decrease year-over-year that
 
01:47:00.610 --> 01:47:00.620 align:start position:0%
we saw during the Great Recession was 16
 
01:47:06.100 --> 01:47:06.110 align:start position:0%
percent then to 14.8 then to 6.8 over
 
01:47:09.310 --> 01:47:09.320 align:start position:0%
that three-year period we're assuming a
 
01:47:13.210 --> 01:47:13.220 align:start position:0%
bigger drop but a faster return so more
 
01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
of a V or use and it sound it sounds
 
01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:22.070 align:start position:0%
like in the end the drop the cumulative
 
01:47:24.570 --> 01:47:24.580 align:start position:0%
drop over three years would be
 
01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:26.450 align:start position:0%
considerably worse than the Great
 
01:47:31.030 --> 01:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
Recession I haven't calculated that out
 
01:47:36.190 --> 01:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
from what you said but for the Great
 
01:47:38.350 --> 01:47:38.360 align:start position:0%
Recession it was sixteen percent the
 
01:47:40.660 --> 01:47:40.670 align:start position:0%
first year and then another fifteen
 
01:47:42.340 --> 01:47:42.350 align:start position:0%
percent the second year and then another
 
01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:45.050 align:start position:0%
seven percent the year after that right
 
01:47:48.450 --> 01:47:48.460 align:start position:0%
and then it started to return correct
 
01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:52.430 align:start position:0%
where we're anticipating a brief but
 
01:47:55.750 --> 01:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
more dramatic drop and then a faster
 
01:48:01.330 --> 01:48:01.340 align:start position:0%
return could you I don't see any more
 
01:48:03.610 --> 01:48:03.620 align:start position:0%
hands but could could you just make a
 
01:48:07.330 --> 01:48:07.340 align:start position:0%
note or some more Chris send Chris and
 
01:48:12.550 --> 01:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
Chris can send us the updated document
 
01:48:14.530 --> 01:48:14.540 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at because you had a
 
01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:22.690 align:start position:0%
a 96 percent above plan increase in June
 
01:48:26.290 --> 01:48:26.300 align:start position:0%
current before and you've changed it to
 
01:48:27.439 --> 01:48:27.449 align:start position:0%
88 and I don't
 
01:48:30.020 --> 01:48:30.030 align:start position:0%
know what else has changed so you have
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
actually found the only change in the
 
01:48:37.399 --> 01:48:37.409 align:start position:0%
document and that very later we just
 
01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:41.010 align:start position:0%
need to cross out on page five the lady
 
01:48:43.009 --> 01:48:43.019 align:start position:0%
sticks about plans at the very end and
 
01:48:50.209 --> 01:48:50.219 align:start position:0%
put in an a th thank you okay
 
01:48:54.979 --> 01:48:54.989 align:start position:0%
communication services tax all right
 
01:48:57.169 --> 01:48:57.179 align:start position:0%
moving on to communication some of those
 
01:49:04.129 --> 01:49:04.139 align:start position:0%
tax CST this again has a delay in timing
 
01:49:05.419 --> 01:49:05.429 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you're familiar with that
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
similar to M&amp;R so the activity is a one
 
01:49:12.890 --> 01:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
is a one-month delay when we looked at
 
01:49:16.129 --> 01:49:16.139 align:start position:0%
CST and tried to predict out the factors
 
01:49:18.949 --> 01:49:18.959 align:start position:0%
of it we was just talking about with
 
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
onion D and we sort of went back to the
 
01:49:24.339 --> 01:49:24.349 align:start position:0%
Great Recession and took a look at that
 
01:49:27.169 --> 01:49:27.179 align:start position:0%
with unemployment because obviously this
 
01:49:30.259 --> 01:49:30.269 align:start position:0%
is a bill that that taxpayers are paying
 
01:49:32.569 --> 01:49:32.579 align:start position:0%
and then the companies are omitting that
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
tax to the Department of Revenue
 
01:49:37.729 --> 01:49:37.739 align:start position:0%
when looking back at the Great Recession
 
01:49:41.419 --> 01:49:41.429 align:start position:0%
from May of 2008 to May of 2009 there
 
01:49:46.879 --> 01:49:46.889 align:start position:0%
was a 20% decrease in CST this occurred
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
simultaneously with the high New
 
01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:50.010 align:start position:0%
Hampshire unemployment rate of 6.5%
 
01:49:53.870 --> 01:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
during the Great Recession we obviously
 
01:49:56.410 --> 01:49:56.420 align:start position:0%
have the high unemployment rate as well
 
01:49:59.660 --> 01:49:59.670 align:start position:0%
we've also had the governor had an
 
01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:01.650 align:start position:0%
emergency order to say if you are unable
 
01:50:05.870 --> 01:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
to pay your phone bill you could do that
 
01:50:08.719 --> 01:50:08.729 align:start position:0%
at this time and your services will be
 
01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:10.650 align:start position:0%
shut off so I'm going to scroll just to
 
01:50:14.029 --> 01:50:14.039 align:start position:0%
the next page so you can see some of our
 
01:50:16.250 --> 01:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
numbers a little bit so when looking at
 
01:50:18.290 --> 01:50:18.300 align:start position:0%
how we performed we took these factors
 
01:50:20.899 --> 01:50:20.909 align:start position:0%
into account what we also needed to look
 
01:50:23.239 --> 01:50:23.249 align:start position:0%
at was the taxability of video
 
01:50:25.250 --> 01:50:25.260 align:start position:0%
conferencing as we're using today we're
 
01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:27.630 align:start position:0%
using the zoom and a lot more companies
 
01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:30.570 align:start position:0%
now with having employees at home
 
01:50:34.489 --> 01:50:34.499 align:start position:0%
because of this pandemic have used more
 
01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:36.030 align:start position:0%
video conferencing tools which are
 
01:50:40.669 --> 01:50:40.679 align:start position:0%
taxable under CST and I think we saw
 
01:50:42.859 --> 01:50:42.869 align:start position:0%
occur in April so if you look down to
 
01:50:45.529 --> 01:50:45.539 align:start position:0%
the second chart people was ahead of
 
01:50:48.890 --> 01:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
plan by three percent which we don't
 
01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
typically see with CST in April that was
 
01:50:55.370 --> 01:50:55.380 align:start position:0%
from March activities so that was sort
 
01:50:58.009 --> 01:50:58.019 align:start position:0%
of the kickoff of this coded 19 in the
 
01:51:03.229 --> 01:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
last couple of months a situation so
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
when looking at that we were projecting
 
01:51:09.199 --> 01:51:09.209 align:start position:0%
your May we sort of took that
 
01:51:10.939 --> 01:51:10.949 align:start position:0%
information that I spoke about before
 
01:51:13.069 --> 01:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
with the Great Recession and how those
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
numbers were affected looked at the
 
01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:17.010 align:start position:0%
governor's emergency orders looked at
 
01:51:20.120 --> 01:51:20.130 align:start position:0%
people's ability to pay and then sort of
 
01:51:23.929 --> 01:51:23.939 align:start position:0%
balanced that with this increasing video
 
01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:28.170 align:start position:0%
conferencing and potentially increase of
 
01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:31.050 align:start position:0%
VoIP usage and we got to about a 10
 
01:51:36.169 --> 01:51:36.179 align:start position:0%
percent reduction in May right now a
 
01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:38.010 align:start position:0%
month today or about eight point eight
 
01:51:43.759 --> 01:51:43.769 align:start position:0%
point seven percent down there'll be a
 
01:51:49.969 --> 01:51:49.979 align:start position:0%
slight a slight increase in increase
 
01:51:51.979 --> 01:51:51.989 align:start position:0%
from that ten percent to a five percent
 
01:51:54.649 --> 01:51:54.659 align:start position:0%
we will see we we noted a five percent
 
01:51:57.069 --> 01:51:57.079 align:start position:0%
reduction in revenue from June until
 
01:52:00.350 --> 01:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
December and in January sort of resuming
 
01:52:03.949 --> 01:52:03.959 align:start position:0%
things as normal from that plan would be
 
01:52:07.069 --> 01:52:07.079 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 2021 I think this this
 
01:52:08.989 --> 01:52:08.999 align:start position:0%
couples would opening back up of the
 
01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:12.570 align:start position:0%
state's people getting back to work and
 
01:52:15.850 --> 01:52:15.860 align:start position:0%
that balancing of videoconferencing
 
01:52:18.939 --> 01:52:18.949 align:start position:0%
potentially going down some but people
 
01:52:23.989 --> 01:52:23.999 align:start position:0%
having the ability to pay more so
 
01:52:26.169 --> 01:52:26.179 align:start position:0%
decrease like I said from June until
 
01:52:29.509 --> 01:52:29.519 align:start position:0%
December down five percent and then
 
01:52:31.399 --> 01:52:31.409 align:start position:0%
January through June with no loss
 
01:52:34.699 --> 01:52:34.709 align:start position:0%
overall it's not a huge loss for fiscal
 
01:52:37.219 --> 01:52:37.229 align:start position:0%
year 20 we anticipated a million dollar
 
01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:40.050 align:start position:0%
loss and then for fiscal year 21 and an
 
01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:44.610 align:start position:0%
additional million dollar loss happy to
 
01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:48.030 align:start position:0%
answer any questions on CST do I think
 
01:52:51.589 --> 01:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
we need to look at the years before and
 
01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:54.210 align:start position:0%
after especially the
 
01:52:56.240 --> 01:52:56.250 align:start position:0%
for the Great Recession because there
 
01:52:58.209 --> 01:52:58.219 align:start position:0%
were massive changes going on in
 
01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:01.170 align:start position:0%
communications at that point and I can't
 
01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:05.370 align:start position:0%
remember maybe you do when on when our
 
01:53:08.690 --> 01:53:08.700 align:start position:0%
u.s. senator led the charge to make the
 
01:53:16.420 --> 01:53:16.430 align:start position:0%
internet on taxable and and the and the
 
01:53:21.729 --> 01:53:21.739 align:start position:0%
legislature I think that was after the
 
01:53:24.380 --> 01:53:24.390 align:start position:0%
legislature gave up the grandfathering
 
01:53:26.750 --> 01:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so I just looked at the chart that
 
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
was in 2012 to 2013
 
01:53:39.920 --> 01:53:39.930 align:start position:0%
okay so that one was after you looked at
 
01:53:43.190 --> 01:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
I think oh no it was before
 
01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:45.510 align:start position:0%
it was yes it was after the period do
 
01:53:49.220 --> 01:53:49.230 align:start position:0%
you look dead okay so we have quite a
 
01:53:52.250 --> 01:53:52.260 align:start position:0%
different situation now you can get very
 
01:53:56.720 --> 01:53:56.730 align:start position:0%
cheap smartphones where you're paying
 
01:54:00.590 --> 01:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
still by the data unit or the minute I
 
01:54:02.990 --> 01:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
know a lot of really poor people that
 
01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:03.690 align:start position:0%
have them
 
01:54:09.020 --> 01:54:09.030 align:start position:0%
and those people have lost a lot of the
 
01:54:12.850 --> 01:54:12.860 align:start position:0%
most revenue as as Phil told us and
 
01:54:17.570 --> 01:54:17.580 align:start position:0%
maybe are giving them up though they
 
01:54:19.459 --> 01:54:19.469 align:start position:0%
have to a lot of them are doing network
 
01:54:24.380 --> 01:54:24.390 align:start position:0%
but they're in the gig economy so they
 
01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:26.430 align:start position:0%
may not be able to give them up any more
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
than they can give up paying rent or
 
01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:35.370 align:start position:0%
they'll be homeless so so it's a con
 
01:54:37.490 --> 01:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
it's a complicated one but it it is a
 
01:54:40.750 --> 01:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
very small revenue source for us yes
 
01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:44.210 align:start position:0%
representative a brownie header
 
01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:47.130 align:start position:0%
yes the interesting thing is I never
 
01:54:50.780 --> 01:54:50.790 align:start position:0%
thought of paid versus built in the ten
 
01:54:52.010 --> 01:54:52.020 align:start position:0%
years that we've been talking about this
 
01:54:56.150 --> 01:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
revenue so so it's the obligation is
 
01:54:57.770 --> 01:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
when the money comes in is when they
 
01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:03.030 align:start position:0%
they get the tax not one that when it's
 
01:55:05.370 --> 01:55:05.380 align:start position:0%
bad yes
 
01:55:08.250 --> 01:55:08.260 align:start position:0%
they report the revenue to us based on
 
01:55:11.070 --> 01:55:11.080 align:start position:0%
what they collect okay that's just a fun
 
01:55:12.930 --> 01:55:12.940 align:start position:0%
I don't think we can over discuss that
 
01:55:15.870 --> 01:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
so but that does play into the fact that
 
01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:17.350 align:start position:0%
some people may not be able to pay their
 
01:55:23.550 --> 01:55:23.560 align:start position:0%
bill so okay thank you it's the same
 
01:55:27.300 --> 01:55:27.310 align:start position:0%
month right they played the 15th of the
 
01:55:28.340 --> 01:55:28.350 align:start position:0%
following month
 
01:55:31.710 --> 01:55:31.720 align:start position:0%
if so it is the following month yeah
 
01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
it's like M&amp;R yes anyway set up we
 
01:55:39.020 --> 01:55:39.030 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:41.550 --> 01:55:41.560 align:start position:0%
Laurie still has his hand up so that
 
01:55:44.580 --> 01:55:44.590 align:start position:0%
wasn't discussion ah just a quick
 
01:55:48.750 --> 01:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
question or a comment regarding most of
 
01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:50.050 align:start position:0%
the carriers
 
01:55:53.130 --> 01:55:53.140 align:start position:0%
I know Verizon has I know that that
 
01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:55.510 align:start position:0%
whatever they're calling t-mobile was
 
01:55:58.950 --> 01:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
print whatever is being called now have
 
01:56:02.250 --> 01:56:02.260 align:start position:0%
increased the number of units available
 
01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:06.330 align:start position:0%
to individuals without increasing their
 
01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:12.010 align:start position:0%
charges so I don't see any change in the
 
01:56:14.510 --> 01:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
communications tax taking place at all
 
01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:21.130 align:start position:0%
comment done thank you by major heads
 
01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:25.270 align:start position:0%
Handa yeah I didn't hear in the
 
01:56:28.350 --> 01:56:28.360 align:start position:0%
discussion two-way communication then
 
01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:34.090 align:start position:0%
today Skype go to some a lot more than
 
01:56:37.770 --> 01:56:37.780 align:start position:0%
is happening which all in fact revenues
 
01:56:43.410 --> 01:56:43.420 align:start position:0%
now I just read that I guess the DRA
 
01:56:47.060 --> 01:56:47.070 align:start position:0%
said that the zone should be subject to
 
01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:55.770 align:start position:0%
the tax is are we currently taxing zone
 
01:56:59.520 --> 01:56:59.530 align:start position:0%
no Alyssa I can't you know our
 
01:57:01.110 --> 01:57:01.120 align:start position:0%
confidentiality statue I can't comment
 
01:57:03.300 --> 01:57:03.310 align:start position:0%
in particular taxpayers however I can
 
01:57:12.620 --> 01:57:12.630 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:12.630 --> 01:57:13.990 align:start position:0%
 
if

01:57:13.990 --> 01:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:57:18.130 --> 01:57:18.140 align:start position:0%
under a definition more taxing it what
 
01:57:22.150 --> 01:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
exactly are we taxing in it what's the
 
01:57:26.230 --> 01:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
definition I don't have that pulled up I
 
01:57:29.370 --> 01:57:29.380 align:start position:0%
think I had sent you an email on that
 
01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:31.370 align:start position:0%
yes you did
 
01:57:33.250 --> 01:57:33.260 align:start position:0%
why can we send that to the committee
 
01:57:36.010 --> 01:57:36.020 align:start position:0%
not not can't remember if there was a
 
01:57:38.890 --> 01:57:38.900 align:start position:0%
good definition in there or not the
 
01:57:41.230 --> 01:57:41.240 align:start position:0%
whole point in statute with the
 
01:58:01.900 --> 01:58:01.910 align:start position:0%
definition to wait by the phone so it
 
01:58:05.020 --> 01:58:05.030 align:start position:0%
would be considered taxable back to sort
 
01:58:07.150 --> 01:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
of my previous point so that's why we
 
01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:10.490 align:start position:0%
offset the loss and that's why we saw a
 
01:58:13.270 --> 01:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
gain in April is because of this this
 
01:58:14.950 --> 01:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
video conferencing represented major
 
01:58:16.810 --> 01:58:16.820 align:start position:0%
some of those items or some of those
 
01:58:18.970 --> 01:58:18.980 align:start position:0%
those companies that you are saying you
 
01:58:20.530 --> 01:58:20.540 align:start position:0%
know there is an increased usage of
 
01:58:22.510 --> 01:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
those and we were balancing that
 
01:58:24.550 --> 01:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
increased usage with also taxpayers
 
01:58:27.160 --> 01:58:27.170 align:start position:0%
inability to pay during this time which
 
01:58:29.740 --> 01:58:29.750 align:start position:0%
got us to the 10% reduction in May and
 
01:58:32.740 --> 01:58:32.750 align:start position:0%
then the reduction of 5% move through
 
01:58:44.460 --> 01:58:44.470 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:47.460 --> 01:58:47.470 align:start position:0%
people would just cease to be customers
 
01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:50.750 align:start position:0%
well if they tried to sign up again
 
01:58:53.290 --> 01:58:53.300 align:start position:0%
presumably they'd still owe what they
 
01:58:56.680 --> 01:58:56.690 align:start position:0%
hadn't paid during the the declaration
 
01:59:00.340 --> 01:59:00.350 align:start position:0%
of emergency yeah I do know I knew that
 
01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:02.810 align:start position:0%
no this just anecdotally from having
 
01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:04.490 align:start position:0%
children in school and people's ability
 
01:59:06.610 --> 01:59:06.620 align:start position:0%
to pay and what Comcast has been doing
 
01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:07.970 align:start position:0%
to try to get people to the Internet
 
01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:11.570 align:start position:0%
that if people do have a pasty bill with
 
01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:13.510 align:start position:0%
a balance that they can't reconnect
 
01:59:20.890 --> 01:59:20.900 align:start position:0%
until that balance is paid in full so
 
01:59:23.380 --> 01:59:23.390 align:start position:0%
that that's going to be interesting
 
01:59:26.020 --> 01:59:26.030 align:start position:0%
going forward yes a lot of people's jobs
 
01:59:27.370 --> 01:59:27.380 align:start position:0%
depend on that
 
01:59:32.770 --> 01:59:32.780 align:start position:0%
they communicate okay no further
 
01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:38.210 align:start position:0%
questions it looks like okay good
 
01:59:43.890 --> 01:59:43.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:48.650 align:start position:0%
okay so for the we did not make an
 
01:59:51.129 --> 01:59:51.139 align:start position:0%
adjustment to fiscal year 2020 plan we
 
01:59:55.300 --> 01:59:55.310 align:start position:0%
felt like rat was performing for covered
 
02:00:00.550 --> 02:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
very facebook lien may revenue looks to
 
02:00:05.290 --> 02:00:05.300 align:start position:0%
be about 17 percent below plan or as a
 
02:00:07.689 --> 02:00:07.699 align:start position:0%
reminder that's for April transactions
 
02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:11.810 align:start position:0%
yes there are a few interesting pieces
 
02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:14.570 align:start position:0%
confirmation that play through the real
 
02:00:18.250 --> 02:00:18.260 align:start position:0%
estate transfer tax a lot before but
 
02:00:21.010 --> 02:00:21.020 align:start position:0%
just as a reminder there's two important
 
02:00:22.840 --> 02:00:22.850 align:start position:0%
pieces of real estate transfer tax one
 
02:00:25.209 --> 02:00:25.219 align:start position:0%
is the volume you need the transactions
 
02:00:27.689 --> 02:00:27.699 align:start position:0%
to occur in order to generate the tax
 
02:00:31.060 --> 02:00:31.070 align:start position:0%
but then also the tax is based on the
 
02:00:31.070 --> 02:00:31.689 align:start position:0%
but then also the tax is based on the
price

02:00:31.689 --> 02:00:31.699 align:start position:0%
price
 
02:00:35.110 --> 02:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
so as the prices fluctuate that can
 
02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:37.010 align:start position:0%
impact the tax as well and so we're
 
02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:40.610 align:start position:0%
constantly kind of evaluating both
 
02:00:42.459 --> 02:00:42.469 align:start position:0%
what's happening in terms of the volume
 
02:00:44.229 --> 02:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
but also what's happening in terms of
 
02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:47.330 align:start position:0%
the prices because if one goes down and
 
02:00:49.419 --> 02:00:49.429 align:start position:0%
the other goes up it could essentially
 
02:00:51.490 --> 02:00:51.500 align:start position:0%
negate each other and we could see just
 
02:00:54.970 --> 02:00:54.980 align:start position:0%
normal activity so based on a survey
 
02:00:56.830 --> 02:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Association of
 
02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:02.090 align:start position:0%
Realtors all but thirteen percent of the
 
02:01:04.209 --> 02:01:04.219 align:start position:0%
people that responded indicated that the
 
02:01:06.100 --> 02:01:06.110 align:start position:0%
coronavirus had had an impact on their
 
02:01:09.399 --> 02:01:09.409 align:start position:0%
business survey indicated that 69
 
02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:11.090 align:start position:0%
percent of buyers were delaying their
 
02:01:13.149 --> 02:01:13.159 align:start position:0%
home searches and that 64 percent of
 
02:01:15.100 --> 02:01:15.110 align:start position:0%
sellers were delaying new listings and
 
02:01:18.660 --> 02:01:18.670 align:start position:0%
even taking homes off the market so
 
02:01:21.129 --> 02:01:21.139 align:start position:0%
we're trying to understand and what the
 
02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:22.850 align:start position:0%
data is starting to tell us is that
 
02:01:27.010 --> 02:01:27.020 align:start position:0%
there was some level of transactions
 
02:01:29.470 --> 02:01:29.480 align:start position:0%
that were already in process before
 
02:01:32.379 --> 02:01:32.389 align:start position:0%
Kovan maybe up into the point of
 
02:01:34.660 --> 02:01:34.670 align:start position:0%
actually signing the papers and that
 
02:01:36.490 --> 02:01:36.500 align:start position:0%
those transactions may have still
 
02:01:39.250 --> 02:01:39.260 align:start position:0%
occurred because they're kind of past
 
02:01:40.830 --> 02:01:40.840 align:start position:0%
the point of no return
 
02:01:42.630 --> 02:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
but then we're gonna see a reduction
 
02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:47.290 align:start position:0%
when the volume decreases when people
 
02:01:49.820 --> 02:01:49.830 align:start position:0%
don't list their homes or delay the
 
02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:52.570 align:start position:0%
listing of their home or delay their
 
02:01:55.620 --> 02:01:55.630 align:start position:0%
home search so we're anticipating a
 
02:01:57.690 --> 02:01:57.700 align:start position:0%
little bit of a delayed reaction and you
 
02:02:00.030 --> 02:02:00.040 align:start position:0%
can kind of see that in the numbers or
 
02:02:03.150 --> 02:02:03.160 align:start position:0%
delayed impact on revenues because like
 
02:02:04.860 --> 02:02:04.870 align:start position:0%
I said a number of transactions were
 
02:02:07.290 --> 02:02:07.300 align:start position:0%
already in process and still continue to
 
02:02:10.890 --> 02:02:10.900 align:start position:0%
occur even in April but we anticipate
 
02:02:15.960 --> 02:02:15.970 align:start position:0%
those falling off also the median real
 
02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:20.290 align:start position:0%
estate sales price was 9 percent in
 
02:02:23.250 --> 02:02:23.260 align:start position:0%
March 9 percent ahead of March from
 
02:02:25.470 --> 02:02:25.480 align:start position:0%
March a year ago according to the
 
02:02:27.270 --> 02:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
Association of Realtors so your sale
 
02:02:30.210 --> 02:02:30.220 align:start position:0%
prices in March of 2020 we're nine
 
02:02:32.010 --> 02:02:32.020 align:start position:0%
percent higher than your sale prices in
 
02:02:34.740 --> 02:02:34.750 align:start position:0%
March of 2019 so that gets to that
 
02:02:37.020 --> 02:02:37.030 align:start position:0%
balance that I was talking about worse
 
02:02:38.700 --> 02:02:38.710 align:start position:0%
are likely to start seeing fewer
 
02:02:41.010 --> 02:02:41.020 align:start position:0%
transactions but of the transactions
 
02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:43.570 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing the prices are higher
 
02:02:45.570 --> 02:02:45.580 align:start position:0%
than they were a year ago and so that
 
02:02:49.380 --> 02:02:49.390 align:start position:0%
kind of helps to produce that balance so
 
02:02:51.210 --> 02:02:51.220 align:start position:0%
we took into account what we've seen you
 
02:02:53.250 --> 02:02:53.260 align:start position:0%
see the 17 percent reduction in May
 
02:02:55.080 --> 02:02:55.090 align:start position:0%
that's with most of the activity re
 
02:02:58.170 --> 02:02:58.180 align:start position:0%
having occurred for this month the
 
02:03:01.590 --> 02:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
reduction of 60% in June that's where
 
02:03:03.450 --> 02:03:03.460 align:start position:0%
we're really feeling the full effect
 
02:03:04.950 --> 02:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
because June will be for May
 
02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:08.490 align:start position:0%
transactions where we're feeling like
 
02:03:11.670 --> 02:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
the impact of the reduction in the
 
02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:14.290 align:start position:0%
volume of transactions will really be
 
02:03:17.310 --> 02:03:17.320 align:start position:0%
the largest and then you see you start
 
02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:21.490 align:start position:0%
to see a steady increase back to the end
 
02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:23.290 align:start position:0%
we're going out to the end of 21
 
02:03:25.980 --> 02:03:25.990 align:start position:0%
although we never fully recovered to
 
02:03:31.110 --> 02:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
plan numbers there are other things that
 
02:03:33.690 --> 02:03:33.700 align:start position:0%
in addition to just the prices and the
 
02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:35.290 align:start position:0%
volume that we're taking into
 
02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:38.410 align:start position:0%
consideration obviously the fact that
 
02:03:41.160 --> 02:03:41.170 align:start position:0%
mortgage rates are low will hopefully
 
02:03:43.590 --> 02:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
help to preserve some level of
 
02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:51.930 align:start position:0%
transaction volume and the ability with
 
02:03:54.540 --> 02:03:54.550 align:start position:0%
the restrictions on the stay at home
 
02:03:57.750 --> 02:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
orders being lifted the ability to fully
 
02:04:00.299 --> 02:04:00.309 align:start position:0%
execute these contracts will help also
 
02:04:04.109 --> 02:04:04.119 align:start position:0%
to bring the transaction numbers up but
 
02:04:05.939 --> 02:04:05.949 align:start position:0%
we have to couple that with a high rate
 
02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:07.690 align:start position:0%
of unemployment that we're seeing and
 
02:04:10.589 --> 02:04:10.599 align:start position:0%
the fact that a number of people just
 
02:04:14.010 --> 02:04:14.020 align:start position:0%
may not be looking to buy or sell a home
 
02:04:16.260 --> 02:04:16.270 align:start position:0%
right now or alternatively they may be
 
02:04:18.629 --> 02:04:18.639 align:start position:0%
forced into buying or selling a home
 
02:04:20.970 --> 02:04:20.980 align:start position:0%
given their struggling financial
 
02:04:23.250 --> 02:04:23.260 align:start position:0%
situation that could also be the same
 
02:04:25.740 --> 02:04:25.750 align:start position:0%
with businesses we've all heard about a
 
02:04:27.750 --> 02:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
number of businesses that have decided
 
02:04:29.669 --> 02:04:29.679 align:start position:0%
to cease operations and to the extent
 
02:04:31.020 --> 02:04:31.030 align:start position:0%
that they own the building that the
 
02:04:33.089 --> 02:04:33.099 align:start position:0%
business has been operating in we may
 
02:04:35.339 --> 02:04:35.349 align:start position:0%
see some increased transactions there
 
02:04:37.799 --> 02:04:37.809 align:start position:0%
although the values or the transaction
 
02:04:40.410 --> 02:04:40.420 align:start position:0%
price may be lower so these are all
 
02:04:41.910 --> 02:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
things that we're kind of keeping our
 
02:04:45.990 --> 02:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
eyes on while we kind of move through
 
02:04:50.609 --> 02:04:50.619 align:start position:0%
the next few months and I'm happy to
 
02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:53.170 align:start position:0%
answer any questions I'm representative
 
02:04:53.750 --> 02:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
of Romi
 
02:04:59.520 --> 02:04:59.530 align:start position:0%
you know so two weeks ago I shared a
 
02:05:02.069 --> 02:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on let's trade beans in
 
02:05:04.169 --> 02:05:04.179 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County wearing my County
 
02:05:07.439 --> 02:05:07.449 align:start position:0%
responsibility hat and our registrar was
 
02:05:16.220 --> 02:05:16.230 align:start position:0%
really upbeat of transactions etc and
 
02:05:18.990 --> 02:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
maybe so since then but she seemed
 
02:05:23.729 --> 02:05:23.739 align:start position:0%
pretty upbeat do you have data by by
 
02:05:27.089 --> 02:05:27.099 align:start position:0%
county Rockingham maybe walking hams in
 
02:05:28.830 --> 02:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
a bit of an aberration I mean it's still
 
02:05:30.629 --> 02:05:30.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of building going on did I say in
 
02:05:33.020 --> 02:05:33.030 align:start position:0%
marking ham
 
02:05:36.209 --> 02:05:36.219 align:start position:0%
do you have it by county to verify
 
02:05:52.410 --> 02:05:52.420 align:start position:0%
whether maybe if you'd like me to so yea
 
02:06:01.379 --> 02:06:01.389 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County for was up 30.7% so
 
02:06:04.200 --> 02:06:04.210 align:start position:0%
that that's transaction values that's
 
02:06:06.419 --> 02:06:06.429 align:start position:0%
not necessarily counts in front of me
 
02:06:07.629 --> 02:06:07.639 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:06:14.080 --> 02:06:14.090 align:start position:0%
so there was a spike for April which was
 
02:06:22.479 --> 02:06:22.489 align:start position:0%
March activity we don't have for me a
 
02:06:34.770 --> 02:06:34.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:41.859 --> 02:06:41.869 align:start position:0%
it looks like in April so for March
 
02:06:44.320 --> 02:06:44.330 align:start position:0%
activity in Belknap County
 
02:06:47.350 --> 02:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
Darryl Capponi gesture saw slight
 
02:06:51.129 --> 02:06:51.139 align:start position:0%
reduction colas saw a reduction wrapped
 
02:06:53.439 --> 02:06:53.449 align:start position:0%
and saw an increase Hillsboro saw an
 
02:06:55.750 --> 02:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
increase Merrimack saw a decrease in
 
02:06:58.510 --> 02:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
Rockingham saw an increase Stratford was
 
02:07:01.240 --> 02:07:01.250 align:start position:0%
a decrease in Sullivan was a decrease so
 
02:07:07.510 --> 02:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
it's mixed across the state yeah and I
 
02:07:09.550 --> 02:07:09.560 align:start position:0%
just pulled up in merry so amazed a
 
02:07:15.700 --> 02:07:15.710 align:start position:0%
little bit darker than than April had a
 
02:07:18.160 --> 02:07:18.170 align:start position:0%
fifteen point seven percent increase so
 
02:07:20.020 --> 02:07:20.030 align:start position:0%
they were good in Stratford had a forty
 
02:07:22.629 --> 02:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
two point five percent increase but all
 
02:07:24.490 --> 02:07:24.500 align:start position:0%
the other counties were down Carol was
 
02:07:25.870 --> 02:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
down 30 percent
 
02:07:29.430 --> 02:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
Cheshire are down 51 percent COAS down
 
02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:33.530 align:start position:0%
50 percent grafton down 15% Hillsboro
 
02:07:37.390 --> 02:07:37.400 align:start position:0%
down 21% Merrimack down 25% Rockingham
 
02:07:40.780 --> 02:07:40.790 align:start position:0%
down 26% in Sullivan down twelve point
 
02:07:42.609 --> 02:07:42.619 align:start position:0%
three percent for total counties being
 
02:07:50.050 --> 02:07:50.060 align:start position:0%
down 19.4% in activity okay that timing
 
02:07:52.450 --> 02:07:52.460 align:start position:0%
impact kind of catching up with us of
 
02:07:56.979 --> 02:07:56.989 align:start position:0%
those sales process have already kind of
 
02:07:58.930 --> 02:07:58.940 align:start position:0%
worked their way through and now we're
 
02:08:00.850 --> 02:08:00.860 align:start position:0%
seeing the reduction what it looked like
 
02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:02.810 align:start position:0%
right it looked like there was a slight
 
02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:04.850 align:start position:0%
again March but leveled off and I've
 
02:08:06.250 --> 02:08:06.260 align:start position:0%
done it the dipstick
 
02:08:13.270 --> 02:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
corrected itself the next month as a
 
02:08:18.330 --> 02:08:18.340 align:start position:0%
question yes when you talk about
 
02:08:20.770 --> 02:08:20.780 align:start position:0%
transactions sure that includes
 
02:08:25.229 --> 02:08:25.239 align:start position:0%
refinancing does it or does it not that
 
02:08:29.410 --> 02:08:29.420 align:start position:0%
does not so real estate transfer tax is
 
02:08:32.529 --> 02:08:32.539 align:start position:0%
only when you change property or the
 
02:08:35.859 --> 02:08:35.869 align:start position:0%
real estate changes hands yeah but let's
 
02:08:41.319 --> 02:08:41.329 align:start position:0%
yeah but I hate you at that phrase if a
 
02:08:45.399 --> 02:08:45.409 align:start position:0%
person is doing say from a trust to the
 
02:08:47.439 --> 02:08:47.449 align:start position:0%
person and then back to the trust
 
02:08:48.879 --> 02:08:48.889 align:start position:0%
they're paying the real estate transfer
 
02:08:50.439 --> 02:08:50.449 align:start position:0%
tax because it's going from two
 
02:08:53.890 --> 02:08:53.900 align:start position:0%
different people which most you know if
 
02:09:00.899 --> 02:09:00.909 align:start position:0%
it's a revocable trust is that correct
 
02:09:04.149 --> 02:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
you can think of it if the deed needs to
 
02:09:07.629 --> 02:09:07.639 align:start position:0%
be recorded at the county then the tax
 
02:09:11.290 --> 02:09:11.300 align:start position:0%
is paid so some of the transactions
 
02:09:14.979 --> 02:09:14.989 align:start position:0%
could be going from the revocable trust
 
02:09:16.870 --> 02:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
back to the person for the mortgage and
 
02:09:20.649 --> 02:09:20.659 align:start position:0%
then back to the revocable trust the
 
02:09:26.529 --> 02:09:26.539 align:start position:0%
county yep some of that's false money
 
02:09:30.580 --> 02:09:30.590 align:start position:0%
it's not real indicate indication of an
 
02:09:33.459 --> 02:09:33.469 align:start position:0%
actual I mean well it's an actual
 
02:09:36.100 --> 02:09:36.110 align:start position:0%
transaction but it's not a sale of
 
02:09:39.430 --> 02:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
property or a purchase of new property
 
02:09:50.050 --> 02:09:50.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:52.700 --> 02:09:52.710 align:start position:0%
any other questions on Rhett otherwise
 
02:09:59.990 --> 02:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
we'll move to utility property tax all
 
02:10:04.060 --> 02:10:04.070 align:start position:0%
right moving on utility property tax um
 
02:10:08.149 --> 02:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
this one is probably the first tax that
 
02:10:10.490 --> 02:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk that hasn't been
 
02:10:12.530 --> 02:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
affected that we've seen by Cove in
 
02:10:17.209 --> 02:10:17.219 align:start position:0%
nineteen at this point anyways as you
 
02:10:20.180 --> 02:10:20.190 align:start position:0%
know there is a there is a lag in how
 
02:10:22.490 --> 02:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
assessments are due for UPT so what
 
02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:26.610 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are paying right now are
 
02:10:28.459 --> 02:10:28.469 align:start position:0%
they're paying estimates based on
 
02:10:35.479 --> 02:10:35.489 align:start position:0%
assessments done December 2019 that
 
02:10:37.130 --> 02:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
works as they paid their assessments
 
02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:38.610 align:start position:0%
they just Trude up in their January
 
02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:42.210 align:start position:0%
payment for their 2019 prior to that
 
02:10:44.209 --> 02:10:44.219 align:start position:0%
they're paying on their 2018 so right
 
02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
now estimates that are being made for
 
02:10:50.330 --> 02:10:50.340 align:start position:0%
April and June are based on their 2019
 
02:10:51.950 --> 02:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
in the same with September and December
 
02:10:54.500 --> 02:10:54.510 align:start position:0%
will be based on the 2019 assessments
 
02:10:58.459 --> 02:10:58.469 align:start position:0%
and then in January 2021 when they get
 
02:11:02.209 --> 02:11:02.219 align:start position:0%
their new assessment from December 2020
 
02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
they'll true up any difference that's
 
02:11:07.250 --> 02:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
there if they overpay typically they'll
 
02:11:10.550 --> 02:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
put that into a credit and carry that to
 
02:11:13.070 --> 02:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
offset the future estimates if they
 
02:11:14.570 --> 02:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
don't have enough then they'll receive a
 
02:11:20.419 --> 02:11:20.429 align:start position:0%
payment in January so looking right now
 
02:11:22.490 --> 02:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
fiscal year-to-date where 3.3 percent
 
02:11:26.930 --> 02:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
demo plan and and fiscally a date well
 
02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:30.690 align:start position:0%
5.9 percent ahead of prior year you can
 
02:11:33.590 --> 02:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
see that in April we were done 12% and
 
02:11:37.189 --> 02:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
in May we anticipate being down 24% this
 
02:11:38.510 --> 02:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't have anything to do with
 
02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:41.130 align:start position:0%
people's ability to pay or anything to
 
02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:43.890 align:start position:0%
do with Cova 19 this is really taxpayers
 
02:11:46.939 --> 02:11:46.949 align:start position:0%
have some credits on file that we saw
 
02:11:48.890 --> 02:11:48.900 align:start position:0%
the usage of April we know that those
 
02:11:52.580 --> 02:11:52.590 align:start position:0%
credits are May is a small month let me
 
02:11:54.050 --> 02:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
just note that if you look down it's
 
02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
only a million dollar a month so even
 
02:11:58.430 --> 02:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
though it says 24 percent it's not
 
02:12:02.220 --> 02:12:02.230 align:start position:0%
$200,000 but we anticipate them
 
02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:05.410 align:start position:0%
utilizing that those credits from May in
 
02:12:10.740 --> 02:12:10.750 align:start position:0%
June and then July through December we
 
02:12:13.110 --> 02:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
don't anticipate any reduction and again
 
02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:15.490 align:start position:0%
that's based on the timing of what we
 
02:12:18.890 --> 02:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
had said on when the assessed values are
 
02:12:21.420 --> 02:12:21.430 align:start position:0%
done and when their estimates are paying
 
02:12:23.130 --> 02:12:23.140 align:start position:0%
so since those estimates are not being
 
02:12:25.590 --> 02:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
adjusted July through December because
 
02:12:28.560 --> 02:12:28.570 align:start position:0%
they're paying on prior year assessments
 
02:12:29.550 --> 02:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
and they already know what they're
 
02:12:31.350 --> 02:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
paying for those months we don't see any
 
02:12:33.660 --> 02:12:33.670 align:start position:0%
adjustment until June which is when
 
02:12:36.930 --> 02:12:36.940 align:start position:0%
they're true up payment occurs based on
 
02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:39.930 align:start position:0%
the December 2020
 
02:12:45.770 --> 02:12:45.780 align:start position:0%
valuations and we do we do anticipate
 
02:12:49.860 --> 02:12:49.870 align:start position:0%
potentially a 10% reduction in January
 
02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:52.690 align:start position:0%
and then continuing that 10% reduction
 
02:12:54.780 --> 02:12:54.790 align:start position:0%
through April and June on those
 
02:12:59.310 --> 02:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
assessments and that's just based on
 
02:13:02.420 --> 02:13:02.430 align:start position:0%
very preliminary assessment information
 
02:13:04.950 --> 02:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
so you'll see for fiscal year 20 we
 
02:13:08.340 --> 02:13:08.350 align:start position:0%
anticipate it being down 1.6% 1.6
 
02:13:10.290 --> 02:13:10.300 align:start position:0%
million excuse me and then fiscal year
 
02:13:22.890 --> 02:13:22.900 align:start position:0%
21 2.3 percent decrease taxes you can I
 
02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:27.130 align:start position:0%
guess the business taxes you can tell
 
02:13:30.900 --> 02:13:30.910 align:start position:0%
what credits they these businesses have
 
02:13:32.940 --> 02:13:32.950 align:start position:0%
on file because there's a limited number
 
02:13:36.030 --> 02:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
of them yeah this is this is a much much
 
02:13:39.300 --> 02:13:39.310 align:start position:0%
smaller group of people to analyze and
 
02:13:41.130 --> 02:13:41.140 align:start position:0%
look at much easier to follow those
 
02:13:42.890 --> 02:13:42.900 align:start position:0%
trends and follow what they're using
 
02:13:45.540 --> 02:13:45.550 align:start position:0%
versus business taxes well you're you're
 
02:13:48.300 --> 02:13:48.310 align:start position:0%
talking about taxes 16,000 taxpayers
 
02:13:52.530 --> 02:13:52.540 align:start position:0%
with credits versus just a handful here
 
02:13:57.420 --> 02:13:57.430 align:start position:0%
with credits and do you have indications
 
02:14:00.110 --> 02:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
that there will be new taxable property
 
02:14:03.690 --> 02:14:03.700 align:start position:0%
constructed or does it depend on things
 
02:14:07.860 --> 02:14:07.870 align:start position:0%
like us passing the the bill about net
 
02:14:07.870 --> 02:14:10.489 align:start position:0%
like us passing the the bill about net
metering

02:14:10.489 --> 02:14:10.499 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:12.469 --> 02:14:12.479 align:start position:0%
I'm Lindsay do you wanna feel that
 
02:14:15.950 --> 02:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
question sure I mean we're always kind
 
02:14:18.890 --> 02:14:18.900 align:start position:0%
of watching what's going on in terms of
 
02:14:20.810 --> 02:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
taxable property at these estimates
 
02:14:23.839 --> 02:14:23.849 align:start position:0%
don't anticipate any drastic changes in
 
02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:25.650 align:start position:0%
the underlying amount of taxable
 
02:14:29.810 --> 02:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
property that currently exists thank you
 
02:14:33.859 --> 02:14:33.869 align:start position:0%
I think you've got it as a consideration
 
02:14:37.399 --> 02:14:37.409 align:start position:0%
for variation we're always monitoring
 
02:14:43.279 --> 02:14:43.289 align:start position:0%
what's going on hey Andy I don't see any
 
02:14:50.979 --> 02:14:50.989 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:54.799 --> 02:14:54.809 align:start position:0%
okay so the first thing we did with
 
02:14:57.379 --> 02:14:57.389 align:start position:0%
business taxes was we made a slight
 
02:15:04.180 --> 02:15:04.190 align:start position:0%
reduction 2.5 percent to fiscal year 20
 
02:15:07.279 --> 02:15:07.289 align:start position:0%
plan just to kind of right-size it so
 
02:15:10.219 --> 02:15:10.229 align:start position:0%
again even without kovat we anticipated
 
02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
based on what we had seen through
 
02:15:13.549 --> 02:15:13.559 align:start position:0%
February that we might come in slightly
 
02:15:15.620 --> 02:15:15.630 align:start position:0%
below plans so we made that 2.5%
 
02:15:19.129 --> 02:15:19.139 align:start position:0%
adjustment first next we made
 
02:15:22.609 --> 02:15:22.619 align:start position:0%
adjustments based on assumptions about
 
02:15:24.410 --> 02:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
the possible effects of COBIT on
 
02:15:27.799 --> 02:15:27.809 align:start position:0%
business activity and that was done by
 
02:15:30.830 --> 02:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
payment type very similar to what I was
 
02:15:33.770 --> 02:15:33.780 align:start position:0%
talking about with IND we make specific
 
02:15:36.890 --> 02:15:36.900 align:start position:0%
and different adjustments for estimates
 
02:15:40.100 --> 02:15:40.110 align:start position:0%
extensions returns and tax notices based
 
02:15:43.009 --> 02:15:43.019 align:start position:0%
on the underlying activity that would
 
02:15:46.609 --> 02:15:46.619 align:start position:0%
occur the additional complication with
 
02:15:49.310 --> 02:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
business taxes is unlike the interest in
 
02:15:52.729 --> 02:15:52.739 align:start position:0%
dividends tax where almost all taxpayers
 
02:15:55.339 --> 02:15:55.349 align:start position:0%
are on a calendar year business
 
02:15:58.009 --> 02:15:58.019 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are on a variety of fiscal
 
02:16:00.109 --> 02:16:00.119 align:start position:0%
years we've talked about this before but
 
02:16:01.910 --> 02:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
approximately 90 percent follow a
 
02:16:04.370 --> 02:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
calendar year but then a fiscal year
 
02:16:07.430 --> 02:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
ending 630 and then a fiscal year ending
 
02:16:12.259 --> 02:16:12.269 align:start position:0%
9:30 are two other very popular fiscal
 
02:16:15.770 --> 02:16:15.780 align:start position:0%
year ends so we do additional analysis
 
02:16:18.620 --> 02:16:18.630 align:start position:0%
to take into account the timing of
 
02:16:21.529 --> 02:16:21.539 align:start position:0%
estimates and returns and extensions for
 
02:16:24.050 --> 02:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
those alternate fiscal year
 
02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:26.130 align:start position:0%
that don't follow the calendar year as
 
02:16:31.430 --> 02:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
well so again looking at the underlying
 
02:16:34.820 --> 02:16:34.830 align:start position:0%
business activity when the COBIT
 
02:16:37.370 --> 02:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
pandemic would impact business activity
 
02:16:40.459 --> 02:16:40.469 align:start position:0%
and then projecting when or analyzing
 
02:16:42.860 --> 02:16:42.870 align:start position:0%
when that change in business activity
 
02:16:47.419 --> 02:16:47.429 align:start position:0%
would be seen in revenues that resulted
 
02:16:48.860 --> 02:16:48.870 align:start position:0%
in the same analysis that we've been
 
02:16:50.270 --> 02:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
talking about with which is a
 
02:16:54.080 --> 02:16:54.090 align:start position:0%
month-by-month variation also similar to
 
02:16:55.970 --> 02:16:55.980 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax we did need to
 
02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:00.090 align:start position:0%
adjust for the TIR or the guidance that
 
02:17:02.450 --> 02:17:02.460 align:start position:0%
the department put out allowing certain
 
02:17:06.500 --> 02:17:06.510 align:start position:0%
tax payers to move their return and
 
02:17:09.440 --> 02:17:09.450 align:start position:0%
estimate payments from April 15th to
 
02:17:14.510 --> 02:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
June 15th we saw a number of tax payers
 
02:17:18.589 --> 02:17:18.599 align:start position:0%
that will make that shift we also saw
 
02:17:21.770 --> 02:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
some tax payers that likely didn't
 
02:17:25.669 --> 02:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
qualify to make that shift also making
 
02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:27.330 align:start position:0%
minute shift and so those tax payers
 
02:17:28.790 --> 02:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
will be subject to penalties and
 
02:17:30.830 --> 02:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
interest but we've accounted for those
 
02:17:33.440 --> 02:17:33.450 align:start position:0%
additional tax payers moving their
 
02:17:36.650 --> 02:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
payments till June one bit of good news
 
02:17:39.050 --> 02:17:39.060 align:start position:0%
is that when we looked at the tax payers
 
02:17:42.260 --> 02:17:42.270 align:start position:0%
that paid in April they paid for the
 
02:17:43.730 --> 02:17:43.740 align:start position:0%
most part they paid more than they did
 
02:17:46.120 --> 02:17:46.130 align:start position:0%
in the prior year so I think
 
02:17:48.350 --> 02:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
representative abirami made this point
 
02:17:52.160 --> 02:17:52.170 align:start position:0%
you know calendar year 2020 our calendar
 
02:17:54.709 --> 02:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
year in 2019 excuse me was a good year
 
02:17:58.220 --> 02:17:58.230 align:start position:0%
this pandemic is coming off of a good
 
02:18:02.419 --> 02:18:02.429 align:start position:0%
time for businesses and so that will
 
02:18:04.970 --> 02:18:04.980 align:start position:0%
help kind of sustain our revenues for
 
02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
some period of time and there will be a
 
02:18:09.919 --> 02:18:09.929 align:start position:0%
delayed impact on when we see the impact
 
02:18:12.589 --> 02:18:12.599 align:start position:0%
from Koch vid on revenues unlike M&amp;R
 
02:18:14.270 --> 02:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
where we're seeing it almost immediately
 
02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:17.010 align:start position:0%
the impact on business taxes because of
 
02:18:18.709 --> 02:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
how they're paid will be slightly
 
02:18:23.360 --> 02:18:23.370 align:start position:0%
delayed I represented major headers hand
 
02:18:27.490 --> 02:18:27.500 align:start position:0%
up but he's taking it down is that I
 
02:18:31.270 --> 02:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
said no I had a question relative to the
 
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
18.7 man subject to penalties and
 
02:18:42.379 --> 02:18:42.389 align:start position:0%
interest so for that eighteen point
 
02:18:44.780 --> 02:18:44.790 align:start position:0%
seven million that we anticipated to see
 
02:18:46.430 --> 02:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
in April that we're hoping is going to
 
02:18:48.860 --> 02:18:48.870 align:start position:0%
show up in June that will be subject to
 
02:18:50.720 --> 02:18:50.730 align:start position:0%
interest in penalties because they did
 
02:18:52.879 --> 02:18:52.889 align:start position:0%
not qualify to make that shift in
 
02:18:58.610 --> 02:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
revenue and we're not sure whether
 
02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:01.050 align:start position:0%
they'll pay in June or not fingers
 
02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
crossed we're hoping the ball clip and
 
02:19:11.720 --> 02:19:11.730 align:start position:0%
my own okay the other question I have is
 
02:19:15.050 --> 02:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
the bulk of the taxes the business taxes
 
02:19:18.910 --> 02:19:18.920 align:start position:0%
that are due in 2020 the result of
 
02:19:24.470 --> 02:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
businesses results at 2019 correct and
 
02:19:27.140 --> 02:19:27.150 align:start position:0%
you show that you made an adjustment of
 
02:19:34.430 --> 02:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
two and a half percent if all the
 
02:19:41.930 --> 02:19:41.940 align:start position:0%
indications I saw was that 2019 was oh I
 
02:19:47.959 --> 02:19:47.969 align:start position:0%
see is better but the thing is the
 
02:19:52.761 --> 02:19:52.771 align:start position:0%
federal tax cut yes it was responsible
 
02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
for that okay right so that that two and
 
02:19:57.230 --> 02:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
a half percent that's a good question
 
02:19:58.970 --> 02:19:58.980 align:start position:0%
and an important point so thank you for
 
02:20:02.020 --> 02:20:02.030 align:start position:0%
bringing that two and a half percent
 
02:20:07.790 --> 02:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
reduction to plan really is around the
 
02:20:10.730 --> 02:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
amount on the surplus statement that was
 
02:20:14.030 --> 02:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
anticipated for our synchronization with
 
02:20:18.440 --> 02:20:18.450 align:start position:0%
the Internal Revenue Code we hadn't
 
02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:20.730 align:start position:0%
anticipated or the surplus statement the
 
02:20:23.301 --> 02:20:23.311 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates anticipated a pretty
 
02:20:25.880 --> 02:20:25.890 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money resulting
 
02:20:27.590 --> 02:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
from conformity to the Internal Revenue
 
02:20:30.470 --> 02:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
Code and based on what we were seeing we
 
02:20:31.800 --> 02:20:31.810 align:start position:0%
felt like that number was a little
 
02:20:34.740 --> 02:20:34.750 align:start position:0%
hi so that's what that 2.5% adjustment
 
02:20:43.109 --> 02:20:43.119 align:start position:0%
is okay yes thank you um so you'll see
 
02:20:47.760 --> 02:20:47.770 align:start position:0%
on this slide that again
 
02:20:50.729 --> 02:20:50.739 align:start position:0%
unlike meals and rentals tax but similar
 
02:20:53.729 --> 02:20:53.739 align:start position:0%
to interested in given the changes in
 
02:20:55.620 --> 02:20:55.630 align:start position:0%
each month are not going to follow a
 
02:20:58.620 --> 02:20:58.630 align:start position:0%
linear trend because we're looking at
 
02:21:00.120 --> 02:21:00.130 align:start position:0%
the specific payments that will be made
 
02:21:02.280 --> 02:21:02.290 align:start position:0%
in the individual months and adjusting
 
02:21:04.349 --> 02:21:04.359 align:start position:0%
based on the underlying economic
 
02:21:06.030 --> 02:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
activity or business activity for that
 
02:21:08.309 --> 02:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
time period so you will see fluctuations
 
02:21:12.719 --> 02:21:12.729 align:start position:0%
month-to-month but we do trend a gradual
 
02:21:15.960 --> 02:21:15.970 align:start position:0%
improvement in at the end of 2021
 
02:21:19.410 --> 02:21:19.420 align:start position:0%
although the start of 2021 is is
 
02:21:28.050 --> 02:21:28.060 align:start position:0%
definitely impacted by kovin why why do
 
02:21:32.189 --> 02:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
you think that payments will be coming
 
02:21:35.580 --> 02:21:35.590 align:start position:0%
in lower through what is usually a
 
02:21:37.979 --> 02:21:37.989 align:start position:0%
really low period anyway in July August
 
02:21:44.519 --> 02:21:44.529 align:start position:0%
and then in as well in September which
 
02:21:48.420 --> 02:21:48.430 align:start position:0%
is a quarterly estimate period great and
 
02:21:51.420 --> 02:21:51.430 align:start position:0%
might be the first time that we'd we'd
 
02:21:54.120 --> 02:21:54.130 align:start position:0%
see people a lot of people adjusting
 
02:21:58.019 --> 02:21:58.029 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't have adjusted before right
 
02:22:00.599 --> 02:22:00.609 align:start position:0%
so September is that estimate payment is
 
02:22:02.760 --> 02:22:02.770 align:start position:0%
going to be for July August and
 
02:22:07.439 --> 02:22:07.449 align:start position:0%
September yes it's kind of hidden in
 
02:22:09.990 --> 02:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
here because of the shift from April to
 
02:22:15.929 --> 02:22:15.939 align:start position:0%
June showing a 10% reduction compared to
 
02:22:18.479 --> 02:22:18.489 align:start position:0%
plan but if you if we were looking at
 
02:22:22.349 --> 02:22:22.359 align:start position:0%
say just estimates in June for into a
 
02:22:25.800 --> 02:22:25.810 align:start position:0%
more dramatic reduction because June
 
02:22:28.469 --> 02:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
will be for April May and June activity
 
02:22:32.250 --> 02:22:32.260 align:start position:0%
yes the peak impact from kovat at least
 
02:22:35.269 --> 02:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
based on what we were anticipating and
 
02:22:40.319 --> 02:22:40.329 align:start position:0%
so that September reduction is an
 
02:22:44.460 --> 02:22:44.470 align:start position:0%
improvement what we anticipated
 
02:22:47.280 --> 02:22:47.290 align:start position:0%
or a reduction in estimates that we're
 
02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:49.210 align:start position:0%
gonna see in June but that's kind of
 
02:22:57.679 --> 02:22:57.689 align:start position:0%
hard to see but we were talking earlier
 
02:23:01.639 --> 02:23:01.649 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:06.990 --> 02:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
people businesses tending not to react
 
02:23:10.050 --> 02:23:10.060 align:start position:0%
mate until at least September when
 
02:23:17.700 --> 02:23:17.710 align:start position:0%
something major happens to them I mean I
 
02:23:22.620 --> 02:23:22.630 align:start position:0%
think that's going to depend on the cash
 
02:23:26.309 --> 02:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
that a business has on hand I mean they
 
02:23:28.469 --> 02:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
think that they don't need to adjust
 
02:23:30.599 --> 02:23:30.609 align:start position:0%
their June estimate and they have the
 
02:23:33.660 --> 02:23:33.670 align:start position:0%
cash on hand to make that payment then
 
02:23:35.820 --> 02:23:35.830 align:start position:0%
they do so into your point their
 
02:23:37.260 --> 02:23:37.270 align:start position:0%
adjustments will start to show in
 
02:23:41.610 --> 02:23:41.620 align:start position:0%
September but it will be it'll it'll be
 
02:23:43.650 --> 02:23:43.660 align:start position:0%
important for us to analyze what we
 
02:23:47.510 --> 02:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
receive in June yes
 
02:23:50.910 --> 02:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you we have to supplement
 
02:23:52.920 --> 02:23:52.930 align:start position:0%
that a little bit represented I mean I
 
02:23:55.170 --> 02:23:55.180 align:start position:0%
think we did consideration I think we
 
02:23:57.240 --> 02:23:57.250 align:start position:0%
thought that in December that they would
 
02:24:01.110 --> 02:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
be looking at that versus in September
 
02:24:04.320 --> 02:24:04.330 align:start position:0%
that in December they would be making
 
02:24:06.870 --> 02:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
their adjustments at that point when
 
02:24:08.429 --> 02:24:08.439 align:start position:0%
maybe there's more funds available and
 
02:24:11.179 --> 02:24:11.189 align:start position:0%
they really know what they look like
 
02:24:13.559 --> 02:24:13.569 align:start position:0%
which is why the reduction isn't so
 
02:24:15.710 --> 02:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
great in December
 
02:24:19.559 --> 02:24:19.569 align:start position:0%
compared to $10 where it's where it's
 
02:24:23.790 --> 02:24:23.800 align:start position:0%
much deeper September in June so you
 
02:24:26.610 --> 02:24:26.620 align:start position:0%
expect people to look in December to be
 
02:24:30.420 --> 02:24:30.430 align:start position:0%
able to feel that hey we're doing ok
 
02:24:33.719 --> 02:24:33.729 align:start position:0%
after all and we owe more so we're gonna
 
02:24:38.040 --> 02:24:38.050 align:start position:0%
pay it back yeah essentially that or
 
02:24:40.530 --> 02:24:40.540 align:start position:0%
even to look at they may not make their
 
02:24:42.269 --> 02:24:42.279 align:start position:0%
June payment and they may not make their
 
02:24:44.099 --> 02:24:44.109 align:start position:0%
September payment and they may just true
 
02:24:46.349 --> 02:24:46.359 align:start position:0%
that up in December when your business
 
02:24:49.260 --> 02:24:49.270 align:start position:0%
situation is a little bit better and
 
02:24:52.830 --> 02:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
they know where they stand with funds on
 
02:24:55.050 --> 02:24:55.060 align:start position:0%
file at that point before the return is
 
02:24:57.210 --> 02:24:57.220 align:start position:0%
due sort of to avoid avoid the penalty
 
02:24:57.220 --> 02:24:59.969 align:start position:0%
due sort of to avoid avoid the penalty
situation

02:24:59.969 --> 02:24:59.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:02.920 --> 02:25:02.930 align:start position:0%
so you only charge penalty if they
 
02:25:09.819 --> 02:25:09.829 align:start position:0%
haven't paid before On January of the
 
02:25:13.599 --> 02:25:13.609 align:start position:0%
next year I lived in a state once for
 
02:25:17.260 --> 02:25:17.270 align:start position:0%
six months they got me for income tax
 
02:25:22.410 --> 02:25:22.420 align:start position:0%
and my grandmother's estate settled
 
02:25:25.780 --> 02:25:25.790 align:start position:0%
halfway through that the time that I was
 
02:25:29.050 --> 02:25:29.060 align:start position:0%
with them and they did interest and
 
02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:31.010 align:start position:0%
penalties on me for not having done it
 
02:25:34.090 --> 02:25:34.100 align:start position:0%
for an estimated tax that I hadn't even
 
02:25:39.429 --> 02:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
been there for they're not like that I
 
02:25:45.340 --> 02:25:45.350 align:start position:0%
know but we charge we charge interest in
 
02:25:48.490 --> 02:25:48.500 align:start position:0%
penalties only if they try to show up in
 
02:25:52.030 --> 02:25:52.040 align:start position:0%
January or February the next year if
 
02:25:53.679 --> 02:25:53.689 align:start position:0%
they file would the return they're going
 
02:25:57.760 --> 02:25:57.770 align:start position:0%
to get they'll be they'll get under
 
02:26:00.309 --> 02:26:00.319 align:start position:0%
payment of estimate penalty versus if
 
02:26:03.099 --> 02:26:03.109 align:start position:0%
they're paying in their quarterly
 
02:26:10.290 --> 02:26:10.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:12.770 align:start position:0%
so obviously taking everything into
 
02:26:14.469 --> 02:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
account we're projecting that fiscal
 
02:26:22.149 --> 02:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
year 2020 little bit better than that I
 
02:26:25.809 --> 02:26:25.819 align:start position:0%
think we're estimating that 9 million it
 
02:26:27.399 --> 02:26:27.409 align:start position:0%
looks like we're currently down about
 
02:26:30.250 --> 02:26:30.260 align:start position:0%
seven so we may be performing slightly
 
02:26:32.139 --> 02:26:32.149 align:start position:0%
better than we anticipated for May but
 
02:26:33.969 --> 02:26:33.979 align:start position:0%
looking at about a hundred and fifteen
 
02:26:35.830 --> 02:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
million for business taxes for fiscal
 
02:26:38.080 --> 02:26:38.090 align:start position:0%
year twenty and then fiscal year 21
 
02:26:46.370 --> 02:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:49.080 --> 02:26:49.090 align:start position:0%
okay we have three people with their
 
02:26:52.830 --> 02:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
hands raised now representing Romney to
 
02:26:55.740 --> 02:26:55.750 align:start position:0%
two questions first a tempest - 10 % of
 
02:26:58.460 --> 02:26:58.470 align:start position:0%
Jim so let's make sure I understand its
 
02:27:01.950 --> 02:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
you're saying that the estimates for the
 
02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:04.890 align:start position:0%
first quarter going to be outweigh the
 
02:27:10.310 --> 02:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:18.450 --> 02:27:18.460 align:start position:0%
so what we're anticipating your first
 
02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:20.410 align:start position:0%
for many businesses your first and
 
02:27:23.250 --> 02:27:23.260 align:start position:0%
second quarter estimates so your April
 
02:27:26.910 --> 02:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
and plus your April return or an
 
02:27:31.500 --> 02:27:31.510 align:start position:0%
extension amount and so the minus 10% is
 
02:27:34.950 --> 02:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
essentially the net of positive returns
 
02:27:36.900 --> 02:27:36.910 align:start position:0%
and extensions coming out of calendar
 
02:27:40.020 --> 02:27:40.030 align:start position:0%
year 19 coupled with yes a reduction in
 
02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:44.410 align:start position:0%
estimates for first in second quarter of
 
02:27:46.890 --> 02:27:46.900 align:start position:0%
2020 okay that makes sense to me
 
02:27:49.590 --> 02:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
actually all right then
 
02:27:54.330 --> 02:27:54.340 align:start position:0%
there's no question I'm just I'm big on
 
02:27:58.080 --> 02:27:58.090 align:start position:0%
the you know the fact that the business
 
02:28:00.660 --> 02:28:00.670 align:start position:0%
tax is a limited number companies I mean
 
02:28:02.910 --> 02:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
I don't trying all we talk about all the
 
02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:05.770 align:start position:0%
time and you know I mentioned
 
02:28:08.820 --> 02:28:08.830 align:start position:0%
manufacturing or my sense is that a lot
 
02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:12.370 align:start position:0%
of manufacturing company stayed open now
 
02:28:15.180 --> 02:28:15.190 align:start position:0%
I also know that the oil industry for
 
02:28:18.900 --> 02:28:18.910 align:start position:0%
instance took a big hit the last couple
 
02:28:20.910 --> 02:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
of months they closed their factories
 
02:28:24.420 --> 02:28:24.430 align:start position:0%
down so and I'm assuming that we make a
 
02:28:26.370 --> 02:28:26.380 align:start position:0%
lot of medium-sized companies that make
 
02:28:28.890 --> 02:28:28.900 align:start position:0%
components that go into things and I
 
02:28:30.660 --> 02:28:30.670 align:start position:0%
would imagine we have components that go
 
02:28:34.260 --> 02:28:34.270 align:start position:0%
into automobiles as an example so I
 
02:28:36.600 --> 02:28:36.610 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm getting at is I mean have
 
02:28:40.160 --> 02:28:40.170 align:start position:0%
you looked at it if you look at this by
 
02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:44.410 align:start position:0%
industry category what they produce
 
02:28:46.500 --> 02:28:46.510 align:start position:0%
you can we can't look at that because
 
02:28:48.590 --> 02:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
that would get us into the granular
 
02:28:52.230 --> 02:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
discussion but if you try to look at our
 
02:28:54.990 --> 02:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
top companies and say well what business
 
02:28:56.580 --> 02:28:56.590 align:start position:0%
is what are they really producing and
 
02:28:56.970 --> 02:28:56.980 align:start position:0%
would that
 
02:29:00.810 --> 02:29:00.820 align:start position:0%
affected by this magic we have beer
 
02:29:02.520 --> 02:29:02.530 align:start position:0%
company a big large beer company here
 
02:29:05.940 --> 02:29:05.950 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't impacted by this and that
 
02:29:09.331 --> 02:29:09.341 align:start position:0%
they kept on producing but there may be
 
02:29:12.930 --> 02:29:12.940 align:start position:0%
other companies that that produce for
 
02:29:16.020 --> 02:29:16.030 align:start position:0%
the Defense Department that also may not
 
02:29:18.451 --> 02:29:18.461 align:start position:0%
have been affected as much by this but
 
02:29:20.150 --> 02:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
there are others that are producing
 
02:29:22.470 --> 02:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
components of things that may have been
 
02:29:24.650 --> 02:29:24.660 align:start position:0%
impacted so did you look at that at all
 
02:29:27.331 --> 02:29:27.341 align:start position:0%
we did we did start to look at that and
 
02:29:29.761 --> 02:29:29.771 align:start position:0%
we will continue to look at it we need
 
02:29:31.440 --> 02:29:31.450 align:start position:0%
to your point we really need to do that
 
02:29:34.140 --> 02:29:34.150 align:start position:0%
on a taxpayer by taxpayer basis and so
 
02:29:35.911 --> 02:29:35.921 align:start position:0%
therefore we're likely to do it for the
 
02:29:39.570 --> 02:29:39.580 align:start position:0%
largest taxpayers only because and we've
 
02:29:42.900 --> 02:29:42.910 align:start position:0%
talked about this before the there's no
 
02:29:46.381 --> 02:29:46.391 align:start position:0%
reliable way for us to know what
 
02:29:50.640 --> 02:29:50.650 align:start position:0%
industry our taxpayers fall into we have
 
02:29:53.461 --> 02:29:53.471 align:start position:0%
a line on our return for them to
 
02:29:57.331 --> 02:29:57.341 align:start position:0%
indicate their industry code but there's
 
02:29:59.251 --> 02:29:59.261 align:start position:0%
no obligation for them to fill that out
 
02:30:01.680 --> 02:30:01.690 align:start position:0%
accurately and we've found issues with
 
02:30:04.791 --> 02:30:04.801 align:start position:0%
that data so we do really rely on a
 
02:30:07.770 --> 02:30:07.780 align:start position:0%
taxpayer by taxpayer analysis for our
 
02:30:11.461 --> 02:30:11.471 align:start position:0%
largest taxpayers and we do look at what
 
02:30:13.650 --> 02:30:13.660 align:start position:0%
industry do we think they operate in to
 
02:30:15.451 --> 02:30:15.461 align:start position:0%
your point about manufacturing where in
 
02:30:18.270 --> 02:30:18.280 align:start position:0%
the supply chain are they and what has
 
02:30:20.511 --> 02:30:20.521 align:start position:0%
the impact been on that supply chain
 
02:30:23.570 --> 02:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
because that might impact the timing of
 
02:30:27.150 --> 02:30:27.160 align:start position:0%
the pandemic on their specific business
 
02:30:29.761 --> 02:30:29.771 align:start position:0%
so we have started to do that and as we
 
02:30:32.701 --> 02:30:32.711 align:start position:0%
get more returns and estimates coming in
 
02:30:34.890 --> 02:30:34.900 align:start position:0%
now in June we'll be able to expand that
 
02:30:40.801 --> 02:30:40.811 align:start position:0%
analysis that's basically to say here
 
02:30:45.051 --> 02:30:45.061 align:start position:0%
about thank you okay represent extreme
 
02:30:49.131 --> 02:30:49.141 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
 
02:30:53.180 --> 02:30:53.190 align:start position:0%
about two thousand businesses received
 
02:30:59.850 --> 02:30:59.860 align:start position:0%
PPP forgivable loans which of course
 
02:31:03.360 --> 02:31:03.370 align:start position:0%
aren't taxable federally I think that
 
02:31:05.911 --> 02:31:05.921 align:start position:0%
the best information we have is that
 
02:31:08.010 --> 02:31:08.020 align:start position:0%
they will be taxable
 
02:31:12.630 --> 02:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
or be et and be PT and there's 400
 
02:31:18.660 --> 02:31:18.670 align:start position:0%
million in Main Street grants coming
 
02:31:22.080 --> 02:31:22.090 align:start position:0%
into effect to replace lost profits for
 
02:31:26.130 --> 02:31:26.140 align:start position:0%
businesses that haven't done as well
 
02:31:28.950 --> 02:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
this year as last year you know even
 
02:31:31.040 --> 02:31:31.050 align:start position:0%
though they may have reduced cost by
 
02:31:33.840 --> 02:31:33.850 align:start position:0%
having fewer employees they've lost more
 
02:31:37.800 --> 02:31:37.810 align:start position:0%
in revenue and so on so make that up I'm
 
02:31:39.660 --> 02:31:39.670 align:start position:0%
not sure whether that would be taxable
 
02:31:43.139 --> 02:31:43.149 align:start position:0%
or not of those two I mean I think those
 
02:31:45.529 --> 02:31:45.539 align:start position:0%
two programs together represent a lot of
 
02:31:48.990 --> 02:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
G New Hampshire businesses and if
 
02:31:52.319 --> 02:31:52.329 align:start position:0%
they're both taxable I you know I wonder
 
02:31:55.260 --> 02:31:55.270 align:start position:0%
how that would factor in to this
 
02:32:00.920 --> 02:32:00.930 align:start position:0%
estimate for fiscal year 21 BT and BT
 
02:32:05.189 --> 02:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
business taxes thank you sure that's a
 
02:32:08.429 --> 02:32:08.439 align:start position:0%
very good question we have not
 
02:32:11.099 --> 02:32:11.109 align:start position:0%
specifically in these estimates 421
 
02:32:13.410 --> 02:32:13.420 align:start position:0%
taken those two programs into the into
 
02:32:16.639 --> 02:32:16.649 align:start position:0%
account although we are monitoring them
 
02:32:20.340 --> 02:32:20.350 align:start position:0%
and you are correct so with the PPP
 
02:32:23.460 --> 02:32:23.470 align:start position:0%
loans if that loan is forgivable it
 
02:32:25.979 --> 02:32:25.989 align:start position:0%
essentially turns into a grant and while
 
02:32:28.800 --> 02:32:28.810 align:start position:0%
not taxable federally that grant is
 
02:32:31.740 --> 02:32:31.750 align:start position:0%
taxable at the state level same with
 
02:32:33.960 --> 02:32:33.970 align:start position:0%
these Main Street business grants lows
 
02:32:36.750 --> 02:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
will be taxable as revenue what will
 
02:32:40.109 --> 02:32:40.119 align:start position:0%
ultimately determine any potential
 
02:32:42.479 --> 02:32:42.489 align:start position:0%
revenue impact will be how businesses
 
02:32:45.809 --> 02:32:45.819 align:start position:0%
spend those brands because if they have
 
02:32:47.969 --> 02:32:47.979 align:start position:0%
expenses that qualify as business
 
02:32:50.849 --> 02:32:50.859 align:start position:0%
deductions you could essentially have
 
02:32:52.979 --> 02:32:52.989 align:start position:0%
the revenue and increase your deductions
 
02:32:55.469 --> 02:32:55.479 align:start position:0%
and they'll net out to zero so it'll
 
02:32:57.269 --> 02:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
really depend on what businesses do with
 
02:32:57.750 --> 02:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
that money
 
02:32:59.700 --> 02:32:59.710 align:start position:0%
if they take in the revenue and hold it
 
02:33:02.340 --> 02:33:02.350 align:start position:0%
for a rainy day and they don't have a
 
02:33:04.559 --> 02:33:04.569 align:start position:0%
deductible expense then yes that would
 
02:33:10.260 --> 02:33:10.270 align:start position:0%
impact their their taxable amount so we
 
02:33:12.120 --> 02:33:12.130 align:start position:0%
are continuing and have started to and
 
02:33:13.410 --> 02:33:13.420 align:start position:0%
will continue to kind of put together
 
02:33:17.010 --> 02:33:17.020 align:start position:0%
and keep track of all of the federal
 
02:33:19.229 --> 02:33:19.239 align:start position:0%
programs that are happening and what we
 
02:33:20.540 --> 02:33:20.550 align:start position:0%
think the impact
 
02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:22.770 align:start position:0%
to revenues will be especially as we
 
02:33:25.670 --> 02:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
move into 2021 because some things will
 
02:33:27.770 --> 02:33:27.780 align:start position:0%
be direct potential direct impacts like
 
02:33:30.110 --> 02:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
you mentioned with the grants others may
 
02:33:32.929 --> 02:33:32.939 align:start position:0%
be things that just help spur the
 
02:33:36.889 --> 02:33:36.899 align:start position:0%
economy or help under the underlying
 
02:33:39.440 --> 02:33:39.450 align:start position:0%
economy and so we may not see a direct
 
02:33:42.320 --> 02:33:42.330 align:start position:0%
you know that grant is taxable impact
 
02:33:44.570 --> 02:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
but we may see if there's another round
 
02:33:47.630 --> 02:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
of stimulus checks we may say okay maybe
 
02:33:49.429 --> 02:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
when those stimulus checks come if
 
02:33:51.050 --> 02:33:51.060 align:start position:0%
restaurants are open maybe we'll see
 
02:33:52.969 --> 02:33:52.979 align:start position:0%
more people go out to dinner and we
 
02:33:55.849 --> 02:33:55.859 align:start position:0%
should factor that in or at least
 
02:33:58.760 --> 02:33:58.770 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that we may see an impact an
 
02:34:01.219 --> 02:34:01.229 align:start position:0%
indirect impact from revenue from those
 
02:34:03.320 --> 02:34:03.330 align:start position:0%
federal stimulus programs so we are
 
02:34:07.870 --> 02:34:07.880 align:start position:0%
monitoring all of those thank you
 
02:34:10.420 --> 02:34:10.430 align:start position:0%
represent major has a question
 
02:34:14.599 --> 02:34:14.609 align:start position:0%
q my question has to do with this
 
02:34:16.429 --> 02:34:16.439 align:start position:0%
summary of estimates for the business
 
02:34:23.570 --> 02:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
taxes in April the actual was down close
 
02:34:26.240 --> 02:34:26.250 align:start position:0%
to 40 percent and that's primarily new
 
02:34:29.780 --> 02:34:29.790 align:start position:0%
to the deferral of the taxes in June so
 
02:34:36.290 --> 02:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
I look at June of 2020 and I look at its
 
02:34:41.420 --> 02:34:41.430 align:start position:0%
Dow 14 million dollars from the plan my
 
02:34:44.420 --> 02:34:44.430 align:start position:0%
question is on the D FDR a revised
 
02:34:46.370 --> 02:34:46.380 align:start position:0%
estimate which sells one hundred and
 
02:34:49.700 --> 02:34:49.710 align:start position:0%
twenty six point six million coming in
 
02:34:53.030 --> 02:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
how much of that is due to the deferred
 
02:34:57.139 --> 02:34:57.149 align:start position:0%
payment I would assume that the deferred
 
02:35:02.330 --> 02:35:02.340 align:start position:0%
payment added to I even if you were down
 
02:35:08.540 --> 02:35:08.550 align:start position:0%
10 percent almost make that been down so
 
02:35:12.500 --> 02:35:12.510 align:start position:0%
that's my question just trying to see if
 
02:35:17.809 --> 02:35:17.819 align:start position:0%
I have that amount quickly so we are
 
02:35:20.480 --> 02:35:20.490 align:start position:0%
assuming a shift of forty eight point
 
02:35:27.679 --> 02:35:27.689 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:32.449 --> 02:35:32.459 align:start position:0%
and that's a combination of 29.5 or
 
02:35:37.550 --> 02:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
almost 30 million of just the the
 
02:35:39.469 --> 02:35:39.479 align:start position:0%
general shift from April to June for
 
02:35:42.170 --> 02:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
those taxpayers that qualified plus
 
02:35:44.239 --> 02:35:44.249 align:start position:0%
eighteen point seven million from
 
02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:47.010 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who didn't qualify for the
 
02:35:48.710 --> 02:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
relief but it looks like they're taking
 
02:35:50.420 --> 02:35:50.430 align:start position:0%
advantage of it anyway and like I said
 
02:35:51.859 --> 02:35:51.869 align:start position:0%
they won't those will be subject to
 
02:36:00.760 --> 02:36:00.770 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:03.620 --> 02:36:03.630 align:start position:0%
so the eighteen point two will include
 
02:36:08.679 --> 02:36:08.689 align:start position:0%
the penalties and interest yes
 
02:36:11.239 --> 02:36:11.249 align:start position:0%
approximately I mean these are estimates
 
02:36:13.279 --> 02:36:13.289 align:start position:0%
based on what we anticipate but yes
 
02:36:14.779 --> 02:36:14.789 align:start position:0%
those will be subject to penalties and
 
02:36:20.300 --> 02:36:20.310 align:start position:0%
interest and so the shift will help
 
02:36:22.399 --> 02:36:22.409 align:start position:0%
mitigate the loss that we're
 
02:36:25.630 --> 02:36:25.640 align:start position:0%
anticipating from estimate payments
 
02:36:28.399 --> 02:36:28.409 align:start position:0%
because these would be q2 estimates
 
02:36:30.739 --> 02:36:30.749 align:start position:0%
estimate payments like I said for April
 
02:36:34.340 --> 02:36:34.350 align:start position:0%
May and June activity and for many many
 
02:36:36.790 --> 02:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
businesses that's really the bottom
 
02:36:41.120 --> 02:36:41.130 align:start position:0%
hopefully of what they're gonna see and
 
02:36:45.019 --> 02:36:45.029 align:start position:0%
so the shift helps to mitigate that loss
 
02:36:51.469 --> 02:36:51.479 align:start position:0%
that we were anticipating and part of
 
02:36:55.069 --> 02:36:55.079 align:start position:0%
the penalties and interest at least is
 
02:36:59.359 --> 02:36:59.369 align:start position:0%
likely not to be collectible before the
 
02:37:02.359 --> 02:37:02.369 align:start position:0%
next fiscal year but the auditors at any
 
02:37:07.029 --> 02:37:07.039 align:start position:0%
rate will in the kafirs send it back
 
02:37:10.340 --> 02:37:10.350 align:start position:0%
right so depending on the timing of when
 
02:37:12.050 --> 02:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
that revenue is received to your point
 
02:37:14.449 --> 02:37:14.459 align:start position:0%
about the kafir' yes there is a window
 
02:37:17.359 --> 02:37:17.369 align:start position:0%
of 60 days currently so July in August
 
02:37:20.029 --> 02:37:20.039 align:start position:0%
the revenue received in July in August
 
02:37:22.250 --> 02:37:22.260 align:start position:0%
we do an analysis to determine whether
 
02:37:24.199 --> 02:37:24.209 align:start position:0%
the underlying business activity for
 
02:37:26.569 --> 02:37:26.579 align:start position:0%
that revenue was related to new
 
02:37:30.500 --> 02:37:30.510 align:start position:0%
enterprise but yes be part of our
 
02:37:39.780 --> 02:37:39.790 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:39.790 --> 02:37:50.699 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:37:50.699 --> 02:37:50.709 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:54.459 --> 02:37:54.469 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm trying to get rid of that fun
 
02:37:59.409 --> 02:37:59.419 align:start position:0%
on rap surnames has a question yeah
 
02:38:00.550 --> 02:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:38:04.300 --> 02:38:04.310 align:start position:0%
I actually have two questions I'll start
 
02:38:06.999 --> 02:38:07.009 align:start position:0%
with the immediate one from that
 
02:38:11.050 --> 02:38:11.060 align:start position:0%
conversation you just had 18 million
 
02:38:15.389 --> 02:38:15.399 align:start position:0%
dollars or so that should have been paid
 
02:38:19.269 --> 02:38:19.279 align:start position:0%
the obvious question is why it seems
 
02:38:23.260 --> 02:38:23.270 align:start position:0%
like you're assuming that the answer to
 
02:38:27.389 --> 02:38:27.399 align:start position:0%
the why is not significant to our
 
02:38:31.659 --> 02:38:31.669 align:start position:0%
projections but I I wonder if you've had
 
02:38:34.420 --> 02:38:34.430 align:start position:0%
any information from the businesses who
 
02:38:37.389 --> 02:38:37.399 align:start position:0%
failed to pay these are probably pretty
 
02:38:41.499 --> 02:38:41.509 align:start position:0%
big big places or whether you have a
 
02:38:44.670 --> 02:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:47.519 --> 02:38:47.529 align:start position:0%
eighteen point two million dollars in
 
02:38:50.349 --> 02:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
taxes that were owed we're not paid on
 
02:38:52.569 --> 02:38:52.579 align:start position:0%
time and the taxpayers are now we're
 
02:38:54.789 --> 02:38:54.799 align:start position:0%
going to have to pay a penalty assuming
 
02:38:57.909 --> 02:38:57.919 align:start position:0%
they're able to pay the tax itself sure
 
02:39:02.529 --> 02:39:02.539 align:start position:0%
so those businesses just as a reminder
 
02:39:06.579 --> 02:39:06.589 align:start position:0%
that we're due to pay in April but may
 
02:39:13.630 --> 02:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
not have they in 2018 owed fifty
 
02:39:16.809 --> 02:39:16.819 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars or more in tax so it's
 
02:39:18.969 --> 02:39:18.979 align:start position:0%
really those in the bottom portion of
 
02:39:22.209 --> 02:39:22.219 align:start position:0%
that triangle the large tax payers and I
 
02:39:24.340 --> 02:39:24.350 align:start position:0%
think what's contributing to not making
 
02:39:26.260 --> 02:39:26.270 align:start position:0%
that payment in April and hopefully
 
02:39:28.630 --> 02:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
making the payment in June is the fact
 
02:39:33.039 --> 02:39:33.049 align:start position:0%
that the federal date was extended until
 
02:39:36.789 --> 02:39:36.799 align:start position:0%
July 15 and so for many of these very
 
02:39:39.039 --> 02:39:39.049 align:start position:0%
large tax payers they really need the
 
02:39:41.139 --> 02:39:41.149 align:start position:0%
information from their federal returns
 
02:39:43.239 --> 02:39:43.249 align:start position:0%
in order to determine their state
 
02:39:46.719 --> 02:39:46.729 align:start position:0%
returns and we know that in many
 
02:39:46.729 --> 02:39:48.020 align:start position:0%
returns and we know that in many
instances

02:39:48.020 --> 02:39:48.030 align:start position:0%
instances
 
02:39:49.700 --> 02:39:49.710 align:start position:0%
even though it's a lot of money to New
 
02:39:53.001 --> 02:39:53.011 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when you compare the amount
 
02:39:55.400 --> 02:39:55.410 align:start position:0%
that some of these tax payers Oh to much
 
02:39:56.961 --> 02:39:56.971 align:start position:0%
larger states like New York and
 
02:40:00.740 --> 02:40:00.750 align:start position:0%
California they may do their own
 
02:40:02.841 --> 02:40:02.851 align:start position:0%
analysis and say it may be worth the
 
02:40:04.310 --> 02:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
penalty the small amount of penalties
 
02:40:07.671 --> 02:40:07.681 align:start position:0%
and interest in New Hampshire and we're
 
02:40:09.470 --> 02:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
okay with that but we need to prepare
 
02:40:11.301 --> 02:40:11.311 align:start position:0%
our federal return first and deal with
 
02:40:13.580 --> 02:40:13.590 align:start position:0%
our larger states before dealing with
 
02:40:15.381 --> 02:40:15.391 align:start position:0%
you Hampshire so I do think it's the
 
02:40:17.211 --> 02:40:17.221 align:start position:0%
impact of the federal return not being
 
02:40:21.230 --> 02:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
due until July 15th that's a good answer
 
02:40:24.530 --> 02:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
I like that answer yeah doesn't have it
 
02:40:28.910 --> 02:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't have repercussions I think so my
 
02:40:33.251 --> 02:40:33.261 align:start position:0%
my I guess larger question is I think
 
02:40:37.640 --> 02:40:37.650 align:start position:0%
before seeing your your estimates I I
 
02:40:39.560 --> 02:40:39.570 align:start position:0%
had assumed I think others that assume
 
02:40:41.961 --> 02:40:41.971 align:start position:0%
that we may be seem to be seeing a high
 
02:40:44.421 --> 02:40:44.431 align:start position:0%
and low we talked a little bit about
 
02:40:46.370 --> 02:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
that in the interest and dividends
 
02:40:51.320 --> 02:40:51.330 align:start position:0%
discussion and I guess my question to
 
02:40:57.080 --> 02:40:57.090 align:start position:0%
you is have you sort of have you served
 
02:41:01.060 --> 02:41:01.070 align:start position:0%
ballparks on on best case worst case
 
02:41:04.370 --> 02:41:04.380 align:start position:0%
you've given us a single number here and
 
02:41:08.060 --> 02:41:08.070 align:start position:0%
maybe we're going to want to move into
 
02:41:11.060 --> 02:41:11.070 align:start position:0%
us a best case worst case I think going
 
02:41:14.150 --> 02:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
into this exercise our assumption was
 
02:41:17.480 --> 02:41:17.490 align:start position:0%
that we would do that and I'm wondering
 
02:41:19.690 --> 02:41:19.700 align:start position:0%
if you've done it and can help us think
 
02:41:24.350 --> 02:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
about best case worst case sure we have
 
02:41:28.430 --> 02:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
not done that analysis yet and that's
 
02:41:30.290 --> 02:41:30.300 align:start position:0%
really I think based on the fact that
 
02:41:34.430 --> 02:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
June is going to hopefully tell us a lot
 
02:41:36.890 --> 02:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
of information and will allow us the
 
02:41:40.490 --> 02:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
better formulate ranges of highs and
 
02:41:44.330 --> 02:41:44.340 align:start position:0%
lows as I mentioned when we started this
 
02:41:46.280 --> 02:41:46.290 align:start position:0%
presentation we've had to make a number
 
02:41:48.410 --> 02:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
of assumptions just to get to these
 
02:41:52.551 --> 02:41:52.561 align:start position:0%
numbers and I think it would have just
 
02:41:54.801 --> 02:41:54.811 align:start position:0%
been a whole other level of assumptions
 
02:41:57.140 --> 02:41:57.150 align:start position:0%
to get to highs and lows without that
 
02:41:59.810 --> 02:41:59.820 align:start position:0%
data coming out of June and so I think
 
02:42:01.440 --> 02:42:01.450 align:start position:0%
like I said we can take
 
02:42:03.660 --> 02:42:03.670 align:start position:0%
June data take what we've done here and
 
02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:07.570 align:start position:0%
then better formulate ranges but we were
 
02:42:11.370 --> 02:42:11.380 align:start position:0%
trying to just get some some numbers out
 
02:42:15.390 --> 02:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
here and keeping our assumptions
 
02:42:18.750 --> 02:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
although they were significant to a
 
02:42:22.020 --> 02:42:22.030 align:start position:0%
minimum if possible so my hope I'm July
 
02:42:24.900 --> 02:42:24.910 align:start position:0%
will be better able to do ranges for 21
 
02:42:28.290 --> 02:42:28.300 align:start position:0%
yeah I understand that we've got the
 
02:42:28.950 --> 02:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
same problem
 
02:42:31.171 --> 02:42:31.181 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm we're gonna have better numbers
 
02:42:34.710 --> 02:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
in two weeks three weeks in three weeks
 
02:42:37.381 --> 02:42:37.391 align:start position:0%
we'll have better numbers that will shed
 
02:42:42.570 --> 02:42:42.580 align:start position:0%
a lot of light on this I think it'll be
 
02:42:49.860 --> 02:42:49.870 align:start position:0%
more more like a month and so now we've
 
02:42:58.040 --> 02:42:58.050 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:00.960 --> 02:43:00.970 align:start position:0%
madam chair will we be receiving a copy
 
02:43:05.330 --> 02:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
of this slideshow presentation thank you
 
02:43:08.460 --> 02:43:08.470 align:start position:0%
the slideshow presentation you have a
 
02:43:11.430 --> 02:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
copy of the slideshow presentation with
 
02:43:16.341 --> 02:43:16.351 align:start position:0%
the one it came from Chris Shea twice I
 
02:43:18.930 --> 02:43:18.940 align:start position:0%
didn't see it the first time the second
 
02:43:23.011 --> 02:43:23.021 align:start position:0%
time was Monday and there is one
 
02:43:28.680 --> 02:43:28.690 align:start position:0%
exception on it which is the a changed
 
02:43:31.140 --> 02:43:31.150 align:start position:0%
on page five for interest and dividends
 
02:43:35.220 --> 02:43:35.230 align:start position:0%
tax thank you which went from ninety six
 
02:43:40.350 --> 02:43:40.360 align:start position:0%
percent to eighty eight percent yeah
 
02:43:41.880 --> 02:43:41.890 align:start position:0%
we've got that already
 
02:43:41.890 --> 02:43:45.230 align:start position:0%
we've got that already
[Music]

02:43:45.230 --> 02:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:47.580 --> 02:43:47.590 align:start position:0%
Southworth has his hand up and now
 
02:43:50.790 --> 02:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
there's another thank you for taking my
 
02:43:50.800 --> 02:43:51.390 align:start position:0%
there's another thank you for taking my
question

02:43:51.390 --> 02:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:43:54.301 --> 02:43:54.311 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if I missed it did you would
 
02:43:56.460 --> 02:43:56.470 align:start position:0%
all consider what might happen if
 
02:43:59.250 --> 02:43:59.260 align:start position:0%
unemployment is extended especially the
 
02:44:04.350 --> 02:44:04.360 align:start position:0%
extra $600 for that group of people we
 
02:44:07.830 --> 02:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
did not consider that specifically here
 
02:44:13.819 --> 02:44:13.829 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:18.139 --> 02:44:18.149 align:start position:0%
thank you we have senator bra me what I
 
02:44:20.580 --> 02:44:20.590 align:start position:0%
represent astronomers common about the
 
02:44:26.010 --> 02:44:26.020 align:start position:0%
PPE if I guess the role was 75% I say if
 
02:44:29.160 --> 02:44:29.170 align:start position:0%
they use 75% to keep people on the
 
02:44:31.830 --> 02:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
payroll that the grant will happen I
 
02:44:32.760 --> 02:44:32.770 align:start position:0%
guess that's one of the requirements
 
02:44:36.269 --> 02:44:36.279 align:start position:0%
anyway which to me dat and as we
 
02:44:38.849 --> 02:44:38.859 align:start position:0%
discussed that's taxable income
 
02:44:44.370 --> 02:44:44.380 align:start position:0%
standpoint or from a being key
 
02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:48.010 align:start position:0%
standpoint is that is that correct yes
 
02:44:52.439 --> 02:44:52.449 align:start position:0%
that's correct so do we know maybe one
 
02:44:54.239 --> 02:44:54.249 align:start position:0%
thing we can do and I would imagine most
 
02:44:56.670 --> 02:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
companies that get it will indeed keep
 
02:44:59.010 --> 02:44:59.020 align:start position:0%
their employees on you know even if you
 
02:45:03.840 --> 02:45:03.850 align:start position:0%
say ninety percent that do we if we can
 
02:45:05.960 --> 02:45:05.970 align:start position:0%
find out how much PP may have done us
 
02:45:11.399 --> 02:45:11.409 align:start position:0%
not much PPP was allocated to New
 
02:45:13.800 --> 02:45:13.810 align:start position:0%
Hampshire companies and we can kind of
 
02:45:15.960 --> 02:45:15.970 align:start position:0%
work backwards to see you know that
 
02:45:18.210 --> 02:45:18.220 align:start position:0%
impacts now I know we have
 
02:45:20.479 --> 02:45:20.489 align:start position:0%
multinationals that may be harder to do
 
02:45:23.189 --> 02:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
but I don't think they were eligible did
 
02:45:25.380 --> 02:45:25.390 align:start position:0%
the larger I think publicly traded
 
02:45:28.080 --> 02:45:28.090 align:start position:0%
companies weren't involved today they
 
02:45:32.729 --> 02:45:32.739 align:start position:0%
weren't supposed to be so we can take
 
02:45:34.769 --> 02:45:34.779 align:start position:0%
that information and do some rough
 
02:45:36.899 --> 02:45:36.909 align:start position:0%
calculations and kind of balance that
 
02:45:40.019 --> 02:45:40.029 align:start position:0%
against the unemployment numbers cuz
 
02:45:42.029 --> 02:45:42.039 align:start position:0%
again it's a mitigating factor against
 
02:45:44.069 --> 02:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
the drop that we're likely to see due to
 
02:45:50.160 --> 02:45:50.170 align:start position:0%
unemployment yes and we've got to look
 
02:45:53.309 --> 02:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
at the unemployment vs. how many jobs
 
02:45:57.359 --> 02:45:57.369 align:start position:0%
there were before mm-hmm to deal with
 
02:46:02.399 --> 02:46:02.409 align:start position:0%
that as well it's it gets pretty
 
02:46:04.559 --> 02:46:04.569 align:start position:0%
complicated if you try to go down into
 
02:46:06.569 --> 02:46:06.579 align:start position:0%
sectors unfortunately because they use
 
02:46:09.239 --> 02:46:09.249 align:start position:0%
different sectors to to report the
 
02:46:12.559 --> 02:46:12.569 align:start position:0%
unemployment than they do the employment
 
02:46:17.840 --> 02:46:17.850 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:22.800 --> 02:46:22.810 align:start position:0%
okay we're out of questions on that okay
 
02:46:24.540 --> 02:46:24.550 align:start position:0%
so just the last slide is very similar
 
02:46:26.011 --> 02:46:26.021 align:start position:0%
to the slides at the beginning
 
02:46:28.711 --> 02:46:28.721 align:start position:0%
it's really just a summary so this slide
 
02:46:31.711 --> 02:46:31.721 align:start position:0%
here just summaries summarizes by the
 
02:46:35.730 --> 02:46:35.740 align:start position:0%
tags type actual for April what we
 
02:46:38.131 --> 02:46:38.141 align:start position:0%
anticipate for May with just a few days
 
02:46:40.860 --> 02:46:40.870 align:start position:0%
left here and then what we anticipate
 
02:46:44.131 --> 02:46:44.141 align:start position:0%
for again you'll see at the very end
 
02:46:46.470 --> 02:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
overall we're anticipating one hundred
 
02:46:47.850 --> 02:46:47.860 align:start position:0%
and thirty five point eight million
 
02:46:50.400 --> 02:46:50.410 align:start position:0%
dollar reduction compared to plan in
 
02:46:52.711 --> 02:46:52.721 align:start position:0%
revenue for April to June which is
 
02:46:54.871 --> 02:46:54.881 align:start position:0%
approximately twenty three percent and
 
02:46:57.030 --> 02:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
then the next slide is just a high-level
 
02:46:59.400 --> 02:46:59.410 align:start position:0%
summary and this is exactly what's on
 
02:47:01.621 --> 02:47:01.631 align:start position:0%
the first page of fiscal year twenty and
 
02:47:08.491 --> 02:47:08.501 align:start position:0%
fiscal year twenty one so you're looking
 
02:47:10.831 --> 02:47:10.841 align:start position:0%
this seems to be where the governor's
 
02:47:14.341 --> 02:47:14.351 align:start position:0%
conviction that we will have more than a
 
02:47:15.690 --> 02:47:15.700 align:start position:0%
six percent decline
 
02:47:20.310 --> 02:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
comes from correct so this is very close
 
02:47:24.871 --> 02:47:24.881 align:start position:0%
to a six percent decline I will note
 
02:47:27.631 --> 02:47:27.641 align:start position:0%
that the triggers for the business tax
 
02:47:31.020 --> 02:47:31.030 align:start position:0%
rates are all revenue all general and
 
02:47:33.991 --> 02:47:34.001 align:start position:0%
education trust fund revenue so not DRA
 
02:47:37.350 --> 02:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
revenues exactly other than what's in
 
02:47:41.371 --> 02:47:41.381 align:start position:0%
here and also it is the revenue based on
 
02:47:42.751 --> 02:47:42.761 align:start position:0%
the comprehensive annual financial
 
02:47:46.110 --> 02:47:46.120 align:start position:0%
report or the kafir' that is issued in
 
02:47:49.171 --> 02:47:49.181 align:start position:0%
December and if snapper takes into
 
02:47:51.690 --> 02:47:51.700 align:start position:0%
account some of those accounting
 
02:47:54.241 --> 02:47:54.251 align:start position:0%
adjustments or accrual adjustments and
 
02:47:58.621 --> 02:47:58.631 align:start position:0%
so we will be watching that very
 
02:48:01.801 --> 02:48:01.811 align:start position:0%
carefully so I there is a chance based
 
02:48:04.980 --> 02:48:04.990 align:start position:0%
on projections at this point that what
 
02:48:07.860 --> 02:48:07.870 align:start position:0%
we see on a cash basis at the end of
 
02:48:12.690 --> 02:48:12.700 align:start position:0%
June well will or will not trigger that
 
02:48:15.030 --> 02:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
the business tax rate changes but it's
 
02:48:16.980 --> 02:48:16.990 align:start position:0%
ultimately the Khafre number that takes
 
02:48:18.331 --> 02:48:18.341 align:start position:0%
into a CREP into account those
 
02:48:20.491 --> 02:48:20.501 align:start position:0%
accounting adjustments that is the the
 
02:48:22.591 --> 02:48:22.601 align:start position:0%
true trigger so we won't know until the
 
02:48:26.661 --> 02:48:26.671 align:start position:0%
half and it occurs to me that the large
 
02:48:30.841 --> 02:48:30.851 align:start position:0%
largest businesses that are waiting to
 
02:48:34.801 --> 02:48:34.811 align:start position:0%
file and pay until they have finished
 
02:48:38.610 --> 02:48:38.620 align:start position:0%
their July 15 federal returns and then
 
02:48:39.779 --> 02:48:39.789 align:start position:0%
broken it
 
02:48:43.079 --> 02:48:43.089 align:start position:0%
down to the states they may be paying us
 
02:48:46.169 --> 02:48:46.179 align:start position:0%
in August right so that is within the
 
02:48:48.089 --> 02:48:48.099 align:start position:0%
60-day window that we look at for the
 
02:48:51.059 --> 02:48:51.069 align:start position:0%
year before it will for the cat fur we
 
02:48:53.069 --> 02:48:53.079 align:start position:0%
will not know about that from cash in
 
02:48:56.219 --> 02:48:56.229 align:start position:0%
hand at the end of June correct which is
 
02:48:59.309 --> 02:48:59.319 align:start position:0%
right which is why depending on what
 
02:49:02.369 --> 02:49:02.379 align:start position:0%
cash looks like at the end of June the
 
02:49:03.779 --> 02:49:03.789 align:start position:0%
answer could be different in December
 
02:49:04.739 --> 02:49:04.749 align:start position:0%
when we make the final determination
 
02:49:08.399 --> 02:49:08.409 align:start position:0%
about the rates right perhaps we could
 
02:49:19.709 --> 02:49:19.719 align:start position:0%
try and estimate that we are going to
 
02:49:24.689 --> 02:49:24.699 align:start position:0%
ask all of the agencies every two months
 
02:49:29.609 --> 02:49:29.619 align:start position:0%
if they've got any changes in their
 
02:49:33.299 --> 02:49:33.309 align:start position:0%
estimates for for the business and
 
02:49:35.429 --> 02:49:35.439 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends taxes it looks
 
02:49:39.119 --> 02:49:39.129 align:start position:0%
like we need to ask about if there are
 
02:49:41.069 --> 02:49:41.079 align:start position:0%
any changes in the estimates they go
 
02:49:50.939 --> 02:49:50.949 align:start position:0%
back to 2020 also sure great againi I
 
02:49:54.719 --> 02:49:54.729 align:start position:0%
don't see any further questions thank
 
02:50:00.829 --> 02:50:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:06.809 --> 02:50:06.819 align:start position:0%
we are going to it's 20 past 12:00 so we
 
02:50:11.159 --> 02:50:11.169 align:start position:0%
have 40 minutes for lunch at one o'clock
 
02:50:14.309 --> 02:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
we should all be back and connected so
 
02:50:18.359 --> 02:50:18.369 align:start position:0%
that that we can listen to the people
 
02:50:21.659 --> 02:50:21.669 align:start position:0%
from the chambers for for half an hour
 
02:50:24.389 --> 02:50:24.399 align:start position:0%
and then we'll start in on all of the
 
02:50:29.399 --> 02:50:29.409 align:start position:0%
other taxes and revenues representative
 
02:50:32.760 --> 02:50:32.770 align:start position:0%
owl me if I may interject there are two
 
02:50:35.999 --> 02:50:36.009 align:start position:0%
hands up but yes finish first thank you
 
02:50:38.999 --> 02:50:39.009 align:start position:0%
I would just suggest if it's if people
 
02:50:40.469 --> 02:50:40.479 align:start position:0%
are comfortable with it they may just
 
02:50:42.989 --> 02:50:42.999 align:start position:0%
want to remain connected so they don't
 
02:50:45.269 --> 02:50:45.279 align:start position:0%
have to go through and find the the link
 
02:50:48.449 --> 02:50:48.459 align:start position:0%
to reconnect later I will end the
 
02:50:53.081 --> 02:50:53.091 align:start position:0%
recording but they they're free
 
02:50:55.600 --> 02:50:55.610 align:start position:0%
means to remain connected I'm not going
 
02:50:59.261 --> 02:50:59.271 align:start position:0%
to close the meeting right and I see
 
02:51:02.230 --> 02:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
that representative Lang has joined us
 
02:51:08.491 --> 02:51:08.501 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:08.501 --> 02:51:11.131 align:start position:0%
 
absolutely

02:51:11.131 --> 02:51:11.141 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
02:51:13.720 --> 02:51:13.730 align:start position:0%
Thank You chip mr. chairman I just want
 
02:51:15.461 --> 02:51:15.471 align:start position:0%
to tell I did join in way back when when
 
02:51:16.900 --> 02:51:16.910 align:start position:0%
you were talking about rooms and meals
 
02:51:18.551 --> 02:51:18.561 align:start position:0%
tax and I was listening to the
 
02:51:20.801 --> 02:51:20.811 align:start position:0%
conversation I will be missing the
 
02:51:22.390 --> 02:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
afternoon session only because I have
 
02:51:25.741 --> 02:51:25.751 align:start position:0%
the reopening taskforce meeting
 
02:51:39.251 --> 02:51:39.261 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that there should be a
 
02:51:43.241 --> 02:51:43.251 align:start position:0%
problem signing back on but if you want
 
02:51:44.320 --> 02:51:44.330 align:start position:0%
to just leave it running there's no
 
02:51:52.241 --> 02:51:52.251 align:start position:0%
problem with that either you can just
 
02:51:54.461 --> 02:51:54.471 align:start position:0%
minimize it like you would any other
 
02:52:00.341 --> 02:52:00.351 align:start position:0%
window if you're on a PC you go to you
 
02:52:02.291 --> 02:52:02.301 align:start position:0%
take the cursor up to the top and it
 
02:52:10.091 --> 02:52:10.101 align:start position:0%
gives you X it full screen are you on a
 
02:52:15.911 --> 02:52:15.921 align:start position:0%
PC or a Mac PC yes so you go up to the
 
02:52:19.001 --> 02:52:19.011 align:start position:0%
top of the screen with the cursor and
 
02:52:22.570 --> 02:52:22.580 align:start position:0%
the top bar shows up it goes away again
 
02:52:32.110 --> 02:52:32.120 align:start position:0%
unless you use that's okay are you
 
02:52:39.060 --> 02:52:39.070 align:start position:0%
moving the cursor to it yeah yeah talk
 
02:52:41.951 --> 02:52:41.961 align:start position:0%
yep don't worry don't worry also about
 
02:52:44.770 --> 02:52:44.780 align:start position:0%
you okay the other thing people might
 
02:52:47.230 --> 02:52:47.240 align:start position:0%
want to do is just stop your video and
 
02:52:52.890 --> 02:52:52.900 align:start position:0%
and make sure you're muted yep very good
 
02:52:59.411 --> 02:52:59.421 align:start position:0%
okay thank I think that's it
