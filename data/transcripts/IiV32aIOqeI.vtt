00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.350 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
I think we have our close to foam
 
00:09:19.009 --> 00:09:19.019 align:start position:0%
contingent of subcommittee members
 
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
um present so I guess
 
00:09:23.449 --> 00:09:23.459 align:start position:0%
um we can get started
 
00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:27.620 align:start position:0%
um this is a subcommittee meeting on
 
00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:32.060 align:start position:0%
retained Bill House Bill 437
 
00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
dealing with literacy
 
00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:36.430 align:start position:0%
dealing with literacy
um

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
and uh this subcommitting meetings are
 
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
more informal
 
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
um you know there might be some people
 
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
in the audience who wish to speak so we
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
can we can entertain that
 
00:09:54.769 --> 00:09:54.779 align:start position:0%
um but uh first I'd like to
 
00:09:59.810 --> 00:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
mention I've passed out uh and updated
 
00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:01.019 align:start position:0%
um draft
 
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
of HB 437
 
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:05.750 align:start position:0%
of HB 437
um

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
it is still a work in progress we're
 
00:10:11.449 --> 00:10:11.459 align:start position:0%
still tweaking it
 
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
um but we'll have the final Amendment
 
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
for our full committee
 
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
session in in November
 
00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:25.220 align:start position:0%
um so I'd like to uh first
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
start with
 
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.490 align:start position:0%
start with
um

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
why uh
 
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.050 align:start position:0%
why uh
um

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:36.260 align:start position:0%
went down the road with this legislation
 
00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
and it really
 
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:43.380 align:start position:0%
centers on what has happened or hasn't
 
00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:45.620 align:start position:0%
happened with reading across the country
 
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
for a few decades
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
and if we look at
 
00:10:51.959 --> 00:10:52.910 align:start position:0%
and if we look at
um

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
nape scores really can't see this too
 
00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
well and I'm sorry I didn't have copies
 
00:11:01.009 --> 00:11:01.019 align:start position:0%
for everybody but in fourth grade
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
reading in New Hampshire
 
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.150 align:start position:0%
reading in New Hampshire
and

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.970 align:start position:0%
and
1992

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:07.980 align:start position:0%
1992
 
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
the nape achievement level and reading
 
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
in the fourth grade was 38 percent
 
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
in 2022 it was 37 percent
 
00:11:22.009 --> 00:11:22.019 align:start position:0%
in the eighth grade
 
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:25.740 align:start position:0%
in 2009
 
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
it was actually in 2003 it was 40
 
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.569 align:start position:0%
it was actually in 2003 it was 40
percent

00:11:32.569 --> 00:11:32.579 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
in 2022 it was 33 percent
 
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.050 align:start position:0%
in 2022 it was 33 percent
so

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:39.650 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:43.740 align:start position:0%
we are not making progress
 
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
um I can
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
try and get copies for everybody this
 
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
this is a a chart of proficiency scores
 
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:54.860 align:start position:0%
in many of our schools
 
00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
comparing uh reading Proficiency in 2017
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
18 19 and 21.
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
um and I believe the current state
 
00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
average is something like 48.5
 
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.509 align:start position:0%
average is something like 48.5
proficiency

00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:11.519 --> 00:12:12.410 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
so that I think demonstrates the need
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
and the fact that really the Department
 
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
of Education has been working very hard
 
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:23.660 align:start position:0%
for several years
 
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:27.560 align:start position:0%
in trying to change the focus
 
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:33.140 align:start position:0%
of our literacy instruction in the state
 
00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:36.860 align:start position:0%
over the past decade
 
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
there's something like 26 states that
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
have passed legislation revamping the
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.269 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:54.060 align:start position:0%
and I have worked with uh some of
 
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:00.260 align:start position:0%
um people from those States most notably
 
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959 align:start position:0%
a lady who was in charge of the um
 
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
legislation in Mississippi where they
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
have seen the most dramatic changes in
 
00:13:13.129 --> 00:13:13.139 align:start position:0%
proficiency rates in their schools
 
00:13:13.139 --> 00:13:14.690 align:start position:0%
proficiency rates in their schools
um

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:14.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.250 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that department has
 
00:13:18.959 --> 00:13:20.210 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that department has
been

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:20.220 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:21.050 align:start position:0%
been
um

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:25.069 --> 00:13:25.079 align:start position:0%
doing is training in something called
 
00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:26.700 align:start position:0%
letters and I know
 
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
representative you've been involved in
 
00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.470 align:start position:0%
representative you've been involved in
that

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
um but I was at a letters
 
00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:36.980 align:start position:0%
meeting on Friday
 
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
and updated numbers were mentioned that
 
00:13:46.009 --> 00:13:46.019 align:start position:0%
over 3 000 people in New Hampshire have
 
00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
now been trained
 
00:13:51.129 --> 00:13:51.139 align:start position:0%
um via the letters program which really
 
00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:57.660 align:start position:0%
um evidence-based reading practices in
 
00:13:59.930 --> 00:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
the science of reading
 
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
um and they said that New Hampshire uh
 
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
far is Superior in what we're doing in
 
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
this Regard in the letters training to
 
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
any other state in the country which I
 
00:14:15.769 --> 00:14:15.779 align:start position:0%
thought was uh impressive
 
00:14:15.779 --> 00:14:16.490 align:start position:0%
thought was uh impressive
um

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:19.009 --> 00:14:19.019 align:start position:0%
so I think what I'd like to do is
 
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
um go through
 
00:14:23.449 --> 00:14:23.459 align:start position:0%
um the legislation and there's a few
 
00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
copies out there
 
00:14:28.129 --> 00:14:28.139 align:start position:0%
um if you want to follow along but I I
 
00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:32.339 align:start position:0%
highlighted several areas that I thought
 
00:14:35.569 --> 00:14:35.579 align:start position:0%
it was important to mention
 
00:14:38.769 --> 00:14:38.779 align:start position:0%
um and you'll see on the first page
 
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
number one is a universal reading
 
00:14:47.949 --> 00:14:47.959 align:start position:0%
screener for Local District use
 
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
we are still talking about screeners and
 
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
um which screener but
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
um I I believe that there will be
 
00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:01.009 align:start position:0%
um I I believe that there will be
um

00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:01.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
resources available for the state to
 
00:15:08.509 --> 00:15:08.519 align:start position:0%
help in providing readers to the local
 
00:15:08.519 --> 00:15:10.730 align:start position:0%
help in providing readers to the local
districts

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:10.740 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
um and one change
 
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
uh here that I think you'll see
 
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
underlying on your uh your page
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
um is that we're doing the screening in
 
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
K through three but three times a year
 
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
beginning middle and end of the year
 
00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:31.910 align:start position:0%
beginning middle and end of the year
um

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:34.129 --> 00:15:34.139 align:start position:0%
and some of these changes you'll notice
 
00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
uh this is for instance in italics
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
and someone we've been working closely
 
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.290 align:start position:0%
and someone we've been working closely
with

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
um is Dr Tolman from New Hampshire but
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
she is co-author of the letters program
 
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
so I think it's been um extremely
 
00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:57.959 align:start position:0%
valuable input for us to improve the
 
00:15:57.959 --> 00:15:59.509 align:start position:0%
valuable input for us to improve the
legislation

00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:01.009 align:start position:0%
legislation
and

00:16:01.009 --> 00:16:01.019 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
um so it's three times a year and you'll
 
00:16:07.449 --> 00:16:07.459 align:start position:0%
see some of the measurable skills
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
that should be concentrated on down
 
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
below that
 
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
also one of the other changes at the
 
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
bottom of the page is that we believe
 
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
the screener should be given within the
 
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
first 40 school days of the year
 
00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.170 align:start position:0%
first 40 school days of the year
and

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:30.899 align:start position:0%
um then uh also
 
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
um anyone coming into the school for the
 
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%
first time if they haven't been uh
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
they're not coming with any information
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
on their reading abilities should be
 
00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
screened also within the first uh 40
 
00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.870 align:start position:0%
screened also within the first uh 40
days

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:52.910 align:start position:0%
days
yes

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:01.610 align:start position:0%
totally different bill
 
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:06.710 align:start position:0%
totally different bill
[Laughter]

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.230 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:11.579 align:start position:0%
so if you turn over to the second page
 
00:17:15.049 --> 00:17:15.059 align:start position:0%
Roman 3 you'll see a number two
 
00:17:20.449 --> 00:17:20.459 align:start position:0%
and this involves the development of an
 
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
individual reading plan for those
 
00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:26.540 align:start position:0%
students who are not at an
 
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
age-appropriate Benchmark according to
 
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
the screening
 
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
and it details what should be included
 
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
in that plan
 
00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:39.500 align:start position:0%
including goals and benchmarks
 
00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:42.200 align:start position:0%
monitoring of progress
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
and I think one significant thing we did
 
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
in F
 
00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
um was to say that um
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
any instructional or intervention
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
programs shall not use the three queuing
 
00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
method which is the most prevalent
 
00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.930 align:start position:0%
method which is the most prevalent
method

00:17:59.930 --> 00:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
method
 
00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:01.980 align:start position:0%
um currently
 
00:18:06.049 --> 00:18:06.059 align:start position:0%
um really I think around the state and
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
in many states
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
who have not moved to the science of
 
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.789 align:start position:0%
who have not moved to the science of
reading

00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:12.799 align:start position:0%
reading
 
00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:14.470 align:start position:0%
reading
which

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
involves the student trying to learn to
 
00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:22.100 align:start position:0%
read getting cues rather than really
 
00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.710 align:start position:0%
read getting cues rather than really
using

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:23.720 align:start position:0%
using
 
00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:26.660 align:start position:0%
evidence-based research to
 
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
sound out the word and figure out what
 
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
the word is use cues like a picture to
 
00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
help them identify what the word is
 
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:38.750 align:start position:0%
help them identify what the word is
um

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:41.529 --> 00:18:41.539 align:start position:0%
so we don't want to
 
00:18:45.289 --> 00:18:45.299 align:start position:0%
continue using that framework for
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
reading but also I think important in
 
00:18:51.529 --> 00:18:51.539 align:start position:0%
the individual plan are strategies for
 
00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
the student parent to use
 
00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the things that we try
 
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
to incorporate into this I think that if
 
00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to really have a broad
 
00:19:07.549 --> 00:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
literacy Improvement program in the
 
00:19:09.529 --> 00:19:09.539 align:start position:0%
state that
 
00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:12.500 align:start position:0%
um everybody has to be involved
 
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
parents for sure but even
 
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:16.990 align:start position:0%
parents for sure but even
um

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
a little bit further on you'll see that
 
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
uh local districts should engage the
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
state stakeholders in the community as
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
to what is important and why we're doing
 
00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
um all this
 
00:19:30.179 --> 00:19:31.070 align:start position:0%
um all this
um

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
and it's not included in this but I have
 
00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:37.140 align:start position:0%
talked with the state librarian about
 
00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.770 align:start position:0%
talked with the state librarian about
future

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:38.780 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
expansion of a summer reading programs
 
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
and things like that possibly in the
 
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:49.970 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:49.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
so on to number three Roman four
 
00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:56.750 align:start position:0%
so on to number three Roman four
um

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:59.049 --> 00:19:59.059 align:start position:0%
if there is
 
00:20:02.529 --> 00:20:02.539 align:start position:0%
a deficiency noted
 
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
in the age-appropriate benchmarks that
 
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:09.110 align:start position:0%
in the age-appropriate benchmarks that
um

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
the parent is notified within 14 days
 
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
um and you'll see there
 
00:20:21.529 --> 00:20:21.539 align:start position:0%
um some of the
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
um things that should be discussed with
 
00:20:30.409 --> 00:20:30.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
um number four is Romans six
 
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
um and this is where we get into the
 
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:40.980 align:start position:0%
engagement of local stakeholders we also
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
specify that the department should hold
 
00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:47.940 align:start position:0%
periodic workshops for educators and
 
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
parents uh as they are doing currently
 
00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
with the the letters program
 
00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
but also the department should come up
 
00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.529 align:start position:0%
but also the department should come up
with

00:20:56.529 --> 00:20:56.539 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:00.500 align:start position:0%
guidance to the departments on
 
00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:02.940 align:start position:0%
evidence-based instructional materials
 
00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
so that the Departments have a a
 
00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
resource uh at least to begin with to
 
00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
see what they want to use in their
 
00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.630 align:start position:0%
see what they want to use in their
schools

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
um number five uh each School District
 
00:21:21.549 --> 00:21:21.559 align:start position:0%
show report annually
 
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
about the progress and you'll see
 
00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:25.860 align:start position:0%
there's three or four things listed
 
00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
there in terms of what has to be
 
00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
reported in these annual reports by the
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
school district
 
00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
um I I think that one of the problems
 
00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:40.500 align:start position:0%
uh or issues that we've seen for years
 
00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:42.260 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid that we had for third
 
00:21:48.049 --> 00:21:48.059 align:start position:0%
grade reading there was just money that
 
00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
went out to the district with no
 
00:21:54.049 --> 00:21:54.059 align:start position:0%
accountability or no information about
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
um progress other than that one year end
 
00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
of year report so here we want to keep
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
an eye on what
 
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
what is going on and how the each school
 
00:22:12.529 --> 00:22:12.539 align:start position:0%
district is moving forward with the
 
00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:19.789 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:30.409 --> 00:22:30.419 align:start position:0%
the department uh
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
I think is also responsible for a report
 
00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.409 align:start position:0%
I think is also responsible for a report
and

00:22:36.409 --> 00:22:36.419 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:39.169 --> 00:22:39.179 align:start position:0%
I think this is very important
 
00:22:39.179 --> 00:22:41.029 align:start position:0%
I think this is very important
um

00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
we talk about
 
00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:47.220 align:start position:0%
the teacher preparation programs
 
00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:49.490 align:start position:0%
the teacher preparation programs
and

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
we want we we can't do a whole lot as a
 
00:22:56.529 --> 00:22:56.539 align:start position:0%
state legislature to direct what the
 
00:22:59.090 --> 00:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
colleges are doing
 
00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
but we can ask them to report on what
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
they were doing
 
00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
um a couple of years ago
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
um this group called The National
 
00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:14.700 align:start position:0%
Council on teacher quality and ctq and
 
00:23:17.289 --> 00:23:17.299 align:start position:0%
they issued a major report
 
00:23:17.299 --> 00:23:18.850 align:start position:0%
they issued a major report
on

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:18.860 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
uh the app the movement toward the
 
00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
science of reading and evidence-based
 
00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:27.740 align:start position:0%
reading instruction
 
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
and it was interesting they rated
 
00:23:33.649 --> 00:23:33.659 align:start position:0%
each of the schools who returned the
 
00:23:33.659 --> 00:23:35.330 align:start position:0%
each of the schools who returned the
surveys

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
surveys
 
00:23:39.049 --> 00:23:39.059 align:start position:0%
and in New Hampshire there were four
 
00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:41.460 align:start position:0%
and I'll read you the name of the school
 
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
and the grade for 2023 that they were
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
assigned based on their survey
 
00:23:51.169 --> 00:23:51.179 align:start position:0%
Keen State got to be
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
Plymouth State got a D
 
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:55.980 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire University got an
 
00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:56.810 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire University got an
F

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:56.820 align:start position:0%
F
 
00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
and the University of New Hampshire got
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
a D
 
00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.830 align:start position:0%
a D
so

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
if the teacher preparation programs are
 
00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:11.480 align:start position:0%
not providing the necessary information
 
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
to teachers coming out of those colleges
 
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:16.740 align:start position:0%
were behind the eight ball and the
 
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
students are behind the eight ball to
 
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
begin with
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
so what I did
 
00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:27.140 align:start position:0%
here you'll see in in G
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
Roman 11.
 
00:24:33.649 --> 00:24:33.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
survey criteria that were used by the uh
 
00:24:45.409 --> 00:24:45.419 align:start position:0%
the National Council
 
00:24:45.419 --> 00:24:47.630 align:start position:0%
the National Council
and

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:49.980 align:start position:0%
we're going to ask the department to get
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
the same information
 
00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:55.820 align:start position:0%
that they did from these colleges
 
00:24:59.289 --> 00:24:59.299 align:start position:0%
looking at the components
 
00:25:02.029 --> 00:25:02.039 align:start position:0%
including phonics and vocabulary and
 
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
comprehension but for each one of those
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
lists the hours the measures
 
00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
how much opportunity there is to
 
00:25:15.289 --> 00:25:15.299 align:start position:0%
practice this and the materials used by
 
00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:18.059 align:start position:0%
those colleges the same criteria that
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
National Council of teacher quality used
 
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
so I think that this is a a major
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
component that we've worked on over the
 
00:25:33.649 --> 00:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:33.659 --> 00:25:34.549 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:37.789 --> 00:25:37.799 align:start position:0%
going down to the next area reading
 
00:25:39.789 --> 00:25:39.799 align:start position:0%
Improvement Grants
 
00:25:42.049 --> 00:25:42.059 align:start position:0%
this is going to change a little bit
 
00:25:42.059 --> 00:25:45.110 align:start position:0%
this is going to change a little bit
because

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:49.559 align:start position:0%
we missed out on passing something last
 
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:51.900 align:start position:0%
year when we had the budget available to
 
00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:52.930 align:start position:0%
year when we had the budget available to
us

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:52.940 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:25:56.529 --> 00:25:56.539 align:start position:0%
to put in an appropriation
 
00:26:00.289 --> 00:26:00.299 align:start position:0%
we are going to change this reading
 
00:26:03.649 --> 00:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
Improvement Grant section to more like a
 
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
competitive Grant situation and we'll be
 
00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
working with the Department to uh to
 
00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:12.200 align:start position:0%
work that out and then hopefully start
 
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
these reading Improvement Grants in two
 
00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:17.700 align:start position:0%
years with the next budget with an
 
00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:19.640 align:start position:0%
appropriation there
 
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
and as you'll see in this there's
 
00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:25.220 align:start position:0%
um different Grant amounts
 
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:31.860 align:start position:0%
uh the grade level thinking that it's
 
00:26:35.649 --> 00:26:35.659 align:start position:0%
going to be less expensive if we catch
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
student deficiencies earlier
 
00:26:41.289 --> 00:26:41.299 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be more expensive
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
later so if we're not aware of it until
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
the third grade we have the highest
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
Grant amount award at that level
 
00:26:53.039 --> 00:26:53.750 align:start position:0%
Grant amount award at that level
um

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
but in order to receive these grants the
 
00:26:59.810 --> 00:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
district has to provide a plan on how
 
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
the funds are going to be used to
 
00:27:05.529 --> 00:27:05.539 align:start position:0%
improve reading
 
00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
an accountability measure that I think
 
00:27:12.909 --> 00:27:12.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:16.740 align:start position:0%
the next next page
 
00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.190 align:start position:0%
the next next page
um

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:21.769 --> 00:27:21.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
is section is statutes that relate to
 
00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
literacy skills in the elementary
 
00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.409 align:start position:0%
literacy skills in the elementary
schools

00:27:30.409 --> 00:27:30.419 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:27:30.419 --> 00:27:31.850 align:start position:0%
schools
and

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:32.930 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
some of the things in here that we've
 
00:27:34.919 --> 00:27:35.810 align:start position:0%
some of the things in here that we've
done

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:35.820 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.130 align:start position:0%
done
is

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're moving toward
 
00:27:40.919 --> 00:27:43.490 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're moving toward
evidence-based

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
evidence-based
 
00:27:47.169 --> 00:27:47.179 align:start position:0%
reflective of science reading research
 
00:27:51.529 --> 00:27:51.539 align:start position:0%
and the major components within that
 
00:27:54.169 --> 00:27:54.179 align:start position:0%
that you'll see listed
 
00:27:54.179 --> 00:27:55.430 align:start position:0%
that you'll see listed
um

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:58.850 --> 00:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
and also repeating that we are not going
 
00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
to be using the three queuing of the
 
00:28:03.769 --> 00:28:03.779 align:start position:0%
balanced literacy
 
00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:07.559 align:start position:0%
um uh type of instruction
 
00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
um that has been used for so long and I
 
00:28:12.409 --> 00:28:12.419 align:start position:0%
think it's in that regard it's
 
00:28:14.169 --> 00:28:14.179 align:start position:0%
interesting to note
 
00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
method of instruction was made Popular
 
00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:25.100 align:start position:0%
by a scholar by the name of Lucy Calkins
 
00:28:27.529 --> 00:28:27.539 align:start position:0%
who has
 
00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:28.510 align:start position:0%
who has
um

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:28.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
recently backtracked from what she has
 
00:28:36.049 --> 00:28:36.059 align:start position:0%
been advocating for decades and also
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
interesting to note that the
 
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.250 align:start position:0%
interesting to note that the
um

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
Columbia University
 
00:28:42.799 --> 00:28:44.590 align:start position:0%
Columbia University
has

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:48.860 align:start position:0%
dissolved the program within the college
 
00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:52.860 align:start position:0%
that was from used to promote this kind
 
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
of instruction
 
00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
recognition of
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
where we have been that's not working
 
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:06.900 align:start position:0%
and where we need to go that has proven
 
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:08.390 align:start position:0%
and where we need to go that has proven
results

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
results
 
00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
um I think is widely
 
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
um uh accepted and one thing I also
 
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out was in relation to
 
00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:20.220 align:start position:0%
the science of reading and I can make
 
00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
copies of this
 
00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
um there are all sorts of
 
00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:25.730 align:start position:0%
um there are all sorts of
um

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:25.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:31.140 align:start position:0%
lectures on UT YouTube about what's
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
involved in quote the science of reading
 
00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
but at one seminar that a couple of us
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
went to
 
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
um they talked about the reading brain
 
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
and I've seen pictures of of kids being
 
00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
hooked up
 
00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:49.620 align:start position:0%
um you know with sensors all around
 
00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:52.980 align:start position:0%
their head and their brain to measure
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
what is going on in the brain as they
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
are trying to read
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
um so that is what this the reading
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
brain is and it talks about the
 
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
different lobes of the brain and what
 
00:30:09.649 --> 00:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
happens in each as they're trying to
 
00:30:09.659 --> 00:30:11.029 align:start position:0%
happens in each as they're trying to
read

00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
read
 
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
um so I'll make copies of this for
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
everybody but
 
00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
this and the research that has been done
 
00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:18.740 align:start position:0%
this is what we're talking about with
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
evidence-based science of reading
 
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
research and I think that's important
 
00:30:26.049 --> 00:30:26.059 align:start position:0%
to note as well
 
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
and the last section
 
00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:34.860 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to touch on was we
 
00:30:39.529 --> 00:30:39.539 align:start position:0%
last year passed a house bill 377
 
00:30:39.539 --> 00:30:41.049 align:start position:0%
last year passed a house bill 377
um

00:30:41.049 --> 00:30:41.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
and that was signed into law
 
00:30:48.409 --> 00:30:48.419 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
00:30:48.419 --> 00:30:50.210 align:start position:0%
this legislation
um

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:50.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:52.430 align:start position:0%
um
encompasses

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
encompasses
 
00:30:55.269 --> 00:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
the dyslexia screening and instruction
 
00:30:59.810 --> 00:30:59.820 align:start position:0%
as well as general reading literacy and
 
00:31:03.649 --> 00:31:03.659 align:start position:0%
it in doing so it does several important
 
00:31:05.769 --> 00:31:05.779 align:start position:0%
things in my mind
 
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
one is the move to three screenings a
 
00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
year instead of just two
 
00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:13.820 align:start position:0%
and it also
 
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
lessens the number of days
 
00:31:20.529 --> 00:31:20.539 align:start position:0%
required for screening to begin
 
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the year
 
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
um so I think that
 
00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:30.860 align:start position:0%
we are taking another step forward
 
00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:34.980 align:start position:0%
in trying to ascertain
 
00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:38.700 align:start position:0%
um where and when these children are
 
00:31:41.889 --> 00:31:41.899 align:start position:0%
having a problems in learning to read
 
00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
and addressing them early on
 
00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:48.409 align:start position:0%
and addressing them early on
um

00:31:48.409 --> 00:31:48.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
and I do have copies
 
00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.389 align:start position:0%
and I do have copies
actually

00:31:53.389 --> 00:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:31:53.399 --> 00:31:53.990 align:start position:0%
actually
um

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:56.269 --> 00:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
for this is
 
00:31:56.279 --> 00:31:58.610 align:start position:0%
for this is
um

00:31:58.610 --> 00:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
um a page on the reading brain that I
 
00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
took from several sources
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
and I I'll get these out to the um
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
audience but also this is
 
00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:16.980 align:start position:0%
this is the executive summary from the
 
00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
report I mentioned by the national uh
 
00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:22.460 align:start position:0%
Council on teacher quality
 
00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:24.500 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
what they found and going into
 
00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.889 align:start position:0%
what they found and going into
um

00:32:30.889 --> 00:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
more detail for instance I just opened
 
00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
this page
 
00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
um two out of three teacher preparation
 
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
programs fail to adequately address
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
phenomic awareness and it goes on like
 
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:46.380 align:start position:0%
that throughout each of the sections
 
00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
that they believe are important for um
 
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.340 --> 00:33:08.590 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
members for any questions and then ask
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
for if there's anyone in the audience uh
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
that would like to comment or ask a
 
00:33:17.519 --> 00:33:18.649 align:start position:0%
that would like to comment or ask a
question

00:33:18.649 --> 00:33:18.659 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:33:18.659 --> 00:33:22.130 align:start position:0%
question
any

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
representative I'll kind of kick it off
 
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
so um is this going strictly to
 
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
uh phonetics uh phonics yeah phonics
 
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
instead of uh at the exclusion I the
 
00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:38.220 align:start position:0%
thing that bothers me a little bit is
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
that in several places you're excluding
 
00:33:42.889 --> 00:33:42.899 align:start position:0%
one particular uh technique that's been
 
00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:45.299 align:start position:0%
used even though it may not be the most
 
00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
effective technique it's been used for a
 
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
long time and
 
00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:49.490 align:start position:0%
long time and
um

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
I know just from my stent teaching that
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
when new ideas came along like this and
 
00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
you had
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
um a big change it you know we went from
 
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
Whole language to
 
00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.669 align:start position:0%
Whole language to
um

00:34:04.669 --> 00:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:06.529 --> 00:34:06.539 align:start position:0%
it just
 
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
stream of thought as far as language
 
00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
arts were concerned and it kind of
 
00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
there's a third of the kids that learn
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
One Way third of the kids that learn
 
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
another way and a third of the kids
 
00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
learn another way and if you exclude one
 
00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
of those you miss out on some of the
 
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
students and I'm just wondering if
 
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
um we have to put
 
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
that it's excluded
 
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:34.930 --> 00:34:34.940 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:34:37.369 --> 00:34:37.379 align:start position:0%
I've been doing a bunch of reading in
 
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
preparation for this and what I have
 
00:34:42.829 --> 00:34:42.839 align:start position:0%
read is that queuing's theory is
 
00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:45.300 align:start position:0%
actually harmful even if used in
 
00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:48.060 align:start position:0%
conjunction with these other methods
 
00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:50.540 align:start position:0%
that it it it it
 
00:34:54.109 --> 00:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
messes up I guess the way a child learns
 
00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
reading and that it shouldn't even be
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
used in conjunction
 
00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:01.580 align:start position:0%
okay I
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:05.450 align:start position:0%
I think that
um

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
yeah children do learn differently as we
 
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
we all know but I I think that the
 
00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
basics of what they found in all the
 
00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:20.780 align:start position:0%
research are these five six seven
 
00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
components and even
 
00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:26.460 align:start position:0%
um some people
 
00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
um at a seminar several of us were at
 
00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:32.660 align:start position:0%
um they talk about
 
00:35:35.089 --> 00:35:35.099 align:start position:0%
one missing component and some of this
 
00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:38.099 align:start position:0%
is knowledge
 
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
um and the increase in proficiency they
 
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
saw when there was six more months of
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
social studies
 
00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
given to the students because they had a
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
greater knowledge base
 
00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
to for the comprehension aspect which is
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
in here on the first page f is reading
 
00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
comprehension so if you have a greater
 
00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:05.720 align:start position:0%
knowledge base
 
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
comprehension will increase also
 
00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
um so you know yes children learn
 
00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
differently but I I think that from the
 
00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:19.079 align:start position:0%
research these are the basics that the
 
00:36:23.089 --> 00:36:23.099 align:start position:0%
experts have said should be present and
 
00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.329 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:36:29.329 --> 00:36:29.339 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
well one of the things I found
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
persuasive what you just said a little
 
00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
while ago about this three queuing is
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
that one of the leading proponents of it
 
00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
I can't remember what name loose
 
00:36:43.849 --> 00:36:43.859 align:start position:0%
right that so she you would think
 
00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
is an expert and then she is kind of
 
00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:48.180 align:start position:0%
going back and saying
 
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
it's not so that that that to me is sort
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
of persuasive as far as maybe this is
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
and the fact that Columbia Teachers
 
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.870 align:start position:0%
and the fact that Columbia Teachers
College

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
College
 
00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
um is backtracking on years of
 
00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:03.060 align:start position:0%
supporting this type of uh instruction
 
00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
but one of the problems still is that
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
um we have book publishers
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
who are um you know trying to make a
 
00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:18.839 align:start position:0%
profit also and they are still pushing
 
00:37:18.839 --> 00:37:19.870 align:start position:0%
profit also and they are still pushing
um this

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
um this
 
00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
method of reading and one of the biggest
 
00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
Publishers of this is based here in New
 
00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.390 align:start position:0%
Publishers of this is based here in New
Hampshire

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
um but I think with the movement that
 
00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
we've seen as I said 26 States in a
 
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
decade moving in this new Direction I
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
think that the Publishers will will get
 
00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:44.700 align:start position:0%
the message
 
00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
um so I noticed since I had
 
00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
representative Lance Amendment before me
 
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:05.460 align:start position:0%
um that he included um mathematics which
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
I understand why you probably just want
 
00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
to do reading at this point
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
um but he also had that it it would
 
00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:14.940 align:start position:0%
apply to Charter Public Schools public
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
schools and public academies and I'm
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
wondering if in this bill it will
 
00:38:26.089 --> 00:38:26.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
um and I I
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
um you will see often in the science of
 
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
reading and this evidence-based approach
 
00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:38.220 align:start position:0%
um reading and Mathematics
 
00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:41.700 align:start position:0%
um but I I figured it was a uh enough of
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
a hill for me to climb just on the
 
00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
just as an aside I think that we need to
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
approach mathematics in a similar
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
fashion yes and we did do a couple of
 
00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
things last year in regard to that yes
 
00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:01.140 align:start position:0%
so yeah definitely yeah our math
 
00:39:04.849 --> 00:39:04.859 align:start position:0%
proficiency rates are uh no better well
 
00:39:06.829 --> 00:39:06.839 align:start position:0%
and we haven't really recognized that
 
00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
there's you know a similar case to
 
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
dyslexia only with mathematics with
 
00:39:31.609 --> 00:39:31.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:31.619 --> 00:39:33.109 align:start position:0%
 
just

00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:39:34.849 --> 00:39:34.859 align:start position:0%
um you have to press the silver button
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
so the red light goes on
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
um and give us your name and position
 
00:39:44.329 --> 00:39:44.339 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Brenda Peters I
 
00:39:47.329 --> 00:39:47.339 align:start position:0%
am the immediate past president of the
 
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:49.160 align:start position:0%

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
dyslexia Association we have been around
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
for 18 years serving New Hampshire we
 
00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
used to be called New Hampshire Ida but
 
00:39:59.810 --> 00:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
because we represent Maine and Vermont
 
00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
we were able to change our name about a
 
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
year ago so that we have better
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
representation in all of our states I
 
00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
have been involved in this field for
 
00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
almost I don't know 25 years since my
 
00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
son who is profoundly dyslexic
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
um and we started this journey before
 
00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
that I was in organizational development
 
00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:22.740 align:start position:0%
and like moving along happily and didn't
 
00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
even know that special education existed
 
00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
until my son struggled so that started
 
00:40:30.109 --> 00:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
me on this journey I'm now a reading
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
specialist and learning disability
 
00:40:35.089 --> 00:40:35.099 align:start position:0%
specialist and a specialist in the
 
00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
assessment of intellectual functioning
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
so I actually test children for dyslexia
 
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
and it was also on the director the
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
children's to sexiest Center and
 
00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:44.940 align:start position:0%
affiliated with them for 18 years
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
teaching structured literacy structured
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
literacy is the approach that we talk
 
00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
about when we think about the science of
 
00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
reading and structured literacy includes
 
00:40:59.150 --> 00:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
not just phonics and phonemic awareness
 
00:41:01.849 --> 00:41:01.859 align:start position:0%
it also includes vocabulary building
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
knowledge and it is truly based on
 
00:41:06.849 --> 00:41:06.859 align:start position:0%
science it's been around for 95 years
 
00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:09.180 align:start position:0%
based on the work of Orton Gillingham
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
and then it's evolved from there and
 
00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
what we know about reading and the
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
acquisition of reading is that all
 
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
children in fact the brain processes
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
information the same and we all learn in
 
00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:25.400 align:start position:0%
this we all learn to read the same way
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
and that is by understanding and making
 
00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:31.740 align:start position:0%
that parent association between the
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
sound system of language and the written
 
00:41:37.849 --> 00:41:37.859 align:start position:0%
system of language and children who
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
struggle have difficulty with this sound
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
system of language that becomes apparent
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
when they're very young even third
 
00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
fourth I'm sorry three four
 
00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
five-year-olds uh we can effectively
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
identify these struggling readers which
 
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
is why we have bills like this in so
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
many places children do not learn by the
 
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
three queuing system which involves
 
00:42:04.849 --> 00:42:04.859 align:start position:0%
visual semantic and syntactic
 
00:42:07.609 --> 00:42:07.619 align:start position:0%
information using those first before
 
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
going to decoding the word and getting
 
00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:13.980 align:start position:0%
the word off the page now the thing that
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
what people are attracted to about three
 
00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:20.460 align:start position:0%
queuing is that and balanced literacy is
 
00:42:23.329 --> 00:42:23.339 align:start position:0%
that the belief was teach a rich
 
00:42:25.069 --> 00:42:25.079 align:start position:0%
information and the child will learn to
 
00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:27.500 align:start position:0%
read you know teach them like
 
00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
interesting the knowledge build
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge and they will learn to read it
 
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't work we've been trying that for
 
00:42:36.589 --> 00:42:36.599 align:start position:0%
decades in all of our states it doesn't
 
00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
work and when we have 65 of our children
 
00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:45.060 align:start position:0%
not reading at a proficient level but
 
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
only 15 percent of the children are
 
00:42:50.349 --> 00:42:50.359 align:start position:0%
actually dyslexic we have a tier one
 
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
instructional problem and the answer is
 
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
structured literacy which addresses all
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
of those needs so that's my two cents
 
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
but thank you I think this bill is
 
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
really important
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
um I think it's a great beginning but I
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
do think that we need to do all we can
 
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
to make sure that our teachers who are
 
00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
spending over a hundred thousand dollars
 
00:43:17.089 --> 00:43:17.099 align:start position:0%
to become teachers walk out of unh and
 
00:43:19.609 --> 00:43:19.619 align:start position:0%
can teach any child including those who
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
struggle to read if they can't then why
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
what does this you know edu this degree
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
mean the one of the main purposes of our
 
00:43:32.089 --> 00:43:32.099 align:start position:0%
children going to public school is to
 
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
learn to read and if the teacher can't
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
leave that with the ability to teach all
 
00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
children then I think we have a problem
 
00:43:44.809 --> 00:43:44.819 align:start position:0%
and in in Mississippi they require the
 
00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
professors to take letters and to learn
 
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
about our language and you would think
 
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
well of course people are there learning
 
00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:54.300 align:start position:0%
this in college they're not they're not
 
00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
so yeah we need to back up the bus and
 
00:43:59.809 --> 00:43:59.819 align:start position:0%
we also need to look at our state and
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
federally funded colleges and what are
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
we doing there to get that information
 
00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.870 align:start position:0%
we doing there to get that information
out

00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:44:08.569 --> 00:44:08.579 align:start position:0%
thank you many yes questions from
 
00:44:08.579 --> 00:44:11.450 align:start position:0%
thank you many yes questions from
subcommittee

00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you for taking on
 
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
this important subject with the children
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm representative ball I am a
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
reading specialist although it's now
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
Labs because I became the state but I
 
00:44:35.569 --> 00:44:35.579 align:start position:0%
was certified as a reading specialist in
 
00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:36.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as well as a special
 
00:44:38.569 --> 00:44:38.579 align:start position:0%
education teacher
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
um just to touch on a few things you
 
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
were talking about the colleges and I
 
00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:43.980 align:start position:0%
will tell you that when I became a
 
00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
reading specialist I had no idea that
 
00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
was a general education certificate and
 
00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:50.460 align:start position:0%
many of us sitting at the table were
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
like well when are we going to learn our
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
specialized instruction on how to teach
 
00:44:56.089 --> 00:44:56.099 align:start position:0%
reading we never were taught it is up to
 
00:44:58.130 --> 00:44:58.140 align:start position:0%
the teacher to take it upon herself or
 
00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
himself to um then go ahead and get
 
00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:03.020 align:start position:0%
certified in a specialized instruction
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
most schools don't even offer it
 
00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
um that was
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
just to kind of touch on that I'm also
 
00:45:10.319 --> 00:45:11.450 align:start position:0%
just to kind of touch on that I'm also
concerned

00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:11.460 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:12.790 align:start position:0%
concerned
um

00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
literacy is including math
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
and so it concerns me that I do believe
 
00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
we need to have a firm definition in New
 
00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire of what exactly literacy is
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
and it does include math and it's easy
 
00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
to to Define that by just looking at how
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
we identify students for special
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
education in specific learning
 
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
disabilities because that is literacy
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
and it does include math and it also
 
00:45:41.569 --> 00:45:41.579 align:start position:0%
includes spelling so my concern here is
 
00:45:43.609 --> 00:45:43.619 align:start position:0%
that it often mentions when I look it
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
says a lot of decoding fluency but
 
00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:48.660 align:start position:0%
there's nothing about encoding and
 
00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:50.700 align:start position:0%
oftentimes what I have learned and I
 
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
also have been fighting this battle for
 
00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
30 years to try and get phonics back
 
00:45:58.550 --> 00:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
into the classroom is that oftentimes
 
00:46:01.069 --> 00:46:01.079 align:start position:0%
children can easily memorize our
 
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
children with dyslexia tend to be
 
00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:06.540 align:start position:0%
average to above average IQ they teach
 
00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
themselves they compensate and so they
 
00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
can easily memorize these words however
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
when you ask them to spell them that's
 
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
where you can find that they don't know
 
00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
the rules they don't understand how the
 
00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:20.420 align:start position:0%
sounds work and speaking of sounds
 
00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:24.420 align:start position:0%
dyslexia is an auditory disability so it
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
often goes and it goes from generation
 
00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
to generation so they must be taught
 
00:46:30.349 --> 00:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
these sounds it is
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
has to be broken down and taught to them
 
00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill the one thing that I
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
another thing that I notice is often it
 
00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:43.079 align:start position:0%
says age appropriate and I personally
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
would like to see that as grade
 
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate because sometimes parents
 
00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:48.500 align:start position:0%
will choose to hold a child back
 
00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:51.180 align:start position:0%
oftentimes it is boys who tend to act a
 
00:46:53.809 --> 00:46:53.819 align:start position:0%
little bit less mature so we really
 
00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:55.380 align:start position:0%
should be looking at where should they
 
00:46:59.210 --> 00:46:59.220 align:start position:0%
be in this grade not in their age
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:06.300 align:start position:0%
just something that I I would change I
 
00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
know that um
 
00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli was very nice he
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
we and I we spoke last year about this
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
bill and I did mention the part about
 
00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
making meaningful gains to lessen the
 
00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:19.309 align:start position:0%
making meaningful gains to lessen the
different

00:47:19.309 --> 00:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
um that section there that is language
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
that's from special education law and I
 
00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
really thought it should be included in
 
00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:28.020 align:start position:0%
this because we're not just looking for
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
Progress we do need to look for
 
00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:31.380 align:start position:0%
Meaningful gains we need to see that the
 
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
Gap is lessening my feedback for that is
 
00:47:39.069 --> 00:47:39.079 align:start position:0%
we need to put a time frame
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
response to intervention is not supposed
 
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
to go on forever it is supposed to be a
 
00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:46.980 align:start position:0%
quick let's see if we can get if we can
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
close the gap it should go 8 to 12 weeks
 
00:47:51.770 --> 00:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
after that the child should be referred
 
00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:53.460 align:start position:0%
to special education and they should
 
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
rule out a disability there should be an
 
00:47:58.490 --> 00:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
idea that there could be a problem if
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
they um you know there could be a
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
disability if the child is not uh
 
00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
picking up
 
00:48:07.849 --> 00:48:07.859 align:start position:0%
on the interventions
 
00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
thing I would like to mention is there's
 
00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
also oftentimes we have to wait for the
 
00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
child there's physiological changes that
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
happen in the brain and so the idea that
 
00:48:22.609 --> 00:48:22.619 align:start position:0%
children are going to read at six is
 
00:48:24.829 --> 00:48:24.839 align:start position:0%
really not going to happen for all
 
00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
children some children it may be eight
 
00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:29.700 align:start position:0%
years old they could still be reversing
 
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
letters and numbers they're still not
 
00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
just putting it together and then once
 
00:48:35.569 --> 00:48:35.579 align:start position:0%
it clicks when their brain is ready to
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
accept it they will so I think we do
 
00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
need to make sure we're not putting so
 
00:48:41.569 --> 00:48:41.579 align:start position:0%
much pressure on a child when they
 
00:48:43.849 --> 00:48:43.859 align:start position:0%
really are they just can't do it yet but
 
00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
we need to be aware of that and provide
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
accommodations while we are waiting for
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
their brain to develop to the point that
 
00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:54.020 align:start position:0%
they can accept what we're teaching them
 
00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:59.829 align:start position:0%
let's see
um

00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
sure I believe that's just my feedback
 
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
I'm just I'm sorry because I just see no
 
00:49:07.849 --> 00:49:07.859 align:start position:0%
no so yeah like all over the place um I
 
00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:10.740 align:start position:0%
just wanted to mention um in terms of
 
00:49:13.309 --> 00:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
um time frames for special ed referral
 
00:49:13.319 --> 00:49:14.930 align:start position:0%
um time frames for special ed referral
we've

00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
we've
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
danced around that issue
 
00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
um with a number of of people
 
00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
um as to
 
00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
um should there be uh you know eight to
 
00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:28.079 align:start position:0%
twelve weeks or you know what should the
 
00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:32.460 align:start position:0%
time frame be or if we're specifying a
 
00:49:34.609 --> 00:49:34.619 align:start position:0%
shorter time frame
 
00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:36.140 align:start position:0%
um are we
 
00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:40.380 align:start position:0%
pushing the child into a special ed
 
00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:42.470 align:start position:0%
pushing the child into a special ed
categorization

00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
categorization
 
00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
um so that's something that we've danced
 
00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
around with and I think I think maybe
 
00:49:49.849 --> 00:49:49.859 align:start position:0%
that dance will continue uh until
 
00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:52.500 align:start position:0%
November I will say that that is one of
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
my biggest concerns and has always been
 
00:49:56.329 --> 00:49:56.339 align:start position:0%
a concern of mine for the last 15 years
 
00:49:58.849 --> 00:49:58.859 align:start position:0%
since I've been certified as a teacher
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
or as a specialty reading specialist
 
00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:05.060 align:start position:0%
that is a huge
 
00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:07.980 align:start position:0%
Pitfall in the special education law it
 
00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
specifically says that the school
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
districts can use an exhaust all
 
00:50:14.329 --> 00:50:14.339 align:start position:0%
interventions that they can try and
 
00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
throw at the student
 
00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
it could go on for two years meanwhile
 
00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
that child is behind for two years there
 
00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
needs to be a a way of shortening that
 
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
up in 2011 the commissioner of the
 
00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:30.180 align:start position:0%
United States Department of Education
 
00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
sent out a letter and I can get you a
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
copy of it but it's the in that letter
 
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
she specifically said that referral
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
suspensional education cannot be
 
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
deferred or delayed because a child is
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
going to be in response to intervention
 
00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:51.420 align:start position:0%
RTI that if there if there's a if you
 
00:50:53.809 --> 00:50:53.819 align:start position:0%
suspect a disability you are to refer
 
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
that child to special education now that
 
00:50:58.190 --> 00:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
happens but the problem is you go to
 
00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
your referral meetings and the school
 
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
says well we want to try X Y and Z well
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
at some point x y and z has to end
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
because if it doesn't we're just
 
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
prolonging and keeping that child in a
 
00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
classroom where they can't access the
 
00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:15.180 align:start position:0%
curriculum and oftentimes it could be a
 
00:51:17.329 --> 00:51:17.339 align:start position:0%
child now in second grade and they're
 
00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
still waiting to get referred to for
 
00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:22.140 align:start position:0%
special education I've seen that happen
 
00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
multiple times even within my own family
 
00:51:28.849 --> 00:51:28.859 align:start position:0%
so I do think we need to tighten up that
 
00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
federal law as a state we can we can
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
tighten it up as a state and say well
 
00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:34.980 align:start position:0%
the federal law might say that but in
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we hold our schools to a
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
higher standard we want our children we
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
want to rule out uh learning
 
00:51:44.809 --> 00:51:44.819 align:start position:0%
disabilities as soon as possible or get
 
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
them into a more intensive reading
 
00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:49.549 align:start position:0%
them into a more intensive reading
program

00:51:49.549 --> 00:51:49.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
um any questions from anyone
 
00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner is is there
 
00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:57.770 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner is is there
anything

00:51:57.770 --> 00:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:51:59.809 --> 00:51:59.819 align:start position:0%
um in this I know you talk about
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
bringing in stakeholders and parents and
 
00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:05.940 align:start position:0%
um but a lot of reading instruction goes
 
00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:07.380 align:start position:0%
on in the home
 
00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
um early and a lot of parents are not
 
00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:11.030 align:start position:0%
um early and a lot of parents are not
really

00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
not a lot but a number of parents are
 
00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:15.790 align:start position:0%
not a lot but a number of parents are
not

00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:15.800 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
readers proficient readers themselves
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
and and maybe just don't have the time
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
to spend with the child or for whatever
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
reason but some of it is that they just
 
00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:27.180 align:start position:0%
don't know and
 
00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:29.460 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me one of the
 
00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
the things we could do in this bill is
 
00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
at least put in something about
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
um and I know we're out of the money
 
00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
issue but that Local Schools should
 
00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:39.549 align:start position:0%
issue but that Local Schools should
offer

00:52:39.549 --> 00:52:39.559 align:start position:0%
offer
 
00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:43.140 align:start position:0%
instruction for parents uh you know not
 
00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:45.180 align:start position:0%
not required instruction for parents but
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
the offer of having forums or seminars
 
00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
at schools
 
00:52:52.609 --> 00:52:52.619 align:start position:0%
um that parents could take for you know
 
00:52:55.609 --> 00:52:55.619 align:start position:0%
the state would cover it
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you uh
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
um I did try and address that uh to a
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
degree in terms of the individual plan
 
00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:06.660 align:start position:0%
that's developed for the student
 
00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
um would include strategies
 
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
um that would be given to the parent but
 
00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:13.740 align:start position:0%
also I did say that the department
 
00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:16.380 align:start position:0%
should offer periodic workshops for
 
00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:19.140 align:start position:0%
educators and parents
 
00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
um so I think you're absolutely correct
 
00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
um the uh the information and the
 
00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
instruction capabilities being provided
 
00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:30.420 align:start position:0%
to parents and that's why I'm looking
 
00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
forward to you know in the future
 
00:53:37.329 --> 00:53:37.339 align:start position:0%
working with the state librarian and uh
 
00:53:40.849 --> 00:53:40.859 align:start position:0%
advancing on what and how the libraries
 
00:53:46.609 --> 00:53:46.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
comment on that
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
on that letters program was actually
 
00:53:52.609 --> 00:53:52.619 align:start position:0%
open to parents as well to take I also
 
00:53:55.370 --> 00:53:55.380 align:start position:0%
took the letters training and it is a
 
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
very basic training it's not a
 
00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:59.690 align:start position:0%
very basic training it's not a
certification

00:53:59.690 --> 00:53:59.700 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:02.220 align:start position:0%
the problem or the challenge with that
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
is as long as we have fontus and Pennell
 
00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
in our school districts in our state
 
00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:09.660 align:start position:0%
letters is of no use because fontus and
 
00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
panel is a scripted program and the
 
00:54:13.609 --> 00:54:13.619 align:start position:0%
teachers are expected to be on the same
 
00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
place on the same day every across so if
 
00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:19.140 align:start position:0%
you have three first grades classrooms
 
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
in your District all three are expected
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
to be on the same page every single day
 
00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
and you stick to the script you're not
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
to deviate so even with all the letters
 
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
training the teacher's hands are tied
 
00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much yes
 
00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:34.790 align:start position:0%
thank you very much yes
yes

00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I tried to
 
00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
take a step toward
 
00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:42.609 align:start position:0%
take a step toward
um

00:54:42.609 --> 00:54:42.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
requiring the move to the evidence-based
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
research uh types of instruction
 
00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:53.450 align:start position:0%
research uh types of instruction
um

00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:56.220 align:start position:0%
I went as far as I could in that regard
 
00:54:59.349 --> 00:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that the department will be
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
offering further guidance in the
 
00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:06.839 align:start position:0%
department and Technical advisories Etc
 
00:55:10.569 --> 00:55:10.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
yeah the questions I'm sitting here uh
 
00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:15.900 align:start position:0%
listening to this it would never be any
 
00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:16.970 align:start position:0%
listening to this it would never be any
value

00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:16.980 align:start position:0%
value
 
00:55:20.569 --> 00:55:20.579 align:start position:0%
in inviting uh representatives of the
 
00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
teacher education institutions for this
 
00:55:26.809 --> 00:55:26.819 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh to hear their side or
 
00:55:31.010 --> 00:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
their approach uh or lack thereof and
 
00:55:32.450 --> 00:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
teaching of reading based upon the
 
00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:33.900 align:start position:0%
information that's been shared this
 
00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:37.010 align:start position:0%
information that's been shared this
morning

00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
I believe you know we could do that
 
00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:42.660 align:start position:0%
um I I have uh talked to
 
00:55:45.049 --> 00:55:45.059 align:start position:0%
um uh Mr Appleby from the Department
 
00:55:45.059 --> 00:55:46.190 align:start position:0%
um uh Mr Appleby from the Department
about

00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
teacher preparation and so forth so uh I
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
could possibly ask him to contact some
 
00:55:58.010 --> 00:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:58.020 --> 00:55:59.990 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:56:01.569 --> 00:56:01.579 align:start position:0%
yes do you have
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
um thank you to the speakers definitely
 
00:56:08.450 --> 00:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
to have the knowledge base
 
00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:09.349 align:start position:0%
to have the knowledge base
um

00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:11.089 --> 00:56:11.099 align:start position:0%
when I've only been out of the field for
 
00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
two years but after teaching reading and
 
00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
and overseeing special ed referrals and
 
00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:17.510 align:start position:0%
and overseeing special ed referrals and
whatnot

00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
whatnot
 
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
I too have a strong opinion about how
 
00:56:22.849 --> 00:56:22.859 align:start position:0%
reading should be taught and no two
 
00:56:22.859 --> 00:56:24.470 align:start position:0%
reading should be taught and no two
children

00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
you know can use the same method but yet
 
00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:29.700 align:start position:0%
we seem to buy programs that are
 
00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:31.069 align:start position:0%
we seem to buy programs that are
scripted

00:56:31.069 --> 00:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
scripted
 
00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:33.240 align:start position:0%
and they just don't meet the needs of
 
00:56:35.089 --> 00:56:35.099 align:start position:0%
all the kids
 
00:56:37.549 --> 00:56:37.559 align:start position:0%
um I'm a firm believer in the Jim
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
Collins good to Great Schools no matter
 
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
what that those reading scores are we
 
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
should always be an improvement mode I
 
00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
don't care if it's 60 40 whatever it is
 
00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
um so I'm coming from that Realm
 
00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
one of the things about this this bill
 
00:56:55.790 --> 00:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
is it has a lot of strengths and I'm
 
00:56:58.130 --> 00:56:58.140 align:start position:0%
very happy to see that you've moved
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
language to evidence evidence-based
 
00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:01.490 align:start position:0%
language to evidence evidence-based
reading

00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
reading
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
as far as I consider a three queuing
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
system shouldn't even be a language
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's on paper
 
00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:09.540 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if it works or it
 
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't but it's
 
00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:13.380 align:start position:0%
if you've been in education like some of
 
00:57:16.069 --> 00:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
these people the pendulum swings from
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
one extreme to the other
 
00:57:21.049 --> 00:57:21.059 align:start position:0%
and it never just goes in the middle but
 
00:57:22.849 --> 00:57:22.859 align:start position:0%
if you can make your school district so
 
00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
that people have the skills and know how
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
to draw from the toolbox to be able to
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
address each of the children's needs
 
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
then that's what we need to give
 
00:57:36.109 --> 00:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
teachers and schools but you need to
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
have a hierarchy that's going to go
 
00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
after that and not just the current
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
book on the market really
 
00:57:45.890 --> 00:57:45.900 align:start position:0%
um so I come from a lot of experience it
 
00:57:47.930 --> 00:57:47.940 align:start position:0%
did look a little bit more from teacher
 
00:57:50.450 --> 00:57:50.460 align:start position:0%
prep so it's been you know I don't want
 
00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
to say how many years since I've been
 
00:57:52.790 --> 00:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
out of college
 
00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:55.140 align:start position:0%
but as an elementary major
 
00:57:58.130 --> 00:57:58.140 align:start position:0%
secondary secondary and Elementary major
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
I did have to take foundations of
 
00:58:02.329 --> 00:58:02.339 align:start position:0%
reading to learn the different programs
 
00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
for different types of Learners and I
 
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
did have to take a course in diagnostic
 
00:58:08.329 --> 00:58:08.339 align:start position:0%
screening intervention
 
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
now I didn't I don't know if they still
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
provide that but I would say
 
00:58:17.089 --> 00:58:17.099 align:start position:0%
because of what we know in Reading those
 
00:58:20.569 --> 00:58:20.579 align:start position:0%
programs should be much more robust
 
00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
um I know that they they have to take
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
the Praxis one whether they're UNH are
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
plummet those are the two schools I just
 
00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:29.220 align:start position:0%
randomly picked out
 
00:58:31.069 --> 00:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
um they have to take at an elementary
 
00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
major they have to also take a
 
00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:36.660 align:start position:0%
foundations of reading test to move on
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
and get certified and the Praxis too
 
00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:42.660 align:start position:0%
so something in that ROM should be more
 
00:58:45.370 --> 00:58:45.380 align:start position:0%
robust and based on
 
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
evidence-based reading strategies I'm a
 
00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:50.700 align:start position:0%
big proponent of that uh having worked
 
00:58:52.930 --> 00:58:52.940 align:start position:0%
and reading over many years
 
00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
I'm glad to see the Bible that I've
 
00:58:59.210 --> 00:58:59.220 align:start position:0%
adjusted Dr John's Savage worked out at
 
00:59:01.089 --> 00:59:01.099 align:start position:0%
Boston University was from Massachusetts
 
00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
wrote a book under understanding reading
 
00:59:06.289 --> 00:59:06.299 align:start position:0%
problems did a lot of training with a
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
um the other piece that is not new to
 
00:59:15.049 --> 00:59:15.059 align:start position:0%
the market is I think the reading
 
00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:16.740 align:start position:0%
specialist mentioned was the response to
 
00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
intervention model
 
00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
so it was a three-tier model and I think
 
00:59:24.289 --> 00:59:24.299 align:start position:0%
what has gone by the wayside
 
00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
is the fact that schools are really not
 
00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
engaging in data teams and that's where
 
00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:32.690 align:start position:0%
engaging in data teams and that's where
you

00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:32.700 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
don't have somebody going on two years
 
00:59:37.069 --> 00:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
in an intervention and then you say oh
 
00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
maybe now I need a referral no it's
 
00:59:41.930 --> 00:59:41.940 align:start position:0%
really prescriptive and all right you
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
provide an intervention for six weeks
 
00:59:45.890 --> 00:59:45.900 align:start position:0%
you measure the progress you provide an
 
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
intervention you measure the progress
 
00:59:50.569 --> 00:59:50.579 align:start position:0%
um and from what I understand I'm one of
 
00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
my districts they no longer do data
 
00:59:54.109 --> 00:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
teams which really made the difference
 
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
in Reading progress or not
 
00:59:59.809 --> 00:59:59.819 align:start position:0%
but definitely still the responsive to
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
intervention is the model
 
01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
in terms of tertiary services
 
01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
and we had a very strong Title One
 
01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:11.220 align:start position:0%
reading program and they were always
 
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
current but Dottie fair was at the
 
01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
department back then and they were
 
01:00:18.349 --> 01:00:18.359 align:start position:0%
always current in what was the right
 
01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
method and it wasn't always what was
 
01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
being advertised and and districts get
 
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
sucked into that pretty easily because
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
they offer companies you know offer a
 
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
lot of freebies if you buy their program
 
01:00:35.809 --> 01:00:35.819 align:start position:0%
but you have to keep an open mind and a
 
01:00:37.849 --> 01:00:37.859 align:start position:0%
kin I come from a district that had no
 
01:00:37.859 --> 01:00:38.690 align:start position:0%
kin I come from a district that had no
money

01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:38.700 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
uh so we didn't buy the program of the
 
01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
Azure and we didn't go whole language
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
but neighboring districts would go a
 
01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:46.380 align:start position:0%
whole language we didn't believe in it
 
01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:49.740 align:start position:0%
because kids need phonics
 
01:00:51.289 --> 01:00:51.299 align:start position:0%
um sure enough evidence-based reading
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
says they have to have phonics and they
 
01:00:54.589 --> 01:00:54.599 align:start position:0%
have to have phonemic awareness and
 
01:00:56.569 --> 01:00:56.579 align:start position:0%
those five components I would stick to
 
01:00:56.579 --> 01:00:57.770 align:start position:0%
those five components I would stick to
those

01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:57.780 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:00.780 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about your time limit
 
01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:04.140 align:start position:0%
and your benchmarks I don't disagree
 
01:01:06.289 --> 01:01:06.299 align:start position:0%
with them yes they need to be middle and
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
beginning middle and end for every
 
01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
student to make sure they're on that
 
01:01:13.609 --> 01:01:13.619 align:start position:0%
trajectory but again in between middle
 
01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
beginning middle and end in between time
 
01:01:18.410 --> 01:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
those kids who are not making that
 
01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
progress need to be picked up
 
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
um maybe the principal certification
 
01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:26.220 align:start position:0%
programs need to have specialized
 
01:01:27.770 --> 01:01:27.780 align:start position:0%
coursework in Reading because they
 
01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:28.980 align:start position:0%
should know
 
01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
you know not only just a special
 
01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:32.700 align:start position:0%
educator but the administrator should
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
know all right why don't you uh based on
 
01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:37.740 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing in this data team this
 
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
student might need Lindamood or this
 
01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:42.200 align:start position:0%
student might need a Wilson
 
01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
depending on how that goes so it leaves
 
01:01:48.589 --> 01:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
and I think that if we could focus on
 
01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
the evidence-based reading strategies we
 
01:01:55.069 --> 01:01:55.079 align:start position:0%
don't want to take away local control
 
01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
and I and I'm placing a lot of value now
 
01:01:59.630 --> 01:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
on the department having a reading
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
specialist because somebody needs to
 
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
lead this charge
 
01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:05.030 align:start position:0%
lead this charge
um

01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
and and that's where it needs to be I
 
01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
mean I'm glad to see Dibbles is out of
 
01:02:11.089 --> 01:02:11.099 align:start position:0%
here though I trained in Dibbles and
 
01:02:13.309 --> 01:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
used it many times but in the field now
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
they're using more prescriptive
 
01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:18.839 align:start position:0%
um different types of
 
01:02:20.569 --> 01:02:20.579 align:start position:0%
um assessments and I don't think we
 
01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
should be talking about again a specific
 
01:02:27.289 --> 01:02:27.299 align:start position:0%
program or a company name letters I did
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
training letters as well
 
01:02:32.329 --> 01:02:32.339 align:start position:0%
um it's one tool in the toolbox it's not
 
01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
the whole gamut but the evidence-based
 
01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:37.559 align:start position:0%
strategies the five readings that's the
 
01:02:37.559 --> 01:02:38.990 align:start position:0%
strategies the five readings that's the
key

01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
key
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
um I think once if if we can get
 
01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:43.799 align:start position:0%
guidance at the state level in terms of
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
how to disseminate and make sure that
 
01:02:48.289 --> 01:02:48.299 align:start position:0%
every District does that
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
the benchmarking will happen it has to
 
01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:53.700 align:start position:0%
um I don't think you need the time limit
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
because that will override it because if
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
you're going to show Improvement you
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
better do it you know at certain
 
01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.609 align:start position:0%
better do it you know at certain
intervals

01:03:01.609 --> 01:03:01.619 align:start position:0%
intervals
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:03.789 align:start position:0%
um I think
um

01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:03.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:06.839 align:start position:0%
when there was a recommendation or there
 
01:03:08.930 --> 01:03:08.940 align:start position:0%
was a reading specialist initially hired
 
01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
and then it went to an English language
 
01:03:12.049 --> 01:03:12.059 align:start position:0%
arts consultant
 
01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
that person put together this wonderful
 
01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
guide I don't remember the year of it
 
01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
resource guide for dyslexia and other
 
01:03:18.359 --> 01:03:19.970 align:start position:0%
resource guide for dyslexia and other
related

01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
related
 
01:03:22.809 --> 01:03:22.819 align:start position:0%
um resources I don't remember the year
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
2016-17 and before that was the national
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
reading panel in 2005 okay and so I
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
don't like the term science of reading
 
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
simply because it's the term of the day
 
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
I would say the term of the doer what is
 
01:03:40.210 --> 01:03:40.220 align:start position:0%
really key here is those five
 
01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:42.660 align:start position:0%
evidence-based strategies whether you
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
call it science or reading or reading
 
01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.349 align:start position:0%
call it science or reading or reading
first

01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
it's what it is right so so that's a
 
01:03:50.809 --> 01:03:50.819 align:start position:0%
good thing and I'm glad that that has
 
01:03:50.819 --> 01:03:52.309 align:start position:0%
good thing and I'm glad that that has
persisted

01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
persisted
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
over almost 20 years because it's sound
 
01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:58.010 align:start position:0%
over almost 20 years because it's sound
um

01:03:58.010 --> 01:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:00.530 --> 01:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
so I think it needs some work I think we
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
should focus on the
 
01:04:05.210 --> 01:04:05.220 align:start position:0%
evidence-based strategies
 
01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:05.990 align:start position:0%
evidence-based strategies
um

01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
maybe throw in some data team
 
01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:11.270 align:start position:0%
maybe throw in some data team
requirement

01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:12.410 align:start position:0%
requirement
um

01:04:12.410 --> 01:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
what were some of the other things I had
 
01:04:17.930 --> 01:04:17.940 align:start position:0%
the department also has a website called
 
01:04:19.849 --> 01:04:19.859 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire loves reading I think it's
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
called or something to that effect
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
you've probably seen it I would like to
 
01:04:25.370 --> 01:04:25.380 align:start position:0%
see some YouTube videos on there for
 
01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:28.140 align:start position:0%
parents and teachers
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
um quick little Snippets how do I help
 
01:04:32.809 --> 01:04:32.819 align:start position:0%
my child they're struggling in
 
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
um you know phonemic awareness putting
 
01:04:37.849 --> 01:04:37.859 align:start position:0%
sounds together well use a slinky
 
01:04:40.130 --> 01:04:40.140 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm having trouble my kids
 
01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:43.640 align:start position:0%
are having trouble with uh ending sounds
 
01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
well here's some tools you could use I
 
01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:49.140 align:start position:0%
mean you don't need to buy a book I mean
 
01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
exposure to language helps children read
 
01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:53.150 align:start position:0%
exposure to language helps children read
right

01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
and the big thing that I I am concerned
 
01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
about when you get talking about a
 
01:04:59.329 --> 01:04:59.339 align:start position:0%
referral for special ed versus
 
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
waiting or providing intervention
 
01:05:04.970 --> 01:05:04.980 align:start position:0%
is kids have to come to school in
 
01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:07.559 align:start position:0%
kindergarten rating some basic words
 
01:05:07.559 --> 01:05:09.109 align:start position:0%
kindergarten rating some basic words
already

01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:05:11.089 --> 01:05:11.099 align:start position:0%
or they used to come to first grade
 
01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
reading basic words
 
01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
but we have lots of kids from rural
 
01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:19.740 align:start position:0%
communities that don't have that pre
 
01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:21.829 align:start position:0%
communities that don't have that pre
learning

01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
learning
 
01:05:23.930 --> 01:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
and those kids unless they've been
 
01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
exposed to learning you can't sift
 
01:05:30.049 --> 01:05:30.059 align:start position:0%
through whether it's a disability or not
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
and so that's why you got to have
 
01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:34.140 align:start position:0%
somebody skilled and knowing you know
 
01:05:35.329 --> 01:05:35.339 align:start position:0%
the difference between the achievement
 
01:05:37.730 --> 01:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
the ability so that's a very fine line
 
01:05:40.730 --> 01:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
nine times out of ten I'd go with a
 
01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
parent if the parent wants a a referral
 
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
then let's start giving a cognitive test
 
01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:48.839 align:start position:0%
that's all you need to start with and
 
01:05:50.809 --> 01:05:50.819 align:start position:0%
then let's sift it out but you need to
 
01:05:52.730 --> 01:05:52.740 align:start position:0%
rule it out for Peace of Mind of the
 
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
parent as well
 
01:05:55.079 --> 01:05:56.329 align:start position:0%
parent as well
um

01:05:56.329 --> 01:05:56.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I I like no no commercial programs
 
01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
I don't like any buzzwords like science
 
01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
or reading
 
01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:06.530 align:start position:0%
or reading
um

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:08.690 --> 01:06:08.700 align:start position:0%
trying to think what else and the
 
01:06:10.069 --> 01:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
reading specialist at the department of
 
01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
Ed I think I'm hoping we've got some
 
01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
foundations already in place I think it
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
needs to go to the next level of
 
01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
requiring the data team parts
 
01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
um what bothers me about this bill in
 
01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:23.220 align:start position:0%
particular as a rep I'm trying to
 
01:06:25.609 --> 01:06:25.619 align:start position:0%
represent all my constituents this
 
01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't represent all kids don't we want
 
01:06:31.329 --> 01:06:31.339 align:start position:0%
all our kids to learn how to read
 
01:06:34.930 --> 01:06:34.940 align:start position:0%
somehow that should be in there
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
I mean right do you have suggestions on
 
01:06:42.349 --> 01:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
how to emphasize that and the you know
 
01:06:44.809 --> 01:06:44.819 align:start position:0%
I'm well any thoughts you have you can
 
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
send to me I'm yep no I'm I'm open to uh
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
suggestions that's for sure
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
yeah no I mean
 
01:06:55.069 --> 01:06:55.079 align:start position:0%
aren't all kids supposed to have the
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
ability to do the state assessment which
 
01:07:01.370 --> 01:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
is has a reading component once a year
 
01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:01.970 align:start position:0%
is has a reading component once a year
um

01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:06.770 --> 01:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
but you would want to know any student
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
to me it doesn't matter the level of
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
progress as long as there's progress in
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
kids that I don't have control over but
 
01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
you need to know otherwise you're going
 
01:07:19.730 --> 01:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
to be losing a population and it's not
 
01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:22.309 align:start position:0%
to be losing a population and it's not
right

01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
um if I could just touch on a couple of
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
things you mentioned yeah in terms of
 
01:07:30.890 --> 01:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
the data and data teams um the uh
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
professional development
 
01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
um session I went to was down in
 
01:07:39.130 --> 01:07:39.140 align:start position:0%
Londonderry and they had an assistant
 
01:07:42.849 --> 01:07:42.859 align:start position:0%
superintendent who was the presenter
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:07:45.119 --> 01:07:45.650 align:start position:0%
talking about
um

01:07:45.650 --> 01:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:48.529 --> 01:07:48.539 align:start position:0%
data driven and the way they do it in
 
01:07:51.490 --> 01:07:51.500 align:start position:0%
their District it was um
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
to a very very fine detail
 
01:07:58.730 --> 01:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
um the spreadsheets that the teachers
 
01:08:00.130 --> 01:08:00.140 align:start position:0%
had to keep
 
01:08:04.609 --> 01:08:04.619 align:start position:0%
were extensive and you know I heard some
 
01:08:07.490 --> 01:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
you know feedback that
 
01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
um you know the amount of time that it
 
01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:13.799 align:start position:0%
would take a teacher to input me all
 
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
that information that they wanted into
 
01:08:19.309 --> 01:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheet so that's you know a a
 
01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
balancing point I guess but I have
 
01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
looked at some
 
01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:25.390 align:start position:0%
looked at some
um

01:08:25.390 --> 01:08:25.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:30.349 --> 01:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
systems of assessment that do build a
 
01:08:32.570 --> 01:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
lot of that data for the teacher based
 
01:08:35.209 --> 01:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
on the assessment so I think that you
 
01:08:36.890 --> 01:08:36.900 align:start position:0%
know that's something that that
 
01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:40.980 align:start position:0%
department should take into account but
 
01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
also on the instructional side
 
01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:45.189 align:start position:0%
also on the instructional side
um

01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
a number of states have uh said
 
01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
um to their districts you will use one
 
01:08:57.229 --> 01:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
of these you know six or seven programs
 
01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
of instruction
 
01:09:02.809 --> 01:09:02.819 align:start position:0%
which I you know I wasn't going there
 
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
um so in talking with the Department we
 
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
said the the department will offer
 
01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.130 align:start position:0%
said the the department will offer
guidance

01:09:09.130 --> 01:09:09.140 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
01:09:12.490 --> 01:09:12.500 align:start position:0%
on research base
 
01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
instructional materials and we left it
 
01:09:16.610 --> 01:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
at that
 
01:09:18.829 --> 01:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
and obviously that makes to me it makes
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
more sense than as a legislator I
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be interfering in local
 
01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:24.900 align:start position:0%
control and I shouldn't be interfering
 
01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:25.610 align:start position:0%
control and I shouldn't be interfering
in

01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
the government mandate
 
01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
I mean it's the right thing to do to
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
force this evidence-based reading
 
01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:34.970 align:start position:0%
force this evidence-based reading
um

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
and that's pretty much it
 
01:09:39.890 --> 01:09:39.900 align:start position:0%
yes representative work to be done okay
 
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
well it kind of relates to what
 
01:09:44.209 --> 01:09:44.219 align:start position:0%
representative cascadin was saying about
 
01:09:46.970 --> 01:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
addressing the needs of all all readers
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
or all students this is only pertaining
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
to those this whole bill really pertains
 
01:09:55.729 --> 01:09:55.739 align:start position:0%
to those who exhibit a deficiency
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
so then I'm getting back to like this
 
01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
one thing that seems to be emerging as a
 
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
a big negative is that three queuing
 
01:10:03.890 --> 01:10:03.900 align:start position:0%
system of reading and not having it for
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
these deficient students and their you
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
know the attempt to address their needs
 
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
so does that so then
 
01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
ultimately it seems like you want fewer
 
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
kids being deficient if you're teaching
 
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
if you continue to teach this three
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
queuing system that's inefficient are
 
01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
you going to be
 
01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
not addressing the needs of of readers
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
they will then become deficient does
 
01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
that make any sense when I'm saying that
 
01:10:32.810 --> 01:10:32.820 align:start position:0%
you if you continue to do uh the three
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
queuing which is inefficient with the
 
01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
students not addressed by this bill
 
01:10:39.770 --> 01:10:39.780 align:start position:0%
right in kindergarten first second third
 
01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
that then you will have more deficient
 
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
readers that then the the
 
01:10:48.169 --> 01:10:48.179 align:start position:0%
percentages that you were citing about
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh like nape scores for instance and how
 
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.310 align:start position:0%
uh like nape scores for instance and how
low

01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
low
 
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
how low proficiency is I mean ultimately
 
01:10:57.290 --> 01:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
you want to address that and get that
 
01:10:59.930 --> 01:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:01.370 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I'm getting my point
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
across but it's the idea of let me take
 
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
a stab at it yeah just brainstorming
 
01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
here um yeah
 
01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
um I think we we tried to go in that
 
01:11:15.290 --> 01:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
direction by uh saying it had to be all
 
01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:19.140 align:start position:0%
students screened in K through three
 
01:11:23.570 --> 01:11:23.580 align:start position:0%
um uh and it was three times a year
 
01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:24.830 align:start position:0%
um uh and it was three times a year
um

01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
last year when we were discussing this
 
01:11:30.290 --> 01:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
there was some feedback that
 
01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
um well if uh say in first grade the
 
01:11:34.199 --> 01:11:35.630 align:start position:0%
um well if uh say in first grade the
student

01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
um didn't show deficiencies then they
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to be assessed anymore
 
01:11:45.169 --> 01:11:45.179 align:start position:0%
but in people I talked to said
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
um you can mask that
 
01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
um by the by using the queuing methods
 
01:11:56.590 --> 01:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
and and Etc so that we wanted to keep
 
01:12:00.169 --> 01:12:00.179 align:start position:0%
doing the assessments so that we would
 
01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
catch those students and not
 
01:12:04.490 --> 01:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
um have
 
01:12:06.370 --> 01:12:06.380 align:start position:0%
um their
 
01:12:10.370 --> 01:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
their Solutions Mask real deficiencies
 
01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:12.780 align:start position:0%
in in Reading
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
um so you know we I took that approach
 
01:12:18.530 --> 01:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
in here
 
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
um but any more
 
01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
um ideas on how to make sure that this
 
01:12:28.030 --> 01:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
is impacting all students some
 
01:12:31.490 --> 01:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.229 align:start position:0%
 
like

01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:12:35.450 --> 01:12:35.460 align:start position:0%
the question was along those lines and I
 
01:12:37.450 --> 01:12:37.460 align:start position:0%
was just wondering where
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
specifically you were seeing that
 
01:12:44.450 --> 01:12:44.460 align:start position:0%
not all kids were being reached by this
 
01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
so that we could make sure that they are
 
01:12:50.510 --> 01:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
so where is the downfall I guess
 
01:12:53.149 --> 01:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
that you're seeing
 
01:12:55.850 --> 01:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
do you mean it's requieuing sister no no
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
oh okay no no you said not all kids
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
would be you said not all kids would be
 
01:13:03.530 --> 01:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
reached right and and I guess I didn't
 
01:13:06.669 --> 01:13:06.679 align:start position:0%
get that out of here so I'm wondering
 
01:13:09.649 --> 01:13:09.659 align:start position:0%
where you're getting that so yes all
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
well some kids
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
um attend Learning Centers some kids
 
01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
take online classes some some kids
 
01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:21.470 align:start position:0%
take online classes some some kids
um

01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
have different types of learning
 
01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:24.470 align:start position:0%
have different types of learning
programs

01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:26.330 align:start position:0%
programs
um

01:13:26.330 --> 01:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:29.930 --> 01:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:33.490 --> 01:13:33.500 align:start position:0%
I see so more non-public
 
01:13:35.689 --> 01:13:35.699 align:start position:0%
we've got the bulk of the kids in public
 
01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
schools but we do have a large number in
 
01:13:40.669 --> 01:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
non-public different a variety I don't
 
01:13:42.890 --> 01:13:42.900 align:start position:0%
know specifics but
 
01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:43.790 align:start position:0%
know specifics but
um

01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:45.780 align:start position:0%
and I just want to bring up the nape
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
scores there isn't anything in student
 
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
learning that did not go down during the
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
coveted years
 
01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
so I would place a whole lot of value
 
01:13:57.050 --> 01:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
not that they're not accurate they
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
probably are
 
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
but I wouldn't base all of it on what
 
01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
kids daring did during Colwood because
 
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
if you've worked with that any kids
 
01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
during that time you know they turned it
 
01:14:13.450 --> 01:14:13.460 align:start position:0%
right off I don't care what age level
 
01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
however I mean I think you had a 2003
 
01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
data point of 40 at what grade 8 or
 
01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
grade four I don't know it wasn't sure
 
01:14:24.530 --> 01:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
but it was a few years after that that
 
01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
the national reading panel came out with
 
01:14:28.729 --> 01:14:28.739 align:start position:0%
their research and I'd be curious to see
 
01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
if there was any increase after that if
 
01:14:35.090 --> 01:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
you read about reading first at the
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
national level it was a total debacle
 
01:14:42.890 --> 01:14:42.900 align:start position:0%
um because of corruption at the top
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
but us little peons down in the little
 
01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
districts had some benefit of a lot of
 
01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:50.689 align:start position:0%
districts had some benefit of a lot of
dollars

01:14:50.689 --> 01:14:50.699 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
um but again we're talking about
 
01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:54.900 align:start position:0%
evidence-based reading and the state
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
also had a really strong when Title One
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
was more focused on reading and then it
 
01:15:02.810 --> 01:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
slowly picked up math
 
01:15:05.149 --> 01:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
and now it can fund behavioral
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
specialists or other types of services
 
01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
when it was primarily reading based
 
01:15:15.290 --> 01:15:15.300 align:start position:0%
the state had a granite state reading
 
01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:16.790 align:start position:0%
the state had a granite state reading
Association

01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
Association
 
01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
and then every region in the state had a
 
01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:20.810 align:start position:0%
and then every region in the state had a
chapter

01:15:20.810 --> 01:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
chapter
 
01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
and those entities were very active in
 
01:15:26.090 --> 01:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
the field to the point of having New
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
England reading Association
 
01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
did a um
 
01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
did Regional conferences and I presented
 
01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
at those conferences and we've learned
 
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
from other districts around New England
 
01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
and so that structure I don't think
 
01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
exists anymore
 
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
so there was more of an emphasis
 
01:15:49.010 --> 01:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
you know and it was more of a support
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
system around teaching reading now
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
there's been so many offshoots I mean we
 
01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
have to deal with social emotional
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
Behavior I mean go figure right our job
 
01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
is to teach reading teach math
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
and so something had to go
 
01:16:06.169 --> 01:16:06.179 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying I'm just thinking about
 
01:16:08.510 --> 01:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
it out loud now it's like obviously
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah I
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
I think the whole community
 
01:16:20.209 --> 01:16:20.219 align:start position:0%
has to be be involved in this if we're
 
01:16:22.729 --> 01:16:22.739 align:start position:0%
going to get to where we want to be
 
01:16:24.770 --> 01:16:24.780 align:start position:0%
um so that's why I did
 
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
want the districts to engage with local
 
01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:28.790 align:start position:0%
want the districts to engage with local
stakeholders

01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
01:16:30.169 --> 01:16:30.179 align:start position:0%
um and also
 
01:16:30.179 --> 01:16:30.770 align:start position:0%
um and also
um

01:16:30.770 --> 01:16:30.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:34.250 --> 01:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
uh just initials discussions with the
 
01:16:36.890 --> 01:16:36.900 align:start position:0%
state librarian about you know expanding
 
01:16:39.229 --> 01:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
the work of libraries
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
um uh so uh you know that's I think an
 
01:16:45.050 --> 01:16:45.060 align:start position:0%
ongoing discussion
 
01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:46.490 align:start position:0%
ongoing discussion
yeah

01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner I think on another
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
discussion has to be integrating
 
01:16:53.330 --> 01:16:53.340 align:start position:0%
literacy into
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
um all the other courses
 
01:16:57.169 --> 01:16:57.179 align:start position:0%
um particularly there's a strong
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
connection between music and physical
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
education and literacy and probably art
 
01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
as well so
 
01:17:04.729 --> 01:17:04.739 align:start position:0%
um you know when we start getting
 
01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
programs and we start blocking out
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
things because we have to devote so much
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
energy to something else that
 
01:17:15.229 --> 01:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
um it and I know a lot of places cut
 
01:17:17.090 --> 01:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
back on physical education just went to
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
you know open Play time uh undirected
 
01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
play time and literacy
 
01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:23.940 align:start position:0%
um there is a very strong connection
 
01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
there so in the same way with music and
 
01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
art so I just want to make that pitch
 
01:17:30.890 --> 01:17:30.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:38.709 --> 01:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
hi there my name is Bibi Casey and I'm
 
01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
from New London I wasn't planning to
 
01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
speak today but I'm actually getting
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
text messages from somebody who's
 
01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
watching it leave live stream and she
 
01:17:52.729 --> 01:17:52.739 align:start position:0%
wanted me to share these comments and
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
her name is Christine Downing and uh she
 
01:17:57.649 --> 01:17:57.659 align:start position:0%
was the curriculum director at the
 
01:17:59.630 --> 01:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
Kearsarge District up until last year
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
and now she's currently a curriculum
 
01:18:03.290 --> 01:18:03.300 align:start position:0%
director for I think it's Grantham
 
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
Plainfield and Enfield
 
01:18:09.890 --> 01:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
and very knowledgeable on on this and I
 
01:18:11.810 --> 01:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
commend her for the programming that she
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
created at kears Arch where very
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
detailed screening protocols uh lots and
 
01:18:19.490 --> 01:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
lots of data I was a school board member
 
01:18:22.149 --> 01:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
at the time so she would present to us
 
01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
quite frequently so her comment here
 
01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:28.860 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'll read to you is
 
01:18:31.729 --> 01:18:31.739 align:start position:0%
um I would offer that have we done any
 
01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
alignment to the state assessments to
 
01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
key phonics elements the poor
 
01:18:38.330 --> 01:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
performance on these assessments is a
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
Lynch in this discussion however State
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
assessments and reading don't typically
 
01:18:44.930 --> 01:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
give us the kind of data we need to
 
01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
properly inform this need and process
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
the state assessment should be a key
 
01:18:51.169 --> 01:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
first step in supporting proper data
 
01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
Gathering related to phonics instruction
 
01:18:55.790 --> 01:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
currently we get scores only on Craft
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
and structure integration of knowledge
 
01:18:59.870 --> 01:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
and ideas and key details about
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
informational and literary texts if
 
01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
State results are the driver then start
 
01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
with looking at State assessment design
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
which is the purview of RSA 193c and she
 
01:19:12.050 --> 01:19:12.060 align:start position:0%
also has a comment about I'd like to
 
01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
know how to Bill aligns to RSA 193e
 
01:19:17.209 --> 01:19:17.219 align:start position:0%
which provides parameters in terms of
 
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
the role of the State versus local
 
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
control which I think you've been
 
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
talking a little bit about and she also
 
01:19:26.270 --> 01:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
asks if it might be possible to hold a
 
01:19:28.189 --> 01:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
Roundtable discussion to get some
 
01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
information about what is happening and
 
01:19:32.330 --> 01:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
not happening in schools I know
 
01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli that you've been
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
having reaching out to a lot of folks
 
01:19:38.570 --> 01:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
and having a lot of conversations and I
 
01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
I I'm sure you all have been doing the
 
01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:42.110 align:start position:0%
I I'm sure you all have been doing the
same

01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:19:43.970 --> 01:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
um but and finally I just want to thank
 
01:19:46.010 --> 01:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
you for all of the work you've done on
 
01:19:48.050 --> 01:19:48.060 align:start position:0%
this I've been around for a while
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
working on all of this legislation and
 
01:19:54.050 --> 01:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
it really makes me feel so good that
 
01:19:56.030 --> 01:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
these discussions are happening they
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
weren't happening seven to eight years
 
01:19:59.510 --> 01:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
ago when we passed the first dyslexia
 
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
law I am you know have seen so much
 
01:20:06.649 --> 01:20:06.659 align:start position:0%
improvement and I I thank you all for
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
your work on this I really do thank you
 
01:20:11.930 --> 01:20:11.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for sharing those comments
 
01:20:14.689 --> 01:20:14.699 align:start position:0%
it just made me think also whether
 
01:20:17.090 --> 01:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
um the department has a title one
 
01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:19.310 align:start position:0%
um the department has a title one
consultant

01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
consultant
 
01:20:21.709 --> 01:20:21.719 align:start position:0%
in terms of professional development I
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's somebody here
 
01:20:32.890 --> 01:20:32.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:40.430 --> 01:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:42.110 --> 01:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
sorry is that working yes Kathy
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
McCaffrey the reading consultant for the
 
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed moved into that role
 
01:20:46.199 --> 01:20:48.410 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed moved into that role
recently

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
recently
 
01:20:50.209 --> 01:20:50.219 align:start position:0%
and you had a question about potato one
 
01:20:52.189 --> 01:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
we do have a title one
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
um in our department
 
01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:05.870 align:start position:0%
 
no

01:21:05.870 --> 01:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:07.970 --> 01:21:07.980 align:start position:0%
body that you heard this morning I think
 
01:21:09.890 --> 01:21:09.900 align:start position:0%
it's been a wonderful conversation thank
 
01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
you for your thoughts and
 
01:21:15.649 --> 01:21:15.659 align:start position:0%
um interested to see how it continues
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
thank you yes
 
01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
being part of the state are you looking
 
01:21:29.770 --> 01:21:29.780 align:start position:0%
at the state assessment
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
to see if there are changes that need to
 
01:21:35.689 --> 01:21:35.699 align:start position:0%
be made based on Phonics Etc Nate you
 
01:21:39.890 --> 01:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:41.689 --> 01:21:41.699 align:start position:0%
are we looking at the state assessment
 
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
in regards to phonics
 
01:21:46.370 --> 01:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
and these other things that we're trying
 
01:21:48.649 --> 01:21:48.659 align:start position:0%
to make sure are being taught now are we
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
following that up
 
01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:57.530 --> 01:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
steps for reporting State assessment
 
01:21:57.540 --> 01:21:58.570 align:start position:0%
steps for reporting State assessment
normally

01:21:58.570 --> 01:21:58.580 align:start position:0%
normally
 
01:22:01.010 --> 01:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
reported under this large subjects of
 
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
reading and writing Independence
 
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
so that's some analysis that is
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:22:14.450 --> 01:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
01:22:15.649 --> 01:22:15.659 align:start position:0%
um I think there's someone else with a
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Karen Laplante and um
 
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
first of all I want to thank you all for
 
01:22:36.050 --> 01:22:36.060 align:start position:0%
all the work that you do
 
01:22:39.649 --> 01:22:39.659 align:start position:0%
um I was fortunate enough to
 
01:22:42.169 --> 01:22:42.179 align:start position:0%
um be at a professional development
 
01:22:44.030 --> 01:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity where representative
 
01:22:46.330 --> 01:22:46.340 align:start position:0%
cardelli was there and I learned about
 
01:22:48.970 --> 01:22:48.980 align:start position:0%
his work on this bill
 
01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:50.630 align:start position:0%
his work on this bill
and

01:22:50.630 --> 01:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
um I am a reading specialist I'm
 
01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
actually a special education reading
 
01:22:57.890 --> 01:22:57.900 align:start position:0%
specialist at a middle school right now
 
01:23:00.649 --> 01:23:00.659 align:start position:0%
but I've worked this is my first year at
 
01:23:02.689 --> 01:23:02.699 align:start position:0%
the middle school but prior to that I
 
01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
was in elementary for 12 years both as a
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
special educator and
 
01:23:11.209 --> 01:23:11.219 align:start position:0%
um as a special education reading
 
01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
specialist I was fortunate enough when I
 
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
started my schooling towards the end of
 
01:23:19.610 --> 01:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
my um
 
01:23:23.810 --> 01:23:23.820 align:start position:0%
grab my bachelor's degree I connected
 
01:23:26.330 --> 01:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
with Beth McClure who was essential in
 
01:23:29.050 --> 01:23:29.060 align:start position:0%
putting together the last dyslexia bill
 
01:23:32.090 --> 01:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
and I worked at her charter school and I
 
01:23:34.010 --> 01:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
was trained in Norton Gillingham right
 
01:23:35.930 --> 01:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
from the get-go so I've been working
 
01:23:38.270 --> 01:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
with struggling readers for many many
 
01:23:40.370 --> 01:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
years and they are near and dear to my
 
01:23:43.490 --> 01:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
heart so this bill is very important to
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
me and very important to the students
 
01:23:50.450 --> 01:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
that I serve and that we as teachers and
 
01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:51.790 align:start position:0%
that I serve and that we as teachers and
specialists

01:23:51.790 --> 01:23:51.800 align:start position:0%
specialists
 
01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:53.570 align:start position:0%
specialists
serve

01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
serve
 
01:23:55.790 --> 01:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
so I thought I would just
 
01:23:58.010 --> 01:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
um I had a little mix up on the date so
 
01:23:59.810 --> 01:23:59.820 align:start position:0%
I don't have anything formally prepared
 
01:24:02.930 --> 01:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
but I do want to just speak to the
 
01:24:05.689 --> 01:24:05.699 align:start position:0%
components of the bill a little bit
 
01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
um you know I see that there are a few
 
01:24:10.610 --> 01:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
major components the universal screener
 
01:24:12.169 --> 01:24:12.179 align:start position:0%
I know we've talked about a little bit I
 
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
just wanted to talk about the importance
 
01:24:15.649 --> 01:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
of it
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
um I've worked in schools for many years
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
that don't have a universal screener and
 
01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult for students who are
 
01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
struggling whether they are struggling
 
01:24:27.890 --> 01:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
and they're just under the cusp or they
 
01:24:29.689 --> 01:24:29.699 align:start position:0%
are really struggling
 
01:24:31.669 --> 01:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
um to be identified I don't mean special
 
01:24:34.330 --> 01:24:34.340 align:start position:0%
education identification I mean just
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
looked at so that they don't slip
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
through the cracks the universal
 
01:24:40.370 --> 01:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
screener helps ensure that kids are not
 
01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
slipping through the cracks having it
 
01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
done three times a year is essential
 
01:24:46.610 --> 01:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
because when you do it at the beginning
 
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
of the year and the end of the year you
 
01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
have no midpoint to guide you to say
 
01:24:53.450 --> 01:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
this is working or this isn't we need to
 
01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
tweak it we need to change it so I'm
 
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
very happy to see that the three times a
 
01:25:01.729 --> 01:25:01.739 align:start position:0%
year is written into this bill
 
01:25:04.370 --> 01:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
um also as far as the accountability
 
01:25:07.729 --> 01:25:07.739 align:start position:0%
piece I found with the dyslexia law that
 
01:25:10.130 --> 01:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
we had in the past although it was very
 
01:25:11.630 --> 01:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
good and I was very thrilled to have it
 
01:25:12.770 --> 01:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
it didn't really have that
 
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
accountability piece and I don't think
 
01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
that the accountability piece should be
 
01:25:19.970 --> 01:25:19.980 align:start position:0%
in there to
 
01:25:25.010 --> 01:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
um you know be you know punitive to
 
01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
schools I think that it's there because
 
01:25:30.950 --> 01:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
schools need districts to recognize
 
01:25:34.130 --> 01:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
what's going on at the district level
 
01:25:35.570 --> 01:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
needs to recognize what's going on in
 
01:25:37.010 --> 01:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
the school so that they can guide them
 
01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
and help them right and then the state
 
01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
needs to be able to recognize what's
 
01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
going on in the district so that the
 
01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
state can guide and help the district so
 
01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
I think that accountability piece is
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
very important
 
01:25:51.530 --> 01:25:51.540 align:start position:0%
and at the school level which I have
 
01:25:54.530 --> 01:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
seen I've seen assessments being carried
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
out and you know laws that have put in
 
01:25:58.729 --> 01:25:58.739 align:start position:0%
place be followed but we don't have that
 
01:26:02.229 --> 01:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
accountability and peace in place
 
01:26:04.370 --> 01:26:04.380 align:start position:0%
Administration and even teachers they
 
01:26:05.689 --> 01:26:05.699 align:start position:0%
don't know what to do with the data
 
01:26:07.370 --> 01:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
after that right you know they don't
 
01:26:10.189 --> 01:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily know the steps that need to
 
01:26:12.169 --> 01:26:12.179 align:start position:0%
be taken after that so I think by having
 
01:26:13.729 --> 01:26:13.739 align:start position:0%
the accountability piece in there it's
 
01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
very important the science of reading
 
01:26:19.870 --> 01:26:19.880 align:start position:0%
based methods and materials
 
01:26:21.890 --> 01:26:21.900 align:start position:0%
component that's in the bill right now
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know that speaks from
 
01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
um I noticed that you know the screener
 
01:26:28.810 --> 01:26:28.820 align:start position:0%
is k-3 which I think is very appropriate
 
01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
the materials are K to five right so all
 
01:26:34.129 --> 01:26:34.139 align:start position:0%
throughout Elementary School
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
and really in middle school as well
 
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.149 align:start position:0%
and really in middle school as well
students

01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:26:38.159 --> 01:26:39.470 align:start position:0%
students
should

01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:41.460 align:start position:0%
be taught with
 
01:26:43.370 --> 01:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
um you know methods and materials that
 
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
aligned with the science of reading
 
01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
um not just up until third grade so I'm
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
glad to see that that's in there up
 
01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
until fifth grade one of the problems
 
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
that we have now in schools is that
 
01:26:55.850 --> 01:26:55.860 align:start position:0%
there's a great disconnect between
 
01:26:57.770 --> 01:26:57.780 align:start position:0%
um methods and materials that are used
 
01:27:00.770 --> 01:27:00.780 align:start position:0%
at the tier one level which is
 
01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
um you know your your whole classroom
 
01:27:05.629 --> 01:27:05.639 align:start position:0%
instruction and what is used at a tier
 
01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
two or a tier three level and ideally we
 
01:27:11.390 --> 01:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
would have those methods and materials
 
01:27:13.790 --> 01:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
aligned at each level
 
01:27:16.610 --> 01:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
um students do all learn to read in the
 
01:27:19.610 --> 01:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
same way but students who struggle need
 
01:27:23.330 --> 01:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
more of those science of reading based
 
01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:25.010 align:start position:0%
more of those science of reading based
methods

01:27:25.010 --> 01:27:25.020 align:start position:0%
methods
 
01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
um as you were speaking of those are
 
01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
very important components they need more
 
01:27:31.729 --> 01:27:31.739 align:start position:0%
time at the tier two level at the three
 
01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
tier three level they need even more
 
01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
time but they still need that
 
01:27:37.629 --> 01:27:37.639 align:start position:0%
evidence-based explicit cumulative
 
01:27:40.570 --> 01:27:40.580 align:start position:0%
systematic instruction
 
01:27:43.729 --> 01:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing that now I think a lot of
 
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
schools and certainly in my experience
 
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
specifically are still using Lucy
 
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
Calkins materials
 
01:27:51.890 --> 01:27:51.900 align:start position:0%
so it's been out
 
01:27:53.450 --> 01:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
um the information is there that these
 
01:27:55.070 --> 01:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
are not effective
 
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
um it's been out for a few years now but
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's really just come to a head most
 
01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
recently and schools I think are kind of
 
01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:03.530 align:start position:0%
recently and schools I think are kind of
stuck

01:28:03.530 --> 01:28:03.540 align:start position:0%
stuck
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
um and they they need that guidance from
 
01:28:06.890 --> 01:28:06.900 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:28:09.229 --> 01:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
um to help them to know what they should
 
01:28:11.810 --> 01:28:11.820 align:start position:0%
be using and help with funding so that
 
01:28:13.090 --> 01:28:13.100 align:start position:0%
they can actually
 
01:28:17.629 --> 01:28:17.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
um and I I would be thrilled to to see
 
01:28:21.950 --> 01:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
that happening in schools
 
01:28:23.629 --> 01:28:23.639 align:start position:0%
um it's very difficult for the
 
01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
elementary schools to move away from
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
that Lucy Hawkins materials it's a giant
 
01:28:30.649 --> 01:28:30.659 align:start position:0%
overhaul for schools and again they need
 
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
support in doing so
 
01:28:34.490 --> 01:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
um I also have to say that the three
 
01:28:37.129 --> 01:28:37.139 align:start position:0%
queuing system is something that I've
 
01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
actually seen first hand first-hand
 
01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
harming students
 
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
working at the tier 3 level for many
 
01:28:47.149 --> 01:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
many years I have students that will
 
01:28:50.330 --> 01:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
come into me and all they know how to do
 
01:28:53.330 --> 01:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
is guess at words and it's so sad and it
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
takes so much time for me to turn that
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
around and break those bad habits that
 
01:29:01.250 --> 01:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
they've been taught and the other sad
 
01:29:03.110 --> 01:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
pieces I spend
 
01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:03.709 align:start position:0%
pieces I spend
um

01:29:03.709 --> 01:29:03.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
so much time and energy and heart and
 
01:29:08.570 --> 01:29:08.580 align:start position:0%
soul into providing good instruction for
 
01:29:10.970 --> 01:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
these struggling readers and they leave
 
01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
my room and they go back to class and
 
01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
they're told to guess at the words so
 
01:29:17.990 --> 01:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
for them to make progress it's very
 
01:29:20.570 --> 01:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
difficult as it is because they have
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
whether they have a reading disability
 
01:29:24.729 --> 01:29:24.739 align:start position:0%
or whether they have some other
 
01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
disability or circumstance that's
 
01:29:30.410 --> 01:29:30.420 align:start position:0%
causing them to be behind to have that
 
01:29:33.729 --> 01:29:33.739 align:start position:0%
disconnect between their intervention
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
and their classroom instruction really
 
01:29:39.890 --> 01:29:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:42.290 --> 01:29:42.300 align:start position:0%
last piece well two of my things I
 
01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to say as far as the meaningful
 
01:29:45.950 --> 01:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
gains I agree with that that students
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
need to be making meaningful meaningful
 
01:29:50.209 --> 01:29:50.219 align:start position:0%
gains I would like to see
 
01:29:53.390 --> 01:29:53.400 align:start position:0%
um some time frame around that as far as
 
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
how long kids are in an intervention at
 
01:29:56.750 --> 01:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
the tier two level before they get
 
01:29:59.030 --> 01:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
referred for special education because I
 
01:30:03.890 --> 01:30:03.900 align:start position:0%
too have seen students in tier two much
 
01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
too long and we're not necessarily first
 
01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
off using the right materials may not
 
01:30:11.570 --> 01:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
have teachers who are highly trained to
 
01:30:13.870 --> 01:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
be working with those students
 
01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
but also
 
01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:17.510 align:start position:0%
but also
um

01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:21.169 --> 01:30:21.179 align:start position:0%
they need to be able to move on to
 
01:30:24.110 --> 01:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
special ed or have the proper tweaks to
 
01:30:26.270 --> 01:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
their instruction to
 
01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
um help them improve and move along in
 
01:30:30.590 --> 01:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
their reading last thing I wanted to
 
01:30:33.290 --> 01:30:33.300 align:start position:0%
mention was the teacher prep programs
 
01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:34.739 align:start position:0%
um I do have some personal experience
 
01:30:36.410 --> 01:30:36.420 align:start position:0%
with that because my daughter is in a
 
01:30:38.570 --> 01:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
teacher prep program at the moment at a
 
01:30:40.490 --> 01:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
school here in New Hampshire and they
 
01:30:42.250 --> 01:30:42.260 align:start position:0%
were teaching both
 
01:30:45.709 --> 01:30:45.719 align:start position:0%
methods balance literacy and
 
01:30:48.110 --> 01:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
um instruction lines with the science of
 
01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
reading and they really wanted to stay
 
01:30:52.930 --> 01:30:52.940 align:start position:0%
true to that middle ground
 
01:30:55.310 --> 01:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
she knew better she's in the letters
 
01:30:58.250 --> 01:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
training she has me her roommate she
 
01:30:59.570 --> 01:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
just told me the story a couple of days
 
01:31:02.510 --> 01:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
ago her roommate said to her
 
01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:03.290 align:start position:0%
ago her roommate said to her
um

01:31:03.290 --> 01:31:03.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
you know I think I'm gonna go she's a
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
Elementary Ed major as well and she said
 
01:31:09.709 --> 01:31:09.719 align:start position:0%
you know what I think I'm going to go
 
01:31:12.770 --> 01:31:12.780 align:start position:0%
with that balanced literacy approach the
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
science of reading approach there's so
 
01:31:16.010 --> 01:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
much terminology and I just don't get
 
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
all that Digraph syllable types this
 
01:31:20.209 --> 01:31:20.219 align:start position:0%
that and the other thing and my daughter
 
01:31:22.250 --> 01:31:22.260 align:start position:0%
had to kind of stop her in her tracks
 
01:31:24.770 --> 01:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
you know and say wait a minute all your
 
01:31:26.930 --> 01:31:26.940 align:start position:0%
kids are not going to learn to read if
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
you go that route so that's kind of
 
01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
where we are with with our teacher prep
 
01:31:37.310 --> 01:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
um and I believe that's that's all I had
 
01:31:40.010 --> 01:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
but I appreciate your time and um the
 
01:31:41.570 --> 01:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
work that you've all put in
 
01:31:43.729 --> 01:31:43.739 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you very much for uh
 
01:31:46.010 --> 01:31:46.020 align:start position:0%
coming in in your comments uh would you
 
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
take the question sure oh no not
 
01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
necessarily a question okay just and
 
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you I uh what what comes to mind
 
01:31:55.370 --> 01:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
is I'd be curious to know if we can get
 
01:31:57.950 --> 01:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
this data is how many schools how many
 
01:31:59.750 --> 01:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
elementary schools use a universal
 
01:32:01.970 --> 01:32:01.980 align:start position:0%
screener to start with
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
I mean I've I haven't had experience
 
01:32:06.530 --> 01:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
with a district that has not and
 
01:32:08.689 --> 01:32:08.699 align:start position:0%
obviously that's only three districts
 
01:32:11.330 --> 01:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you that
 
01:32:13.610 --> 01:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
um three queuing has not north of the
 
01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:15.770 align:start position:0%
um three queuing has not north of the
notch

01:32:15.770 --> 01:32:15.780 align:start position:0%
notch
 
01:32:19.250 --> 01:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
um but nwea is a popular one
 
01:32:21.290 --> 01:32:21.300 align:start position:0%
um Ames web is another one
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
I think some are moving towards acadians
 
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
um but I would be curious to see which
 
01:32:30.169 --> 01:32:30.179 align:start position:0%
elementary schools don't use a universal
 
01:32:33.530 --> 01:32:33.540 align:start position:0%
screener and if it's a lot
 
01:32:35.870 --> 01:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
that's pretty concerning something fell
 
01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:37.070 align:start position:0%
that's pretty concerning something fell
somewhere

01:32:37.070 --> 01:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
01:32:39.050 --> 01:32:39.060 align:start position:0%
pretty hard
 
01:32:41.870 --> 01:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
I think the universal screener is where
 
01:32:43.850 --> 01:32:43.860 align:start position:0%
we have to start you know that's that's
 
01:32:47.930 --> 01:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
a very important starting point yeah and
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
like I say I haven't experienced a
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
district that didn't have one so
 
01:32:54.530 --> 01:32:54.540 align:start position:0%
obviously it's an issue somewhere we can
 
01:32:57.110 --> 01:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
try and follow up yep thank you
 
01:33:13.129 --> 01:33:13.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:13.139 --> 01:33:18.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:33:18.430 --> 01:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:20.930 --> 01:33:20.940 align:start position:0%
that's the assessment
 
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:33.709 --> 01:33:33.719 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting and all the be in
 
01:33:35.570 --> 01:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
contact shortly about trying to schedule
 
01:33:35.580 --> 01:33:38.689 align:start position:0%
contact shortly about trying to schedule
that

01:33:38.689 --> 01:33:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:38.699 --> 01:33:39.770 align:start position:0%
 
great

01:33:39.770 --> 01:33:39.780 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:33:41.629 --> 01:33:41.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much so I I guess that
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
ends our our subcommittee and we'll get
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:07.250 align:start position:0%

01:34:32.890 --> 01:34:32.900 align:start position:0%

mostly all he wanted to do to take a nap
 
01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
did you like
 
01:38:56.470 --> 01:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
me you know what because
 
01:39:01.550 --> 01:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
I wanted to say yeah but like always
 
01:39:10.610 --> 01:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:12.250 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:39:12.250 --> 01:39:12.260 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:39:14.570 --> 01:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
my son's a dart and they've been with
 
01:39:16.729 --> 01:39:16.739 align:start position:0%
his parents weekend so he just wanted to
 
01:39:16.739 --> 01:39:37.129 align:start position:0%
his parents weekend so he just wanted to
go

01:39:37.129 --> 01:39:37.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:39.890 --> 01:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like to go ahead with uh the
 
01:39:41.629 --> 01:39:41.639 align:start position:0%
meeting we have scheduled for 11 o'clock
 
01:39:43.250 --> 01:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
seeing it's a little bit after that at
 
01:39:47.330 --> 01:39:47.340 align:start position:0%
this time uh the the meeting is SB 266
 
01:39:50.590 --> 01:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
and as you recall
 
01:39:54.890 --> 01:39:54.900 align:start position:0%
266 was a fairly lengthy bill
 
01:39:57.770 --> 01:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
um dealt with a number of components of
 
01:40:03.470 --> 01:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
statue from chapter 193 c e h and k
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
and it was like 22 pages in length and
 
01:40:10.669 --> 01:40:10.679 align:start position:0%
we've met several times regarding that
 
01:40:14.110 --> 01:40:14.120 align:start position:0%
um so here we are today dealing with 266
 
01:40:16.970 --> 01:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
we have re I received from the
 
01:40:19.010 --> 01:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
Department I'm glad uh Nate and Caitlin
 
01:40:20.689 --> 01:40:20.699 align:start position:0%
are here
 
01:40:23.750 --> 01:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
a request to make some changes to
 
01:40:27.290 --> 01:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
certain areas of statutes that within uh
 
01:40:30.590 --> 01:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh that I've just mentioned uh to
 
01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
support the
 
01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:33.649 align:start position:0%
support the
um

01:40:33.649 --> 01:40:33.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:36.770 --> 01:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
Essa application process which we go
 
01:40:39.290 --> 01:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
through does everybody have a copy of
 
01:40:41.870 --> 01:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment that was on the table over
 
01:40:45.890 --> 01:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
there there's extra copies right here
 
01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:47.270 align:start position:0%
there there's extra copies right here
um

01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
anybody that doesn't will pass them
 
01:40:53.930 --> 01:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:56.050 --> 01:40:56.060 align:start position:0%
Nate they're right they're all up here
 
01:41:01.310 --> 01:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:16.430 --> 01:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
so let me try to explain what went on
 
01:41:19.550 --> 01:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
here in level lasts you know several
 
01:41:22.850 --> 01:41:22.860 align:start position:0%
weeks prior to filing prior to the uh
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
11th deadline in September through the
 
01:41:29.330 --> 01:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
15th I did receive two requests from the
 
01:41:32.810 --> 01:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
Department from Dr Green uh Bureau
 
01:41:36.050 --> 01:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
administrator uh for looking at the
 
01:41:38.149 --> 01:41:38.159 align:start position:0%
accountability and assessment areas
 
01:41:40.030 --> 01:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
within legislation
 
01:41:43.250 --> 01:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
and there are two areas I took them both
 
01:41:46.490 --> 01:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
down to legislative services to try to
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
get them put into legislation and their
 
01:41:52.129 --> 01:41:52.139 align:start position:0%
response to me was you have a bill
 
01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
that's exactly incorporating much of
 
01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:56.270 align:start position:0%
that's exactly incorporating much of
this

01:41:56.270 --> 01:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:42:01.250 --> 01:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
already there in the name of SB 266 that
 
01:42:03.470 --> 01:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
was put forth by the senator course by
 
01:42:06.590 --> 01:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
Senator Ward and had a just a whole
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
boatload of areas within it that we
 
01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
struggled with
 
01:42:14.810 --> 01:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
so they said if you really want to do
 
01:42:17.209 --> 01:42:17.219 align:start position:0%
something you're best just going back
 
01:42:19.209 --> 01:42:19.219 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:42:21.410 --> 01:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
modifying what you've got in front of
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
you to reflect
 
01:42:26.930 --> 01:42:26.940 align:start position:0%
the amending language which are reflect
 
01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:29.820 align:start position:0%
what's been presented and so what I'd
 
01:42:32.270 --> 01:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
like to do because we are going to be
 
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
looking at SB 266 I like to invite boy
 
01:42:38.570 --> 01:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
Nate and and and Caitlyn up if you would
 
01:42:42.290 --> 01:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
please and as we go through it there may
 
01:42:45.109 --> 01:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
be questions regarding this
 
01:42:45.119 --> 01:42:47.870 align:start position:0%
be questions regarding this
and

01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:42:50.990 --> 01:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
so we'll just in and and and look to you
 
01:42:52.609 --> 01:42:52.619 align:start position:0%
for those responses rather than having
 
01:42:53.870 --> 01:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
to call you back and forth back and
 
01:42:53.880 --> 01:43:02.090 align:start position:0%
to call you back and forth back and
forth

01:43:02.090 --> 01:43:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:05.149 --> 01:43:05.159 align:start position:0%
do you both have a copy of this
 
01:43:07.070 --> 01:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:08.390 align:start position:0%
okay great
okay

01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:10.430 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:13.129 --> 01:43:13.139 align:start position:0%
I've had some email discussions with
 
01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
Nate since this and I think what we have
 
01:43:18.530 --> 01:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
in front of you is what you know uh I
 
01:43:21.890 --> 01:43:21.900 align:start position:0%
put forward to the uh um legislative
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
Services last week
 
01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:25.070 align:start position:0%
Services last week
so

01:43:25.070 --> 01:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
um if we could
 
01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:28.790 align:start position:0%
um if we could
um

01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:31.609 --> 01:43:31.619 align:start position:0%
we can start going that this this
 
01:43:35.149 --> 01:43:35.159 align:start position:0%
amending language deals with components
 
01:43:40.189 --> 01:43:40.199 align:start position:0%
from 193 C and 193 H it doesn't have
 
01:43:42.109 --> 01:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
anything to deal with the adequacy
 
01:43:45.890 --> 01:43:45.900 align:start position:0%
formula in 193 e nor does it have
 
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
anything to do with uh 193 k
 
01:43:53.090 --> 01:43:53.100 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
01:43:55.010 --> 01:43:55.020 align:start position:0%
um on the first page we'll look at the
 
01:43:57.169 --> 01:43:57.179 align:start position:0%
first page of the amendment right now
 
01:44:00.050 --> 01:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
and you can go down and see the first
 
01:44:03.169 --> 01:44:03.179 align:start position:0%
change here on this is when we're
 
01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with program goals and
 
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
assessments for 193c colon 3
 
01:44:11.090 --> 01:44:11.100 align:start position:0%
there's a change in line 21 scratching
 
01:44:13.609 --> 01:44:13.619 align:start position:0%
out the word other and writing
 
01:44:17.570 --> 01:44:17.580 align:start position:0%
open-ended performance tasks this area a
 
01:44:20.570 --> 01:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
b c and d are a reaction to what you
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
have in line 16 the assessment
 
01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:24.719 align:start position:0%
instrument shall include but not be
 
01:44:26.330 --> 01:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
limited to
 
01:44:29.149 --> 01:44:29.159 align:start position:0%
these components of the Statewide
 
01:44:29.159 --> 01:44:30.950 align:start position:0%
these components of the Statewide
assessment

01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:37.550 --> 01:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
Nate you've crossed out other and
 
01:44:39.950 --> 01:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
Incorporated in there under 22 other
 
01:44:42.890 --> 01:44:42.900 align:start position:0%
items types Etc could you explain maybe
 
01:44:45.290 --> 01:44:45.300 align:start position:0%
a little bit why that that change is
 
01:44:45.300 --> 01:44:46.910 align:start position:0%
a little bit why that that change is
necessary

01:44:46.910 --> 01:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:44:50.030 --> 01:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I know red makes me think
 
01:44:52.070 --> 01:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
mute so
 
01:44:53.930 --> 01:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
um there are a couple of uh items that
 
01:44:55.790 --> 01:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
we've developed over the last three to
 
01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
four years that are on the state
 
01:44:58.550 --> 01:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
assessment that I would say don't really
 
01:45:00.169 --> 01:45:00.179 align:start position:0%
fall into one of the first three
 
01:45:01.850 --> 01:45:01.860 align:start position:0%
categories there and those are things
 
01:45:04.129 --> 01:45:04.139 align:start position:0%
called item clusters we use them
 
01:45:05.629 --> 01:45:05.639 align:start position:0%
primarily on our state Science
 
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
assessment and it's a way of more
 
01:45:09.770 --> 01:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
authentically assessing students
 
01:45:12.169 --> 01:45:12.179 align:start position:0%
understanding of Science by presenting a
 
01:45:14.090 --> 01:45:14.100 align:start position:0%
scenario to a student where they
 
01:45:15.890 --> 01:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
actually have to interact with the
 
01:45:19.370 --> 01:45:19.380 align:start position:0%
scenario so that could include some type
 
01:45:21.410 --> 01:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
of digital experiment where there are
 
01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
two or three variables and the students
 
01:45:24.109 --> 01:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
can actually look at the different
 
01:45:26.570 --> 01:45:26.580 align:start position:0%
variables and change those and then
 
01:45:29.149 --> 01:45:29.159 align:start position:0%
there's a set of four to sometimes seven
 
01:45:31.370 --> 01:45:31.380 align:start position:0%
questions that all relate to what the
 
01:45:33.410 --> 01:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
student is doing by interacting with
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
that simulation on the test we call
 
01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
those item clusters and we wanted to put
 
01:45:40.129 --> 01:45:40.139 align:start position:0%
in here other item types because that
 
01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't an item type that existed when we
 
01:45:43.609 --> 01:45:43.619 align:start position:0%
first wrote the statute we hadn't really
 
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
developed it and it didn't fit into one
 
01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
of these categories
 
01:45:49.370 --> 01:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
so this fourth category D just kind of
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
gives us the freedom to explore
 
01:45:52.970 --> 01:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
different ways of assessing student
 
01:45:54.890 --> 01:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
understanding on a test that may not fit
 
01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
into one of the three buckets within
 
01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:57.709 align:start position:0%
into one of the three buckets within
statute

01:45:57.709 --> 01:45:57.719 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:45:59.270 --> 01:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on that change I
 
01:46:04.850 --> 01:46:04.860 align:start position:0%
think uh Dr Green really
 
01:46:06.890 --> 01:46:06.900 align:start position:0%
explained that pretty thoroughly
 
01:46:11.629 --> 01:46:11.639 align:start position:0%
okay let's go on down to lines 26 uh now
 
01:46:13.550 --> 01:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
this is the language we have in law
 
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
where there's an assessment required
 
01:46:19.310 --> 01:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
and as you recall from
 
01:46:22.550 --> 01:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
Federal legislation we we are required
 
01:46:25.729 --> 01:46:25.739 align:start position:0%
to test in grades three through eight
 
01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:29.159 align:start position:0%
and one time in the high school
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh could you please explain what you've
 
01:46:34.010 --> 01:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
done with this part right here on lines
 
01:46:37.010 --> 01:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
26 down through going on to the next
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
page on the line four on the next page
 
01:46:43.669 --> 01:46:43.679 align:start position:0%
sure so the original Statue talked about
 
01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
how the state had to test once in an
 
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
elementary school grade and once in a
 
01:46:49.490 --> 01:46:49.500 align:start position:0%
middle school grade so we had crossed
 
01:46:51.470 --> 01:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
that piece out and added the language in
 
01:46:52.669 --> 01:46:52.679 align:start position:0%
that we're testing in grades three
 
01:46:54.890 --> 01:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
through eight just to make our current
 
01:46:57.410 --> 01:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
statute consistent with our practice and
 
01:46:59.930 --> 01:46:59.940 align:start position:0%
with Federal requirements right now I
 
01:47:01.609 --> 01:47:01.619 align:start position:0%
think that language was just a holdover
 
01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
from older statute that was prior to
 
01:47:08.229 --> 01:47:08.239 align:start position:0%
Essa I guess is probably
 
01:47:11.149 --> 01:47:11.159 align:start position:0%
pre-2015 or so and it just doesn't match
 
01:47:13.250 --> 01:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
what we've been doing over the last uh
 
01:47:17.209 --> 01:47:17.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:20.530 --> 01:47:20.540 align:start position:0%
if we flip to the second page
 
01:47:22.729 --> 01:47:22.739 align:start position:0%
it does note that in science
 
01:47:25.609 --> 01:47:25.619 align:start position:0%
specifically science is only tested in
 
01:47:28.609 --> 01:47:28.619 align:start position:0%
grades 5 8 and 11. so math and Ela are
 
01:47:30.169 --> 01:47:30.179 align:start position:0%
the two subjects that are in each of the
 
01:47:31.490 --> 01:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
grades three through eight and eleven
 
01:47:35.090 --> 01:47:35.100 align:start position:0%
science is just three grades Statewide
 
01:47:38.209 --> 01:47:38.219 align:start position:0%
thank you I I noticed that there's
 
01:47:40.310 --> 01:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
one component within there which is
 
01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
changed that the Local District had the
 
01:47:47.209 --> 01:47:47.219 align:start position:0%
ability to do an assessment
 
01:47:51.410 --> 01:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
in consultation with the Department
 
01:47:55.129 --> 01:47:55.139 align:start position:0%
not having to gain their approval
 
01:47:55.139 --> 01:47:56.149 align:start position:0%
not having to gain their approval
um

01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:59.770 --> 01:47:59.780 align:start position:0%
how many districts were doing that
 
01:48:02.030 --> 01:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
other than pace
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh and I would say so Pace was uh under
 
01:48:07.070 --> 01:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
the approval of the Department of
 
01:48:08.689 --> 01:48:08.699 align:start position:0%
Education it was authorized by the U.S
 
01:48:10.250 --> 01:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
Department of Education we had to get a
 
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh what's called a 1241 waiver to allow
 
01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
schools to do the PACE program
 
01:48:17.689 --> 01:48:17.699 align:start position:0%
um and what we did on the second page in
 
01:48:20.330 --> 01:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
lines five six and seven we've added
 
01:48:22.430 --> 01:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
some language in there that still gives
 
01:48:24.169 --> 01:48:24.179 align:start position:0%
the Authority for local districts to
 
01:48:26.590 --> 01:48:26.600 align:start position:0%
pursue alternative means of assessment
 
01:48:29.390 --> 01:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
by going through the department and the
 
01:48:31.310 --> 01:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
U.S Department of Education the reason
 
01:48:34.370 --> 01:48:34.380 align:start position:0%
we've added that in there is by by going
 
01:48:36.830 --> 01:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
that process schools are still able to
 
01:48:38.810 --> 01:48:38.820 align:start position:0%
access all of their Federal title funds
 
01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
if a school were to choose an entirely
 
01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
separate assessment without going
 
01:48:45.649 --> 01:48:45.659 align:start position:0%
through either the New Hampshire
 
01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Education or the U.S
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
Department of Education they would not
 
01:48:50.030 --> 01:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
be able to continue to receive their
 
01:48:52.129 --> 01:48:52.139 align:start position:0%
Federal title funds so they could do it
 
01:48:53.810 --> 01:48:53.820 align:start position:0%
they could you know I think you and I
 
01:48:56.030 --> 01:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
have talked about the Iowa Test of Basic
 
01:48:58.310 --> 01:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
Skills as a possible assessment a school
 
01:49:01.250 --> 01:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
could adopt that but if they don't do it
 
01:49:03.770 --> 01:49:03.780 align:start position:0%
through the the steps authorized by the
 
01:49:05.450 --> 01:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
US Department of Education they wouldn't
 
01:49:06.830 --> 01:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
be able to continue to receive their
 
01:49:09.229 --> 01:49:09.239 align:start position:0%
title funding so it's just a trade-off
 
01:49:11.629 --> 01:49:11.639 align:start position:0%
there and we tried to specify that
 
01:49:13.729 --> 01:49:13.739 align:start position:0%
within the statute so we still have a
 
01:49:15.770 --> 01:49:15.780 align:start position:0%
means for providing schools to go
 
01:49:18.169 --> 01:49:18.179 align:start position:0%
through that approval process and be
 
01:49:19.609 --> 01:49:19.619 align:start position:0%
able to use an alternative assessment
 
01:49:21.590 --> 01:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
and also still keep all their Federal
 
01:49:23.330 --> 01:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
title funds
 
01:49:25.669 --> 01:49:25.679 align:start position:0%
you'll see for for the committee the way
 
01:49:30.290 --> 01:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
we had it before they could use the Iowa
 
01:49:33.070 --> 01:49:33.080 align:start position:0%
or California achievement test another
 
01:49:35.629 --> 01:49:35.639 align:start position:0%
norm-referenced achievement test
 
01:49:38.990 --> 01:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
and consider that part of the Statewide
 
01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
Assessment program but it conflicted
 
01:49:44.149 --> 01:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
with their receiving federal dollars if
 
01:49:47.450 --> 01:49:47.460 align:start position:0%
it was contrary to what the state is
 
01:49:50.390 --> 01:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
using for all they can still do the Iowa
 
01:49:52.370 --> 01:49:52.380 align:start position:0%
test or against Community test or
 
01:49:55.430 --> 01:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
something else on top of what they do on
 
01:49:57.649 --> 01:49:57.659 align:start position:0%
the Statewide assessment they want
 
01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
correct oh absolutely yes yeah
 
01:50:04.370 --> 01:50:04.380 align:start position:0%
sure yes
 
01:50:06.169 --> 01:50:06.179 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here could you
 
01:50:08.870 --> 01:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
define for us how many public academies
 
01:50:10.910 --> 01:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
do we currently have in this week sure
 
01:50:12.290 --> 01:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
yeah so there's only two public
 
01:50:14.930 --> 01:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
academies one is Pinkerton Academy uh
 
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
which is actually where my kids go so
 
01:50:17.689 --> 01:50:17.699 align:start position:0%
I'm very familiar with that particular
 
01:50:20.270 --> 01:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
school and the other one is Cole Brown
 
01:50:24.050 --> 01:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:26.209 --> 01:50:26.219 align:start position:0%
and we also tuitioned to St Johnsbury
 
01:50:26.219 --> 01:50:27.109 align:start position:0%
and we also tuitioned to St Johnsbury
Academy

01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
Academy
 
01:50:29.530 --> 01:50:29.540 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
01:50:33.770 --> 01:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
thank you so on the online 22 on page
 
01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
one no on line 27 on page one you
 
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
expressly said Charter Public Schools
 
01:50:42.530 --> 01:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
public schools and public Academy and
 
01:50:44.870 --> 01:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
yet in this one you're talking just a
 
01:50:47.570 --> 01:50:47.580 align:start position:0%
school district
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:54.050 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:50:54.050 --> 01:50:54.060 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:50:57.169 --> 01:50:57.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:59.450 --> 01:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
okay so we just put in the language that
 
01:51:01.790 --> 01:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
Charter School
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
um Academy public school right there
 
01:51:07.850 --> 01:51:07.860 align:start position:0%
versus District yeah so I believe you're
 
01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
talking about line five on page two
 
01:51:12.890 --> 01:51:12.900 align:start position:0%
yes yeah I would I would say that should
 
01:51:14.570 --> 01:51:14.580 align:start position:0%
mirror the language from the first page
 
01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:16.790 align:start position:0%
mirror the language from the first page
yes

01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:51:21.410 --> 01:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
and again the reason for that is all
 
01:51:24.590 --> 01:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
three of those categories of schools
 
01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
receive title funds so they're required
 
01:51:28.430 --> 01:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
federally to participate in the
 
01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:34.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:51:36.770 --> 01:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
there's no other changes on that page
 
01:51:38.990 --> 01:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
two other than changing some of the
 
01:51:41.689 --> 01:51:41.699 align:start position:0%
Roman numerals
 
01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
now I guess there's no changes there and
 
01:51:48.649 --> 01:51:48.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:48.659 --> 01:51:52.010 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:51:52.010 --> 01:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:54.530 --> 01:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
let me make sure we get that on page
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
three we're talking it once again we're
 
01:51:59.570 --> 01:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
now 193 C 11.
 
01:52:02.270 --> 01:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
uh where it says for the purposes of
 
01:52:04.250 --> 01:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
public reporting the state shall use a
 
01:52:07.850 --> 01:52:07.860 align:start position:0%
minimum in size of 11 to maintain
 
01:52:11.570 --> 01:52:11.580 align:start position:0%
student data privacy was that 10 before
 
01:52:14.510 --> 01:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
no so it's been 11 since the uh
 
01:52:17.629 --> 01:52:17.639 align:start position:0%
authorization of Essa it may have even
 
01:52:19.669 --> 01:52:19.679 align:start position:0%
been 11 during No Child Left Behind I'm
 
01:52:21.470 --> 01:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
not sure but I do know since we first
 
01:52:24.530 --> 01:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
adopted our state plan in 2016-17 it's
 
01:52:26.350 --> 01:52:26.360 align:start position:0%
been 11.
 
01:52:28.490 --> 01:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
a little more information on that we
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
have historically used 11 throughout
 
01:52:32.990 --> 01:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
reporting but we had to Define it in our
 
01:52:34.850 --> 01:52:34.860 align:start position:0%
Essa plan and that's why in essence it
 
01:52:36.350 --> 01:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
kind of became the official policy of
 
01:52:38.270 --> 01:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education and we
 
01:52:39.709 --> 01:52:39.719 align:start position:0%
believe it should be reflected in state
 
01:52:41.629 --> 01:52:41.639 align:start position:0%
law represent Damon you have your hand
 
01:52:43.850 --> 01:52:43.860 align:start position:0%
up yes thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
01:52:48.290 --> 01:52:48.300 align:start position:0%
so I'm fully respectful of the need for
 
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
student privacy I'm just looking for
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
some comment on how our small mostly
 
01:52:56.570 --> 01:52:56.580 align:start position:0%
rural districts that never meet that n
 
01:52:58.550 --> 01:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
of 11
 
01:53:01.490 --> 01:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
how do we learn about test results and
 
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:08.209 --> 01:53:08.219 align:start position:0%
that's a really good question that I
 
01:53:09.649 --> 01:53:09.659 align:start position:0%
think we struggle with from a public
 
01:53:12.169 --> 01:53:12.179 align:start position:0%
transparency perspective because if you
 
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
have a grade of students that only has
 
01:53:16.189 --> 01:53:16.199 align:start position:0%
three students or four students in it in
 
01:53:17.330 --> 01:53:17.340 align:start position:0%
a very small you know if we're talking
 
01:53:19.129 --> 01:53:19.139 align:start position:0%
about you know a K-8 one-room
 
01:53:20.930 --> 01:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
schoolhouse that has 30 students total
 
01:53:23.090 --> 01:53:23.100 align:start position:0%
across those grades it's very difficult
 
01:53:24.910 --> 01:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
to publicly report any kind of results
 
01:53:27.050 --> 01:53:27.060 align:start position:0%
all of that assessment data is made
 
01:53:29.090 --> 01:53:29.100 align:start position:0%
available to the school staff to the
 
01:53:31.010 --> 01:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
school leaders so they have the raw data
 
01:53:32.209 --> 01:53:32.219 align:start position:0%
they use it in their planning purposes
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
they use it to make changes to their
 
01:53:36.770 --> 01:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
curriculum to training that they provide
 
01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
teachers it's just where we publish
 
01:53:40.910 --> 01:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
things publicly on the department
 
01:53:43.810 --> 01:53:43.820 align:start position:0%
website that that data would
 
01:53:46.910 --> 01:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
be either blurred or suppressed because
 
01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
the in size is just too small
 
01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:52.189 align:start position:0%
the in size is just too small
yes

01:53:52.189 --> 01:53:52.199 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:53:54.609 --> 01:53:54.619 align:start position:0%
so is it ever
 
01:53:57.530 --> 01:53:57.540 align:start position:0%
aggregated across the grades and I
 
01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
realize that's
 
01:54:01.850 --> 01:54:01.860 align:start position:0%
murky but
 
01:54:04.010 --> 01:54:04.020 align:start position:0%
like you might have more than 11
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
students in a cater for school but not
 
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
more than 11 per grade yes so we
 
01:54:11.629 --> 01:54:11.639 align:start position:0%
aggregate it both at a school and a
 
01:54:14.930 --> 01:54:14.940 align:start position:0%
district level so if you had
 
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
um you know 15 students even in a school
 
01:54:17.810 --> 01:54:17.820 align:start position:0%
I mean this would be a very tiny school
 
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
but even if you had 15 students in the
 
01:54:21.050 --> 01:54:21.060 align:start position:0%
entire School you could see the school's
 
01:54:22.850 --> 01:54:22.860 align:start position:0%
performance publicly because that's more
 
01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
than 11 and then in the district that
 
01:54:26.629 --> 01:54:26.639 align:start position:0%
might include multiple schools and you
 
01:54:27.890 --> 01:54:27.900 align:start position:0%
would see the district performance as
 
01:54:29.629 --> 01:54:29.639 align:start position:0%
well and that small school would be
 
01:54:33.169 --> 01:54:33.179 align:start position:0%
within that performance
 
01:54:35.810 --> 01:54:35.820 align:start position:0%
further questions represent miler hi
 
01:54:37.970 --> 01:54:37.980 align:start position:0%
thank you I should I I should note the
 
01:54:40.729 --> 01:54:40.739 align:start position:0%
answer to my question but Define end
 
01:54:42.350 --> 01:54:42.360 align:start position:0%
size for me please
 
01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
sure so n size n refers to the total
 
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
number of students in a particular group
 
01:54:50.330 --> 01:54:50.340 align:start position:0%
um and the group really depends on what
 
01:54:51.890 --> 01:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
it is that you're looking at from a data
 
01:54:54.109 --> 01:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
perspective so an end size could be the
 
01:54:56.209 --> 01:54:56.219 align:start position:0%
number of students in third grade it
 
01:54:57.470 --> 01:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
could be the number of students in the
 
01:54:57.480 --> 01:54:58.850 align:start position:0%
could be the number of students in the
school

01:54:58.850 --> 01:54:58.860 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
um I think you know when we talk about
 
01:55:03.290 --> 01:55:03.300 align:start position:0%
public reporting sometimes where it gets
 
01:55:05.149 --> 01:55:05.159 align:start position:0%
tricky to report that out is student
 
01:55:07.490 --> 01:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
subgroups so n size could refer to the
 
01:55:08.629 --> 01:55:08.639 align:start position:0%
total number of English language
 
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
Learners in a school or the total number
 
01:55:12.290 --> 01:55:12.300 align:start position:0%
of English language Learners in a Grade
 
01:55:14.149 --> 01:55:14.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes the school might only have
 
01:55:15.770 --> 01:55:15.780 align:start position:0%
three or four students that are English
 
01:55:17.330 --> 01:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
language Learners and it becomes
 
01:55:18.709 --> 01:55:18.719 align:start position:0%
difficult to report out on performance
 
01:55:20.750 --> 01:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
when the N size for subgroups of
 
01:55:22.850 --> 01:55:22.860 align:start position:0%
students are so small we see that
 
01:55:23.930 --> 01:55:23.940 align:start position:0%
occasionally as well with special
 
01:55:26.330 --> 01:55:26.340 align:start position:0%
education for grades where a small
 
01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
school might only have a very small
 
01:55:29.930 --> 01:55:29.940 align:start position:0%
handful of special education students
 
01:55:32.689 --> 01:55:32.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
further questions on this point good
 
01:55:38.510 --> 01:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
we'll move on down the page then uh to
 
01:55:41.209 --> 01:55:41.219 align:start position:0%
lines six and seven where there's a
 
01:55:42.590 --> 01:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
change here the department Shopify
 
01:55:45.050 --> 01:55:45.060 align:start position:0%
testing entity as defined in the RSA
 
01:55:47.570 --> 01:55:47.580 align:start position:0%
with individual pupil names and unique
 
01:55:49.609 --> 01:55:49.619 align:start position:0%
people identifiers and other
 
01:55:51.590 --> 01:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
demographics and statistical information
 
01:55:53.390 --> 01:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
necessary to comply with state and
 
01:55:56.090 --> 01:55:56.100 align:start position:0%
federal reporting
 
01:55:59.870 --> 01:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
so we ran into I'd say two issues on one
 
01:56:02.810 --> 01:56:02.820 align:start position:0%
particular piece here there's another uh
 
01:56:04.850 --> 01:56:04.860 align:start position:0%
statute and I don't know it off the top
 
01:56:07.729 --> 01:56:07.739 align:start position:0%
of my head but it's in the 180s that
 
01:56:09.950 --> 01:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
allows the uh testing entities to
 
01:56:12.350 --> 01:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
collect specifically student uh name and
 
01:56:14.510 --> 01:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
date of birth we needed a couple more
 
01:56:17.209 --> 01:56:17.219 align:start position:0%
demographic variables when we look at
 
01:56:19.129 --> 01:56:19.139 align:start position:0%
some of our larger testing vendors to be
 
01:56:20.930 --> 01:56:20.940 align:start position:0%
able to identify the correct students
 
01:56:22.790 --> 01:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
and make sure that we're sending the
 
01:56:24.850 --> 01:56:24.860 align:start position:0%
correct score reports to those students
 
01:56:26.990 --> 01:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
and specifically I can talk about the
 
01:56:29.930 --> 01:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
SAT so the SAT is administered in every
 
01:56:32.209 --> 01:56:32.219 align:start position:0%
single state within the country so when
 
01:56:34.189 --> 01:56:34.199 align:start position:0%
they're receiving test scores and test
 
01:56:36.350 --> 01:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
results normally just within New
 
01:56:38.090 --> 01:56:38.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a first last name and a date
 
01:56:39.649 --> 01:56:39.659 align:start position:0%
of birth might be enough for us to just
 
01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
identify a student but when they're
 
01:56:42.950 --> 01:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
working with large amounts of data
 
01:56:45.530 --> 01:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
across multiple States if they have more
 
01:56:47.629 --> 01:56:47.639 align:start position:0%
demographic information they're able to
 
01:56:49.609 --> 01:56:49.619 align:start position:0%
make sure that each student is matched
 
01:56:51.890 --> 01:56:51.900 align:start position:0%
up with the correct score reports so our
 
01:56:53.570 --> 01:56:53.580 align:start position:0%
intent with this change here is to make
 
01:56:55.250 --> 01:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
sure that we can share
 
01:56:57.530 --> 01:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
information specific to our students to
 
01:56:58.850 --> 01:56:58.860 align:start position:0%
make sure that the school reports we
 
01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
provide go to the correct student and to
 
01:57:05.510 --> 01:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:07.370 --> 01:57:07.380 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair can you just give us
 
01:57:11.870 --> 01:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
an example of what specific demographic
 
01:57:13.729 --> 01:57:13.739 align:start position:0%
data uh that would include so in this
 
01:57:16.070 --> 01:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
case it's really just adding gender and
 
01:57:18.050 --> 01:57:18.060 align:start position:0%
then in some cases for some of the data
 
01:57:20.149 --> 01:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
analysis we do it would be looking at
 
01:57:24.589 --> 01:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:26.810 --> 01:57:26.820 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:57:30.669 --> 01:57:30.679 align:start position:0%
okay let's move on down to the line 17
 
01:57:33.410 --> 01:57:33.420 align:start position:0%
the testing entity shall destroy all
 
01:57:36.109 --> 01:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
data on a schedule determined by the
 
01:57:39.410 --> 01:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
state contract with the testing entity
 
01:57:41.270 --> 01:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
so initially the state statute said
 
01:57:42.830 --> 01:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
eight years and we were running into
 
01:57:44.209 --> 01:57:44.219 align:start position:0%
some problems there because we're having
 
01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
a difficult time identifying when the
 
01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
eight years started and when it ended
 
01:57:50.149 --> 01:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
and different students have different
 
01:57:52.490 --> 01:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
circumstances so there are some students
 
01:57:54.530 --> 01:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
that get to 18 they graduate high school
 
01:57:56.689 --> 01:57:56.699 align:start position:0%
normally they move on there are some
 
01:57:58.430 --> 01:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
students that may stay in school until
 
01:58:01.490 --> 01:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
they're 20 or 21. in some cases students
 
01:58:02.930 --> 01:58:02.940 align:start position:0%
that are special education students
 
01:58:04.850 --> 01:58:04.860 align:start position:0%
continue to receive Services far beyond
 
01:58:07.070 --> 01:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
that and so if you're destroying student
 
01:58:10.010 --> 01:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
data at eight years that can result in
 
01:58:11.450 --> 01:58:11.460 align:start position:0%
situations where a student came in in
 
01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:13.679 align:start position:0%
third grade and now we're destroying
 
01:58:15.109 --> 01:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
Student Records for students that are
 
01:58:17.810 --> 01:58:17.820 align:start position:0%
still within that school so we want the
 
01:58:19.490 --> 01:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
ability and I think we would welcome
 
01:58:21.470 --> 01:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
input from this committee to develop a
 
01:58:24.709 --> 01:58:24.719 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive schedule for how and
 
01:58:27.169 --> 01:58:27.179 align:start position:0%
when student records and student data is
 
01:58:30.649 --> 01:58:30.659 align:start position:0%
destroyed that allows us to keep records
 
01:58:32.689 --> 01:58:32.699 align:start position:0%
in some cases but ensure that our
 
01:58:34.490 --> 01:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
testing vendors are destroying records
 
01:58:37.250 --> 01:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
according to that schedule
 
01:58:39.950 --> 01:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
yes represent Tanner um I'm sorry to go
 
01:58:42.709 --> 01:58:42.719 align:start position:0%
back to to the line six and seven the
 
01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
demographic uh and statistical
 
01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:46.550 align:start position:0%
demographic uh and statistical
information

01:58:46.550 --> 01:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:58:50.089 --> 01:58:50.099 align:start position:0%
um and you said gender and ethnicity yes
 
01:58:52.310 --> 01:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
are the two and
 
01:58:56.149 --> 01:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
um why those two unless the testing
 
01:59:00.649 --> 01:59:00.659 align:start position:0%
agent see is using that as as uh uh
 
01:59:04.129 --> 01:59:04.139 align:start position:0%
uh kind of a not not necessarily as a
 
01:59:05.810 --> 01:59:05.820 align:start position:0%
pupil identifier but as an
 
01:59:07.850 --> 01:59:07.860 align:start position:0%
identification of
 
01:59:11.390 --> 01:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
um you know scores that that are within
 
01:59:13.910 --> 01:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
certain ethnic groups maybe not doing as
 
01:59:15.950 --> 01:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
well as other ethnic groups just seems
 
01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
like uh if you wanted other people
 
01:59:20.930 --> 01:59:20.940 align:start position:0%
identifiers it would be that they live
 
01:59:23.089 --> 01:59:23.099 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that you'd have your
 
01:59:24.830 --> 01:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
unique pupil identifier and then you'd
 
01:59:29.209 --> 01:59:29.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:31.550 --> 01:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:59:34.850 --> 01:59:34.860 align:start position:0%
is can you can you explain why that
 
01:59:37.070 --> 01:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
can't be as simple as that
 
01:59:40.010 --> 01:59:40.020 align:start position:0%
so for our New Hampshire specific tests
 
01:59:42.109 --> 01:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
it is and that's that's what we use we
 
01:59:44.149 --> 01:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
don't really look Beyond just first and
 
01:59:45.530 --> 01:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
last name and date of birth and we have
 
01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire identifier and that's
 
01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
what we use there we do internally use
 
01:59:52.370 --> 01:59:52.380 align:start position:0%
some of the uh ethnic and racial groups
 
01:59:54.709 --> 01:59:54.719 align:start position:0%
to look at the test performance so that
 
01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
as we see the test performing for
 
01:59:57.890 --> 01:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
different groups of students internally
 
01:59:59.450 --> 01:59:59.460 align:start position:0%
we may change different questions
 
02:00:01.129 --> 02:00:01.139 align:start position:0%
depending on how students are performing
 
02:00:03.770 --> 02:00:03.780 align:start position:0%
on it and so that's all internal data
 
02:00:05.390 --> 02:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
that we use none of that is published
 
02:00:07.129 --> 02:00:07.139 align:start position:0%
and none of that is used beyond the
 
02:00:08.750 --> 02:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
testing vendor it's just for the
 
02:00:11.149 --> 02:00:11.159 align:start position:0%
creation of the test
 
02:00:14.990 --> 02:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
is that data sort of like the for ell in
 
02:00:16.970 --> 02:00:16.980 align:start position:0%
like a city like a Manchester where you
 
02:00:20.149 --> 02:00:20.159 align:start position:0%
have a huge population which is speaking
 
02:00:22.010 --> 02:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
a different language or from a different
 
02:00:24.770 --> 02:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
culture we get breakdowns on that
 
02:00:26.930 --> 02:00:26.940 align:start position:0%
information yes
 
02:00:28.430 --> 02:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
and our assessment vendor is the one
 
02:00:30.229 --> 02:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
that provides us with those breakdowns
 
02:00:31.669 --> 02:00:31.679 align:start position:0%
they have the statistical information
 
02:00:34.310 --> 02:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
for the performance on each item so they
 
02:00:36.470 --> 02:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
they don't provide it for specific
 
02:00:37.669 --> 02:00:37.679 align:start position:0%
students we're not receiving that
 
02:00:39.649 --> 02:00:39.659 align:start position:0%
student level data but we get on average
 
02:00:41.149 --> 02:00:41.159 align:start position:0%
on the state how did each different
 
02:00:43.729 --> 02:00:43.739 align:start position:0%
group perform on specific questions so
 
02:00:45.169 --> 02:00:45.179 align:start position:0%
we can determine whether we fill the
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
questions themselves are were written
 
02:00:50.930 --> 02:00:50.940 align:start position:0%
appropriately for New Hampshire students
 
02:00:50.940 --> 02:00:52.430 align:start position:0%
appropriately for New Hampshire students
representative

02:00:52.430 --> 02:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:00:55.189 --> 02:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
and so on that very Point uh so that
 
02:00:57.229 --> 02:00:57.239 align:start position:0%
allows you to be able to disaggregate
 
02:00:59.750 --> 02:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
the data
 
02:01:01.910 --> 02:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
so we do some we can do some of our own
 
02:01:04.250 --> 02:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
disaggregation of data when we look at
 
02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
overall performance what we don't have
 
02:01:07.850 --> 02:01:07.860 align:start position:0%
the ability within the department to do
 
02:01:09.530 --> 02:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
is look at it on a question by question
 
02:01:13.250 --> 02:01:13.260 align:start position:0%
basis so we just disaggregate when we
 
02:01:16.010 --> 02:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
look at overall student performance so I
 
02:01:18.109 --> 02:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
think to representative lad's point you
 
02:01:19.729 --> 02:01:19.739 align:start position:0%
know we can do disaggregations and say
 
02:01:22.070 --> 02:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
how English language Learners performed
 
02:01:24.770 --> 02:01:24.780 align:start position:0%
on the test as a whole but we can't
 
02:01:26.390 --> 02:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily go in and look at how did
 
02:01:27.950 --> 02:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
English language Learners perform on
 
02:01:30.290 --> 02:01:30.300 align:start position:0%
each of the individual questions across
 
02:01:32.149 --> 02:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
the test and that's because we use an
 
02:01:35.330 --> 02:01:35.340 align:start position:0%
Adaptive test and so each student sees a
 
02:01:37.370 --> 02:01:37.380 align:start position:0%
slightly different version of the state
 
02:01:39.530 --> 02:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
assessment and so it isn't as simple as
 
02:01:41.030 --> 02:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
just looking at how did everybody do on
 
02:01:42.830 --> 02:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
this one particular question there are
 
02:01:44.149 --> 02:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
many different variations of each
 
02:01:45.410 --> 02:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
question that are worded in different
 
02:01:47.870 --> 02:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
ways sometimes the way a question might
 
02:01:50.450 --> 02:01:50.460 align:start position:0%
be worded presents challenges to
 
02:01:51.950 --> 02:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
students and we go in and we look at it
 
02:01:54.649 --> 02:01:54.659 align:start position:0%
maybe there it's too wordy versus some
 
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
of the other questions that we use and
 
02:01:57.950 --> 02:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
so that's the type of analysis we do to
 
02:01:59.149 --> 02:01:59.159 align:start position:0%
determine whether we feel the question
 
02:02:01.790 --> 02:02:01.800 align:start position:0%
itself appropriate and each year we
 
02:02:03.770 --> 02:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
throw questions out we add new questions
 
02:02:06.050 --> 02:02:06.060 align:start position:0%
in to make sure that the test continues
 
02:02:07.930 --> 02:02:07.940 align:start position:0%
to assess appropriately
 
02:02:11.930 --> 02:02:11.940 align:start position:0%
what our students know and can do
 
02:02:13.729 --> 02:02:13.739 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
02:02:15.649 --> 02:02:15.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I might have been a
 
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
little bit confused I'm trying I want to
 
02:02:18.109 --> 02:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
dig in a little bit on what you were
 
02:02:20.689 --> 02:02:20.699 align:start position:0%
what you were saying as far as using um
 
02:02:23.510 --> 02:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
ethnic data as far as creating the tests
 
02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
and you're saying that they're adaptive
 
02:02:29.209 --> 02:02:29.219 align:start position:0%
does that mean does that mean somehow
 
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
we're administering possibly different
 
02:02:35.570 --> 02:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
tests to students based on ethnicity
 
02:02:38.149 --> 02:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
no so it's it's entirely based upon
 
02:02:40.970 --> 02:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
student ability so the way the Adaptive
 
02:02:42.890 --> 02:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
engine works is a student will go in and
 
02:02:46.010 --> 02:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
they might answer a set of questions
 
02:02:48.290 --> 02:02:48.300 align:start position:0%
that's common across all students and
 
02:02:49.850 --> 02:02:49.860 align:start position:0%
based off of how the students performed
 
02:02:51.410 --> 02:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
on those particular questions if a
 
02:02:53.209 --> 02:02:53.219 align:start position:0%
student you know aced every question
 
02:02:54.530 --> 02:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
they moved to those questions very
 
02:02:56.570 --> 02:02:56.580 align:start position:0%
quickly the test will provide a slightly
 
02:02:59.629 --> 02:02:59.639 align:start position:0%
harder question to them next and then as
 
02:03:01.609 --> 02:03:01.619 align:start position:0%
if the student continues to perform well
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
on those questions the questions become
 
02:03:05.149 --> 02:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
increasingly harder and you're able to
 
02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
determine the student's performance if a
 
02:03:08.689 --> 02:03:08.699 align:start position:0%
student is answering questions
 
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
incorrectly it'll provide slightly
 
02:03:12.830 --> 02:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
easier questions to that student and so
 
02:03:14.689 --> 02:03:14.699 align:start position:0%
that allows us to dial in exactly where
 
02:03:16.729 --> 02:03:16.739 align:start position:0%
students are at entirely based upon
 
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
ability and we don't look at any student
 
02:03:21.410 --> 02:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
specific information when we look at
 
02:03:23.149 --> 02:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
that it's just how they're answering
 
02:03:25.010 --> 02:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
each question
 
02:03:27.470 --> 02:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
yeah if I may just quick follow-up and
 
02:03:28.490 --> 02:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for the explanation because
 
02:03:30.410 --> 02:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
that helps but where where does the
 
02:03:32.149 --> 02:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
ethnic component then come in because I
 
02:03:34.189 --> 02:03:34.199 align:start position:0%
I thought you had said that somehow the
 
02:03:36.950 --> 02:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
ethnic part is used in the creation of
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
the test is that is that right or no
 
02:03:41.089 --> 02:03:41.099 align:start position:0%
it's usually after the fact so we have a
 
02:03:43.450 --> 02:03:43.460 align:start position:0%
federal requirement where we have to
 
02:03:45.410 --> 02:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
ensure that
 
02:03:47.930 --> 02:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
the the way that students perform on
 
02:03:51.649 --> 02:03:51.659 align:start position:0%
questions is relatively similar so if we
 
02:03:54.169 --> 02:03:54.179 align:start position:0%
gave a test uh and I'll try to simplify
 
02:03:55.430 --> 02:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
it a little bit but let's say there's 10
 
02:03:55.440 --> 02:03:57.050 align:start position:0%
it a little bit but let's say there's 10
questions

02:03:57.050 --> 02:03:57.060 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:03:58.669 --> 02:03:58.679 align:start position:0%
um and we looked at how students
 
02:04:00.470 --> 02:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
performed in different subgroups so how
 
02:04:02.810 --> 02:04:02.820 align:start position:0%
your special ed population did how your
 
02:04:04.990 --> 02:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
English language learner population did
 
02:04:08.330 --> 02:04:08.340 align:start position:0%
how your free reduced lunch uh income
 
02:04:10.370 --> 02:04:10.380 align:start position:0%
students did and we found that
 
02:04:13.189 --> 02:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
specifically the free reduced lunch kids
 
02:04:15.770 --> 02:04:15.780 align:start position:0%
um overwhelmingly got question eight
 
02:04:18.050 --> 02:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
wrong but every other student group got
 
02:04:20.030 --> 02:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
question eight correct we would go in
 
02:04:21.290 --> 02:04:21.300 align:start position:0%
and look at that question and try to
 
02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
determine is there something about that
 
02:04:25.189 --> 02:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
question that's causing one group of
 
02:04:26.990 --> 02:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
students overwhelmingly to get that
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
question wrong and that's the type of
 
02:04:30.410 --> 02:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
analysis so we do that after the fact
 
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
it's once we have all the data in and
 
02:04:34.669 --> 02:04:34.679 align:start position:0%
then if we feel the question is
 
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate and we look at it with
 
02:04:37.970 --> 02:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
groups of teachers then it may stay on
 
02:04:40.370 --> 02:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
the test but if we fail that particular
 
02:04:43.370 --> 02:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
question isn't is unfair in some way to
 
02:04:45.109 --> 02:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
that particular group and maybe the way
 
02:04:46.850 --> 02:04:46.860 align:start position:0%
it's word did then that question would
 
02:04:48.109 --> 02:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
be removed and we'd replace it with
 
02:04:50.750 --> 02:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
another question but that would go on to
 
02:04:53.689 --> 02:04:53.699 align:start position:0%
the next year's test and we have to do
 
02:04:55.729 --> 02:04:55.739 align:start position:0%
that for all the questions for our test
 
02:04:58.310 --> 02:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
as part of receiving federal funds so we
 
02:04:59.870 --> 02:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
don't it's not public information that
 
02:05:01.189 --> 02:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
we put out there it's it's something
 
02:05:03.470 --> 02:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
that we do internally when we look at
 
02:05:05.810 --> 02:05:05.820 align:start position:0%
how the test is performing and then we
 
02:05:07.310 --> 02:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
provide evidence that we've done that
 
02:05:09.770 --> 02:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
analysis to the feds to show that we're
 
02:05:13.510 --> 02:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:16.189 --> 02:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner thank you and thank you
 
02:05:17.870 --> 02:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:05:22.070 --> 02:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
um so over if if it adapts over years
 
02:05:23.750 --> 02:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
um would girls get different questions
 
02:05:25.030 --> 02:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
than boys
 
02:05:28.490 --> 02:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
uh or would the test be leaning more
 
02:05:31.189 --> 02:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
towards a male identified test than a
 
02:05:33.770 --> 02:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
female identify test since gender is one
 
02:05:36.830 --> 02:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
of the things that you're taking into
 
02:05:40.430 --> 02:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
consideration as well as ethnicity no so
 
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
that that is one of the groups that we
 
02:05:44.270 --> 02:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
would look at to see you know if we had
 
02:05:46.490 --> 02:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
a question on there and overwhelmingly
 
02:05:48.470 --> 02:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
let's say all the boys in the state got
 
02:05:49.609 --> 02:05:49.619 align:start position:0%
this question right but all the girls
 
02:05:51.950 --> 02:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
got that question wrong and we don't see
 
02:05:53.990 --> 02:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
that on the test but if there was a
 
02:05:55.490 --> 02:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
situation when that happened we would
 
02:05:56.930 --> 02:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
look at the question and try to decide
 
02:05:59.570 --> 02:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
is this question in some way written
 
02:06:02.089 --> 02:06:02.099 align:start position:0%
that you know it makes sense to boys but
 
02:06:03.589 --> 02:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
it didn't make sense to the girls and
 
02:06:05.390 --> 02:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a simplified way of
 
02:06:08.629 --> 02:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
looking at it but the the adaptivity of
 
02:06:09.890 --> 02:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
the test is really just based off
 
02:06:11.930 --> 02:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
student performance so the test itself
 
02:06:14.209 --> 02:06:14.219 align:start position:0%
doesn't know who the students are so it
 
02:06:16.430 --> 02:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't have anything to do with uh
 
02:06:20.089 --> 02:06:20.099 align:start position:0%
gender or any student groups so I I then
 
02:06:22.070 --> 02:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
I swing back in my mind then why do we
 
02:06:24.530 --> 02:06:24.540 align:start position:0%
need to take those demographics I mean
 
02:06:28.070 --> 02:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
if it just it doesn't make sense to me
 
02:06:31.550 --> 02:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
that I I know why National tests do it
 
02:06:34.010 --> 02:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
so that they can advertise and you know
 
02:06:36.950 --> 02:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
Target their tests more but on a state
 
02:06:38.810 --> 02:06:38.820 align:start position:0%
level I don't understand why we're doing
 
02:06:40.609 --> 02:06:40.619 align:start position:0%
that unless it unless it's a federal
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
mandate which it didn't sound like it
 
02:06:44.629 --> 02:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
was a federal mandate it sounds like
 
02:06:46.550 --> 02:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
we're just putting that in
 
02:06:48.589 --> 02:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
so in this case it's a federal
 
02:06:50.209 --> 02:06:50.219 align:start position:0%
requirement as part of our peer review
 
02:06:53.209 --> 02:06:53.219 align:start position:0%
when we submit our state test to the U.S
 
02:06:54.649 --> 02:06:54.659 align:start position:0%
Department of Education they have to
 
02:06:56.209 --> 02:06:56.219 align:start position:0%
approve what we're doing in our
 
02:06:58.010 --> 02:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment and part of that is
 
02:06:59.450 --> 02:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
we have to provide them evidence that
 
02:07:01.609 --> 02:07:01.619 align:start position:0%
we're doing that level of analysis so
 
02:07:05.450 --> 02:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:07.970 --> 02:07:07.980 align:start position:0%
okay let's move on down to the next
 
02:07:11.629 --> 02:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
areas we're leaving the assessment as
 
02:07:16.129 --> 02:07:16.139 align:start position:0%
identified in 193 C and going in 193 h
 
02:07:19.070 --> 02:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
which is uh a little bit different here
 
02:07:22.310 --> 02:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
it's uh now we're talking about giving
 
02:07:24.890 --> 02:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
support to these schools which may need
 
02:07:28.669 --> 02:07:28.679 align:start position:0%
that support so on lines Nate online
 
02:07:31.010 --> 02:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
um 24 there is a change by Crossing out
 
02:07:34.070 --> 02:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
the date and then I I know why you're
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
doing line 26 but why don't you go ahead
 
02:07:37.850 --> 02:07:37.860 align:start position:0%
and explain it
 
02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
sure so uh our plan occasionally goes
 
02:07:42.109 --> 02:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
through revisions
 
02:07:43.669 --> 02:07:43.679 align:start position:0%
um so we're trying to keep the date out
 
02:07:45.890 --> 02:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
because we have
 
02:07:48.290 --> 02:07:48.300 align:start position:0%
um the plan was updated in 2019 and then
 
02:07:50.990 --> 02:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
it was updated again in 2020 with some
 
02:07:52.669 --> 02:07:52.679 align:start position:0%
small changes we made as a result of the
 
02:07:56.030 --> 02:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic and then we have a new revision
 
02:07:58.310 --> 02:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
that was updated and approved in 2023.
 
02:08:00.950 --> 02:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to keep the date itself
 
02:08:03.169 --> 02:08:03.179 align:start position:0%
out of Statute just because the plan
 
02:08:05.390 --> 02:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
itself every couple of years has minor
 
02:08:08.270 --> 02:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
modifications and changes to it
 
02:08:11.089 --> 02:08:11.099 align:start position:0%
um number 26 regardless of title and
 
02:08:14.089 --> 02:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
status this is just bringing
 
02:08:16.910 --> 02:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
um if you look at line 21 this whole
 
02:08:18.589 --> 02:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
sort of paragraph section here is
 
02:08:20.089 --> 02:08:20.099 align:start position:0%
referring to comprehensive support and
 
02:08:22.189 --> 02:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
Improvement schools later on in this
 
02:08:24.169 --> 02:08:24.179 align:start position:0%
statute it also talks about targeted
 
02:08:26.570 --> 02:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
assistance schools and it uses the same
 
02:08:29.330 --> 02:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
language regardless of Title 1 status we
 
02:08:30.890 --> 02:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
think that that was an oversight of the
 
02:08:32.350 --> 02:08:32.360 align:start position:0%
original statute
 
02:08:35.870 --> 02:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
CSI schools are actually the more
 
02:08:37.550 --> 02:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
serious of schools when we look at
 
02:08:39.470 --> 02:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
schools that need additional assistance
 
02:08:41.689 --> 02:08:41.699 align:start position:0%
so when we talk about targeted assistant
 
02:08:43.490 --> 02:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
schools later on in the statute and we
 
02:08:45.229 --> 02:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
add the piece about regardless of Title
 
02:08:46.189 --> 02:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
One status
 
02:08:48.950 --> 02:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
we do the same thing for CSI schools as
 
02:08:51.589 --> 02:08:51.599 align:start position:0%
well so I again I think you know this is
 
02:08:54.169 --> 02:08:54.179 align:start position:0%
just bringing it into
 
02:08:55.850 --> 02:08:55.860 align:start position:0%
um compliance with what our current
 
02:08:57.229 --> 02:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
practice is
 
02:08:58.669 --> 02:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
um and it matches it with the TSI
 
02:09:00.609 --> 02:09:00.619 align:start position:0%
schools if we don't want to include
 
02:09:03.229 --> 02:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
non-title one schools I would recommend
 
02:09:05.030 --> 02:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know not adding it here but also
 
02:09:06.649 --> 02:09:06.659 align:start position:0%
removing it from the other section in
 
02:09:09.490 --> 02:09:09.500 align:start position:0%
statute where it already belongs
 
02:09:12.649 --> 02:09:12.659 align:start position:0%
statute yeah well we liked it where we
 
02:09:14.209 --> 02:09:14.219 align:start position:0%
have some high schools which don't
 
02:09:17.350 --> 02:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
receive any title Monies but need help
 
02:09:20.270 --> 02:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
or are not you know doing as well as
 
02:09:22.910 --> 02:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
they should as good as they should and
 
02:09:25.010 --> 02:09:25.020 align:start position:0%
so regardless whether the receiving
 
02:09:27.050 --> 02:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
Title One money or not they're not low
 
02:09:29.149 --> 02:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
as five percent it's going to be
 
02:09:32.209 --> 02:09:32.219 align:start position:0%
identified and they're going to get that
 
02:09:32.219 --> 02:09:33.950 align:start position:0%
identified and they're going to get that
support

02:09:33.950 --> 02:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:09:35.689 --> 02:09:35.699 align:start position:0%
exactly yeah I would say this really
 
02:09:37.550 --> 02:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
applies to high schools yeah because
 
02:09:39.229 --> 02:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
they're just such a small number of high
 
02:09:40.669 --> 02:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
schools that identify as Title One in
 
02:09:42.709 --> 02:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
yes representative cascadden uh just a
 
02:09:47.209 --> 02:09:47.219 align:start position:0%
quick question I don't recall what what
 
02:09:49.490 --> 02:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
does the term what does Title One use as
 
02:09:52.310 --> 02:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
a terminology for their rating is it the
 
02:09:55.850 --> 02:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
same CSI and TSI it is yeah all right I
 
02:09:58.010 --> 02:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
couldn't remember thanks
 
02:10:00.649 --> 02:10:00.659 align:start position:0%
going down to the next one now is uh
 
02:10:03.229 --> 02:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
line 27 any high school with a
 
02:10:07.390 --> 02:10:07.400 align:start position:0%
graduation rate less than U.S 69 percent
 
02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
over two consecutive years now it's 67
 
02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:13.790 align:start position:0%
over two consecutive years now it's 67
period

02:10:13.790 --> 02:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
period
 
02:10:16.189 --> 02:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
so this is what's currently in our Essa
 
02:10:17.689 --> 02:10:17.699 align:start position:0%
plan so we had two different lists of
 
02:10:19.729 --> 02:10:19.739 align:start position:0%
schools we had schools that were under
 
02:10:22.430 --> 02:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
67 percent under the federal CSI
 
02:10:24.830 --> 02:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
definition and then our state CSI
 
02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
definition here was 20 69 over two
 
02:10:29.510 --> 02:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
consecutive years one of those lists
 
02:10:31.370 --> 02:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
receives Federal funding and one of
 
02:10:33.290 --> 02:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
those lists does not what we wanted to
 
02:10:35.089 --> 02:10:35.099 align:start position:0%
do was make the list the same so that
 
02:10:37.609 --> 02:10:37.619 align:start position:0%
when we identify schools as CSI all the
 
02:10:39.350 --> 02:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
schools on that list receive federal
 
02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:40.510 align:start position:0%
schools on that list receive federal
funding

02:10:40.510 --> 02:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
funding
 
02:10:43.550 --> 02:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
and then I know that
 
02:10:45.109 --> 02:10:45.119 align:start position:0%
um representative lab you and I had
 
02:10:47.629 --> 02:10:47.639 align:start position:0%
chatted about this a real discussion on
 
02:10:49.129 --> 02:10:49.139 align:start position:0%
this one I think it's it's really
 
02:10:51.290 --> 02:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
important to understand that you know we
 
02:10:53.030 --> 02:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
have a really high graduation rate in
 
02:10:54.709 --> 02:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire our high schools tend to
 
02:10:56.810 --> 02:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
do very well when compared nationally
 
02:10:59.689 --> 02:10:59.699 align:start position:0%
we're in the low to mid 90s when we talk
 
02:11:01.729 --> 02:11:01.739 align:start position:0%
about graduation rates as an average for
 
02:11:02.689 --> 02:11:02.699 align:start position:0%
our state
 
02:11:04.850 --> 02:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
but the way we Define graduation rate
 
02:11:06.770 --> 02:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand is only
 
02:11:09.229 --> 02:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
students receive a four-year high school
 
02:11:12.410 --> 02:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
diploma so this calculation here this
 
02:11:14.209 --> 02:11:14.219 align:start position:0%
percentage does not include students
 
02:11:16.310 --> 02:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
that receive their GED it does not
 
02:11:17.930 --> 02:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
include students that take the high set
 
02:11:20.390 --> 02:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
and move on it does not include students
 
02:11:22.310 --> 02:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
that are attending an adult education
 
02:11:24.589 --> 02:11:24.599 align:start position:0%
program and receive an adult diploma and
 
02:11:26.089 --> 02:11:26.099 align:start position:0%
it does not include completion
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
certificates as part of a special
 
02:11:29.629 --> 02:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
education program so there are a lot of
 
02:11:31.250 --> 02:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
students that are successfully ending
 
02:11:33.890 --> 02:11:33.900 align:start position:0%
their high school program with a GED or
 
02:11:36.410 --> 02:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
a hiset or adult diploma that don't
 
02:11:38.750 --> 02:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
count in this percentage so when we say
 
02:11:40.129 --> 02:11:40.139 align:start position:0%
we might have a high school that has a
 
02:11:43.490 --> 02:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
65 graduation rate that just means 65
 
02:11:44.990 --> 02:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
percent of their students received a
 
02:11:46.910 --> 02:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
four-year high school diploma their
 
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
completion rate may be much much higher
 
02:11:51.109 --> 02:11:51.119 align:start position:0%
when you add in things like hisat and
 
02:11:54.589 --> 02:11:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:56.510 --> 02:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
okay let me give you some figures that I
 
02:11:58.669 --> 02:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
looked up and
 
02:12:01.189 --> 02:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at four
 
02:12:03.709 --> 02:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
high schools here
 
02:12:03.719 --> 02:12:04.370 align:start position:0%
high schools here
um

02:12:04.370 --> 02:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:06.709 --> 02:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
one north of Us Franklin which has a
 
02:12:11.410 --> 02:12:11.420 align:start position:0%
graduation rate of 67.16 percent as of
 
02:12:14.030 --> 02:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
2022 that Court
 
02:12:19.189 --> 02:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
who has one student hiset
 
02:12:24.109 --> 02:12:24.119 align:start position:0%
Manchester Central has 67.97 percent
 
02:12:29.709 --> 02:12:29.719 align:start position:0%
graduation one hiset Manchester West has
 
02:12:32.149 --> 02:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
58.56 percent
 
02:12:35.810 --> 02:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
with five high sets in Pittsfield
 
02:12:39.950 --> 02:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
has 53.85 percent with one high set
 
02:12:42.589 --> 02:12:42.599 align:start position:0%
so we we have some schools that are are
 
02:12:44.330 --> 02:12:44.340 align:start position:0%
fairly low here
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
and I know that when we've had this
 
02:12:50.030 --> 02:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
discussion in other groups before we've
 
02:12:51.890 --> 02:12:51.900 align:start position:0%
had Senators really go off the track
 
02:12:54.649 --> 02:12:54.659 align:start position:0%
saying why are we having this this bar
 
02:12:56.870 --> 02:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
so low why aren't we setting the
 
02:12:59.450 --> 02:12:59.460 align:start position:0%
expectation that a level higher wherever
 
02:13:03.050 --> 02:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
that may be whether 75 percent or or we
 
02:13:08.330 --> 02:13:08.340 align:start position:0%
know that our average is over 90 percent
 
02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
so if if we had these schools so low how
 
02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
we can identify them through this
 
02:13:16.370 --> 02:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
process to get that support they need
 
02:13:18.530 --> 02:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
should we be identifying more schools
 
02:13:20.510 --> 02:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
because there's a number of them in the
 
02:13:25.729 --> 02:13:25.739 align:start position:0%
low you know the low 70 percent level
 
02:13:28.129 --> 02:13:28.139 align:start position:0%
I think go ahead yeah we had looked at
 
02:13:29.870 --> 02:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
the numbers for this past year and
 
02:13:31.550 --> 02:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
looking at you know if we increase it to
 
02:13:34.850 --> 02:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
70 or 75 if we increase it to 80 what if
 
02:13:37.669 --> 02:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
you brought it all the way up to 90
 
02:13:39.410 --> 02:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
um and the you know obviously as you
 
02:13:42.229 --> 02:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
bring that graduation Target up higher
 
02:13:43.669 --> 02:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
you end up with more schools on that
 
02:13:43.679 --> 02:13:44.930 align:start position:0%
you end up with more schools on that
list

02:13:44.930 --> 02:13:44.940 align:start position:0%
list
 
02:13:47.330 --> 02:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
um what we want to try to do is find a
 
02:13:49.069 --> 02:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
balance between the amount of funds that
 
02:13:50.930 --> 02:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
we have and the number of schools that
 
02:13:53.149 --> 02:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
are on the list because the funds are
 
02:13:55.129 --> 02:13:55.139 align:start position:0%
split between those schools and so we
 
02:13:56.510 --> 02:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
want to try to identify the schools that
 
02:13:58.250 --> 02:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
need the most support when it comes to
 
02:14:00.709 --> 02:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
graduation so we provide them the
 
02:14:02.450 --> 02:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
targeted funds that they need to put
 
02:14:04.189 --> 02:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
programs in place to try to raise those
 
02:14:06.470 --> 02:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
graduation rates and I absolutely agree
 
02:14:07.790 --> 02:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
we should have we should set High
 
02:14:11.629 --> 02:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
targets I believe our state Target might
 
02:14:14.930 --> 02:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
be like 91 or 92 percent that we've set
 
02:14:16.550 --> 02:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
as our expectation is you should be
 
02:14:20.450 --> 02:14:20.460 align:start position:0%
hitting this or higher the 67 of the 69
 
02:14:22.370 --> 02:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
is the threshold for us to give you
 
02:14:24.109 --> 02:14:24.119 align:start position:0%
money specific to you trying to raise
 
02:14:27.589 --> 02:14:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:29.270 --> 02:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
02:14:32.750 --> 02:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um so I'm wondering how
 
02:14:35.089 --> 02:14:35.099 align:start position:0%
how you determine graduation rate is it
 
02:14:37.609 --> 02:14:37.619 align:start position:0%
the number of students that enter High
 
02:14:37.619 --> 02:14:38.510 align:start position:0%
the number of students that enter High
School

02:14:38.510 --> 02:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
School
 
02:14:41.270 --> 02:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh that then complete
 
02:14:43.910 --> 02:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
um their four years or is it just the
 
02:14:45.770 --> 02:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
senior class how many people out of that
 
02:14:49.850 --> 02:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
senior class do um and also
 
02:14:52.910 --> 02:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm concerned that we've the
 
02:14:57.050 --> 02:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
definition of high school so is that a
 
02:15:00.169 --> 02:15:00.179 align:start position:0%
um charter school that offers uh grades
 
02:15:03.050 --> 02:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
9 through 12 is public Academy again are
 
02:15:06.169 --> 02:15:06.179 align:start position:0%
we uh putting all those groups in
 
02:15:08.030 --> 02:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
together and
 
02:15:09.350 --> 02:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
um I guess
 
02:15:11.209 --> 02:15:11.219 align:start position:0%
those are my two main questions with
 
02:15:13.970 --> 02:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
that how's that percentage you know does
 
02:15:15.589 --> 02:15:15.599 align:start position:0%
it take into account that
 
02:15:18.649 --> 02:15:18.659 align:start position:0%
you know 200 kids are in ninth grade and
 
02:15:21.050 --> 02:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
only 67 percent of them graduate out of
 
02:15:22.910 --> 02:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
that high school does it take into
 
02:15:24.830 --> 02:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
account the kids that move out or that
 
02:15:27.830 --> 02:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
go to another school district or you
 
02:15:30.290 --> 02:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
know whatever they for one reason or
 
02:15:31.310 --> 02:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
another don't
 
02:15:33.950 --> 02:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
reach that 12th grade level
 
02:15:35.569 --> 02:15:35.579 align:start position:0%
so in terms of high schools it does
 
02:15:37.129 --> 02:15:37.139 align:start position:0%
include charter schools and public
 
02:15:39.770 --> 02:15:39.780 align:start position:0%
academies as well okay um so across the
 
02:15:41.450 --> 02:15:41.460 align:start position:0%
board If you're receiving any federal
 
02:15:43.250 --> 02:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
monies through the title program you're
 
02:15:44.870 --> 02:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
on that list we can certainly clarify
 
02:15:46.129 --> 02:15:46.139 align:start position:0%
that here in this statute I think that
 
02:15:47.689 --> 02:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
would be good okay
 
02:15:47.699 --> 02:15:48.830 align:start position:0%
would be good okay
um

02:15:48.830 --> 02:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:51.950 --> 02:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
you do Post you do post the academies
 
02:15:55.010 --> 02:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
and the charter schools on the web as
 
02:15:56.750 --> 02:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
well right and just as a point of
 
02:15:59.510 --> 02:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
clarification so high high school
 
02:16:00.950 --> 02:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
elementary school middle school those
 
02:16:03.530 --> 02:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
are great great groupings types of
 
02:16:05.209 --> 02:16:05.219 align:start position:0%
schools would be a district Public
 
02:16:06.950 --> 02:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
School a charter school a non-public
 
02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
school whatever those are so there's
 
02:16:09.950 --> 02:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
types of schools and schools great
 
02:16:12.770 --> 02:16:12.780 align:start position:0%
school groupings so a high school no
 
02:16:14.089 --> 02:16:14.099 align:start position:0%
matter if it's a non-public school or
 
02:16:15.530 --> 02:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
Charter School whatever means a school
 
02:16:17.870 --> 02:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
that has 9 through 12 in it kind of per
 
02:16:20.030 --> 02:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
our definition so those are kind of a
 
02:16:21.410 --> 02:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
type and a grouping are different okay
 
02:16:23.569 --> 02:16:23.579 align:start position:0%
so thank you and then in terms of the
 
02:16:25.910 --> 02:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
way it's calculated it's a cohort based
 
02:16:28.310 --> 02:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
calculation so as soon as a student
 
02:16:30.950 --> 02:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
enters ninth grade they're assigned a
 
02:16:33.830 --> 02:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
year of graduation regardless of what
 
02:16:36.770 --> 02:16:36.780 align:start position:0%
school they ultimately graduate from and
 
02:16:39.709 --> 02:16:39.719 align:start position:0%
the can I not to make it sound high
 
02:16:41.089 --> 02:16:41.099 align:start position:0%
stakes but the clock starts ticking
 
02:16:42.950 --> 02:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
essentially once you're enrolled in
 
02:16:44.570 --> 02:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
ninth grade you have four years to
 
02:16:45.650 --> 02:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
graduate with a regular high school
 
02:16:48.410 --> 02:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
diploma and so when we're looking at the
 
02:16:50.750 --> 02:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
graduating class we're looking at every
 
02:16:52.790 --> 02:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
student that entered ninth grade four
 
02:16:54.530 --> 02:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
years ago and that's what we're using
 
02:16:56.870 --> 02:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
for our calculation to determine whether
 
02:16:59.450 --> 02:16:59.460 align:start position:0%
they're graduate or not so a student who
 
02:17:00.770 --> 02:17:00.780 align:start position:0%
graduates with a regular high school
 
02:17:03.349 --> 02:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
diploma but they do it five years from
 
02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
when they entered High School does not
 
02:17:06.469 --> 02:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
count in this percentage it actually
 
02:17:08.629 --> 02:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
dings a high school and it drops their
 
02:17:10.250 --> 02:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
percentage even though they're still
 
02:17:11.389 --> 02:17:11.399 align:start position:0%
graduating and they're receiving a
 
02:17:13.070 --> 02:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
regular high school diploma it's because
 
02:17:14.450 --> 02:17:14.460 align:start position:0%
they did it in five years instead of
 
02:17:16.790 --> 02:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
four years and that's why for some of
 
02:17:18.049 --> 02:17:18.059 align:start position:0%
our larger high schools you see lower
 
02:17:20.389 --> 02:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
percentages they have students that are
 
02:17:22.669 --> 02:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
graduating but they're graduating in
 
02:17:23.750 --> 02:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
their fifth year or they might be
 
02:17:25.429 --> 02:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
graduating in their sixth year
 
02:17:28.129 --> 02:17:28.139 align:start position:0%
wouldn't a school that had a high
 
02:17:31.370 --> 02:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
transient population then be also skew
 
02:17:33.530 --> 02:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
you know suffer from that as far as the
 
02:17:35.389 --> 02:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
graduation percentage
 
02:17:37.849 --> 02:17:37.859 align:start position:0%
it can I think the the schools that we
 
02:17:39.770 --> 02:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
see that suffer the most from the way
 
02:17:41.389 --> 02:17:41.399 align:start position:0%
it's defined tend to be the charter
 
02:17:43.549 --> 02:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
schools that are serving
 
02:17:45.349 --> 02:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
um student populations that are most at
 
02:17:47.150 --> 02:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
risk for dropping out we have a couple
 
02:17:49.610 --> 02:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
of charter schools that they are
 
02:17:50.810 --> 02:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
receiving students who are already
 
02:17:52.549 --> 02:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
entering their fifth year of high school
 
02:17:55.669 --> 02:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
and so their graduation percentage will
 
02:17:58.009 --> 02:17:58.019 align:start position:0%
always be incredibly low because by the
 
02:18:00.349 --> 02:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
time they receive that student
 
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
that student will never count for them
 
02:18:04.969 --> 02:18:04.979 align:start position:0%
they they can't count as a four-year
 
02:18:06.469 --> 02:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
graduate because they're entering the
 
02:18:09.169 --> 02:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
charter school in their fifth year and
 
02:18:11.030 --> 02:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
then also we tend to see it skewing a
 
02:18:12.290 --> 02:18:12.300 align:start position:0%
little bit towards smaller schools
 
02:18:15.169 --> 02:18:15.179 align:start position:0%
because if you only have five kids in
 
02:18:18.169 --> 02:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
your senior class and two of them don't
 
02:18:20.089 --> 02:18:20.099 align:start position:0%
graduate in their fourth year
 
02:18:21.770 --> 02:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
your percentage is based out of three
 
02:18:23.209 --> 02:18:23.219 align:start position:0%
out of five students and that
 
02:18:25.310 --> 02:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
significantly drops you and those two
 
02:18:26.990 --> 02:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
students may still graduate they may
 
02:18:29.089 --> 02:18:29.099 align:start position:0%
just graduate next year in their fifth
 
02:18:30.709 --> 02:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
year but by then it doesn't count as
 
02:18:32.209 --> 02:18:32.219 align:start position:0%
part of that percentage
 
02:18:35.450 --> 02:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
do you ever ask Asterix those so that
 
02:18:38.030 --> 02:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
they that when it's uh you know
 
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
publicized publicly that that that it it
 
02:18:44.389 --> 02:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
points out those facts yeah so we try to
 
02:18:46.310 --> 02:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
report this out in I would say about
 
02:18:48.349 --> 02:18:48.359 align:start position:0%
four or five different ways and we talk
 
02:18:49.849 --> 02:18:49.859 align:start position:0%
to schools about different ways of
 
02:18:51.969 --> 02:18:51.979 align:start position:0%
messaging it to their Community as well
 
02:18:54.410 --> 02:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
this definition of students graduating
 
02:18:57.410 --> 02:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
in four years is a federal definition we
 
02:18:59.509 --> 02:18:59.519 align:start position:0%
don't have an ability to control or
 
02:19:01.849 --> 02:19:01.859 align:start position:0%
Define it and that's because it's tied
 
02:19:04.250 --> 02:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
to federal funds so the schools that
 
02:19:07.810 --> 02:19:07.820 align:start position:0%
fall below this 67 percent then receive
 
02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
federal funds directly to support their
 
02:19:12.469 --> 02:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
graduation rate
 
02:19:15.049 --> 02:19:15.059 align:start position:0%
um but on the website we publish both a
 
02:19:16.549 --> 02:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
four-year graduation rate and a
 
02:19:18.709 --> 02:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
five-year graduation rate and then we
 
02:19:21.049 --> 02:19:21.059 align:start position:0%
publish an average of a four and five
 
02:19:23.270 --> 02:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
year graduation rate so that you know
 
02:19:24.530 --> 02:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
parents and community members can go on
 
02:19:25.849 --> 02:19:25.859 align:start position:0%
there and see okay these are the kids
 
02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
that graduate in four years but here's a
 
02:19:29.450 --> 02:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
percentage of kids that graduated within
 
02:19:31.129 --> 02:19:31.139 align:start position:0%
five years and that five-year graduation
 
02:19:33.169 --> 02:19:33.179 align:start position:0%
rate is always much higher than the
 
02:19:35.089 --> 02:19:35.099 align:start position:0%
four-year because it captures those
 
02:19:36.770 --> 02:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
students that you know maybe they
 
02:19:38.690 --> 02:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
repeated their freshman year twice or
 
02:19:40.129 --> 02:19:40.139 align:start position:0%
they repeated their junior year twice
 
02:19:42.410 --> 02:19:42.420 align:start position:0%
but they're still on track to graduate
 
02:19:43.730 --> 02:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
they just do it in five years and so
 
02:19:43.740 --> 02:19:46.250 align:start position:0%
they just do it in five years and so
forth

02:19:46.250 --> 02:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:48.589 --> 02:19:48.599 align:start position:0%
represent Myler
 
02:19:52.090 --> 02:19:52.100 align:start position:0%
tell us what the impact is of
 
02:19:56.990 --> 02:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:59.090 --> 02:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
so in this case the two consecutive
 
02:20:00.830 --> 02:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
years is just part of the way it was
 
02:20:03.050 --> 02:20:03.060 align:start position:0%
defined at the state level so that's not
 
02:20:06.050 --> 02:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
used in the federal definition and so
 
02:20:09.830 --> 02:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
right now the schools that have that
 
02:20:11.570 --> 02:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
meet this definition of two consecutive
 
02:20:14.570 --> 02:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
years don't receive any funds the
 
02:20:16.310 --> 02:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
schools that meet the federal definition
 
02:20:18.590 --> 02:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
right now of just a single year do
 
02:20:20.270 --> 02:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
receive federal funds for their program
 
02:20:21.830 --> 02:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
so that's why we talked about
 
02:20:25.250 --> 02:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
eliminating it here because the having
 
02:20:27.110 --> 02:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
the list that includes two consecutive
 
02:20:29.389 --> 02:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
years is a list that gets published but
 
02:20:30.889 --> 02:20:30.899 align:start position:0%
there's no money attached to it because
 
02:20:33.950 --> 02:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
it's just within the state definition
 
02:20:38.510 --> 02:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
so by dropping this from 69 to 67 of
 
02:20:40.570 --> 02:20:40.580 align:start position:0%
those four high schools I talked about
 
02:20:43.610 --> 02:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
you're eliminating two of them
 
02:20:46.490 --> 02:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
from receiving because there's 67 point
 
02:20:46.500 --> 02:20:47.630 align:start position:0%
from receiving because there's 67 point
something

02:20:47.630 --> 02:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
they're over that 67 percent
 
02:20:54.290 --> 02:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
so is this a wise decision should we
 
02:20:57.950 --> 02:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
keep it at 69 where we currently are we
 
02:21:01.309 --> 02:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
made that decision as a state
 
02:21:04.370 --> 02:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
so we would allocate I assume
 
02:21:06.290 --> 02:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
we're not allocating the title one money
 
02:21:09.349 --> 02:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
we can't because the federal law says 67
 
02:21:11.809 --> 02:21:11.819 align:start position:0%
so those those ones right there in that
 
02:21:13.190 --> 02:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
grouping they'd be identified for State
 
02:21:14.929 --> 02:21:14.939 align:start position:0%
purposes but there's no additional
 
02:21:17.090 --> 02:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
assistance that we could provide them
 
02:21:20.030 --> 02:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
so we can't use Title One monies where
 
02:21:22.969 --> 02:21:22.979 align:start position:0%
there got that rate you know we can only
 
02:21:25.429 --> 02:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
use Title front title funding for where
 
02:21:27.349 --> 02:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
it aligns with the federal law and where
 
02:21:28.849 --> 02:21:28.859 align:start position:0%
this would be out of we're currently
 
02:21:30.050 --> 02:21:30.060 align:start position:0%
right now out of line with the federal
 
02:21:31.849 --> 02:21:31.859 align:start position:0%
law I mean there's nothing prevent you
 
02:21:34.130 --> 02:21:34.140 align:start position:0%
from coming up with a state program to
 
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
support these additional schools but
 
02:21:37.730 --> 02:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
right now so all we would do would be
 
02:21:39.469 --> 02:21:39.479 align:start position:0%
identify those schools we'd say well
 
02:21:40.670 --> 02:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
there's two of you you get nothing
 
02:21:42.410 --> 02:21:42.420 align:start position:0%
everybody else you get something because
 
02:21:44.510 --> 02:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
you do meet this Federal criteria so
 
02:21:45.710 --> 02:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
there's just kind of these two that'd be
 
02:21:47.570 --> 02:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
stuck in no man's land we couldn't do
 
02:21:50.630 --> 02:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
anything so we have in Item B here just
 
02:21:52.610 --> 02:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
above this area we're talking about
 
02:21:56.210 --> 02:21:56.220 align:start position:0%
those schools which don't receive Title
 
02:21:59.690 --> 02:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
One support would be receiving they'd be
 
02:22:02.870 --> 02:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
classified as a comprehensive support
 
02:22:05.090 --> 02:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
Improvement School
 
02:22:07.010 --> 02:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
so but we're not going to provide them
 
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
any support
 
02:22:12.530 --> 02:22:12.540 align:start position:0%
so for the ones that are six that do not
 
02:22:14.389 --> 02:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
receive Title One funding right now that
 
02:22:15.950 --> 02:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
it would only be identified for State
 
02:22:17.990 --> 02:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
purposes there's no additional supports
 
02:22:19.730 --> 02:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
that we can provide them
 
02:22:21.469 --> 02:22:21.479 align:start position:0%
so we're just going to identify them
 
02:22:23.650 --> 02:22:23.660 align:start position:0%
that you're
 
02:22:25.969 --> 02:22:25.979 align:start position:0%
we've we agree that that is a challenge
 
02:22:27.530 --> 02:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
that we should work together as a
 
02:22:29.870 --> 02:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
committee to to resolve but yes that's
 
02:22:32.450 --> 02:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
right now there's so there are um and I
 
02:22:34.130 --> 02:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
should say there's technical correction
 
02:22:36.469 --> 02:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
and action plans that are required
 
02:22:39.190 --> 02:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
um later on in RSA I think it's RSA 193
 
02:22:41.809 --> 02:22:41.819 align:start position:0%
E5 or something like that
 
02:22:44.090 --> 02:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
um that it's further down it talks about
 
02:22:45.349 --> 02:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
um there's essentially four years of
 
02:22:46.969 --> 02:22:46.979 align:start position:0%
potential corrective action plans that a
 
02:22:48.710 --> 02:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
school must implement but there's no
 
02:22:49.849 --> 02:22:49.859 align:start position:0%
additional supports that the Department
 
02:22:51.469 --> 02:22:51.479 align:start position:0%
of Education is able to provide in the
 
02:22:53.510 --> 02:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
form of funding and or contracted
 
02:22:55.910 --> 02:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
assistance so for the title one schools
 
02:22:57.410 --> 02:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
that are in the bottom five percent
 
02:22:59.570 --> 02:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
schools that are CSI schools we have
 
02:23:01.190 --> 02:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
contractors that we pay for our federal
 
02:23:03.830 --> 02:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
funds that help schools go out and they
 
02:23:05.750 --> 02:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
do a review they needs assessments for
 
02:23:07.010 --> 02:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
the schools and they help the schools
 
02:23:09.530 --> 02:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
put plans in place to implement that in
 
02:23:11.870 --> 02:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
addition the schools also receive we
 
02:23:14.990 --> 02:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
call it a 1003a grant from our Title One
 
02:23:16.550 --> 02:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
office at the Department of Education
 
02:23:18.230 --> 02:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
and they receive
 
02:23:19.670 --> 02:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
um I think it's anywhere from like 25
 
02:23:21.349 --> 02:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
thousand to several hundred thousand
 
02:23:22.670 --> 02:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
dollars depending on the size of the
 
02:23:25.910 --> 02:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
school to implement those um those items
 
02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
identified in the needs assessment so
 
02:23:29.090 --> 02:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
that's true right now there is no
 
02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:30.230 align:start position:0%
that's true right now there is no
additional

02:23:30.230 --> 02:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
additional
 
02:23:31.550 --> 02:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
um additional State support for those
 
02:23:34.910 --> 02:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
schools so help me out here Caitlyn so
 
02:23:37.790 --> 02:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
that the title if you're considered a
 
02:23:40.550 --> 02:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:43.429 --> 02:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
a recipient as a district the district
 
02:23:45.410 --> 02:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the option to spend those
 
02:23:45.420 --> 02:23:46.809 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the option to spend those
dollars

02:23:46.809 --> 02:23:46.819 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:23:50.330 --> 02:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
where they want in which schools it's no
 
02:23:52.250 --> 02:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
so there's two there's two parts of
 
02:23:54.530 --> 02:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
title one uh so there's the Fig lard 40
 
02:23:56.570 --> 02:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
million dollar Title One grant that most
 
02:23:58.849 --> 02:23:58.859 align:start position:0%
districts across the state get and the
 
02:24:01.969 --> 02:24:01.979 align:start position:0%
schools or the districts are required to
 
02:24:03.410 --> 02:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
provide those funds to their media
 
02:24:05.450 --> 02:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
students so for the most part schools
 
02:24:08.270 --> 02:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
rank order there's their sorry districts
 
02:24:10.370 --> 02:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
rank order their schools in order of
 
02:24:12.290 --> 02:24:12.300 align:start position:0%
poverty and allocate the funding of the
 
02:24:14.690 --> 02:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
schools so that's the big Title One
 
02:24:16.610 --> 02:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
Grant there's a set aside the Department
 
02:24:19.190 --> 02:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
of Education receives in title one which
 
02:24:21.050 --> 02:24:21.060 align:start position:0%
is seven percent of our Title One Grant
 
02:24:23.809 --> 02:24:23.819 align:start position:0%
and so what we do is we take that money
 
02:24:25.730 --> 02:24:25.740 align:start position:0%
off their Title One off the top and we
 
02:24:27.770 --> 02:24:27.780 align:start position:0%
set that aside for once the CSI
 
02:24:29.929 --> 02:24:29.939 align:start position:0%
determination has be done has been done
 
02:24:32.389 --> 02:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
so we at the department of education do
 
02:24:34.309 --> 02:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
these rigorous calculations defined here
 
02:24:36.110 --> 02:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
and law to determine what the CSI
 
02:24:38.210 --> 02:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
schools will be and the those bottom
 
02:24:40.730 --> 02:24:40.740 align:start position:0%
five percent of schools will receive one
 
02:24:43.190 --> 02:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
the technical assistance and two a grant
 
02:24:46.550 --> 02:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
of that so that set aside Grant but that
 
02:24:48.650 --> 02:24:48.660 align:start position:0%
is is only right now for elementary
 
02:24:53.450 --> 02:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
schools that are Title 1 status or any
 
02:24:55.370 --> 02:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
school any high school that has a
 
02:25:01.309 --> 02:25:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:05.030 --> 02:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
yeah representative cascaden yes so they
 
02:25:07.130 --> 02:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
would receive
 
02:25:10.490 --> 02:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
substantially as a CSI score TSI school
 
02:25:12.050 --> 02:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
if the graduation rate like you
 
02:25:13.370 --> 02:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
mentioned yeah
 
02:25:17.030 --> 02:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
not the ones that are 67.1 so in the
 
02:25:18.469 --> 02:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
list that you mentioned I believe it was
 
02:25:21.250 --> 02:25:21.260 align:start position:0%
right is below right yeah right below
 
02:25:24.710 --> 02:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
67. so have you been
 
02:25:26.570 --> 02:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
directing this money when we've had it
 
02:25:29.330 --> 02:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
at 69 for two consecutive years have
 
02:25:31.790 --> 02:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
they been receiving money no we can't we
 
02:25:33.830 --> 02:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
can't do that
 
02:25:35.929 --> 02:25:35.939 align:start position:0%
so and I think part of the confusion is
 
02:25:35.939 --> 02:25:37.150 align:start position:0%
so and I think part of the confusion is
is

02:25:37.150 --> 02:25:37.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:25:40.190 --> 02:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
in 2017 we wrote this we kind of tried
 
02:25:42.590 --> 02:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
to kill two birds with one stone which
 
02:25:43.610 --> 02:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
we said all right there's Federal
 
02:25:44.809 --> 02:25:44.819 align:start position:0%
accountability in their state
 
02:25:47.990 --> 02:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
accountability and it's mostly aligned
 
02:25:49.730 --> 02:25:49.740 align:start position:0%
but there's a few differences and this
 
02:25:51.590 --> 02:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
is one of those few differences
 
02:25:53.929 --> 02:25:53.939 align:start position:0%
and we might be at a point now where we
 
02:25:55.429 --> 02:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
need to start talking about well what
 
02:25:57.110 --> 02:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
does State accountability actually look
 
02:25:58.790 --> 02:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
like and should it be different than
 
02:26:00.650 --> 02:26:00.660 align:start position:0%
what federal accountability is because
 
02:26:02.330 --> 02:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
if you remember the section of this law
 
02:26:03.950 --> 02:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
as accountability for an adequate
 
02:26:06.110 --> 02:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
education and so maybe we want to say
 
02:26:07.670 --> 02:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
all right this is what you need to do
 
02:26:09.710 --> 02:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
over here per your Consolidated state
 
02:26:12.349 --> 02:26:12.359 align:start position:0%
plan for Essa and that's while the you
 
02:26:14.690 --> 02:26:14.700 align:start position:0%
know 130 million dollars of federal Essa
 
02:26:16.610 --> 02:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
money or whatever it is is contingent on
 
02:26:19.309 --> 02:26:19.319 align:start position:0%
that and then the accountability for an
 
02:26:20.809 --> 02:26:20.819 align:start position:0%
adequate education which is the state
 
02:26:22.490 --> 02:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
adequate education funding of about a
 
02:26:24.170 --> 02:26:24.180 align:start position:0%
billion dollars maybe we have a
 
02:26:26.690 --> 02:26:26.700 align:start position:0%
different process for that but right now
 
02:26:28.429 --> 02:26:28.439 align:start position:0%
they're kind of aligned and there's some
 
02:26:30.170 --> 02:26:30.180 align:start position:0%
confusion there's a lot of people that
 
02:26:31.190 --> 02:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
have been coming to the Department of
 
02:26:33.290 --> 02:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
Education lately that said well should
 
02:26:35.750 --> 02:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
we be looking at um completers so should
 
02:26:37.250 --> 02:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
we be getting credit for those that are
 
02:26:39.410 --> 02:26:39.420 align:start position:0%
getting the kids a GED or a high set
 
02:26:42.110 --> 02:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
should there be some additional kind of
 
02:26:43.370 --> 02:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
should that be concluded in your
 
02:26:45.349 --> 02:26:45.359 align:start position:0%
calculation and we said those are
 
02:26:46.790 --> 02:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
definitely good things to think about we
 
02:26:48.349 --> 02:26:48.359 align:start position:0%
have our adult education program that's
 
02:26:49.910 --> 02:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of this work and paying for
 
02:26:52.010 --> 02:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the state but it's not not
 
02:26:53.750 --> 02:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
included in the federal definition and
 
02:26:55.370 --> 02:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
we don't have the ability to change the
 
02:26:57.590 --> 02:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
federal definition that's in federal law
 
02:27:01.190 --> 02:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
so approximately how much does West
 
02:27:04.670 --> 02:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
receive in Title One monies I can look
 
02:27:05.630 --> 02:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
it up
 
02:27:07.910 --> 02:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
think would be a lot
 
02:27:09.530 --> 02:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
but it'll take a minute so if you want
 
02:27:16.429 --> 02:27:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:18.770 --> 02:27:18.780 align:start position:0%
okay Nate why don't we uh scoot down to
 
02:27:20.210 --> 02:27:20.220 align:start position:0%
the bottom part here and then come back
 
02:27:22.309 --> 02:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
to this uh
 
02:27:23.990 --> 02:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about the New
 
02:27:27.469 --> 02:27:27.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Consolidated state plan
 
02:27:29.450 --> 02:27:29.460 align:start position:0%
and I know the definition there comes
 
02:27:31.490 --> 02:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
almost for fate verbatim from federal
 
02:27:31.500 --> 02:27:33.770 align:start position:0%
almost for fate verbatim from federal
law

02:27:33.770 --> 02:27:33.780 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:27:35.690 --> 02:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I think this just helps to
 
02:27:38.809 --> 02:27:38.819 align:start position:0%
provide some clarity as to what the SSD
 
02:27:42.469 --> 02:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:44.690 --> 02:27:44.700 align:start position:0%
um one subsequent change as well in here
 
02:27:47.450 --> 02:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
is we removed every three years for that
 
02:27:50.450 --> 02:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
identification period and set it based
 
02:27:52.370 --> 02:27:52.380 align:start position:0%
upon a schedule set forth in the state
 
02:27:55.010 --> 02:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
plan initially when the state plan was
 
02:27:57.349 --> 02:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
written back in 2017 the plan was to
 
02:27:58.790 --> 02:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
have that be on a schedule every three
 
02:28:01.070 --> 02:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
years and that schedule was thrown into
 
02:28:04.070 --> 02:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
whack with the pandemic we ended up with
 
02:28:05.750 --> 02:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
sort of a one-year determination that
 
02:28:07.130 --> 02:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
occurred in the middle of the pandemic
 
02:28:09.230 --> 02:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
with a federal waiver and then an
 
02:28:10.790 --> 02:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
additional one-year designation and then
 
02:28:13.309 --> 02:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
back to a three years and so there was a
 
02:28:15.469 --> 02:28:15.479 align:start position:0%
schedule that was every three years
 
02:28:18.590 --> 02:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
based upon 2017 and that schedule kind
 
02:28:20.570 --> 02:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
of went out the window so there is a
 
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
schedule that is set down it's approved
 
02:28:24.050 --> 02:28:24.060 align:start position:0%
by the U.S Department of Education in
 
02:28:26.030 --> 02:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
our state Essa plan and so we just
 
02:28:27.770 --> 02:28:27.780 align:start position:0%
recommended here that we change it to be
 
02:28:29.630 --> 02:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
the schedule that's in the state plan as
 
02:28:31.429 --> 02:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
opposed to saying every three years the
 
02:28:33.410 --> 02:28:33.420 align:start position:0%
goal is every three years and that's
 
02:28:35.030 --> 02:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
what's written in the state plan but the
 
02:28:36.349 --> 02:28:36.359 align:start position:0%
schedule's a little off as a result of
 
02:28:39.550 --> 02:28:39.560 align:start position:0%
the pandemic thank you
 
02:28:43.010 --> 02:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
to answer your question West received
 
02:28:49.730 --> 02:28:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:51.349 --> 02:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
and that's in addition to other Title
 
02:28:52.670 --> 02:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
One money that Manchester would have
 
02:28:52.680 --> 02:28:54.969 align:start position:0%
One money that Manchester would have
received

02:28:54.969 --> 02:28:54.979 align:start position:0%
received
 
02:28:58.730 --> 02:28:58.740 align:start position:0%
and we're looking at another school like
 
02:28:58.740 --> 02:29:00.429 align:start position:0%
and we're looking at another school like
Central

02:29:00.429 --> 02:29:00.439 align:start position:0%
Central
 
02:29:02.929 --> 02:29:02.939 align:start position:0%
67.9 percent
 
02:29:05.630 --> 02:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
why can't the state kick in somebody to
 
02:29:07.610 --> 02:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
help them as well there's there's
 
02:29:09.230 --> 02:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing that prevents the
 
02:29:10.910 --> 02:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
state from doing that you would just
 
02:29:12.530 --> 02:29:12.540 align:start position:0%
have to come up with a determination and
 
02:29:15.469 --> 02:29:15.479 align:start position:0%
obligate money in the state budget
 
02:29:15.479 --> 02:29:17.929 align:start position:0%
obligate money in the state budget
okay

02:29:17.929 --> 02:29:17.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:20.809 --> 02:29:20.819 align:start position:0%
further on that one
 
02:29:28.250 --> 02:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:30.889 --> 02:29:30.899 align:start position:0%
can you explain lines four through seven
 
02:29:47.809 --> 02:29:47.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:51.670 --> 02:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
see this is referencing back to the A
 
02:29:57.230 --> 02:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
yes oh um so further down in this page
 
02:30:02.330 --> 02:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:06.110 --> 02:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
so on line 19 in current statute
 
02:30:08.030 --> 02:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
it says any school that demonstrates and
 
02:30:10.250 --> 02:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
meets criteria established as a targeted
 
02:30:12.170 --> 02:30:12.180 align:start position:0%
support and Improvement school pursuant
 
02:30:14.510 --> 02:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
to subparagraph a shall be identified as
 
02:30:15.650 --> 02:30:15.660 align:start position:0%
a school in need of corrective and
 
02:30:18.290 --> 02:30:18.300 align:start position:0%
technical assistance and subject rsa183
 
02:30:21.170 --> 02:30:21.180 align:start position:0%
e3e so this
 
02:30:23.330 --> 02:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
which is currently in statute said that
 
02:30:25.969 --> 02:30:25.979 align:start position:0%
if you're a TSI school you're subject to
 
02:30:28.929 --> 02:30:28.939 align:start position:0%
193 E3 and you're identified as a school
 
02:30:32.210 --> 02:30:32.220 align:start position:0%
in need of assistance corrective and
 
02:30:34.370 --> 02:30:34.380 align:start position:0%
technical assistance that language was
 
02:30:37.370 --> 02:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
not included as part of a CSI school and
 
02:30:39.290 --> 02:30:39.300 align:start position:0%
CSI schools are actually schools that
 
02:30:42.710 --> 02:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
are worse in performance than TSI
 
02:30:45.050 --> 02:30:45.060 align:start position:0%
schools so our current statute has a
 
02:30:47.450 --> 02:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
situation where we have two tiers we
 
02:30:50.690 --> 02:30:50.700 align:start position:0%
have TSI and then below that CSI TSI
 
02:30:51.950 --> 02:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
schools by state law are being
 
02:30:53.870 --> 02:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
identified as in need of assistance but
 
02:30:56.630 --> 02:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
CSI schools were not and so we felt like
 
02:30:58.250 --> 02:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
if you're identifying the higher level
 
02:30:59.690 --> 02:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
of schools as being in need of
 
02:31:01.429 --> 02:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
corrective assistance you should also
 
02:31:03.050 --> 02:31:03.060 align:start position:0%
identify the group of schools that's in
 
02:31:04.849 --> 02:31:04.859 align:start position:0%
the lower tier because they actually
 
02:31:08.330 --> 02:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
need more support than TSI schools but I
 
02:31:10.849 --> 02:31:10.859 align:start position:0%
don't know if maybe that was just an
 
02:31:11.929 --> 02:31:11.939 align:start position:0%
oversight in some of the original
 
02:31:14.210 --> 02:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
statute I'm not sure what the intent was
 
02:31:16.010 --> 02:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
to identify a higher performing group of
 
02:31:17.570 --> 02:31:17.580 align:start position:0%
schools but not the lower performing
 
02:31:19.370 --> 02:31:19.380 align:start position:0%
group of schools so what we did is we
 
02:31:22.010 --> 02:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
just copied the language from 19 and we
 
02:31:24.230 --> 02:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
added up here in lines four five and six
 
02:31:26.929 --> 02:31:26.939 align:start position:0%
to the CSI schools so now both of those
 
02:31:28.910 --> 02:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
groups of schools would be identified
 
02:31:31.550 --> 02:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
even those not receiving Title Loan
 
02:31:31.560 --> 02:31:32.389 align:start position:0%
even those not receiving Title Loan
Monies

02:31:32.389 --> 02:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
Monies
 
02:31:35.929 --> 02:31:35.939 align:start position:0%
correct so this is relative to 183 E3 so
 
02:31:38.389 --> 02:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
when you go back to the 183 E3 statute
 
02:31:40.130 --> 02:31:40.140 align:start position:0%
this is accountability for an adequate
 
02:31:42.830 --> 02:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
education so what this is saying is you
 
02:31:44.570 --> 02:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
have two groups of federally identified
 
02:31:47.090 --> 02:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
schools we're saying the higher
 
02:31:49.610 --> 02:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
performing group does not meet the
 
02:31:50.929 --> 02:31:50.939 align:start position:0%
requirements for an adequate education
 
02:31:53.270 --> 02:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
but the lower performing group does
 
02:31:55.190 --> 02:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
and that just didn't make sense within
 
02:31:56.990 --> 02:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
the statute so we felt like if you're if
 
02:31:58.550 --> 02:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
we're identifying one group is not
 
02:32:00.170 --> 02:32:00.180 align:start position:0%
meaning requirements for an adequate
 
02:32:02.150 --> 02:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
education you really have to also
 
02:32:03.889 --> 02:32:03.899 align:start position:0%
identify the lower performing group as
 
02:32:09.710 --> 02:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:13.010 --> 02:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
further discussion on that
 
02:32:16.309 --> 02:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
okay going down to middle of the page
 
02:32:19.070 --> 02:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
line 18.
 
02:32:21.650 --> 02:32:21.660 align:start position:0%
there's also some dates removed I
 
02:32:32.270 --> 02:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:34.250 --> 02:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
targeted support Improvement schools
 
02:32:37.490 --> 02:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:40.389 --> 02:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
I I think this just saying it's
 
02:32:47.450 --> 02:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:47.460 --> 02:33:10.910 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:33:10.910 --> 02:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:12.710 --> 02:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
I think we're unclear what the question
 
02:33:15.950 --> 02:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
is okay I'm just you know explain try it
 
02:33:18.650 --> 02:33:18.660 align:start position:0%
can you explain why they need to add in
 
02:33:20.210 --> 02:33:20.220 align:start position:0%
18 there
 
02:33:22.490 --> 02:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
on line 18.
 
02:33:25.550 --> 02:33:25.560 align:start position:0%
oh sure so this just matches the
 
02:33:27.889 --> 02:33:27.899 align:start position:0%
schedule of determinations of when we
 
02:33:30.710 --> 02:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
identify the additional targeted support
 
02:33:32.570 --> 02:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
and Improvement schools to match the
 
02:33:34.010 --> 02:33:34.020 align:start position:0%
comprehensive support and improving
 
02:33:34.020 --> 02:33:35.750 align:start position:0%
comprehensive support and improving
schools

02:33:35.750 --> 02:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:33:35.760 --> 02:33:36.770 align:start position:0%
schools
okay

02:33:36.770 --> 02:33:36.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:33:39.110 --> 02:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative cascadden uh my
 
02:33:40.849 --> 02:33:40.859 align:start position:0%
question is on using the data from
 
02:33:40.859 --> 02:33:43.610 align:start position:0%
question is on using the data from
2017-18

02:33:43.610 --> 02:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
2017-18
 
02:33:46.070 --> 02:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
is that when that classification first
 
02:33:49.490 --> 02:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
started yes okay so the very first list
 
02:33:52.429 --> 02:33:52.439 align:start position:0%
of CSI and TSI schools yeah was based
 
02:33:55.070 --> 02:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
off 17-18 data and then future
 
02:33:57.770 --> 02:33:57.780 align:start position:0%
determinations are made based off of the
 
02:34:02.090 --> 02:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
current assessment data okay thanks
 
02:34:04.790 --> 02:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
yes representative Miler I'm sorry to be
 
02:34:08.530 --> 02:34:08.540 align:start position:0%
very basic here but you you use the term
 
02:34:11.270 --> 02:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
TSI and CSI
 
02:34:14.510 --> 02:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
which is the one that's
 
02:34:16.730 --> 02:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
higher and lower
 
02:34:20.750 --> 02:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
so a CSI School uh is uh the C stands
 
02:34:22.670 --> 02:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
for comprehensive and so that would be
 
02:34:25.010 --> 02:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
the lower performing one that means that
 
02:34:27.410 --> 02:34:27.420 align:start position:0%
all of your whole school is performing
 
02:34:29.450 --> 02:34:29.460 align:start position:0%
in the very bottom five percent of the
 
02:34:32.990 --> 02:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
state across the board a TSI school is a
 
02:34:35.570 --> 02:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
school that maybe the school overall is
 
02:34:37.969 --> 02:34:37.979 align:start position:0%
performing okay but you might have one
 
02:34:40.190 --> 02:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
or two particular student groups that
 
02:34:41.450 --> 02:34:41.460 align:start position:0%
are performing in the bottom five
 
02:34:44.929 --> 02:34:44.939 align:start position:0%
percent of the state thank you
 
02:34:46.730 --> 02:34:46.740 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
02:34:49.010 --> 02:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
and we I think we've established before
 
02:34:52.130 --> 02:34:52.140 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't matter how high
 
02:34:54.950 --> 02:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
everybody is there's still going to be a
 
02:34:57.410 --> 02:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
bottom five percent it could be up at
 
02:34:59.570 --> 02:34:59.580 align:start position:0%
the 90th percentile and they if they
 
02:35:01.370 --> 02:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
were still at the and that isn't
 
02:35:03.110 --> 02:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
understood by a lot of people I think
 
02:35:05.030 --> 02:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
that the same thing with proficiency
 
02:35:07.070 --> 02:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
which we're going to talk about next
 
02:35:10.370 --> 02:35:10.380 align:start position:0%
there's a I think a lot of
 
02:35:12.969 --> 02:35:12.979 align:start position:0%
um misinformation or misthought about
 
02:35:16.190 --> 02:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
proficiency standards they actually
 
02:35:16.200 --> 02:35:17.630 align:start position:0%
proficiency standards they actually
move

02:35:17.630 --> 02:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
move
 
02:35:20.990 --> 02:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
and uh proficient doesn't mean that
 
02:35:23.330 --> 02:35:23.340 align:start position:0%
you're passing with a D or a c
 
02:35:23.340 --> 02:35:24.830 align:start position:0%
you're passing with a D or a c
so

02:35:24.830 --> 02:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:25.790 --> 02:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
what's your point about the bottom five
 
02:35:27.410 --> 02:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
percent always being identified that is
 
02:35:29.330 --> 02:35:29.340 align:start position:0%
a requirement in the federal law
 
02:35:30.710 --> 02:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
um but that's a great question and
 
02:35:32.150 --> 02:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
that's probably something that should be
 
02:35:35.450 --> 02:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
discussed as a committee uh maybe going
 
02:35:36.950 --> 02:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
forward with some additional legislation
 
02:35:39.230 --> 02:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
is if your bottom five percent is
 
02:35:41.270 --> 02:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
spectacular do we want to say that those
 
02:35:42.950 --> 02:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
schools are not providing an adequate
 
02:35:45.110 --> 02:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
education by the definition I'm not sure
 
02:35:46.969 --> 02:35:46.979 align:start position:0%
that we do or don't
 
02:35:48.889 --> 02:35:48.899 align:start position:0%
um so that will probably need to be
 
02:35:50.809 --> 02:35:50.819 align:start position:0%
written into law and I think those were
 
02:35:52.130 --> 02:35:52.140 align:start position:0%
conversations that we always thought
 
02:35:56.210 --> 02:35:56.220 align:start position:0%
would be happening once we initially
 
02:35:57.950 --> 02:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
determined the list so I think when we
 
02:35:59.330 --> 02:35:59.340 align:start position:0%
first came up with this legislation in
 
02:36:02.270 --> 02:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
2018 2019 we said all right well let's
 
02:36:03.349 --> 02:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
get to the point let's do the
 
02:36:04.790 --> 02:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
determinations let's do the list let's
 
02:36:06.230 --> 02:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
look at what that looks like and then
 
02:36:07.730 --> 02:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
now look what happens when we try to
 
02:36:09.530 --> 02:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
implement it now here we are five down
 
02:36:11.270 --> 02:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
ears down the road we had three years of
 
02:36:12.770 --> 02:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
pandemic and quite a bit of educational
 
02:36:12.780 --> 02:36:14.090 align:start position:0%
pandemic and quite a bit of educational
disruption

02:36:14.090 --> 02:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
disruption
 
02:36:16.070 --> 02:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
um and so we're kind of in this weird no
 
02:36:17.389 --> 02:36:17.399 align:start position:0%
man's land where we thought we would be
 
02:36:19.010 --> 02:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
coming back to you very shortly with an
 
02:36:20.450 --> 02:36:20.460 align:start position:0%
additional plan and some conversations
 
02:36:22.190 --> 02:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
or especially with maybe the legislative
 
02:36:24.110 --> 02:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
oversight committee and it just hasn't
 
02:36:26.389 --> 02:36:26.399 align:start position:0%
happened yet so that's why we are that's
 
02:36:29.510 --> 02:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:33.349 --> 02:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:33.359 --> 02:36:35.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:36:35.630 --> 02:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:36:39.349 --> 02:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
on lines 27 through 29
 
02:36:50.630 --> 02:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:53.210 --> 02:36:53.220 align:start position:0%
so this is a a particular statute that's
 
02:36:56.450 --> 02:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
changed I think three times each time
 
02:37:00.170 --> 02:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
the dates have changed so the
 
02:37:02.450 --> 02:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
line here requires that all schools
 
02:37:04.309 --> 02:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
ensure that every student is proficient
 
02:37:06.849 --> 02:37:06.859 align:start position:0%
on the state test by a certain year
 
02:37:09.950 --> 02:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
prior to it saying 2018-19 I believe it
 
02:37:12.590 --> 02:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
said 2015-16 prior to that I think it
 
02:37:15.889 --> 02:37:15.899 align:start position:0%
said 2008 2009 so there isn't
 
02:37:19.250 --> 02:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
necessarily a consequence attached to
 
02:37:22.730 --> 02:37:22.740 align:start position:0%
this line and there's a date that's set
 
02:37:22.740 --> 02:37:24.710 align:start position:0%
this line and there's a date that's set
um

02:37:24.710 --> 02:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:27.110 --> 02:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
but we don't have every student scoring
 
02:37:29.150 --> 02:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
proficient on the state test in every
 
02:37:31.010 --> 02:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
school and that's kind of what this line
 
02:37:33.410 --> 02:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
here requires it says by this date every
 
02:37:35.450 --> 02:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
student shall be proficient
 
02:37:38.389 --> 02:37:38.399 align:start position:0%
so rather than continue to move the date
 
02:37:41.929 --> 02:37:41.939 align:start position:0%
down the road we pulled it out just
 
02:37:43.130 --> 02:37:43.140 align:start position:0%
because there isn't something that
 
02:37:46.130 --> 02:37:46.140 align:start position:0%
happens afterwards so we publish the
 
02:37:48.469 --> 02:37:48.479 align:start position:0%
data we know that you know many of our
 
02:37:49.610 --> 02:37:49.620 align:start position:0%
students are performing at various
 
02:37:51.530 --> 02:37:51.540 align:start position:0%
different levels on the state test
 
02:37:52.790 --> 02:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
but there wasn't something that kind of
 
02:37:55.490 --> 02:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
happened next after determining that not
 
02:37:59.090 --> 02:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:00.710 --> 02:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
yes represent
 
02:38:05.330 --> 02:38:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:07.849 --> 02:38:07.859 align:start position:0%
when it says by that date everybody had
 
02:38:10.429 --> 02:38:10.439 align:start position:0%
to be proficient did they have to stay
 
02:38:12.889 --> 02:38:12.899 align:start position:0%
proficient I mean is it just like we hit
 
02:38:15.410 --> 02:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
it once and that was it uh
 
02:38:17.929 --> 02:38:17.939 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a vague statute which is
 
02:38:19.370 --> 02:38:19.380 align:start position:0%
sort of why we crossed that out I think
 
02:38:22.429 --> 02:38:22.439 align:start position:0%
it's more than big thank you it needs to
 
02:38:25.510 --> 02:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
be crossed out represent Damon
 
02:38:28.550 --> 02:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
respectfully Mr chair I disagree
 
02:38:31.370 --> 02:38:31.380 align:start position:0%
so we're crossing it out because we
 
02:38:34.670 --> 02:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
didn't have a consequence for not
 
02:38:36.650 --> 02:38:36.660 align:start position:0%
requiring students to perform at a
 
02:38:38.630 --> 02:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
proficient level don't we want them to
 
02:38:40.849 --> 02:38:40.859 align:start position:0%
perform at a proficient level maybe we
 
02:38:44.270 --> 02:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
should if we're not achieving that
 
02:38:46.130 --> 02:38:46.140 align:start position:0%
we should be addressing the fact that
 
02:38:47.750 --> 02:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
we're not achieving it not taking away
 
02:38:50.690 --> 02:38:50.700 align:start position:0%
the goal no I I agree I think and in
 
02:38:52.130 --> 02:38:52.140 align:start position:0%
consequence is probably the bad word I
 
02:38:54.530 --> 02:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
think you know a Next Step based upon a
 
02:38:56.929 --> 02:38:56.939 align:start position:0%
stated year was sort of the part that
 
02:38:58.550 --> 02:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
that didn't make sense is okay so we hit
 
02:38:58.560 --> 02:39:00.530 align:start position:0%
that didn't make sense is okay so we hit
2018-19

02:39:00.530 --> 02:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
2018-19
 
02:39:02.750 --> 02:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
but there wasn't that next step of okay
 
02:39:05.030 --> 02:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
now what and now we've gone beyond that
 
02:39:08.030 --> 02:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
we're in 2023 this line is only specific
 
02:39:11.450 --> 02:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
to what occurred in the year 2018-19
 
02:39:13.370 --> 02:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
and so that's the part that was I
 
02:39:15.230 --> 02:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely a thousand percent agree and
 
02:39:17.510 --> 02:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
I think we have in both the the purpose
 
02:39:19.610 --> 02:39:19.620 align:start position:0%
at the very beginning I think of 183c
 
02:39:21.349 --> 02:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
that talks about the purpose of the
 
02:39:23.150 --> 02:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment to ensure that all
 
02:39:24.950 --> 02:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
students are assessed on what they know
 
02:39:27.590 --> 02:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
and can do we have I think
 
02:39:29.090 --> 02:39:29.100 align:start position:0%
um as well within some of our rules at
 
02:39:30.530 --> 02:39:30.540 align:start position:0%
the department and a lot of the
 
02:39:32.690 --> 02:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
communication that we put out our goal
 
02:39:34.730 --> 02:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
is to get every single student to be
 
02:39:37.070 --> 02:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
proficient at grade level in reading and
 
02:39:39.050 --> 02:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
math and science
 
02:39:41.090 --> 02:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
um so it's just this particular part
 
02:39:44.389 --> 02:39:44.399 align:start position:0%
that referenced that school year was a
 
02:39:46.190 --> 02:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
little bit nonsensical now that we're in
 
02:39:48.469 --> 02:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
2023 like consequence is probably the
 
02:39:51.950 --> 02:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
bad word yeah to use but when we when we
 
02:39:55.610 --> 02:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
adopted the SS stuff back years ago we
 
02:39:57.050 --> 02:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
were looking at
 
02:39:59.090 --> 02:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
the word growth
 
02:40:03.770 --> 02:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
as well as achievement and so if
 
02:40:06.110 --> 02:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
if a student is showing growth but
 
02:40:07.849 --> 02:40:07.859 align:start position:0%
they're not at that proficiency level
 
02:40:10.610 --> 02:40:10.620 align:start position:0%
yet for that student but they're showing
 
02:40:13.370 --> 02:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
growth that's our aim that's one of our
 
02:40:15.710 --> 02:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
aims yes I think that we're going to say
 
02:40:17.030 --> 02:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to be proficient
 
02:40:18.469 --> 02:40:18.479 align:start position:0%
that's you know
 
02:40:21.110 --> 02:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's not realistic but we would like
 
02:40:23.870 --> 02:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
to see growth from all students and I
 
02:40:26.270 --> 02:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
think there's a really important the
 
02:40:27.770 --> 02:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
language that we use when we talk about
 
02:40:30.530 --> 02:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
proficiency so you know if I use fifth
 
02:40:33.290 --> 02:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
grade as an example if we say that again
 
02:40:36.110 --> 02:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
45 of our fifth grade student and I'm
 
02:40:37.910 --> 02:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
making up a number here but if we say 45
 
02:40:39.650 --> 02:40:39.660 align:start position:0%
of our fifth grade students are
 
02:40:42.110 --> 02:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
proficient in Reading we're not saying
 
02:40:45.230 --> 02:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
that 55 of our students can't read we're
 
02:40:47.450 --> 02:40:47.460 align:start position:0%
saying that 55 of the students aren't
 
02:40:49.010 --> 02:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
proficient yet at a fifth grade level
 
02:40:51.230 --> 02:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
many of them are proficient at a fourth
 
02:40:52.910 --> 02:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
grade level and they're making that
 
02:40:54.410 --> 02:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
growth towards that fifth grade level
 
02:40:56.570 --> 02:40:56.580 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of those students can
 
02:40:56.580 --> 02:40:57.469 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of those students can
read

02:40:57.469 --> 02:40:57.479 align:start position:0%
read
 
02:40:59.270 --> 02:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
but in fifth grade some of the students
 
02:41:00.650 --> 02:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
may be reading at a fourth grade level
 
02:41:02.270 --> 02:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
uh some of those students might be
 
02:41:04.670 --> 02:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
reading at a third grade level so it's
 
02:41:06.590 --> 02:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
not proficient doesn't mean whether you
 
02:41:07.910 --> 02:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
can do it or whether you can't do it
 
02:41:10.550 --> 02:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
it's can you do it at that level that
 
02:41:12.710 --> 02:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
your age has put you at in your cohort
 
02:41:15.110 --> 02:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
and so that I think that's why we really
 
02:41:16.610 --> 02:41:16.620 align:start position:0%
like to talk about growth as well
 
02:41:18.950 --> 02:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
because those students that are in fifth
 
02:41:19.969 --> 02:41:19.979 align:start position:0%
grade and reading in a fourth grade
 
02:41:22.309 --> 02:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
level may have made a huge amount of
 
02:41:25.309 --> 02:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
growth to get to that point and so when
 
02:41:26.809 --> 02:41:26.819 align:start position:0%
we were publishing data and statistics
 
02:41:28.250 --> 02:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
on our website next to the achievement
 
02:41:29.990 --> 02:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
percentages we publish the growth
 
02:41:31.790 --> 02:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
percentages to show what percent of
 
02:41:33.889 --> 02:41:33.899 align:start position:0%
students have made growth from their
 
02:41:36.110 --> 02:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
last school year to this school year and
 
02:41:38.389 --> 02:41:38.399 align:start position:0%
maybe they're not on grade level yet but
 
02:41:40.130 --> 02:41:40.140 align:start position:0%
they may have moved a whole grade and a
 
02:41:42.650 --> 02:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
half level up in growth in the work that
 
02:41:43.730 --> 02:41:43.740 align:start position:0%
they've been doing to get to the point
 
02:41:45.349 --> 02:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
they're at right now
 
02:41:48.050 --> 02:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
yeah represent dry
 
02:41:50.389 --> 02:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:41:53.750 --> 02:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
um when it talks about the the schools
 
02:41:55.550 --> 02:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
will be performance-based indicators
 
02:41:57.770 --> 02:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
assistant number two right now approved
 
02:42:01.010 --> 02:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
by the Legislative oversight committee
 
02:42:02.990 --> 02:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
where would we find those it says it's
 
02:42:08.690 --> 02:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
in rules so where are those standards
 
02:42:11.090 --> 02:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
so the Statewide performance targets
 
02:42:12.889 --> 02:42:12.899 align:start position:0%
we've always used Statewide the
 
02:42:14.389 --> 02:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
Statewide performance targets that were
 
02:42:17.230 --> 02:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
approved in the Essa plan in 2017-18
 
02:42:19.309 --> 02:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
there was a committee that had been put
 
02:42:21.650 --> 02:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
together that developed the performance
 
02:42:25.070 --> 02:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
targets based off of how students in New
 
02:42:26.510 --> 02:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at each grade level had been
 
02:42:28.610 --> 02:42:28.620 align:start position:0%
performing up to that point and it made
 
02:42:30.469 --> 02:42:30.479 align:start position:0%
projections out I believe for the next
 
02:42:33.110 --> 02:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
10 years that were relatively aggressive
 
02:42:35.150 --> 02:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
projections for where we wanted students
 
02:42:37.010 --> 02:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to be in each of those
 
02:42:38.510 --> 02:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
subjects at each of those grade levels
 
02:42:40.790 --> 02:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
and we published those Targets on our
 
02:42:43.150 --> 02:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
website so each year when a School
 
02:42:45.410 --> 02:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
receives the data around their Statewide
 
02:42:47.690 --> 02:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
assessment that data is compared to that
 
02:42:49.849 --> 02:42:49.859 align:start position:0%
Statewide performance Target and they
 
02:42:51.770 --> 02:42:51.780 align:start position:0%
can see as a school have they met was
 
02:42:53.690 --> 02:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
what was expected for the state for that
 
02:42:55.670 --> 02:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
year did they exceed it were they below
 
02:42:57.950 --> 02:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
it but much of that information is in
 
02:43:00.590 --> 02:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
the state Essa plan okay follow-up yes
 
02:43:03.889 --> 02:43:03.899 align:start position:0%
so does that change I mean are the
 
02:43:05.450 --> 02:43:05.460 align:start position:0%
standards change or is it we have to
 
02:43:09.290 --> 02:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
wait 10 years to to reevaluate it
 
02:43:10.730 --> 02:43:10.740 align:start position:0%
um so the standards themselves have not
 
02:43:12.590 --> 02:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
changed the standards that we're holding
 
02:43:14.270 --> 02:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
students to each of those years are the
 
02:43:16.370 --> 02:43:16.380 align:start position:0%
same standards
 
02:43:19.330 --> 02:43:19.340 align:start position:0%
um when we get I think 10 years from
 
02:43:22.429 --> 02:43:22.439 align:start position:0%
2017-18 which I think is what so 20 27
 
02:43:24.830 --> 02:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
28 we'll have to reevaluate and come up
 
02:43:27.590 --> 02:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
with new targets because we don't have
 
02:43:29.690 --> 02:43:29.700 align:start position:0%
any Targets set right now at that point
 
02:43:31.969 --> 02:43:31.979 align:start position:0%
but we do have a variety of targets for
 
02:43:33.469 --> 02:43:33.479 align:start position:0%
many different areas not just the
 
02:43:34.910 --> 02:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment we have graduation
 
02:43:37.849 --> 02:43:37.859 align:start position:0%
uh rate targets we have
 
02:43:40.870 --> 02:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
um targets for percentages of students
 
02:43:42.710 --> 02:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
mastering the English language learner
 
02:43:45.170 --> 02:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
that are English language Learners so
 
02:43:46.309 --> 02:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of other categories
 
02:43:47.690 --> 02:43:47.700 align:start position:0%
that go beyond just the Statewide test
 
02:43:49.309 --> 02:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
but yeah they all they all end I think
 
02:43:52.730 --> 02:43:52.740 align:start position:0%
in 2027. and we find those where
 
02:43:54.650 --> 02:43:54.660 align:start position:0%
um so those are published on the I
 
02:43:57.710 --> 02:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
platform and I report as well as in the
 
02:44:02.150 --> 02:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
state Essa plan okay thank you
 
02:44:05.330 --> 02:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
okay this takes us down through uh the
 
02:44:07.670 --> 02:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
changes which we have here it's a lot
 
02:44:11.270 --> 02:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
shorter than uh now if if this is to
 
02:44:13.010 --> 02:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
move forward this amendment this
 
02:44:14.630 --> 02:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
amendment then would delete everything
 
02:44:17.990 --> 02:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
in SB 266
 
02:44:21.710 --> 02:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
and this would be 266.
 
02:44:23.690 --> 02:44:23.700 align:start position:0%
so in a lot of what we did in two
 
02:44:25.670 --> 02:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
success was moving things around to make
 
02:44:28.309 --> 02:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
it chronologically make sense or just
 
02:44:30.650 --> 02:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
kind of move different areas so that's a
 
02:44:33.469 --> 02:44:33.479 align:start position:0%
lot of why you have all these Pages
 
02:44:34.790 --> 02:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
um so this still this gives us the
 
02:44:36.950 --> 02:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
ability to implement the law and do the
 
02:44:40.070 --> 02:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
work that we need to do 266 gave us the
 
02:44:42.469 --> 02:44:42.479 align:start position:0%
ability to kind of make the law book
 
02:44:44.030 --> 02:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
look a little bit better
 
02:44:44.040 --> 02:44:46.790 align:start position:0%
look a little bit better
so

02:44:46.790 --> 02:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:49.250 --> 02:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we're you know up to
 
02:44:52.190 --> 02:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
that in the next several weeks here to
 
02:44:55.550 --> 02:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
take this as it was introduced to us
 
02:44:59.690 --> 02:44:59.700 align:start position:0%
right and no I can't wait to do that I
 
02:45:01.190 --> 02:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
think if you move forward with the
 
02:45:03.110 --> 02:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
amendment that gives us a lot of the
 
02:45:04.969 --> 02:45:04.979 align:start position:0%
work that we needed yeah and then maybe
 
02:45:07.190 --> 02:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
we can talk about making some of the
 
02:45:09.650 --> 02:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
well I think we're open to that uh but I
 
02:45:14.950 --> 02:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:18.230 --> 02:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
c-h-k-e right yeah and K was an entirely
 
02:45:20.809 --> 02:45:20.819 align:start position:0%
new invented I know that it comes after
 
02:45:22.969 --> 02:45:22.979 align:start position:0%
J right yeah well you have to move the
 
02:45:24.349 --> 02:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
reporting and we know that you know
 
02:45:25.790 --> 02:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
there's committees that are kind of
 
02:45:28.130 --> 02:45:28.140 align:start position:0%
mixed in this there's the Holocaust
 
02:45:29.750 --> 02:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
legislation that was just kind of mixed
 
02:45:31.010 --> 02:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
in and we thought it deserved its own
 
02:45:32.630 --> 02:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
section so we were really trying to do
 
02:45:34.910 --> 02:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
an all for one I guess maybe we got a
 
02:45:37.370 --> 02:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
little too ambitious would that work so
 
02:45:40.370 --> 02:45:40.380 align:start position:0%
well we were kind of amazed at a bill of
 
02:45:43.190 --> 02:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
that size came from the Senate as
 
02:45:47.290 --> 02:45:47.300 align:start position:0%
introduced no no changes
 
02:45:49.969 --> 02:45:49.979 align:start position:0%
that was that just was kind of shocking
 
02:45:52.910 --> 02:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
to me uh and then when we got into it we
 
02:45:54.590 --> 02:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
were waiting around and I personally was
 
02:45:56.330 --> 02:45:56.340 align:start position:0%
trying to go back and forth I know gen
 
02:45:59.210 --> 02:45:59.220 align:start position:0%
Ford did a side by side here for us and
 
02:46:01.190 --> 02:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
it was like
 
02:46:04.910 --> 02:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
it was a trial and so I don't know we're
 
02:46:06.710 --> 02:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
not there yet I think we're going to
 
02:46:09.110 --> 02:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
have to take it step by step
 
02:46:11.450 --> 02:46:11.460 align:start position:0%
um that's fair you're you're in some
 
02:46:13.910 --> 02:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
pretty heavy chapters there dealing with
 
02:46:16.429 --> 02:46:16.439 align:start position:0%
education representative cascadden um I
 
02:46:18.110 --> 02:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
want to commend you on this amendment
 
02:46:19.910 --> 02:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
particular because I've gone through I
 
02:46:21.889 --> 02:46:21.899 align:start position:0%
think three times and made notes on the
 
02:46:24.590 --> 02:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
side by side and it was all over the
 
02:46:28.030 --> 02:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
place and certainly some substantial
 
02:46:31.190 --> 02:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
issues in there that just didn't line up
 
02:46:33.050 --> 02:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about minimum
 
02:46:35.510 --> 02:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
standards for school approval versus
 
02:46:38.270 --> 02:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
criteria for education so thank you for
 
02:46:39.590 --> 02:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
this I
 
02:46:42.050 --> 02:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
this is succinct it's what we're talking
 
02:46:44.510 --> 02:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
about and we make that one change then
 
02:46:48.170 --> 02:46:48.180 align:start position:0%
Linda came up it's adapted and you know
 
02:46:50.389 --> 02:46:50.399 align:start position:0%
my suggestion is that we make that one
 
02:46:53.929 --> 02:46:53.939 align:start position:0%
change as a committee right here
 
02:46:55.610 --> 02:46:55.620 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's necessary to come
 
02:46:58.429 --> 02:46:58.439 align:start position:0%
back and talk 266 anymore I would just
 
02:47:01.070 --> 02:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
as soon say we're satisfied to move
 
02:47:03.170 --> 02:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
forward with this thing with that
 
02:47:05.389 --> 02:47:05.399 align:start position:0%
amended change and we'll have it as a
 
02:47:07.570 --> 02:47:07.580 align:start position:0%
committee Amendment
 
02:47:11.570 --> 02:47:11.580 align:start position:0%
any objections that representative Damon
 
02:47:13.429 --> 02:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
I have a lingering question before
 
02:47:15.290 --> 02:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
agreeing to that
 
02:47:20.809 --> 02:47:20.819 align:start position:0%
so on page three line 31 and then it
 
02:47:23.690 --> 02:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
comes up again later I think
 
02:47:23.700 --> 02:47:24.410 align:start position:0%
comes up again later I think
um

02:47:24.410 --> 02:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:26.630 --> 02:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
where the amendment takes out the every
 
02:47:30.230 --> 02:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
three-year determination of what schools
 
02:47:32.929 --> 02:47:32.939 align:start position:0%
are in which category
 
02:47:35.150 --> 02:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
and I believe Dr Green you said the goal
 
02:47:38.210 --> 02:47:38.220 align:start position:0%
is still every three years
 
02:47:41.809 --> 02:47:41.819 align:start position:0%
yeah so how do we know that stays the
 
02:47:44.929 --> 02:47:44.939 align:start position:0%
goal to re-evaluate every three years if
 
02:47:48.050 --> 02:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
it's not part of the RSA
 
02:47:50.270 --> 02:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
um so the so we have to set out that
 
02:47:51.950 --> 02:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
schedule to the US Department of
 
02:47:53.090 --> 02:47:53.100 align:start position:0%
Education I think that's sort of their
 
02:47:54.889 --> 02:47:54.899 align:start position:0%
expectation some states are on a
 
02:47:57.830 --> 02:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
two-year schedule but Most states in the
 
02:48:00.170 --> 02:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
country are on a three-year schedule and
 
02:48:01.730 --> 02:48:01.740 align:start position:0%
that's what our current approved plan
 
02:48:04.130 --> 02:48:04.140 align:start position:0%
says we had a few amendments that were
 
02:48:05.929 --> 02:48:05.939 align:start position:0%
in the middle of that that created these
 
02:48:08.570 --> 02:48:08.580 align:start position:0%
one-year kind of changes we're back on
 
02:48:10.550 --> 02:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
to that three-year cycle so it's a
 
02:48:12.349 --> 02:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
standard three-year cycle that we kind
 
02:48:14.389 --> 02:48:14.399 align:start position:0%
of match up with nationally
 
02:48:16.309 --> 02:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:48:19.849 --> 02:48:19.859 align:start position:0%
okay is there any objection to moving
 
02:48:21.469 --> 02:48:21.479 align:start position:0%
forward with this amendment with that
 
02:48:23.690 --> 02:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
one change
 
02:48:25.670 --> 02:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
from the committee so it looks like
 
02:48:28.010 --> 02:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
we're good then we'll take action on
 
02:48:30.590 --> 02:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
this when we come back in November
 
02:48:32.450 --> 02:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
and we should be able to move through
 
02:48:34.130 --> 02:48:34.140 align:start position:0%
this and we'll get that one amendment
 
02:48:37.670 --> 02:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:40.670 --> 02:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
alrighty that closes us down there is a
 
02:48:42.110 --> 02:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
meeting starts at one o'clock the
 
02:48:43.610 --> 02:48:43.620 align:start position:0%
teacher shortage
 
02:48:45.830 --> 02:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
committee meeting
 
02:48:49.130 --> 02:48:49.140 align:start position:0%
so that that's I think that's over in
 
02:48:51.770 --> 02:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
the other building no it's a 101
 
02:48:53.750 --> 02:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
downstairs okay
 
02:48:56.210 --> 02:48:56.220 align:start position:0%
thank you very much everybody and
 
02:48:58.670 --> 02:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
enjoy the afternoon thank you very much
