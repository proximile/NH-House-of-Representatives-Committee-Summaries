seconded by represent Pro uh would you
 
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your motion I would
 
00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:24.759 align:start position:0%
thank you um we discussed this uh at
 
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
length over the past few months and I
 
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of concern with our
 
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
police officer still remaining
 
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
physically fit however uh I've been in
 
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 align:start position:0%
law enforcement for over 30 years this
 
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't affect me either way um but
 
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
I was here pre 2001 when this bill went
 
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
into effect and clearly after that
 
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
so it's my understanding the initial
 
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
reason for this bill was to reduce
 
00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 align:start position:0%
injuries on officers however I I've seen
 
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
no evidence that that has done that so
 
00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 align:start position:0%
um some of the reasons why I think that
 
00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
this bill should pass and that should be
 
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.790 align:start position:0%
this bill should pass and that should be
repealed

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.189 align:start position:0%
repealed
is

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 align:start position:0%
um the standard we use is Cooper
 
00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 align:start position:0%
standards so it doesn't really
 
00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 align:start position:0%
differentiate between ages and genders
 
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
for example a 59y old male would have to
 
00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 align:start position:0%
do the mile and a half run six seconds
 
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
slower than an 18-y old female um it's
 
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
an outdated system uh I've spoken with a
 
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
lot of law enforcement officers and
 
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
police Chiefs in my area and most of
 
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
them agree that there should be a
 
00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479 align:start position:0%
different standard however they also
 
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
agree that they should be controlled by
 
00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
the town and not be tied to a
 
00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
certification so one of the biggest
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
problems with this is it's tied to your
 
00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
certification so if you fail this uh
 
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
you're given a second chance on it but
 
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
if if you fail it by 10 seconds on the
 
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
run or a couple of push-ups here and
 
00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 align:start position:0%
there you lose your certification you
 
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
lose your career you can't work in New
 
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire anymore um so a lot of towns
 
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
are of the mindset that they'd like to
 
00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
just have their own standard that the
 
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
department can have and if if you don't
 
00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
pass it it doesn't affect your career or
 
00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:54.350 align:start position:0%
pass it it doesn't affect your career or
your

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120 align:start position:0%
certification another reason why is
 
00:06:58.749 --> 00:06:58.759 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of out ofate um retired
 
00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
offices from Massachusetts new uh in
 
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
Maine and Connecticut that come up here
 
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
to work a second career there's a lot of
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
experience uh that would Ling because
 
00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
they just don't want to come here and
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
have to do that that Physical Agility
 
00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
testing you're not paid to train for
 
00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
this test so while you're out running
 
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
and doing your push-ups and sit-ups
 
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
getting ready for this test you're not
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
being paid to do that in addition if you
 
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
get hurt while you're doing that you're
 
00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:24.199 align:start position:0%
probably not going to get covered by
 
00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:26.199 align:start position:0%
work with comp I've seen examples of
 
00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919 align:start position:0%
that in my career um and then you can't
 
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
pass it test because now you're injured
 
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
so you have to you fail it and you have
 
00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
to wait for your second chance at
 
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
it uh most PDS already have an incentive
 
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
based Physical Agility Test on the towns
 
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
that I've worked for do so if you pass
 
00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
it there's a money stien that you would
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
get for it um but they don't pay that on
 
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
the year that you're required to do it
 
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:49.720 align:start position:0%
this would still be in place if you're
 
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
being hired the standard would still be
 
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
there to get into the academy to
 
00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
graduate from the academy as it was
 
00:07:56.149 --> 00:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
prior to 2001 that will still remain in
 
00:07:57.869 --> 00:07:57.879 align:start position:0%
effect there just won't be a three-year
 
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
requirement for officers to do that
 
00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
um in the 20 plus years we've been doing
 
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
it zero states have adopted our our
 
00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
model there are no other states in the
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
country that do this other than New
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in New Hampshire there's
 
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
only one agency that does and that's the
 
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
police departments we don't require of a
 
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
firefighters or EMTs or any other agency
 
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
just our police offices so um I think
 
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
it's time to help with our
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and retaining Offices here
 
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
and being able to get the best Minds out
 
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
there without having to worry about a
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
Physical Agility test every three years
 
00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:32.599 align:start position:0%
leave it up to the towns let's not make
 
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
a state mandate I so I my I'm going to
 
00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:36.919 align:start position:0%
be voting uh yes on ought to pass on
 
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
this thank you representative um per
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your
 
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
second sure just a little bit uh I did
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
talk to a couple of police Chiefs as
 
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
well and uh they were in favor of this
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
going away because they've lost some
 
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
really good talent and experience
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
because the day of the test someone had
 
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
a injured Ang ankle or something like
 
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
that and and again they failed so they
 
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't and it was going to be too long
 
00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:09.519 align:start position:0%
before their ankle got fixed uh for them
 
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
to take the test again or they had to do
 
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
it in a certain amount of time and it
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
and it just didn't uh so they lost that
 
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519 align:start position:0%
person and again right now uh seems like
 
00:09:20.519 --> 00:09:21.550 align:start position:0%
person and again right now uh seems like
the

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
uh younger population doesn't want to
 
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
come into these jobs so getting uh a
 
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
freshly retired guy from another state
 
00:09:33.069 --> 00:09:33.079 align:start position:0%
with a lot of experience and is willing
 
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
to work it it we have to make that more
 
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:39.160 align:start position:0%
desirable uh the pension system is a
 
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
mess so uh that's a deterrent so we
 
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
don't need any more deterrence like they
 
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
have to um meet this standard that's
 
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
kind of outdated and I agree the town
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
should be making their own um and not
 
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.790 align:start position:0%
should be making their own um and not
the

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
state thank you um I would I would just
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
say that um um for me personally I was
 
00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:03.519 align:start position:0%
originally um on the other side of that
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
I thought that the standard was it was
 
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have a state standard um
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
having said that I I spoke to a number
 
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:12.680 align:start position:0%
of people um it seems that the chiefs of
 
00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
Police Association was kind of split
 
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
50/50 on this as well and I think when
 
00:10:21.389 --> 00:10:21.399 align:start position:0%
in doubt revert to the um to the local
 
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:23.320 align:start position:0%
authorities they know they're hiring
 
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
they know their their standards what
 
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959 align:start position:0%
they need um the local community is
 
00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
still free to set a PT standard um this
 
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
does not take away PT standards it just
 
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
says the state's not going to mandate it
 
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
it's now would be up to the local um
 
00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:40.279 align:start position:0%
departments and the state police to have
 
00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:42.519 align:start position:0%
their own standards and I think that's
 
00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:44.839 align:start position:0%
highly appropriate given as we just
 
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
discussed it is very difficult to fill
 
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
positions within the police department
 
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
now and given these standards and other
 
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
issues it's very tough to get people to
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
come here from another state or even get
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
interested in it in the first place when
 
00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:00.279 align:start position:0%
when they know that every 3 years
 
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
they'll have to take this test
 
00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
regardless of what happens in their life
 
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:07.240 align:start position:0%
um at the state level we don't know
 
00:11:08.829 --> 00:11:08.839 align:start position:0%
what's going on with an individual
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
officer um with regard to his health
 
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:13.480 align:start position:0%
what he's been through um what's
 
00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
happened on the job whereas the local
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
Chief will know okay this guy has been
 
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
involved in some stuff he's he got hurt
 
00:11:22.629 --> 00:11:22.639 align:start position:0%
um they can wave it locally but at the
 
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:24.200 align:start position:0%
state level it becomes more difficult
 
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
and complicated and having it tied to
 
00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.310 align:start position:0%
and complicated and having it tied to
their

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
certification as um representative
 
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
Manion said if they fail they can't work
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
anywhere else in New Hampshire we've
 
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
literally just kicked them out of the
 
00:11:36.269 --> 00:11:36.279 align:start position:0%
state and I don't think that's right I
 
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
think that should be a local decision
 
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
and it should not be tied to their
 
00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:42.519 align:start position:0%
certification and remember it's still
 
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
mandatory Statewide to get into the
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
academy and to graduate from the academy
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
once they get employed full-time at a
 
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
department then it's up to the
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
department what physical fitness
 
00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:56.519 align:start position:0%
standards they choose to use for their
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
um employees and they could even even
 
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
follow a model made by standards and
 
00:12:07.629 --> 00:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:11.519 --> 00:12:13.110 align:start position:0%
 
ahead

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
thank I just have a question with um
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
when someone comes from out of state
 
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
who's say a retired police officer from
 
00:12:23.189 --> 00:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
Connecticut um do they still go to our
 
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
police academy or is there a a license
 
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
um like does a transfer there policing
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
ability I just I just don't understand
 
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
the process I I believe that um they
 
00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
have to take a um if they have
 
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
experience and they've gone to the
 
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
academy I believe they had to take a law
 
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
class on the Hampshire laws but their um
 
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
their training is accepted I believe um
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
train transfer wise they don't have to
 
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
go through the academy
 
00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:50.839 align:start position:0%
again is that correct go ahead that is
 
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:52.600 align:start position:0%
correct but they're still required to do
 
00:12:53.949 --> 00:12:53.959 align:start position:0%
that three-year physical fitness test
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
Academy further questions comments
 
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.710 align:start position:0%
Academy further questions comments
represent

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
wheeler well Mr chairman I appreciate
 
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
what representative Manion and yourself
 
00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
has said I I I think that it's more I
 
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
have more of an inclination rather than
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
when in doubt uh blow up the system to
 
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
say when in doubt leave it alone I think
 
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire's police system right
 
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
now as it stands works well and we heard
 
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
in the subcommittee that I was able to
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
sit on that dealt with this
 
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:35.240 align:start position:0%
bill our system is actually lotted and
 
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me congratulated as heralded
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
across the country as uh better than
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
most because of our standards and I
 
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
think if we get rid of those standards
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
then we risk having police officers that
 
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily able to do the job as
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
hard as it is I think if we want to
 
00:13:58.949 --> 00:13:58.959 align:start position:0%
retain our police officers or increase
 
00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
the Staffing changes which I think is a
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
valid concern then we should pay them
 
00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
more uh young people aren't getting into
 
00:14:08.189 --> 00:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
the workforce in this industry and in a
 
00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:10.759 align:start position:0%
lot of other Industries because of the
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
pay and the cost of living which has
 
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
exponentially increased over the last so
 
00:14:17.949 --> 00:14:17.959 align:start position:0%
many years and I think that we should
 
00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:19.639 align:start position:0%
deal with that issue rather than
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
lowering the standard to try and retain
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
people who wouldn't necessarily be able
 
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
to do the job to their full ability and
 
00:14:30.189 --> 00:14:30.199 align:start position:0%
on the sub committee I thought we had
 
00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:33.519 align:start position:0%
had um some agreement despite
 
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
representative manion's descent and I
 
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
would hope that uh this bipartisan
 
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
effort that happened in subcommittee can
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
continue to happen and that we can vote
 
00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
against the aop pass motion to make
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
another motion so that we can continue
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
to have these good standards that are
 
00:14:51.389 --> 00:14:51.399 align:start position:0%
congratulated Across the Nation as some
 
00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839 align:start position:0%
of the best for police so I will be
 
00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:56.839 align:start position:0%
voting against the aop pass Motion in
 
00:14:58.990 --> 00:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
the hopes of another motion being made
 
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um all all good
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
points I would however say that um it
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
may be lauded and congratulated but it's
 
00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
not emulated no one else has um found it
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
so good that they wanted to do it
 
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
themselves um and also um I I trust our
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
local police Chiefs to decide whether or
 
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
not a person is fit enough in their
 
00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
Community to um continue in the job but
 
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
I think that reasonable Minds can
 
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
disagree um further comment
 
00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.590 align:start position:0%
disagree um further comment
representative

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.430 align:start position:0%
representative
m

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
m
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
so during the initial testimony we heard
 
00:15:34.749 --> 00:15:34.759 align:start position:0%
from uh from uh John skippa uh who's the
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
head of New Hampshire police standards
 
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
and training um one of the things that
 
00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
he told us is basically 95% of the
 
00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:43.759 align:start position:0%
people who take this test pass it uh
 
00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
there aren't a lot of officers uh who
 
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
fail it uh and in the past three years
 
00:15:53.069 --> 00:15:53.079 align:start position:0%
uh there have been 15 officers uh uh in
 
00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
in three years who've actually been uh
 
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
suspended because they can't pass this
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
test you know part of the issue in front
 
00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
of us is you know what we're asking
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
police standards and training to do and
 
00:16:07.069 --> 00:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
and it's actually to create standards
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
and training around things like this
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
requirements for police officers um the
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
requirements uh as as we understand it
 
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
um uh and and I think as uh uh as
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler uh pointed
 
00:16:26.509 --> 00:16:26.519 align:start position:0%
out uh New Hampshire's program and and
 
00:16:28.749 --> 00:16:28.759 align:start position:0%
the fact that that we do this uh is
 
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
something that uh that other states are
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
actually trying to replicate right now
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
um I I also think one of the things that
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
we need to uh that we need to uh to
 
00:16:46.189 --> 00:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
focus a little bit more on uh also is
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
just the fact that the the the there's
 
00:16:51.629 --> 00:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
so much disagreement uh within the New
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Chiefs of police uh themselves
 
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
about this and so what we're doing right
 
00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
now um if we pass the this bill is we're
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
actually taking the most radical step we
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
can which is to eliminate the
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
requirements Al together and I think one
 
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
of the things that director skippa was
 
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
asking us to do was to try to find a way
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
to help them evolve the requirements um
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we talked about
 
00:17:18.429 --> 00:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
in uh in subcommittee was the idea of
 
00:17:21.309 --> 00:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
actually establishing uh for for example
 
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:25.480 align:start position:0%
for someone who is who uh an officer who
 
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
who can't meet the standards because of
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
some type of
 
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
of disability or injury um uh having an
 
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
an alternative way that they could
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
actually complete uh the requirements so
 
00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
for instance participation uh in some
 
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
type of a wellness program that would be
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
approved by police standards and
 
00:17:47.549 --> 00:17:47.559 align:start position:0%
training but but I think I I one of the
 
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
reasons why I'm going to oppose this is
 
00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:52.919 align:start position:0%
because this is a this is a very radical
 
00:17:56.029 --> 00:17:56.039 align:start position:0%
step uh to get rid of something uh
 
00:17:59.070 --> 00:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
altogether when it just seems seems like
 
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
there's so much room to take uh an
 
00:18:04.029 --> 00:18:04.039 align:start position:0%
intermediary step that that actually
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
might achieve both both goals um you
 
00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:09.320 align:start position:0%
know to maintain a certain level of
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
Fitness among New Hampshire uh police
 
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:13.720 align:start position:0%
officers while respecting the fact that
 
00:18:15.149 --> 00:18:15.159 align:start position:0%
yeah some of them are getting older some
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
of them are injured uh it's not as easy
 
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
to do this uh when you're older uh as
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
when you're younger I mean these these
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
are all valid arguments um but I I I
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
just urge caution uh before we just
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
throw this out completely which is what
 
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
this bill would
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
do thank you further questions uh
 
00:18:39.549 --> 00:18:39.559 align:start position:0%
representa PR comments I guess I have a
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
my first question that pops up in my
 
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
head is what states are trying to
 
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
emulate us because I don't know of any
 
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
um I had another one
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
um yeah senior moments I hate those and
 
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
I can't finish but um well now I have to
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
change my vote You just prove that he
 
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
was right and people getting older next
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
down and representative uh
 
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:17.720 align:start position:0%
Khan thank you Mr chairman uh Ser
 
00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
serving as a selectman for 15 years in
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
my town I know that how hard to find or
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
hire a police officer especially the
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
parttime police officer is extremely
 
00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
hard and I was I I didn't have any
 
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
knowledge that we are the last state
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
that holding this
 
00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.470 align:start position:0%
that holding this
rules

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh and also I heard that the town and
 
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
cities will have the responsibility to
 
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
set a standard Mr chairman is is very
 
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
good idea to go this way and I'll vote
 
00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
Yes you know when it comes
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
time thank you for sharing that
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
experience represent f is recall this
 
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:02.200 align:start position:0%
question all right well and I remember
 
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:04.919 align:start position:0%
uh when we were talking to uh director
 
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
Skipper that they had been working on
 
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
changing this um standard for years and
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
nothing has ever come they said they've
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
been working on it nothing ever comes
 
00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
because they understand it's kind of too
 
00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
strict and they've been working on
 
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
trying to fix it but they never do so um
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
this is our chance to fix it
 
00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.870 align:start position:0%
this is our chance to fix it
thank

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
you represent wheeler just thank you Mr
 
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
chairman has director skippa asked the
 
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
committee or the legislature to repeal
 
00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:42.200 align:start position:0%
the standards I I don't think so and I I
 
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
I think that direct to skippa actually
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
probably likes the standards if he
 
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
hasn't asked to repeal them because he
 
00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:49.559 align:start position:0%
does have the leeway to come before us
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
and ask with all due respects if we want
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
to repeal the standards and and and I I
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
think if he wants to work with us to fix
 
00:20:59.630 --> 00:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
the standards he absolutely can I like
 
00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:02.039 align:start position:0%
what representative Muse said I think
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
this is a a far too radical step when we
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
can take an intermediate step to be
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
proactive if we want to be
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
representative Peru and fix these
 
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
standards to a way that would be
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
sufficient to maintain the workforce and
 
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:17.240 align:start position:0%
have physically fit police
 
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
officers well in in all due respect to
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh rep uh to um director skippa he
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh write laws we do and another
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
representative did bring this law
 
00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
forward for us to vote on and consider
 
00:21:34.909 --> 00:21:34.919 align:start position:0%
and there was um there was good reason
 
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:37.240 align:start position:0%
for him to do so so I think that as I
 
00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
said um earlier
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
um like Minds we can disagree on on
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
whether or not this is necessary at the
 
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
state or local level I think we all
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
agree it's level it's necessary at some
 
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
level we just disagree on who should be
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
the one in charge of it and I feel that
 
00:21:56.669 --> 00:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
it should be a local decision based on
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
their knowledge of the people and their
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
Community um having said that um
 
00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
representative Stone thank you Mr chair
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
I like to point out that in 1999 I heard
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
from Lieutenant Skipper at the time who
 
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
said he was working on looking at a new
 
00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
uh testing other than the Cooper
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
standard well as you're aware we're now
 
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
into 2023 and the Cooper standard Still
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
Remains at the police academy I think
 
00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
you also need to put into perspective
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
that in 1999 that the retirement system
 
00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:24.440 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire police was 20
 
00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
years now that has changed to 25 years
 
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
and 55 so what was once thought as a
 
00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:33.400 align:start position:0%
process to go forward to improve our
 
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
police officers kind of got kicked along
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
the way when the retirement got
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
increased where in the area I live in we
 
00:22:41.269 --> 00:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
see a lot of officers that occasionally
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
will end up not doing well with the PT
 
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
standards and they go right over to
 
00:22:46.029 --> 00:22:46.039 align:start position:0%
Vermont where they don't have to do it
 
00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:48.559 align:start position:0%
and they're getting similar pay so from
 
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
a recruitment standard as uh
 
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
representative Manion said we are going
 
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
to be getting a lot of the 55 56 year
 
00:22:56.909 --> 00:22:56.919 align:start position:0%
old police officers that retire from
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
Connecticut or Massachusetts coming to
 
00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire where we have tax you know
 
00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
tax-free income they're going to not go
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
here because of the one reason is they
 
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to take a PT test every 3
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
years as they get to their golden years
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
it's just very uh you know and for a
 
00:23:12.029 --> 00:23:12.039 align:start position:0%
small community they should set their
 
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:14.200 align:start position:0%
standards Nash could set their standards
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester kin clamont Newport each
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
small community should be able to set
 
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
their own standards right now a lot of
 
00:23:20.909 --> 00:23:20.919 align:start position:0%
them have collective bargaining that are
 
00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:22.360 align:start position:0%
in play and this is a part of it where
 
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
they receive a monetary incentive for
 
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
completing the PT test so I think that
 
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be also considered when voting
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
on this issue yeah thank you that is a
 
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
good point collective bargaining does
 
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
play a role in this where um a state
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
level mandate is difficult um you have
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
to Collective bargain around it kind of
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
um versus with it so it's it's
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
definitely there's definitely pluses and
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
minuses on both sides and um I trust
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
everyone will make their own decision
 
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
based on their their knowledge and
 
00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:52.919 align:start position:0%
experience and what they've heard with
 
00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:55.559 align:start position:0%
that um I will ask the clerk to call the
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
role the motion on the floor is ought to
 
00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.630 align:start position:0%
role the motion on the floor is ought to
pass

00:23:59.630 --> 00:23:59.640 align:start position:0%

tomorrow and with that the executive
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
session on
 
00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.909 align:start position:0%
session on
hb13

00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
sir uh parliamentary question after uh
 
00:26:57.669 --> 00:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
UT to pass failed why was itl necessary
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
if it failed
 
00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
also um so that yeah someone could have
 
00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
changed their mind you're when one
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
motion fails it's open automatically to
 
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
further motions and the other only other
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
motion available was
 
00:27:14.389 --> 00:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
that um I think the point of your
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
question is why do it if we knew the
 
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
outcome I think uh yeah it's it's just
 
00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
the way it works anyway the um executive
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
session on HB 1113 is closed and I'm
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%

Stone Mr chair I would uh currently
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
under state law there's an analment
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
process that would address the issues
 
00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
brought forth in this uh this house bill
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh under that it has jurisdiction over
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
state level offenses uh likewise if the
 
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
intent was to try to have a jurisdiction
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
over Federal felonies that wouldn't be
 
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
applicable to us therefore uh majority
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
of the committee felt itl was an
 
00:28:07.039 --> 00:28:08.070 align:start position:0%
of the committee felt itl was an
appropriate

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:09.880 align:start position:0%

second

00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
Representative no I think he wrapped
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
that up quite nicely indeed um I would
 
00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
add to that I just um the with with all
 
00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
that's going on in our society in our
 
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
debate back and forth uh on gun laws and
 
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
gun safety um I I am happy to to see
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
that this committee will not be
 
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
supporting returning Firearms to felons
 
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.880 align:start position:0%

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
to even be considering um so with that
 
00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:40.840 align:start position:0%

end so we're going to go right on to to

Cannabis
 
00:30:17.549 --> 00:30:17.559 align:start position:0%
yes um I moved to

second would you like to speak to your
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
motion yeah somewhat um
 
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:31.240 align:start position:0%
we believe that um this would be in
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
violation um of federal laws because
 
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
there are folks that um are under
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%
Housing Authority which is part of the
 
00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
federal government and so they we they
 
00:30:45.549 --> 00:30:45.559 align:start position:0%
would be in violation period with
 
00:30:49.509 --> 00:30:49.519 align:start position:0%
federal laws by um allowing cultivations
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
in um their apartments or their
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
homes thank you um I think you said that
 
00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
well I I agree that um we we we are
 
00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:03.039 align:start position:0%
struggling to pass a comprehensive
 
00:31:05.909 --> 00:31:05.919 align:start position:0%
cannabis um position in this state and I
 
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
don't think nibbling at it from the
 
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
sides this way is appropriate it's going
 
00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
to have unintended consequences such as
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
what you listed um potentially people
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
losing their homes that are federally um
 
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
subsidized and we have a hard enough
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
problem finding homes for everyone in
 
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
this state and we don't need to be doing
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
anything that could shrink them further
 
00:31:26.269 --> 00:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
comment seeing none I'll ask the clerk
 
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:29.480 align:start position:0%

a motion of itl on House Bill 470 is
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
there a second I'll second that seconded
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
by representative Reed would you like to

thank you Mr chair uh I was on the fence
 
00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
with this originally I was a chair of
 
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee uh however speaking
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
with law enforce fellow colleagues and
 
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
constituents uh I am moving forward
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
again with the with the itl motion House
 
00:33:37.269 --> 00:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
Bill 287 uh the Fentanyl and xylazine
 
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
test drift was just signed into law by
 
00:33:40.669 --> 00:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
the governor I think that's a great
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
start let's see what we can get from
 
00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
statistics based off of that and then
 
00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
move forward possibly with this bill in
 
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
the next session or
 
00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:51.320 align:start position:0%
so thank you would you like to speak to
 
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
your second representa re yes um states
 
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
that have enacted similar laws such as
 
00:33:59.909 --> 00:33:59.919 align:start position:0%
Oregon have started to withdraw a work
 
00:34:02.909 --> 00:34:02.919 align:start position:0%
on repealing their um laws because they
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
are failing in the cities that rolled
 
00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
them out thank you do you have any
 
00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
information as to why or or any more
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
anything other than that um overto it
 
00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
didn't it hasn't reduced um overdose
 
00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
deaths actually overdose deaths have
 
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
increased and um it has not reduced the
 
00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
number of people who are suffering from
 
00:34:28.349 --> 00:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
substance misuse disorder um it has um
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
affected the quality of life in the
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
communities in which um these laws are
 
00:34:37.069 --> 00:34:37.079 align:start position:0%
act enacted um and it has just not been
 
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
successful on any
 
00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
level representative
 
00:34:45.869 --> 00:34:45.879 align:start position:0%
Muse yes um I'll be opposing the itl and
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
I have to say I'm a little bit surprised
 
00:34:50.349 --> 00:34:50.359 align:start position:0%
because in our subcommittee we actually
 
00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:52.919 align:start position:0%
voted out to pass uh with Amendment on
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
this uh so the fact that we're facing an
 
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
itl vote is a little bit of an
 
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
unpleasant surprise this morning um but
 
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I I I do want to
 
00:35:04.109 --> 00:35:04.119 align:start position:0%
point out are the the rationale for
 
00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
putting uh putting this bill forward so
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
the currently the situation that we're
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
in in New Hampshire is every time some
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
type of new drug checking technology
 
00:35:16.109 --> 00:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
comes out like a fentanyl test strip or
 
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
xylazine test strips the position
 
00:35:20.349 --> 00:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
position we're in right now is we
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
actually have to change our statute to
 
00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:25.880 align:start position:0%
uh to accommodate that so one of the
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
things that that this bill and the
 
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
amendment that we prepared to this bill
 
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
would would do is actually get us out of
 
00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:33.640 align:start position:0%
that situation it would also get us out
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
of a similar situation with no lockone
 
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
um n lockone right now is the only
 
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
opioid reversal agent that's actually
 
00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
approved in statute for use in New
 
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there are a series of new
 
00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:49.079 align:start position:0%
opioid reversal a agents that are coming
 
00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh into the market now and that have
 
00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
been tested uh that have been shown to
 
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
be more effective on car Fentanyl and
 
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
Fentanyl so so one of the things that is
 
00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%
such a challenge with the opioid
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
epidemic right now is to is to stay
 
00:36:07.069 --> 00:36:07.079 align:start position:0%
ahead of it um and I think law
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement has done uh a a very good
 
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
job in in reducing the flow as much as
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
they can uh but as hard as the folks in
 
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
law enforcement work and as much as the
 
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
rest of us hope that this problem would
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
just go away we remain in a
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
situation where dozens of people
 
00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
continue to die from overdoses uh in New
 
00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:30.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and not only are people dying
 
00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:30.910 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and not only are people dying
from

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:36:34.109 --> 00:36:34.119 align:start position:0%
overdoses um because a lot of the
 
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
chemicals uh that are in the pills and
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
in the powders uh that people buy on the
 
00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:41.480 align:start position:0%
street uh don't necessarily contain the
 
00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839 align:start position:0%
drug that people think they're buying a
 
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
lot of times folks are in a situation
 
00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
where they're taking something they
 
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely um have no idea they're
 
00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
putting into their body so that that's
 
00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
the situation uh that we learned about
 
00:36:57.790 --> 00:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
earlier in the year uh with xylazine
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
um and currently there's a similar
 
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
situation in the New Hampshire drug
 
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
Supply with uh
 
00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:07.839 align:start position:0%
benzodiazapine uh as well as l lol so
 
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
both of those drugs are basically being
 
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
used by drug manufacturers they they can
 
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
uh increase uh the temporary high from
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
drugs uh like like cocaine and like
 
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
opioids you know unfortunately um one of
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
the things that benzo dipine uh uh can
 
00:37:28.309 --> 00:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
also do uh is it can lead to uh the same
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
sort of sores the same sort of uh um uh
 
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:35.560 align:start position:0%
injuries that um that doctors are seeing
 
00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:36.839 align:start position:0%
uh with the use of
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
xylazine so the the problem that we
 
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
we're running into is that this is um a
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
whack-a-mole situation um these new
 
00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:50.200 align:start position:0%
adulterants and contaminants are coming
 
00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:53.240 align:start position:0%
up um faster than we can detect them and
 
00:37:54.829 --> 00:37:54.839 align:start position:0%
one of the advantages of having a
 
00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
broader more robust uh drug checking
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
program is we actually able to collect
 
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
more data about when and where these new
 
00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
contaminants and adulterants are coming
 
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
into the market so States uh States like
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that have a more robust
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
drug checking program they know when
 
00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
these contaminants are coming into
 
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
places like LOL and Lawrence they know
 
00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
where they're coming in they know who's
 
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
buying them and what it does is it puts
 
00:38:26.589 --> 00:38:26.599 align:start position:0%
law enforcement in a situation where
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
they're more informed they know what's
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
happening on the street they know they
 
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
know that there's something out there
 
00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
dangerous in addition to these drugs
 
00:38:34.349 --> 00:38:34.359 align:start position:0%
this is how we kind of got into the
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
fenal mess in the first place there so
 
00:38:38.109 --> 00:38:38.119 align:start position:0%
many people thought they were taking
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
regular opioids and what they what they
 
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
wound up taking were opioids Lac with
 
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
fenel or pure
 
00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:48.079 align:start position:0%
fenel so what we're what we're trying to
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
do here isn't to get in the way of law
 
00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement doing its job what we're
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
trying to do is we're trying to do um
 
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
something that a lot of times isn't in
 
00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
our power as legislators we're actually
 
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
trying to save lives and bills like this
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
will save lives they put us in a better
 
00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
situation in the future um when it comes
 
00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
uh to uh accommodating new technologies
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
um that can detect some of these drugs
 
00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
and new contaminant more efficiently and
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
effectively and uh and and and it gives
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know people in the harm reduction
 
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
Community some of the ammunition that
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
they need to do their jobs right now
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
we've we're in a situation where we've
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
legalized fentanyl test strips but we
 
00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
haven't necessarily made it legal for
 
00:39:42.109 --> 00:39:42.119 align:start position:0%
the for people who might be giving
 
00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
fental test strips to people to actually
 
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
possess those fentanyl test strips and
 
00:39:48.589 --> 00:39:48.599 align:start position:0%
the minor amount of drugs that may be on
 
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
those fentanyl test strips so under our
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
current law it's actually conceivable uh
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
for a person who's actually handing out
 
00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
these these uh test strips as part of a
 
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
of a of a drug checking exercise if
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
those if those test strips are actually
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh used and left with them um they can
 
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
actually be charged with a crime so
 
00:40:10.349 --> 00:40:10.359 align:start position:0%
there there are just a bunch of things
 
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
that we need to do other than say
 
00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test strips and xylazine test
 
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
strips are okay there's work that needs
 
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
to take place in the statute and this
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we prepared to this
 
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
bill actually accommodates a lot of that
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
and what it also did and and what it
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
what it would do is it it it it it
 
00:40:34.589 --> 00:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
acknowledges the concerns of law
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh so originally the the uh
 
00:40:40.349 --> 00:40:40.359 align:start position:0%
the bill uh would have simply crossed
 
00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
out testing and analyzing equipment from
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
the drug paraphernalia statute so one of
 
00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
the things that we heard from law
 
00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement is GE don't do that because
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
testing and analyzing equipment is also
 
00:40:54.309 --> 00:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
used in manufacturer distribution um and
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
compounding of some of these drugs so we
 
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to give drug manufacturers a
 
00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
license to use this equipment and and
 
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely perfectly fair so what
 
00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
we've done is we've left that part of
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
the statute intact and we've created a
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
specific exemption just for drug
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
checking equipment like these test
 
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
strips that's that's basically what this
 
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
bill uh what this bill is doing is we're
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
creating a a a a clear uh a clear
 
00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
exemption that does not get in the way
 
00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
of law enforcement from enforce
 
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
enforcing this law and
 
00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
um while we can always submit a bill
 
00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
like this in the next session I think
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
that there are probably several hundred
 
00:41:39.309 --> 00:41:39.319 align:start position:0%
people out there uh who may not be with
 
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
us by the time we might get around
 
00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:43.160 align:start position:0%
passing this bill who might be with us
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
if we actually passed it so there is a
 
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
cost to not passing a bill like this and
 
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
and I would ask my fellow committee
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
members to think long and hard above
 
00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
that cost in the middle of of a fental
 
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
epidemic thank you thank you further
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
representative I'd like to ask the
 
00:42:11.589 --> 00:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
question of the subcommittee um what
 
00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:15.160 align:start position:0%
harm does this bill do as amended by as
 
00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
representative musees said does this
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
bill do any harm would member of the
 
00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
that it really doesn't um it doesn't
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
thank you um it doesn't
 
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
um um pan out it doesn't offer uh the
 
00:42:37.549 --> 00:42:37.559 align:start position:0%
positives that it appears so um you know
 
00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
when you test the drugs um it it's
 
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't lower the overdose um deaths it
 
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't discourage people from even
 
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
starting you your their Journey on
 
00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:53.000 align:start position:0%
substance misuse um we did hear from a
 
00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
former um drug dealer who is now
 
00:42:58.349 --> 00:42:58.359 align:start position:0%
performed and he said that he feels that
 
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
this is this kind of um law is enabling
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
um it's really not um it's not as as
 
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
wonderful as it appears to be thank you
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
I would um I would say that um I I I'm
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
for harm reduction the part of this that
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
I cannot get by is that it legalizes or
 
00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
appears to legalize the possession of a
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
nominal amount of drugs well we look at
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
the definition of normal amount and it
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
says 10 Mig of a substance 2 mg of
 
00:43:34.309 --> 00:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
fentanyl is a lethal dose so this would
 
00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
allow someone to carry five lethal doses
 
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
of fentanyl to go have it tested um so
 
00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
that that's that's my concern um and
 
00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:44.440 align:start position:0%
that's the concern I believe of law
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement that um and we're sending a
 
00:43:50.589 --> 00:43:50.599 align:start position:0%
message also that we're condoning this
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
when we should not be um but we just
 
00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
passed the test strip bill I I would I'd
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
like to see how that works before we
 
00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
pass a second one um I believe let's see
 
00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
who I wrote down who's in order here
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative nle is
 
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
first thank you Mr chair um I just
 
00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to well first of all um I was the
 
00:44:15.069 --> 00:44:15.079 align:start position:0%
sponsor of 287 that is passed um was
 
00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
signed into law in October um and when
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
we passed that uh through this committee
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
it was for testing and analyzing to to
 
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
strike testing and analyzing by the
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
time excuse me by the the time it got to
 
00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
the Senate and in that uh Committee
 
00:44:34.349 --> 00:44:34.359 align:start position:0%
hearing um the idea was to restrict it
 
00:44:38.549 --> 00:44:38.559 align:start position:0%
only to fenel uh test strips which it's
 
00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
something um but what happened in that
 
00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
moment we were very lucky um that one of
 
00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
our uh local ad uh Advocates and and
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
someone who actually works in harm
 
00:44:48.589 --> 00:44:48.599 align:start position:0%
reduction New Hampshire harm reduction
 
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
Coalition was able to uh I believe it
 
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
was that morning the first batch of
 
00:44:56.829 --> 00:44:56.839 align:start position:0%
xylazine test strips were available and
 
00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
were delivered to them and she was able
 
00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:01.160 align:start position:0%
to bring that so that that that could be
 
00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:03.640 align:start position:0%
added in um that was something that had
 
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
just kind of come up on the scene the
 
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
reason why I'm I'm talking about this is
 
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
to kind of uh bolster representative
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
Muse's point that we need to be flexible
 
00:45:14.309 --> 00:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
because we can't always be in that
 
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
moment where we're bringing in um you
 
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
know last minute oh well we have these
 
00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:21.880 align:start position:0%
now so we need to add those in there um
 
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
these certainly aren't the only things
 
00:45:26.109 --> 00:45:26.119 align:start position:0%
uh that are are showing up in our drug
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
Supply and also um to know to what
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
extent is extremely important fenel is
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
virtually Ubi ubiquit is right now so if
 
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
someone test positive for it there's
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
value in knowing how much um the other
 
00:45:43.549 --> 00:45:43.559 align:start position:0%
thing that I wanted to bring up just to
 
00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:45.800 align:start position:0%
really quickly actually is is um when we
 
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839 align:start position:0%
talk about a nom nominal amount I really
 
00:45:50.109 --> 00:45:50.119 align:start position:0%
wish that we could uh use the language
 
00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
that was intally uh initially used in uh
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts what that is is residual
 
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
amount but they spef speci ified it more
 
00:45:58.750 --> 00:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
clearly uh because they wanted to know
 
00:46:01.309 --> 00:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
it so clearly but but to me not only you
 
00:46:03.309 --> 00:46:03.319 align:start position:0%
know the very small scoop that you
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
really uh you know as representative
 
00:46:08.109 --> 00:46:08.119 align:start position:0%
selig over here needed some my to borrow
 
00:46:10.549 --> 00:46:10.559 align:start position:0%
my glasses to see to actually see an
 
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
indent in this thing it is a very small
 
00:46:16.349 --> 00:46:16.359 align:start position:0%
amount but really um to visualize it for
 
00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
myself I think the idea of saying
 
00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
residuals it is literally what is left
 
00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
in the bag when everything else is gone
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
you know um so especially when we use
 
00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
evidence uh you know like what Oregon uh
 
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
I think it's initiative 110 that is
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
legalizing up to a gram of heroin for
 
00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
example that is a hundred times what we
 
00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
are talking about here so you know if we
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
want to to talk about the evidence and
 
00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
and you know what draw conclusions from
 
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
it um I would number one probably give
 
00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
it more than a year and then uh number
 
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
two uh I would compare apples to apples
 
00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
and that's just not it's just not the
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
same thing um so I I would hope that we
 
00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:02.680 align:start position:0%
could come together around the amendment
 
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
um that was very thoughtful and very
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
responsive and what I felt was a
 
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
wonderful compromise uh taking all the
 
00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:10.839 align:start position:0%
input into consideration I I I really
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
wish we could uh pass it with the
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
amendment and to answer your question
 
00:47:16.109 --> 00:47:16.119 align:start position:0%
representative scitec as a member of the
 
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh subcommittee no I don't think it does
 
00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.390 align:start position:0%
uh subcommittee no I don't think it does
any

00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:19.400 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
harm if you could um I'd like to ask you
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
can you add you you kind of touched on
 
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
my concern
 
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
regarding um nominal but we talked about
 
00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:32.559 align:start position:0%
you know what you can see and what it
 
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
looks like and how tiny that is that's
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
really irrelevant when we get into
 
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
chemical compounds 10 milligrams is
 
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
undebatably enough to kill five people
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
um so why is that level been set at 10
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
milligrams right representative Muse if
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
you want whoever feels best get is okay
 
00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
so the so 10 Mill milligrams if you you
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
look at the uh Centers for Disease
 
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
Control they actually have publication
 
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
uh on drug checking um uh 10 milligrams
 
00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:07.480 align:start position:0%
is the recommended amount um and and
 
00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:09.640 align:start position:0%
part of that is just a a practical
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
consideration um 10 milligrams of any
 
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
material especially a powder um you're
 
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
talking an extremely small amount um uh
 
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
and so for example I saw a brochure by a
 
00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
har reduction group in New York that
 
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
basically said it's about the equivalent
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
if you took if you took had enough
 
00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
powder to spread on Abraham Lincoln's uh
 
00:48:35.069 --> 00:48:35.079 align:start position:0%
head on a penny that would be about how
 
00:48:37.829 --> 00:48:37.839 align:start position:0%
much chemical we're talking about so
 
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
when you when you when you realize that
 
00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:42.839 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a chemical that's
 
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
going to be uh probably transported in a
 
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
in a plastic bag or in a pill bottle or
 
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
or or something like that it's we're
 
00:48:56.349 --> 00:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
talking an extremely small amount um uh
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
is 10 milligrams of certain drugs more
 
00:49:02.109 --> 00:49:02.119 align:start position:0%
than enough to kill you yes it is but
 
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
part of part of the issue is you need
 
00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
also to be a to to actually save lives
 
00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:11.480 align:start position:0%
um people actually need to be able to uh
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh to be able to to have enough material
 
00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:17.839 align:start position:0%
to actually do uh a legitimate test they
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
have to be able to see it um they have
 
00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
to be able to handle it they actually
 
00:49:24.549 --> 00:49:24.559 align:start position:0%
have to be able to to do the test so
 
00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit of the the drug
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
manufacturers make it a lot easier um if
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
they package their stuff up in in much
 
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
lower concentrations but they don't seem
 
00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
be to be cooperating and doing it so the
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
choice that we're left with is either we
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
have language like this in the bill um
 
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh or we we kill the bill and and we
 
00:49:49.069 --> 00:49:49.079 align:start position:0%
lose an opportunity uh to save lives
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
that we could be we could be saving um
 
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
you know this is this is is extremely
 
00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
frustrating uh because I think on this
 
00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:03.400 align:start position:0%
committee um more than any other
 
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
Committee in the house we hear testimony
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
around the impact of the drug problem in
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and um and I I really
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
think that here we have an opportunity
 
00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
um to save lives and we you know a lot
 
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
of times we have the opportunity to
 
00:50:23.309 --> 00:50:23.319 align:start position:0%
punish people more to punish people less
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
but here we actually have an opportun
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
to make to make a difference that could
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
make a huge difference to a lot of New
 
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.630 align:start position:0%
make a huge difference to a lot of New
Hampshire

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:33.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
families thank you um for our members of
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee I have a question did
 
00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
anyone um come in to testify and say
 
00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
that you know I I utilized this testing
 
00:50:47.549 --> 00:50:47.559 align:start position:0%
before and it saved my life did did we
 
00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:49.720 align:start position:0%
hear any actual anyone actually even
 
00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
saved that we know of Representative um
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
um just a we we it's not legal here well
 
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
so no one in New Hampshire would be
 
00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
coming in to speak on their experience
 
00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire since it's just not a a
 
00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
possibility considering we would be
 
00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
wanting to pass it I would think that
 
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
someone from out of state who who was
 
00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
interested in it would come testify that
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
it's working great or at least working
 
00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:19.559 align:start position:0%
siling thank you so I I just want to
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
address a couple of the things that that
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
have been brought up so first of all
 
00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:25.720 align:start position:0%
with Oregon Oregon voted to legalize or
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
decriminalize a huge number of of drugs
 
00:51:30.349 --> 00:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
that are not legal in New Hampshire so
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
it's really a non seiter right and and
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
they aren't writing laws to take away
 
00:51:37.589 --> 00:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
their testing they're working on trying
 
00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:39.640 align:start position:0%
to repeal some of their legalization
 
00:51:41.309 --> 00:51:41.319 align:start position:0%
initiatives I believe and I'm not fully
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
clear but again it's irrelevant to what
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
we're doing here um I share
 
00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
representative Muse's frustration
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
because we worked very hard in in
 
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to take the concerns that
 
00:51:56.349 --> 00:51:56.359 align:start position:0%
we heard from the initial bill about the
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
risks of it breaking laws and people
 
00:51:59.950 --> 00:51:59.960 align:start position:0%
having access and again I brought my
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
little scoop because I was so teeny I
 
00:52:05.069 --> 00:52:05.079 align:start position:0%
couldn't believe it um but understanding
 
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
um from a scientific perspective you
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
need a certain amount of material in
 
00:52:11.549 --> 00:52:11.559 align:start position:0%
order to run a lab test to distinguish
 
00:52:13.549 --> 00:52:13.559 align:start position:0%
things it's kind of like when you take
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
your coid test you know it's not just
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
like stick the swab in your nose and
 
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
take it out you have to like actually
 
00:52:21.549 --> 00:52:21.559 align:start position:0%
move it around to get enough sample for
 
00:52:23.309 --> 00:52:23.319 align:start position:0%
those tests to work you have to have a
 
00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:25.640 align:start position:0%
sufficient amount of material to make a
 
00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
drug test work um but in the last few
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
weeks I've been reading a lot in the
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
papers about how um just two days ago uh
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
the New York Times had an article about
 
00:52:36.829 --> 00:52:36.839 align:start position:0%
how a number of drug dealers have been
 
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
deliberately using um adding things like
 
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
meth which is not currently covered by
 
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
xylazine strips or feny strips into
 
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
their drug supply for the goal of
 
00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:49.839 align:start position:0%
getting people dual addicted right
 
00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
without people realizing that's what's
 
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
in their drugs the kinds of testing that
 
00:52:55.950 --> 00:52:55.960 align:start position:0%
could happen as a result result of the
 
00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
amended version of this bill would allow
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
someone to have their drug Supply tested
 
00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
for things like that to make sure
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
they're not being done things I will say
 
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
personally if a drug dealer wanted to
 
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
expend the $60,000 to have the kind of
 
00:53:12.069 --> 00:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
lab equipment necessary to do the type
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
of drug testing that we're hoping to
 
00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
legalize to make sure that what they're
 
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
selling is cleaner and purer I I
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't personally have a problem with
 
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:21.880 align:start position:0%
them doing things to make their supply
 
00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:24.200 align:start position:0%
safer um because my goal is for people
 
00:53:25.789 --> 00:53:25.799 align:start position:0%
to live long enough to make the decision
 
00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
to get themselves clean and I I think
 
00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
that one of the things that we really
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
tried to focus on and I know that
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative Muse and N were doing a
 
00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of research on to to
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
ensure was looking at ways to to take
 
00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:43.640 align:start position:0%
the harm reduction part of this as the
 
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
primary focus not decriminalizing
 
00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:47.240 align:start position:0%
anything it's not saying that people
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
should be able to go out and sell
 
00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
spoonfuls of cocaine you know or or
 
00:53:53.789 --> 00:53:53.799 align:start position:0%
anything else for that matter spoonfuls
 
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
of fentanyl it's saying we want to make
 
00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
places that do drug testing be able to
 
00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:01.240 align:start position:0%
do the drug testing to protect our
 
00:54:03.309 --> 00:54:03.319 align:start position:0%
citizens the other thing is there was a
 
00:54:06.069 --> 00:54:06.079 align:start position:0%
story yesterday I believe it was on um
 
00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Public Radio about the
 
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
autopsies in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
and the fact that we don't have enough
 
00:54:16.349 --> 00:54:16.359 align:start position:0%
people who are able to perform autopsies
 
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
so that we are only having autopsies on
 
00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:23.480 align:start position:0%
600 of the overdose deaths a year and
 
00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:25.480 align:start position:0%
that's not even necessarily all that's
 
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
they're not even all people who overdose
 
00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:29.240 align:start position:0%
they're only 600 autopsies being
 
00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
performed per year in New Hampshire
 
00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
which is a lot lower than the death rate
 
00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
which means there's a lot of people who
 
00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:37.960 align:start position:0%
are dying from suspected overdose where
 
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
we don't know what it is they've
 
00:54:41.829 --> 00:54:41.839 align:start position:0%
overdosed from and we did hear specific
 
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
testimony during our subcommittee that
 
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
fenel was in our state probably for 20
 
00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:48.280 align:start position:0%
years before we got fenel test strips
 
00:54:50.549 --> 00:54:50.559 align:start position:0%
legalized if we could have identified
 
00:54:54.109 --> 00:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
fenel 20 years ago we might have stopped
 
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
a huge number number of people from
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
dying we might have gotten a lot more
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
people to work to get themselves cleaner
 
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
sooner so I just want us to really think
 
00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
about um I I I wish the person who
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
brought forward the itl motion would
 
00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
withdraw it that we could vote for this
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
amendment because the amendment really
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
takes into consideration those legal
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
concerns the law concerns it really
 
00:55:18.789 --> 00:55:18.799 align:start position:0%
worked very hard to be very specific
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
that it is purely for the purpose of
 
00:55:23.589 --> 00:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
testing drugs to ensure that people
 
00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:25.839 align:start position:0%
aren't going to die
 
00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:31.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um just a second um
 
00:55:34.029 --> 00:55:34.039 align:start position:0%
I just want to be clear the it sounds
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
like we're saying that testing isn't
 
00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
won't be done if we don't pass this
 
00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
however I'm quite sure that every single
 
00:55:45.309 --> 00:55:45.319 align:start position:0%
arrest the police make the substances
 
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
are being sent to the lab and tested so
 
00:55:50.309 --> 00:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
we know what's in our supply um on a
 
00:55:50.319 --> 00:55:51.789 align:start position:0%
we know what's in our supply um on a
daily

00:55:51.789 --> 00:55:51.799 align:start position:0%
daily
 
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
basis um so at least as far as as far as
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
the people who are being arrested we
 
00:55:58.270 --> 00:55:58.280 align:start position:0%
know what the substances are that they
 
00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
have represent we we heard testimony
 
00:56:02.029 --> 00:56:02.039 align:start position:0%
that contradicted that when they when
 
00:56:03.549 --> 00:56:03.559 align:start position:0%
they prosecute someone though they have
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
to be able to tell them what the
 
00:56:04.799 --> 00:56:05.950 align:start position:0%
to be able to tell them what the
substance

00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
substance
 
00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:08.390 align:start position:0%
substance
is

00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
zus sorry one of the things that uh uh
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
Lauren McGinley with the New Hampshire
 
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:14.799 align:start position:0%
harm reduction Coalition told us we
 
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
asked her specifically about that issue
 
00:56:19.870 --> 00:56:19.880 align:start position:0%
um and she said sometimes that testing
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen for
 
00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
months um so the advantage the advantage
 
00:56:27.789 --> 00:56:27.799 align:start position:0%
of of of of drug checking and and having
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
folks in the harm reduction Community
 
00:56:32.829 --> 00:56:32.839 align:start position:0%
actually empowered to do it is that
 
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:35.720 align:start position:0%
information is almost real time you know
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
you you you understand that a new
 
00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
contaminant or or some type of an
 
00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
adulterant has has entered into the
 
00:56:45.789 --> 00:56:45.799 align:start position:0%
supply um maybe not as soon as it
 
00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
happens but very very quickly afterwards
 
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
as opposed to you know waiting on a
 
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
State Police lab and I think if the
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
state police were here they would
 
00:56:57.069 --> 00:56:57.079 align:start position:0%
probably tell you you that um their
 
00:56:59.589 --> 00:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
their processing um is nowhere near
 
00:57:02.589 --> 00:57:02.599 align:start position:0%
close to real time um because they're
 
00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
under the same kind of budget
 
00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
constraints and timing constraints I
 
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
think that so many people in law
 
00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
enforcement are under um so was there
 
00:57:12.589 --> 00:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
testimony to that effect from the law
 
00:57:14.829 --> 00:57:14.839 align:start position:0%
enforcement there was test um I'm sorry
 
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
that was testimony from Miss McGinley um
 
00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:19.240 align:start position:0%
did law enforcement testify at this at
 
00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee representative
 
00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:23.720 align:start position:0%
tanzar uh no and just to clarify
 
00:57:25.789 --> 00:57:25.799 align:start position:0%
representative MERS to two separate Labs
 
00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
the state police crime lab and also
 
00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:29.960 align:start position:0%
whatever lab the New Hampshire harm
 
00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:31.880 align:start position:0%
reduction uses there's not there's a
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
disconnect they don't talk to each other
 
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
so yes chairman State Police knows
 
00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
what's in the system but the harm
 
00:57:38.190 --> 00:57:38.200 align:start position:0%
reduction might not and then they don't
 
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
talk to each other so that's where again
 
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
is is a disconnect I hope that
 
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
clarified um representative
 
00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:46.910 align:start position:0%
clarified um representative
PR

00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
PR
 
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
so two things it was my my impression
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
that they were only testing to see if it
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
was an illegal drug they weren't t
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
testing to see all the other kinds of
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
stuff that were in it but I could be
 
00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
wrong the other thing that we heard we
 
00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
went out or I did anyway went out to the
 
00:58:08.069 --> 00:58:08.079 align:start position:0%
mobile van that hands out the test
 
00:58:11.029 --> 00:58:11.039 align:start position:0%
strips uh clean needles bandaging
 
00:58:15.390 --> 00:58:15.400 align:start position:0%
material and all that stuff and asked do
 
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
people actually use these test strips
 
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
and and how does that play out and we
 
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
were told that some use the test strips
 
00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
and if there things in there that they
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
don't like they actually toss that whole
 
00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:30.680 align:start position:0%
bag of drugs because they just don't
 
00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
want it and they go look somewhere else
 
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
to find a cleaner set of drugs yes I
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
know it's kind of
 
00:58:41.029 --> 00:58:41.039 align:start position:0%
enabling but I think you're saving lives
 
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
at the same time and again hopefully we
 
00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
can get better programs that encourage
 
00:58:49.029 --> 00:58:49.039 align:start position:0%
them to go get clean uh but at least
 
00:58:51.309 --> 00:58:51.319 align:start position:0%
they'll be alive to do that and may not
 
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
have those other consequences that go
 
00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:01.799 align:start position:0%
with um xylene and the the new one
 
00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh that are causing them sores and other
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
side effects and maybe even overdosing
 
00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:09.109 align:start position:0%
side effects and maybe even overdosing
them

00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
so I'll tell you I'm really in a quandry
 
00:59:13.710 --> 00:59:13.720 align:start position:0%
because I'm sitting right on that
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
fence because I don't want to enable
 
00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
anybody but I hate to see people die
 
00:59:20.349 --> 00:59:20.359 align:start position:0%
because I get to see that in the street
 
00:59:22.990 --> 00:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
quite enough and I'm all set with that
 
00:59:25.950 --> 00:59:25.960 align:start position:0%
um so if this can save a few lives I I I
 
00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
think I'm going to pass
 
00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
it representative Stone thank you Mr
 
00:59:34.829 --> 00:59:34.839 align:start position:0%
chair I see this as partly being a
 
00:59:37.029 --> 00:59:37.039 align:start position:0%
problematic for law enforcement to deal
 
00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
with as well um with law enforcement you
 
00:59:42.670 --> 00:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
would be looking at uh having discretion
 
00:59:44.109 --> 00:59:44.119 align:start position:0%
at the the street level you'd have
 
00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:45.839 align:start position:0%
discretion at the prosecutor level as
 
00:59:48.029 --> 00:59:48.039 align:start position:0%
well I haven't seen anything that says
 
00:59:49.589 --> 00:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
that a prosecutor has to bring a case
 
00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
forward if they they feel there's
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
competing harms issues I think this is
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
opening a gateway to possibly more of an
 
00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
issue for hindering of law enforcement
 
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
and saving lives through that
 
01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:04.280 align:start position:0%
mechanism thank you
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
um Can someone tell me that the law that
 
01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
was just signed by the governor what
 
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
does that allow
 
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
represent so the uh HB 287 what it does
 
01:00:18.309 --> 01:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
is it literally uh makes an exemption
 
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
for feny and xylazine test strips and uh
 
01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
that is yeah so that's that's all was
 
01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
what we did was we struck the words they
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to make it much more specific and
 
01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:31.640 align:start position:0%
so that was their uh compromise in
 
01:00:34.029 --> 01:00:34.039 align:start position:0%
passing the bill okay so representative
 
01:00:36.589 --> 01:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
Pro to your question the strips you saw
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
working in saving lives uh currently we
 
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
the governor just signed that into law
 
01:00:43.950 --> 01:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
that we passed in this Committee just
 
01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
months ago this is a whole new one that
 
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to be discussing and when I
 
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
was talking to those people in the van
 
01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
they said that having a full spectrum
 
01:00:58.870 --> 01:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
test would be more beneficial because
 
01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
new and exciting things apparently are
 
01:01:04.029 --> 01:01:04.039 align:start position:0%
coming and the only way they can do that
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
is by you not just with a test strip but
 
01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
having enough that they can put in a
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
machine and get a full spectrum
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
so and you know those people are cutting
 
01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:14.440 align:start position:0%
it with all kinds of
 
01:01:19.029 --> 01:01:19.039 align:start position:0%
crap that are not beneficial to human
 
01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
existance D representative Muse I mean
 
01:01:26.069 --> 01:01:26.079 align:start position:0%
mu Manion thank you Mr chair the
 
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
difference with that Is possessing a
 
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
test strip to test your drugs versus
 
01:01:32.029 --> 01:01:32.039 align:start position:0%
this law allowing you to legally possess
 
01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of illegal drug any
 
01:01:36.029 --> 01:01:36.039 align:start position:0%
amount of illegal drug being legally
 
01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:38.440 align:start position:0%
possessed now because of the SL I'm not
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
for so the difference in the test strip
 
01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0%
Is possessing the test strip not a drug
 
01:01:46.589 --> 01:01:46.599 align:start position:0%
this law will allow up to 10 milligrams
 
01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:49.400 align:start position:0%
of a drug being possessed now legally so
 
01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:51.400 align:start position:0%
for that reason I would be uh opposed to
 
01:01:55.029 --> 01:01:55.039 align:start position:0%
it and to be clear so the test stps
 
01:01:57.390 --> 01:01:57.400 align:start position:0%
right now if someone decides to go to
 
01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
the van and utilize it if they happen to
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
get arrested um they they have no they
 
01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
can't say well I'm going to get it
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
tested it's this would enable them to
 
01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:09.319 align:start position:0%
actually carry an amount around with
 
01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
them is that correct your understanding
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
bill one last time I'm sorry the other
 
01:02:21.549 --> 01:02:21.559 align:start position:0%
thing I forgot to mention we also heard
 
01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
specific testimony about the extreme
 
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
cost cost of um things like xylazine
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
that if someone ends up with open wounds
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
from xylazine for example which now we
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
can test for but um that it was
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
something like um up to six weeks of
 
01:02:39.029 --> 01:02:39.039 align:start position:0%
inpatient care and if they don't have
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
medical insurance that's a cost born by
 
01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:43.960 align:start position:0%
all of the stakeholders in New Hampshire
 
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
um and the medical cost of initially the
 
01:02:48.589 --> 01:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
emergency room care which I can tell you
 
01:02:51.549 --> 01:02:51.559 align:start position:0%
emergency room bills are no joke having
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
just having to negotiate those with
 
01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
insurance um but a six week stay as an
 
01:02:59.589 --> 01:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
inpatient to have open wounds treated
 
01:03:00.829 --> 01:03:00.839 align:start position:0%
and many of these people are having to
 
01:03:02.829 --> 01:03:02.839 align:start position:0%
come back again and again and some of
 
01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:05.039 align:start position:0%
these new drugs that we are as yet not
 
01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
aware what they are because we don't
 
01:03:08.109 --> 01:03:08.119 align:start position:0%
have a way to test for them legally and
 
01:03:12.029 --> 01:03:12.039 align:start position:0%
safely um would lead to additional very
 
01:03:14.269 --> 01:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
high costs for all of us as a taxpayer
 
01:03:17.349 --> 01:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
that are much higher than the cost it
 
01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
would be to adopt the amendment test for
 
01:03:22.349 --> 01:03:22.359 align:start position:0%
these things and try to get them out of
 
01:03:23.789 --> 01:03:23.799 align:start position:0%
our drug Supply or at least make people
 
01:03:25.029 --> 01:03:25.039 align:start position:0%
aware that these things are going to
 
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
cause much much more serious harms than
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
they're aware of including our college
 
01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:31.720 align:start position:0%
students who might be attempting to use
 
01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
recreational drugs who are too foolish
 
01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
to know to protect
 
01:03:40.510 --> 01:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
themselves and where would these um
 
01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
where would this testing take
 
01:03:45.069 --> 01:03:45.079 align:start position:0%
place it's in har it we specified
 
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:51.309 --> 01:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
approved but where though where
 
01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
specifically where it
 
01:03:53.279 --> 01:04:04.549 align:start position:0%
specifically where it
be

01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
put your mic
 
01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
on um we actually haven't specified uh
 
01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of the structure of what
 
01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:13.960 align:start position:0%
that what that would look like
 
01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:15.640 align:start position:0%
essentially what we're trying to do in
 
01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:19.480 align:start position:0%
the bill um is to just make sure that
 
01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
that people who are engaging in harm
 
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
reduction activities currently folks
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
like the New Hampshire Co uh the New
 
01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:27.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire harm reduction Coalition um
 
01:04:29.549 --> 01:04:29.559 align:start position:0%
don't run a risk of getting arrested for
 
01:04:31.069 --> 01:04:31.079 align:start position:0%
the good work that they're actually
 
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
doing so I think that's one of the one
 
01:04:35.309 --> 01:04:35.319 align:start position:0%
of the issues that we've also tried to
 
01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:37.799 align:start position:0%
address in the bill um and I would like
 
01:04:41.789 --> 01:04:41.799 align:start position:0%
to point out um that um we're not
 
01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
legalizing possession of 10 milligrams
 
01:04:49.549 --> 01:04:49.559 align:start position:0%
of of of any substance um you know
 
01:04:51.789 --> 01:04:51.799 align:start position:0%
essentially what we're doing is that
 
01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
we're saying within the within the
 
01:04:56.029 --> 01:04:56.039 align:start position:0%
context of drug checking for the purpose
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
of drug checking only this this this
 
01:05:02.269 --> 01:05:02.279 align:start position:0%
amount um
 
01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
essentially um will be uh you know will
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
be allowable only in the context of of
 
01:05:13.069 --> 01:05:13.079 align:start position:0%
of drug checking so if you're if you're
 
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
um you know if you're selling it to
 
01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:17.799 align:start position:0%
somebody else you know for for for
 
01:05:21.309 --> 01:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
example um it doesn't apply uh one one
 
01:05:23.269 --> 01:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
of I think one of the somebody during
 
01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
one of the public hearings raised the
 
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
issue of well you know wouldn't uh you
 
01:05:29.109 --> 01:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
know wouldn't drug dealers start you
 
01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
know packaging up all of their drugs in
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
10 milligram bags because it would be
 
01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
legal and uh you know
 
01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
no as a practical matter that makes
 
01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely no sense uh and and again it
 
01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
it's just a basic decision I mean
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes these are these are some of
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
the trade offs that we need to make in
 
01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
order to save lives and uh and one of
 
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
the reasons why harm reduction is
 
01:05:58.430 --> 01:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
catching on all over the country is
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
because it is working and it is Saving
 
01:06:03.510 --> 01:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
Lives things like fentanyl test strips
 
01:06:06.510 --> 01:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
but but the thing is is you know we
 
01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
can't always be we don't want to be in a
 
01:06:11.950 --> 01:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
situation where we're two years behind
 
01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
the drug Supply trying to file
 
01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
legislation to catch up so the advantage
 
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
of passing this bill with the amendment
 
01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:23.240 align:start position:0%
is we get out of that game we don't have
 
01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
anymore you know we we can Empower
 
01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
people in the harm reduction Community
 
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
to do what they do to save lives to use
 
01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
uh new drug checking technology and
 
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
tools as they become available like
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test strips like new kinds of
 
01:06:42.309 --> 01:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
test strips that actually will identify
 
01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
multiple types of compounds that are
 
01:06:46.269 --> 01:06:46.279 align:start position:0%
that are coming on the market these are
 
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
things that you know we're just going to
 
01:06:51.269 --> 01:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
want people taking advantage of and and
 
01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
you know the other thing I'd like to
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
point out is well you know we're all con
 
01:06:57.789 --> 01:06:57.799 align:start position:0%
a little concerned about uh about
 
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
enabling folks um and we'd all like
 
01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
people to be in recovery instead the the
 
01:07:06.269 --> 01:07:06.279 align:start position:0%
bottom line is you can't recover if
 
01:07:06.279 --> 01:07:07.190 align:start position:0%
bottom line is you can't recover if
you're

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
dead and and I think that's part of the
 
01:07:13.789 --> 01:07:13.799 align:start position:0%
issue that we're trying to fix
 
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
here representative Harry
 
01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
cther thank you Mr chair um just want to
 
01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
give a few statistics that came out
 
01:07:25.309 --> 01:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
yesterday on a report for um Manchester
 
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
and nashar year to date through the end
 
01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
of October AMR Medics have responded to

Manchester during September eight were
 
01:08:32.669 --> 01:08:32.679 align:start position:0%
in Manchester three were in
 
01:08:36.030 --> 01:08:36.040 align:start position:0%
Nashua that these results alone if we
 
01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
can do anything to save a life we should
 
01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
be sitting here and signing off on it
 
01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
right away we should not be hesitating
 
01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
at all if there's anything that would
 
01:08:47.709 --> 01:08:47.719 align:start position:0%
save folks life here it could be your
 
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
child my child my grandchild or great
 
01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
grandchild but we're talking about
 
01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
saving lives here
 
01:08:57.709 --> 01:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
here and if we have that opportunity we
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
need to do
 
01:09:02.189 --> 01:09:02.199 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
scitech I have a my question is I feel
 
01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
like I'm at the subcommittee level and I
 
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
don't like that is can anyone get high
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
from these strips under exi from the
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
strips as in this bill or from your
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment representative Ms can you get
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
high from
 
01:09:22.719 --> 01:09:25.309 align:start position:0%
high from
these

01:09:25.309 --> 01:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:09:28.349 --> 01:09:28.359 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sure some people would try um
 
01:09:32.749 --> 01:09:32.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:35.309 --> 01:09:35.319 align:start position:0%
possible I don't think the question is
 
01:09:36.669 --> 01:09:36.679 align:start position:0%
um whether they can get high from the
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
strips it's whether they're getting high
 
01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
from the from the drugs that they're
 
01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
actually bringing to to have
 
01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:45.110 align:start position:0%
actually bringing to to have
tested

01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
tested
 
01:09:48.430 --> 01:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
um um so try to separate the drug that's
 
01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:52.189 align:start position:0%
um um so try to separate the drug that's
on

01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
thep representative
 
01:09:58.229 --> 01:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
KH thank you Mr chairman uh Mr chairman
 
01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh my experience with this uh opio
 
01:10:05.310 --> 01:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
issues that we facing for many years uh
 
01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
in my town I attended so many funerals
 
01:10:11.950 --> 01:10:11.960 align:start position:0%
is you know I understand that every
 
01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
representative will tell me the same
 
01:10:17.709 --> 01:10:17.719 align:start position:0%
story that what I went through uh I was
 
01:10:21.790 --> 01:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
not with the U subcommittee or anybody
 
01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
but what kind of messes we going to send
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
to our citizens and our society that we
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
approved we as a legislature approved
 
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
some kind of drugs to kill another drug
 
01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.830 align:start position:0%
some kind of drugs to kill another drug
or

01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
something okay thank you um
 
01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:42.630 align:start position:0%
something okay thank you um
representative

01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair I mean I think
 
01:10:47.669 --> 01:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
we need to remember that the War on
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
Drugs has existed for decades and the
 
01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
methods we've been using are not working
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
like representative Harriet G right
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned Manchester in October had over
 
01:10:58.870 --> 01:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
100 opioid
 
01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
overdoses um related deaths which is the
 
01:11:05.070 --> 01:11:05.080 align:start position:0%
highest total since 2018 um and I think
 
01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
it's time we try new methods to try and
 
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
slow these deaths so like many people
 
01:11:12.149 --> 01:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
have said the point is to keep people
 
01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
alive until they have the ability to
 
01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
change their behavior and be get in
 
01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:21.400 align:start position:0%
recovery and I don't think we should be
 
01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
sentencing people like it feels like
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
just allowing people to die because of
 
01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
our own feelings about what we're doing
 
01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:36.430 --> 01:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
impact would this
 
01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
law have prevented any overdoses I don't
 
01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
think that this law would um tells or in
 
01:11:44.669 --> 01:11:44.679 align:start position:0%
any way would tell someone the amount
 
01:11:47.149 --> 01:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
they can take that will kill them and
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
we're already able to test for Fentanyl
 
01:11:51.709 --> 01:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
and xylazine so what is it that this law
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
would add that would save a
 
01:11:59.189 --> 01:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:02.189 --> 01:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
taken I mean I would say that you know
 
01:12:03.950 --> 01:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
off sometimes people are overdosing on
 
01:12:05.229 --> 01:12:05.239 align:start position:0%
something they aren't aware that they're
 
01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
taking that it's in the substance that
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
they're using that is um being cut with
 
01:12:12.669 --> 01:12:12.679 align:start position:0%
something else um and also like other
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
people have mentioned we have new
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
substances entering the market all the
 
01:12:19.390 --> 01:12:19.400 align:start position:0%
time so to wait until we can identify
 
01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
those substances know that they exist
 
01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
you know create steps create new
 
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.629 align:start position:0%
you know create steps create new
legislation

01:12:24.629 --> 01:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:12:26.990 --> 01:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
in all that time we could already have
 
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
been testing for those substances before
 
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
they reach a point where they're taking
 
01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
so many lives and I also see this in a
 
01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
way um at you know it's going to cut
 
01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
away at the market as well if you think
 
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
about the fact that if people start
 
01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:42.280 align:start position:0%
testing their drugs and they see that oh
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
if I buy from this seller he cuts with
 
01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
these things all the time everybody
 
01:12:47.709 --> 01:12:47.719 align:start position:0%
stops going to that seller like it could
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
actually cut away at the market in that
 
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
way as well as well as um you know
 
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
helping people protect themselves
 
01:12:56.669 --> 01:12:56.679 align:start position:0%
thank you um on the subcommittee can
 
01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
someone tell me what was the testimony
 
01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
of law enforcement regarding this
 
01:13:02.629 --> 01:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
tzar in the subcommittee we do not have
 
01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
any no law enforcement so we haven't
 
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
heard from law enforcement at all on
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
this is not at all just from harm
 
01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
reduction interesting okay all right I
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
think we there were law enforcement uh
 
01:13:21.229 --> 01:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
change I think that we've had a a
 
01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
thoughtful um debate and we've we've dug
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
into this so I'm going to ask the um
 
01:13:29.950 --> 01:13:29.960 align:start position:0%

01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
um can you speak to your Amendment yes
 
01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
uh copies of the amendment were
 
01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
distributed there were also copies of
 
01:15:31.629 --> 01:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
the amendment over on the table for
 
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
folks who uh who do not have them this
 
01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
is a significant rewrite of the addition
 
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
of the original Bill uh so as I said
 
01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
earlier there were some concerns uh some
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
very legitimate concerns on the part of
 
01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
law enforcement that uh by removing L uh
 
01:15:48.149 --> 01:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
testing and analizing from the drug
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia law um uh in order to
 
01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
accommodate things like FAL T Test test
 
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
strips uh we also could conceivably be
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
legalizing the use of that equipment uh
 
01:16:00.270 --> 01:16:00.280 align:start position:0%
for manufacturing compounding and
 
01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
distribution which is something we did
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
not want to do so one of the things that
 
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment does uh is it actually
 
01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:08.440 align:start position:0%
leaves that portion of the language
 
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
intact and then creates specific
 
01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
exemption uh for drug checking equipment
 
01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh from the drug paraphernalia law um
 
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
what it also does is it gets us out of
 
01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
the game of having to uh every time a
 
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
new technology comes along for drug
 
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
checking of having to modify our statute
 
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
uh so the second part of of that uh of
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
that exemption uh actually uh opens the
 
01:16:35.629 --> 01:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
door for uh new drug checking equipment
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
that comes on the market like
 
01:16:39.390 --> 01:16:39.400 align:start position:0%
multicompound strips and things like
 
01:16:42.189 --> 01:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
that uh to be uh to be used without
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
having to come back to this committee a
 
01:16:45.790 --> 01:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
couple years from now and try to get us
 
01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
to pass another law to change our
 
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
current law so what it does is it
 
01:16:54.189 --> 01:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
basically makes uh it it creates a lot
 
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
more flexibility for the harm reduction
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
Community uh to save lives um and
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully one of the things that it will
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
lead to is a lot more of uh of basically
 
01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:07.960 align:start position:0%
more of this resource being available to
 
01:17:10.510 --> 01:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
more of the people who need it at a time
 
01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
when it will actually do them some good
 
01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
um and as representative Cel said one of
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
the things that uh that uh it can will
 
01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
also likely lead to uh in the same way
 
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
that legalization of fentanyl test
 
01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
strips did for compounds that are doing
 
01:17:30.870 --> 01:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
additional harm uh like uh benzo dipene
 
01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
uh and LOL and some of the other things
 
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
that are now being found in our drug
 
01:17:39.870 --> 01:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
Supply um injuries um and and and I
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
would say um unplanned uh interactions
 
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
let's say between the drug you think
 
01:17:46.629 --> 01:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
you're taking and the drug it's been cut
 
01:17:49.189 --> 01:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
with um that's that's another danger
 
01:17:52.110 --> 01:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
because benzo dipene we're talking about
 
01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh drugs like resip Pam uh and Valium uh
 
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
so those those are drugs if you've ever
 
01:17:59.830 --> 01:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
seen them most of the time they're in
 
01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
little little tiny pills um it doesn't
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
take a lot uh for you know for for uh a
 
01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
lot of a drug like that either uh to uh
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
potentially put somebody who's not aware
 
01:18:14.110 --> 01:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
of what they're taking in you know In
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
Harm's Way so if you're actually if uh
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
if people have used one compound before
 
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
and um and they've been okay uh the fact
 
01:18:24.790 --> 01:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
that they think they're just taking that
 
01:18:27.629 --> 01:18:27.639 align:start position:0%
again but they're also taking lorazapam
 
01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
or valium or one of the other
 
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
benzodiazapine drugs it can have an
 
01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
unpredictable reaction uh in a lot of
 
01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
people that can lead uh to a lot more
 
01:18:38.629 --> 01:18:38.639 align:start position:0%
than physical distress the other thing
 
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
that we've done in the in the amendment
 
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
itself and and in the bill is we've
 
01:18:46.629 --> 01:18:46.639 align:start position:0%
actually defined uh harm reduction um uh
 
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
We've defined what drug checking
 
01:18:50.189 --> 01:18:50.199 align:start position:0%
equipment is so we've kind of gone
 
01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
another Step Beyond uh what uh uh you
 
01:18:56.990 --> 01:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
know what we did with HB 287 and then
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
the and another thing that we've done is
 
01:19:02.669 --> 01:19:02.679 align:start position:0%
we've actually um open the open the door
 
01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
to allowing uh other opioid reversal
 
01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
agents other than
 
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
nxone um uh so so essentially what what
 
01:19:13.709 --> 01:19:13.719 align:start position:0%
the what the bill and what the amendment
 
01:19:15.629 --> 01:19:15.639 align:start position:0%
would do is it would put us in a
 
01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
situation when when those opioid
 
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
reversal agents have been properly
 
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
tested and approved to be marketed we
 
01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have an issue with people
 
01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
saying yeah but um the lock zone is the
 
01:19:29.550 --> 01:19:29.560 align:start position:0%
only one that's actually approved for us
 
01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
to use by Statute so we're going to have
 
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
to use that even though it's less
 
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
effective on people who've overdosed on
 
01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
Fentanyl and car fenyl so you know the
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is is the amendment um
 
01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
the amendment actually addresses many of
 
01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
the original concerns of law enforcement
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
um and and I know that there are issues
 
01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
with the 10 milligram
 
01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
with a 10 mgram amount but getting back
 
01:19:58.270 --> 01:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
to it again I think one one of the
 
01:19:59.910 --> 01:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
things we've heard in the context of
 
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
these bills sometimes is I think we may
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
have actually started with residual
 
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
amount in in in the language uh and then
 
01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
we went to 10 milligrams as a nom as you
 
01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
know defining an nominal nominal amount
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
of 10 milligrams because you know
 
01:20:17.950 --> 01:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
because folks were saying well how much
 
01:20:20.229 --> 01:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
is a residual amount you know can you
 
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
quantify how much is in a residual
 
01:20:24.310 --> 01:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
amount and the whole reason for having
 
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
residual amount in statute is basically
 
01:20:29.310 --> 01:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
so you don't have to quantify it so it's
 
01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:32.719 align:start position:0%
sort of which way which way is it I'd be
 
01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:34.639 align:start position:0%
happy with it either way as long as we
 
01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:39.870 --> 01:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
passed further
 
01:20:43.149 --> 01:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
comment okay um at this time I'll ask
 
01:20:44.430 --> 01:20:44.440 align:start position:0%
the clerk to call the role on the
 
01:20:46.990 --> 01:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
amendment we are the vote is on whether
 
01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
to adopt the
 
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
amendment all representative scitec I'm
 
01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
sorry this is the first we're taking
 
01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
your word for this that this is what you
 
01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
say it is this is the first I've seen of
 
01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
this even even with a speed reading
 
01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
course I'm not going to read and absorb
 
01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
all of this I I don't know what to
 
01:21:09.550 --> 01:21:09.560 align:start position:0%
do if you want to look at any specific
 
01:21:12.270 --> 01:21:12.280 align:start position:0%
sections on the third page section c
 
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
talks about the amount
 
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
of the the committee will be in order um
 
01:21:19.950 --> 01:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
the committee is going to take a um
 
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
10-minute break to uh allow
 
01:21:23.950 --> 01:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
representative and anyone else who wants
 
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
to to uh who is not part of the
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to take a second look at
 
01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:30.590 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to take a second look at
this

01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:40.510 --> 01:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
move original
 
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
bill this is what we change in the
 
01:21:47.229 --> 01:21:47.239 align:start position:0%
AM that
 
01:21:51.709 --> 01:21:51.719 align:start position:0%
to representative Roy the members of
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:21.560 --> 01:43:29.629 align:start position:0%
 
High

01:43:29.629 --> 01:43:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:32.510 --> 01:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
okay we're back um and I hope everyone's
 
01:43:34.510 --> 01:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
had time to read the bill reflect on the
 
01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
bill I don't know that we need further
 
01:43:38.990 --> 01:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
discussion does anyone wish to make
 
01:43:42.910 --> 01:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
further comment no I don't think so um
 
01:43:44.870 --> 01:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
so at this time I would ask the clerk to
 
01:43:48.550 --> 01:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
call the role the motion is to adopt the
 
01:43:55.990 --> 01:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:59.629 --> 01:43:59.639 align:start position:0%
422h uh representative scitec um whether
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
we like the bill or not I would ask that
 
01:44:04.750 --> 01:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
we pass the amendment because it makes
 
01:44:07.070 --> 01:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
the bill better you may not like the
 
01:44:09.950 --> 01:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
bill at all but vote down a better bill
 
01:44:14.589 --> 01:44:14.599 align:start position:0%
but don't pass or well that's
 
01:44:17.910 --> 01:44:17.920 align:start position:0%

01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:51.719 align:start position:0%

01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
um I need a second for the amendment can

you second it second seconded by
 
01:49:15.430 --> 01:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
representative Manion this amendment um
 
01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
is brought by the sponsor um what it
 
01:49:20.910 --> 01:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
does uh well a little back track and we
 
01:49:23.709 --> 01:49:23.719 align:start position:0%
got an enormous bill um
 
01:49:26.510 --> 01:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
regarding asset forfeiture and I believe
 
01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
that the subcommittee and everyone else
 
01:49:30.669 --> 01:49:30.679 align:start position:0%
who's looked at it thought that it was
 
01:49:33.070 --> 01:49:33.080 align:start position:0%
much too complex much too many pieces
 
01:49:34.830 --> 01:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
that didn't belong in this committee
 
01:49:36.589 --> 01:49:36.599 align:start position:0%
that belong perhaps in
 
01:49:39.189 --> 01:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
judiciary um and when we got the
 
01:49:41.550 --> 01:49:41.560 align:start position:0%
amendment the last Amendment it there
 
01:49:44.229 --> 01:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
just wasn't enough time for us to um
 
01:49:46.189 --> 01:49:46.199 align:start position:0%
especially given the the amount of
 
01:49:48.109 --> 01:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
energy and time that was being consumed
 
01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
by the bail bill for us to delve into
 
01:49:51.790 --> 01:49:51.800 align:start position:0%
something something like this so he
 
01:49:54.229 --> 01:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
asked us if we would to just make it a
 
01:49:56.550 --> 01:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
study committee and then he could work
 
01:49:59.189 --> 01:49:59.199 align:start position:0%
on it further to perhaps make it ready
 
01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
that it goes where it should properly
 
01:50:03.390 --> 01:50:03.400 align:start position:0%
belong once they've figured out what
 
01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
parts of the bill go where so I would
 
01:50:08.709 --> 01:50:08.719 align:start position:0%
ask the committee to support um support
 
01:50:11.070 --> 01:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
making this committee study committee
 
01:50:13.589 --> 01:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to talk on the
 
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
amendment see none um I'd ask the court
 
01:50:18.189 --> 01:50:18.199 align:start position:0%
to call the role on adopting the
 
01:50:22.629 --> 01:50:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:25.629 --> 01:50:25.639 align:start position:0%

although it does it does have some value
 
01:51:34.830 --> 01:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
it just needs to be further worked on
 
01:51:36.589 --> 01:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
and I would encourage us to give him the
 
01:51:39.270 --> 01:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work on that um with that
 
01:51:41.870 --> 01:51:41.880 align:start position:0%

249 um and the number is 2461
 
01:54:09.709 --> 01:54:09.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:11.910 --> 01:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
that and would you like to speak to your
 
01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:16.270 align:start position:0%

Ament

01:54:16.270 --> 01:54:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
motion this bill established M
 
01:54:20.510 --> 01:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
magistrates who will assist with the
 
01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
hearing of Baal the issuance of warrants
 
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
and other judicial functions the bill
 
01:54:27.910 --> 01:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
further makes various changes to the
 
01:54:30.149 --> 01:54:30.159 align:start position:0%
standards governing the release of
 
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
individuals on bail pending resolutions
 
01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
of criminal
 
01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:40.750 align:start position:0%
of criminal
cases

01:54:40.750 --> 01:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:43.870 --> 01:54:43.880 align:start position:0%
um one of the key points in here in the
 
01:54:45.629 --> 01:54:45.639 align:start position:0%
case of a person arrested when the court
 
01:54:48.149 --> 01:54:48.159 align:start position:0%
is not open within the next 24 hours a
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
decision on bail shall be made made by a
 
01:54:54.750 --> 01:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
magistrate within 24 hours of the
 
01:54:58.069 --> 01:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
arrest so if you guys remember we had a
 
01:54:59.709 --> 01:54:59.719 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
01:55:02.229 --> 01:55:02.239 align:start position:0%
um conversation
 
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
about weekend bail and how long a person
 
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
could be possibly would be held up to 72
 
01:55:11.990 --> 01:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
hours and things of that nature so what
 
01:55:14.430 --> 01:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
we've asked now is that we have 15
 
01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
magistrates that will um be a part of
 
01:55:21.109 --> 01:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
each County one Magistrate County and
 
01:55:24.589 --> 01:55:24.599 align:start position:0%
that that person would be available um
 
01:55:28.629 --> 01:55:28.639 align:start position:0%
on the weekend so on Friday if someone's
 
01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
arrested um they can see a magistrate on
 
01:55:35.109 --> 01:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
Saturday on Saturday or Sunday if
 
01:55:37.069 --> 01:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
they're arrested on Saturday otherwise
 
01:55:38.830 --> 01:55:38.840 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have to wait till the next
 
01:55:41.589 --> 01:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
um court date to
 
01:55:47.109 --> 01:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
um have the either given bail or or the
 
01:55:49.229 --> 01:55:49.239 align:start position:0%
decision to detain them one way or the
 
01:55:49.239 --> 01:55:51.310 align:start position:0%
decision to detain them one way or the
other

01:55:51.310 --> 01:55:51.320 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:55:53.350 --> 01:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
the other thing that was in here that I
 
01:55:56.550 --> 01:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:00.310 --> 01:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
important so the only difference in as
 
01:56:02.750 --> 01:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
in this bill when it when it look when
 
01:56:05.709 --> 01:56:05.719 align:start position:0%
we look at um chapter
 
01:56:08.069 --> 01:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
491b is that any place that you might
 
01:56:11.229 --> 01:56:11.239 align:start position:0%
have seen Court the word Court we now
 
01:56:16.149 --> 01:56:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:18.390 --> 01:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
magistrate uh another thing if there's a
 
01:56:20.229 --> 01:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
probable cost believe that person is on
 
01:56:22.830 --> 01:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
release pending resolution of a previous
 
01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
offense and thereafter was arrested and
 
01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
released pending the resolution of a
 
01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
second offense and has committed an
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
additional Class A misdemeanor or
 
01:56:36.109 --> 01:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
driving or operating while imp appearer
 
01:56:38.589 --> 01:56:38.599 align:start position:0%
the person shall be detained for no more
 
01:56:41.229 --> 01:56:41.239 align:start position:0%
than 24 hours for a bail hearing before
 
01:56:43.390 --> 01:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
a magistrate or the
 
01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
court upon appearance in front of a
 
01:56:47.990 --> 01:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
magistrate or the court for a person
 
01:56:50.270 --> 01:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
detained under this section there shall
 
01:56:52.669 --> 01:56:52.679 align:start position:0%
be a rebuttable presumption that the
 
01:56:54.990 --> 01:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
person will not abide by a condition
 
01:56:57.870 --> 01:56:57.880 align:start position:0%
that the person not commit a new
 
01:57:01.750 --> 01:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
offense that's it for me thank you um I
 
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
think it's important for everyone to
 
01:57:06.669 --> 01:57:06.679 align:start position:0%
realize that each of these um bills does
 
01:57:10.030 --> 01:57:10.040 align:start position:0%
a different thing within the bail system
 
01:57:12.030 --> 01:57:12.040 align:start position:0%
um and they are integral to each other
 
01:57:14.229 --> 01:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
but yet separate enough that we felt
 
01:57:16.229 --> 01:57:16.239 align:start position:0%
that it was important to keep them um on
 
01:57:18.950 --> 01:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
their own Standalone the magistrates for
 
01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:19.910 align:start position:0%
their own Standalone the magistrates for
example

01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:57:21.830 --> 01:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
is a very significant change to the
 
01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
court system um and we did this in
 
01:57:26.350 --> 01:57:26.360 align:start position:0%
conjunction with and conferring with the
 
01:57:27.910 --> 01:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
courts this is not something we're
 
01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
putting on them this is something that
 
01:57:31.470 --> 01:57:31.480 align:start position:0%
they agreed to as a matter of fact the
 
01:57:33.910 --> 01:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
language is almost exactly what they
 
01:57:35.830 --> 01:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
requested um when they worked with
 
01:57:38.990 --> 01:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative gath a few years back so
 
01:57:40.870 --> 01:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
um as part of that we implement the
 
01:57:43.149 --> 01:57:43.159 align:start position:0%
magistrates there'll be one for every um
 
01:57:46.229 --> 01:57:46.239 align:start position:0%
County and plus an extra couple to for
 
01:57:48.709 --> 01:57:48.719 align:start position:0%
floating um they going to help out with
 
01:57:51.510 --> 01:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
other issues the court besides just this
 
01:57:53.550 --> 01:57:53.560 align:start position:0%
so it's a good investment it will help
 
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
take the burden off the Circuit Court
 
01:57:58.790 --> 01:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
judges and it will also ensure that
 
01:58:02.790 --> 01:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
people um have a speedy uh bail hearing
 
01:58:04.950 --> 01:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
um what's important also is that we
 
01:58:06.709 --> 01:58:06.719 align:start position:0%
changed the law in several of these
 
01:58:10.390 --> 01:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
bills to make to tighten up um the bail
 
01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
statute a bit so that people that are
 
01:58:15.149 --> 01:58:15.159 align:start position:0%
definitely threats to society aren't
 
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
just getting out right away um so we've
 
01:58:19.830 --> 01:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
made some clarifications to the existing
 
01:58:22.589 --> 01:58:22.599 align:start position:0%
law and the magistrates make that
 
01:58:25.830 --> 01:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
possible for example if you are arrested
 
01:58:27.229 --> 01:58:27.239 align:start position:0%
um and we're going to talk about it one
 
01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
of the other bills for certain offenses
 
01:58:33.069 --> 01:58:33.079 align:start position:0%
um it's the wish that they not be heard
 
01:58:35.149 --> 01:58:35.159 align:start position:0%
right away by a bail commissioner that
 
01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
they be um if it happens during a
 
01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
weekday they're held and then they go to
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
the judge in the morning but so that
 
01:58:44.589 --> 01:58:44.599 align:start position:0%
they're not held over a long weekend the
 
01:58:46.350 --> 01:58:46.360 align:start position:0%
magistrates will be able to step in and
 
01:58:49.149 --> 01:58:49.159 align:start position:0%
hear those um for the weekend so some no
 
01:58:51.629 --> 01:58:51.639 align:start position:0%
one no one has to sit for more than 24
 
01:58:54.790 --> 01:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
hours without at least someone um laying
 
01:58:56.430 --> 01:58:56.440 align:start position:0%
eyes on their case and making a a
 
01:58:58.870 --> 01:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
determination on their bail the version
 
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
that we got from the Senate um of the
 
01:59:03.629 --> 01:59:03.639 align:start position:0%
bill we're about to discuss next did not
 
01:59:04.990 --> 01:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
allow that people were just going to be
 
01:59:07.350 --> 01:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
held um from when they were arrested
 
01:59:09.030 --> 01:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
until they were made made in front of
 
01:59:10.510 --> 01:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
the court so we've made a significant
 
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
change in both directions but the
 
01:59:14.589 --> 01:59:14.599 align:start position:0%
magistrates are key to making it all
 
01:59:18.189 --> 01:59:18.199 align:start position:0%
work um so any further comment or
 
01:59:20.709 --> 01:59:20.719 align:start position:0%
questions about this
 
01:59:20.719 --> 01:59:23.390 align:start position:0%
questions about this
representative

01:59:23.390 --> 01:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:26.709 --> 01:59:26.719 align:start position:0%
Newman I just have a question about the
 
01:59:30.470 --> 01:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
interaction here between magistrates and
 
01:59:33.310 --> 01:59:33.320 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners so if we pass this
 
01:59:34.589 --> 01:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
law as a
 
01:59:37.870 --> 01:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
separate bill with magistrates with
 
01:59:39.470 --> 01:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
requirements in there and there's no
 
01:59:41.550 --> 01:59:41.560 align:start position:0%
mention of bail Commissioners in here I
 
01:59:41.560 --> 01:59:42.990 align:start position:0%
mention of bail Commissioners in here I
don't

01:59:42.990 --> 01:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:59:45.149 --> 01:59:45.159 align:start position:0%
believe and we don't have those
 
01:59:47.910 --> 01:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
magistrates in place by the
 
01:59:50.350 --> 01:59:50.360 align:start position:0%
implementation date of this
 
01:59:53.709 --> 01:59:53.719 align:start position:0%
law what effect does that have on bail
 
01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
Commissioners um we we've I believe we
 
01:59:59.430 --> 01:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
allowed it least six months yeah and
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's in it's in the bill where is it in
 
02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:02.149 align:start position:0%
it's in it's in the bill where is it in
the

02:00:02.149 --> 02:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:00:05.510 --> 02:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
bill we talk about the Commissioners in
 
02:00:07.910 --> 02:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
318 remember oh in the separate bill
 
02:00:09.750 --> 02:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
yeah again it's addressed in a separate
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
and yeah and we give it a year this bill
 
02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
um the effective date of this bill is
 
02:00:20.109 --> 02:00:20.119 align:start position:0%
January 1
 
02:00:22.430 --> 02:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
2025 um so there's plenty of time for
 
02:00:24.750 --> 02:00:24.760 align:start position:0%
them to implement the
 
02:00:27.350 --> 02:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
magistrates any further questions or
 
02:00:29.470 --> 02:00:29.480 align:start position:0%
comments seeing none I would ask the

of the change we made relating to the
 
02:03:04.950 --> 02:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
bail um
 
02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
statutes in this one I'll I'll read the
 
02:03:10.790 --> 02:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
substantial changes um it says any case
 
02:03:12.109 --> 02:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
where an offender has been arrested for
 
02:03:13.790 --> 02:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
a crime of violent against an individual
 
02:03:15.350 --> 02:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
person including an act of stalking a
 
02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
criminal threat and the bill commission
 
02:03:18.109 --> 02:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
determines that the offender may be
 
02:03:19.550 --> 02:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
released pending Tri the arresting
 
02:03:21.430 --> 02:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
agency will attempt to contact the
 
02:03:24.310 --> 02:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
victim what we did there is we said if
 
02:03:25.830 --> 02:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
someone is arrested for a crime of
 
02:03:27.510 --> 02:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
violence against a person there is a
 
02:03:29.830 --> 02:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
victim the police will make an effort to
 
02:03:31.950 --> 02:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
contact that person to notify them that
 
02:03:34.350 --> 02:03:34.360 align:start position:0%
the offender is being released at least
 
02:03:37.870 --> 02:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
one hour prior to his release um that
 
02:03:39.669 --> 02:03:39.679 align:start position:0%
does not mean they can be held until
 
02:03:41.189 --> 02:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
they find the person that just means
 
02:03:42.910 --> 02:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
that they have an hour to notify them
 
02:03:45.709 --> 02:03:45.719 align:start position:0%
before they release the person um the
 
02:03:48.069 --> 02:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
per the victim has to give the police
 
02:03:50.390 --> 02:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
their in contact information and they
 
02:03:51.709 --> 02:03:51.719 align:start position:0%
just have to make a good effort to
 
02:03:54.229 --> 02:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
notify them and if they can't at the end
 
02:03:56.030 --> 02:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
of the hour they have to leave a written
 
02:03:58.709 --> 02:03:58.719 align:start position:0%
notification or send them a voicemail or
 
02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
something and document the fact that
 
02:04:02.390 --> 02:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
they notified them I think too often
 
02:04:03.990 --> 02:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
we've heard stories of people getting
 
02:04:06.709 --> 02:04:06.719 align:start position:0%
out and a victim being surprised by the
 
02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
person showing up um and this is an
 
02:04:12.310 --> 02:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
attempt to help alleviate that um the
 
02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:13.510 align:start position:0%
attempt to help alleviate that um the
bill

02:04:13.510 --> 02:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:04:17.390 --> 02:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
also talks about um bail Commissioners
 
02:04:19.310 --> 02:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
appointments um
 
02:04:21.109 --> 02:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
it says that uh currently bail
 
02:04:22.109 --> 02:04:22.119 align:start position:0%
Commissioners we know how they're
 
02:04:23.790 --> 02:04:23.800 align:start position:0%
appointed but there was no mechanism for
 
02:04:25.750 --> 02:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
removal of the bail commissioner this
 
02:04:27.709 --> 02:04:27.719 align:start position:0%
simply adds that the Chief Justice can
 
02:04:30.189 --> 02:04:30.199 align:start position:0%
for cause remove a bail commissioner um
 
02:04:32.470 --> 02:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
this was from the court um also the
 
02:04:35.430 --> 02:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
Chief Justice Superior Court um this is
 
02:04:36.430 --> 02:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
going to cause them to have
 
02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
identification cards it was already in
 
02:04:40.030 --> 02:04:40.040 align:start position:0%
statute that they be provide
 
02:04:41.629 --> 02:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
identification what we heard in
 
02:04:43.229 --> 02:04:43.239 align:start position:0%
testimony and subcommittee is that what
 
02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
they got was an email with a PDF
 
02:04:46.870 --> 02:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
attachment to print out and that was
 
02:04:49.950 --> 02:04:49.960 align:start position:0%
their identification um and we did not
 
02:04:51.310 --> 02:04:51.320 align:start position:0%
believe that was the intent of the
 
02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
legislation originally and we made it
 
02:04:54.950 --> 02:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
clear now that we would like them to
 
02:04:57.310 --> 02:04:57.320 align:start position:0%
actually have an physical card ID with
 
02:04:59.430 --> 02:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
their picture on it and we authorize the
 
02:05:01.270 --> 02:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
court to enter into an agreement with
 
02:05:03.950 --> 02:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
the DMV much as the house does for our
 
02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:04.790 align:start position:0%
the DMV much as the house does for our
own

02:05:04.790 --> 02:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
own
 
02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
identifications um so that they have a
 
02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:09.229 align:start position:0%
identifications um so that they have a
proper

02:05:09.229 --> 02:05:09.239 align:start position:0%
proper
 
02:05:12.750 --> 02:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
identification this bill further let me
 
02:05:13.950 --> 02:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
just see if there's anything else we
 
02:05:16.910 --> 02:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
changed it talks about training we heard
 
02:05:19.750 --> 02:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
a lot during the um sub committee that
 
02:05:21.189 --> 02:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
training was an issue for the bail
 
02:05:22.709 --> 02:05:22.719 align:start position:0%
Commissioners it was hit or miss some of
 
02:05:24.549 --> 02:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
them got really great training some of
 
02:05:26.750 --> 02:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
them just kind of met for half an hour
 
02:05:28.830 --> 02:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
and talked and didn't get any training
 
02:05:31.709 --> 02:05:31.719 align:start position:0%
at all um so what this does it
 
02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
standardizes it for new bail
 
02:05:34.310 --> 02:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
Commissioners they have to have at least
 
02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
16 hours of training um and for annual
 
02:05:39.109 --> 02:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
training they have to have at least
 
02:05:40.629 --> 02:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
eight hours of training and that has to
 
02:05:42.629 --> 02:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
be documented and this is again where
 
02:05:44.589 --> 02:05:44.599 align:start position:0%
the magistrates will come in as far as
 
02:05:47.030 --> 02:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
being um ensuring that the training for
 
02:05:49.549 --> 02:05:49.559 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners happens um now we
 
02:05:51.390 --> 02:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
have someone we know who we can ask
 
02:05:56.189 --> 02:05:56.199 align:start position:0%
about it um also we raised the bail fee
 
02:05:59.109 --> 02:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
the bail fee was $40 and has been for a
 
02:06:03.229 --> 02:06:03.239 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time and we felt
 
02:06:05.430 --> 02:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
that because of the mileage that and the
 
02:06:08.030 --> 02:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
cost of gas nowadays um they don't get
 
02:06:11.189 --> 02:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
paid for that so you get called out at
 
02:06:12.870 --> 02:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
3:00 in the morning you have to go bail
 
02:06:14.510 --> 02:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
someone you may have to drive 20 miles
 
02:06:17.510 --> 02:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
30 miles depending on who's on that
 
02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
night that you could would be driving a
 
02:06:20.990 --> 02:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
significant distance there's no
 
02:06:23.149 --> 02:06:23.159 align:start position:0%
compensation for that and to add insult
 
02:06:25.430 --> 02:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
to injury some of them weren't being
 
02:06:27.069 --> 02:06:27.079 align:start position:0%
paid at all we heard testimony in
 
02:06:28.669 --> 02:06:28.679 align:start position:0%
subcommittee about some bail
 
02:06:29.990 --> 02:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner one bail commissioner was
 
02:06:31.149 --> 02:06:31.159 align:start position:0%
owed over
 
02:06:35.709 --> 02:06:35.719 align:start position:0%
$50,000 in back bail um now we
 
02:06:36.990 --> 02:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
understand that we are a volunteer
 
02:06:39.109 --> 02:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
community and us at these tables here
 
02:06:40.510 --> 02:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
we're not working it for the money
 
02:06:41.910 --> 02:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
either and neither are the bail
 
02:06:43.470 --> 02:06:43.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioners but at some point it
 
02:06:45.669 --> 02:06:45.679 align:start position:0%
becomes ridiculous and when you're owed
 
02:06:47.990 --> 02:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
$50,000 uh I think that something needs
 
02:06:49.390 --> 02:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
to be done
 
02:06:52.750 --> 02:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
there was a commission in 2018 that made
 
02:06:54.270 --> 02:06:54.280 align:start position:0%
significant reforms to bail and one of
 
02:06:55.990 --> 02:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
their recommendations was the court pay
 
02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
the bail Commissioners directly so we um
 
02:07:02.709 --> 02:07:02.719 align:start position:0%
looked at that again and we found the
 
02:07:04.669 --> 02:07:04.679 align:start position:0%
yes they were correct however this time
 
02:07:06.149 --> 02:07:06.159 align:start position:0%
instead of just suggesting it we are
 
02:07:08.229 --> 02:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
going to make it law so the court will
 
02:07:09.709 --> 02:07:09.719 align:start position:0%
be under this bill responsible for
 
02:07:11.189 --> 02:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
paying the bail Commissioners monthly
 
02:07:12.910 --> 02:07:12.920 align:start position:0%
for the bails they issued in the
 
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
previous month at $50 each it allows the
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
court to collect the money back from the
 
02:07:22.189 --> 02:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
defendants if they're not Indigent uh it
 
02:07:23.549 --> 02:07:23.559 align:start position:0%
allows the court to set their own
 
02:07:26.430 --> 02:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
standard of indigency and it gives them
 
02:07:29.109 --> 02:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
uh it allows them to um set in place a
 
02:07:31.109 --> 02:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
time period of up to a year to repay
 
02:07:32.950 --> 02:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
that I think most people can come up
 
02:07:36.870 --> 02:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
with $50 in a year um so U it it
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
balances indigency with the right of the
 
02:07:41.109 --> 02:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
people not to have to pay with their
 
02:07:43.589 --> 02:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
taxes for everybody's bail um I think
 
02:07:46.149 --> 02:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
that's a fair balance that we struck and
 
02:07:47.549 --> 02:07:47.559 align:start position:0%
I believe that covers everything
 
02:07:49.549 --> 02:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
representive gath right did I miss
 
02:07:52.790 --> 02:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
anything um no I I think you did a great
 
02:07:54.790 --> 02:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
job I do want to say that I remember
 
02:07:57.149 --> 02:07:57.159 align:start position:0%
doing testimonies when they talked about
 
02:07:59.189 --> 02:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
most of them have laptops but they've
 
02:08:01.589 --> 02:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
actually paid for them themselves so you
 
02:08:04.790 --> 02:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
know the fact that you know State's
 
02:08:06.750 --> 02:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
going to actually be paying them
 
02:08:08.030 --> 02:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully that would help with that
 
02:08:09.790 --> 02:08:09.800 align:start position:0%
situation that they have purchasing
 
02:08:12.750 --> 02:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
their own laptops that's absolutely true
 
02:08:14.709 --> 02:08:14.719 align:start position:0%
um it's possible to do that job that we
 
02:08:17.589 --> 02:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
heard um with just your paperwork and uh
 
02:08:19.069 --> 02:08:19.079 align:start position:0%
but it makes it extremely difficult to
 
02:08:21.149 --> 02:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
keep track of you know uh many of them
 
02:08:23.549 --> 02:08:23.559 align:start position:0%
have invested in technology some of them
 
02:08:25.549 --> 02:08:25.559 align:start position:0%
have to put in phone lines computer
 
02:08:26.830 --> 02:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
lines things of this nature there's no
 
02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for that whatsoever so we
 
02:08:30.189 --> 02:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
felt that the least we could do is
 
02:08:32.430 --> 02:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
ensure they get paid for the bailes and
 
02:08:34.390 --> 02:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
it was done in a timely
 
02:08:37.149 --> 02:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
fashion and I think that's all um any
 
02:08:40.629 --> 02:08:40.639 align:start position:0%
questions or comments representative
 
02:08:45.229 --> 02:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:47.390 --> 02:08:47.400 align:start position:0%

02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:50.350 align:start position:0%
participating I'm not sure what that

02:08:50.350 --> 02:08:50.360 align:start position:0%

did you I'm not sure what that
 
02:08:55.350 --> 02:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
means making a statement that you're
 
02:08:59.750 --> 02:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
participating yes oh okay um any further

the executive session on which one did

does everyone have a copy of 653 no what
 
02:11:27.109 --> 02:11:27.119 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
02:11:30.229 --> 02:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
have have one for
 
02:11:32.030 --> 02:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
252 that's the one I'm waiting for an
 
02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
amendment on so 653 is the only other
 
02:11:39.109 --> 02:11:39.119 align:start position:0%
one that we have to work on besides
 
02:11:42.990 --> 02:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:45.270 --> 02:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
653 all right we're going to take a just
 
02:11:46.669 --> 02:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
five minutes where we get copies of the
 
02:11:48.030 --> 02:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
amendment for everybody I thought they
 
02:11:55.350 --> 02:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:57.830 --> 02:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
653 is there are there any Brad is there
 
02:12:00.589 --> 02:12:00.599 align:start position:0%
any over there 653 could could you ask
 
02:12:03.030 --> 02:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
please if if we could get I don't know
 
02:12:07.750 --> 02:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:11.470 --> 02:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
need yeah we're going to take five
 
02:12:16.750 --> 02:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:20.629 --> 02:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:22.950 --> 02:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
what it's it's not improved until we
 
02:12:25.629 --> 02:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
vote it through right I think that's
 
02:12:28.990 --> 02:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
what all of them they send us said
 
02:12:32.149 --> 02:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
that it was
 
02:12:34.549 --> 02:12:34.559 align:start position:0%
really I think it's unapproved until we
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:47.040 --> 02:20:08.670 align:start position:0%
 
someone

02:20:08.670 --> 02:20:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:11.190 --> 02:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
okay just to update um Karen is getting
 
02:20:14.190 --> 02:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
us copies of 653 and we will be taking
 
02:20:15.710 --> 02:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
that up in about a couple minutes when
 
02:20:17.630 --> 02:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
she comes back down there is an
 
02:20:20.590 --> 02:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
amendment to 252 we're waiting on and
 
02:20:22.429 --> 02:20:22.439 align:start position:0%
that may take a few more minutes so we
 
02:20:24.270 --> 02:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
will probably end up doing is breaking
 
02:20:26.030 --> 02:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
for a short Lunch Period after we take
 
02:20:26.040 --> 02:20:46.309 align:start position:0%
for a short Lunch Period after we take
up

02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:46.319 --> 02:29:16.670 align:start position:0%
 
653

02:29:16.670 --> 02:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:18.630 --> 02:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
at this point everyone should have a
 
02:29:24.110 --> 02:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
copy of um HB 653 Amendment 2465 does
 
02:29:25.750 --> 02:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
everyone have
 
02:29:29.870 --> 02:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
one okay at this point I will make a
 
02:29:33.429 --> 02:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
motion and offer amendment number
 
02:29:36.190 --> 02:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
24658 to HB
 
02:29:39.910 --> 02:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
653 and can I get a second seconded by
 
02:29:42.670 --> 02:29:42.680 align:start position:0%
representative Harry gaite and I will
 
02:29:43.910 --> 02:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
speak to my
 
02:29:47.150 --> 02:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
motion um what we've done with hb6
 
02:29:51.230 --> 02:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
653 this was as you can see originally a
 
02:29:55.389 --> 02:29:55.399 align:start position:0%
bill that was intended to prohibit um PR
 
02:29:58.469 --> 02:29:58.479 align:start position:0%
bail for certain crimes we have um
 
02:29:59.670 --> 02:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
changed it
 
02:30:02.230 --> 02:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
significantly um it still is related to
 
02:30:07.150 --> 02:30:07.160 align:start position:0%
bail however um what it does is it tells
 
02:30:09.710 --> 02:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
um there right now there's a commission
 
02:30:11.510 --> 02:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
um it's called the interbranch uh
 
02:30:13.710 --> 02:30:13.720 align:start position:0%
criminal justice and juvenile law
 
02:30:16.630 --> 02:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
commission and it's made up of Judges um
 
02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
County attorneys defense attorneys um
 
02:30:20.950 --> 02:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office
 
02:30:23.070 --> 02:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
Representatives senators and they're the
 
02:30:25.030 --> 02:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
ones who came together in 2018 and came
 
02:30:28.230 --> 02:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
up with the bail um statute as it is now
 
02:30:29.590 --> 02:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
that we're currently amending a little
 
02:30:32.750 --> 02:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
bit um we're retasking them since rather
 
02:30:35.110 --> 02:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
than create a new commission um since
 
02:30:36.990 --> 02:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
they still exist we're going to retask
 
02:30:39.309 --> 02:30:39.319 align:start position:0%
them and um part of the things we're
 
02:30:40.990 --> 02:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
going to ask them to look into specific
 
02:30:43.870 --> 02:30:43.880 align:start position:0%
things to recommend legislation on that
 
02:30:46.790 --> 02:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
require a a more in-depth um look than
 
02:30:48.429 --> 02:30:48.439 align:start position:0%
just we were able to do in as a
 
02:30:50.750 --> 02:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
committee or subcommittee so the first
 
02:30:51.990 --> 02:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
thing we're asking them to do is
 
02:30:55.349 --> 02:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
pre-trial Services pre-trial Services um
 
02:30:58.230 --> 02:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
provide significant um benefits and cost
 
02:30:59.830 --> 02:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
savings to counties if they're able to
 
02:31:03.630 --> 02:31:03.640 align:start position:0%
get them up and running they allow um
 
02:31:07.830 --> 02:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
interventions that keep people out of
 
02:31:09.990 --> 02:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
incarceration but yet are able to
 
02:31:12.910 --> 02:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
protect the public and help the the
 
02:31:15.030 --> 02:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
offender if they're involved with
 
02:31:17.950 --> 02:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
substance abuse or mental health issues
 
02:31:20.870 --> 02:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony from the county um
 
02:31:24.030 --> 02:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
jails that they are they are overloaded
 
02:31:26.030 --> 02:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
with people with mental health issues
 
02:31:30.190 --> 02:31:30.200 align:start position:0%
and as a committee we agree that that
 
02:31:32.670 --> 02:31:32.680 align:start position:0%
mental the judicial system especially
 
02:31:35.030 --> 02:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
the criminal judicial system is not
 
02:31:36.910 --> 02:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
designed nor do we want it to deal with
 
02:31:39.830 --> 02:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
mental health issues um that being said
 
02:31:43.670 --> 02:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
that is causing a a a lot of um people
 
02:31:47.429 --> 02:31:47.439 align:start position:0%
to be placed in in Lockup in the jails
 
02:31:49.830 --> 02:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
and they're not getting the necessarily
 
02:31:51.790 --> 02:31:51.800 align:start position:0%
the treatment they need so a pre-trial
 
02:31:54.070 --> 02:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
system um we we heard from several
 
02:31:56.309 --> 02:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
counties I believe marac was one that
 
02:31:58.150 --> 02:31:58.160 align:start position:0%
had a really good pre-trial system in
 
02:32:01.910 --> 02:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
place and um they in Stratford County
 
02:32:04.030 --> 02:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
and I believe
 
02:32:08.070 --> 02:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
um no it was the one out west um
 
02:32:11.309 --> 02:32:11.319 align:start position:0%
Jennifer's jesher County have also have
 
02:32:13.950 --> 02:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
one um each of them differ a little bit
 
02:32:17.110 --> 02:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
um but what we would like to do is
 
02:32:19.389 --> 02:32:19.399 align:start position:0%
have this commission look at this and
 
02:32:21.670 --> 02:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
say okay what is the gold standard for a
 
02:32:23.950 --> 02:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
pre-trial Services most other states
 
02:32:25.309 --> 02:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
have pre-trial
 
02:32:28.030 --> 02:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
Services um and it saves money as I said
 
02:32:29.309 --> 02:32:29.319 align:start position:0%
because when they have it and they don't
 
02:32:31.349 --> 02:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
have to incarcerate people right away
 
02:32:32.950 --> 02:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
some people that go in there with mental
 
02:32:35.469 --> 02:32:35.479 align:start position:0%
health issues their medication sometimes
 
02:32:38.710 --> 02:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
can run up to $330,000 a month and the
 
02:32:40.830 --> 02:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
Count's on the hook for that um and the
 
02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
state doesn't give them any money so
 
02:32:44.349 --> 02:32:44.359 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is we're overburdening
 
02:32:46.990 --> 02:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
our County Jail systems by having them
 
02:32:49.190 --> 02:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
hold medical patients in effect and and
 
02:32:50.990 --> 02:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's just not what we want to do so a
 
02:32:52.990 --> 02:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
pre-trial system would be able to help
 
02:32:54.790 --> 02:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
get people the mental health they need
 
02:32:57.349 --> 02:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
without necessarily incarcerating them
 
02:32:59.710 --> 02:32:59.720 align:start position:0%
um and we think that that's a good thing
 
02:33:03.269 --> 02:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
so we would ask them to look into it and
 
02:33:06.510 --> 02:33:06.520 align:start position:0%
establish a gold standard that would be
 
02:33:09.070 --> 02:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
a model for the state and perhaps
 
02:33:11.830 --> 02:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
establish a fund that counties could
 
02:33:14.070 --> 02:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
apply to if they develop a pre-child
 
02:33:16.790 --> 02:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
system that meets a minimum standard set
 
02:33:19.269 --> 02:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
um so that incentivizes counties to
 
02:33:20.870 --> 02:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
develop pre-trial systems and it
 
02:33:23.389 --> 02:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
incentivizes them to develop um Good
 
02:33:25.830 --> 02:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
Ones based on this gold standard and we
 
02:33:28.790 --> 02:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
realize that not every County will need
 
02:33:31.630 --> 02:33:31.640 align:start position:0%
all the services that are there so we
 
02:33:33.429 --> 02:33:33.439 align:start position:0%
asking the commission to look at
 
02:33:35.230 --> 02:33:35.240 align:start position:0%
specifically which ones would be most
 
02:33:37.150 --> 02:33:37.160 align:start position:0%
important for all of them to have and
 
02:33:40.389 --> 02:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
then ones that are good to have um so
 
02:33:41.950 --> 02:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
the next thing that we would be asking
 
02:33:46.389 --> 02:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
the commission to do would be to um look
 
02:33:49.990 --> 02:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
at our computer system in the courts and
 
02:33:52.230 --> 02:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
what we've heard was that from all over
 
02:33:53.830 --> 02:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
the state the courts kind of have their
 
02:33:55.990 --> 02:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
own thing in different courts some of
 
02:33:58.469 --> 02:33:58.479 align:start position:0%
them have really modern um case tracking
 
02:34:01.190 --> 02:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
some of them have none if you want to do
 
02:34:03.110 --> 02:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
any research to go to a court and say
 
02:34:04.349 --> 02:34:04.359 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know how many people have
 
02:34:07.030 --> 02:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
been convicted of X or how many people
 
02:34:08.990 --> 02:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
took this type of plea or what was the
 
02:34:10.710 --> 02:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
outcome of this you would have to
 
02:34:12.269 --> 02:34:12.279 align:start position:0%
literally almost drive to every Court in
 
02:34:14.190 --> 02:34:14.200 align:start position:0%
the state to figure that out and in this
 
02:34:16.990 --> 02:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
age that is not okay um we should be
 
02:34:19.230 --> 02:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
able to be able to get information so
 
02:34:22.230 --> 02:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
that we can make laws that are based on
 
02:34:25.950 --> 02:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
actual facts and not on anecdotes and we
 
02:34:28.190 --> 02:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
feel that also updating them would
 
02:34:31.590 --> 02:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
insist with bail um having accurate
 
02:34:34.510 --> 02:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
information that's up toate real time so
 
02:34:35.990 --> 02:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
there's a desperate need for our court
 
02:34:37.870 --> 02:34:37.880 align:start position:0%
system to be modernized and this
 
02:34:39.870 --> 02:34:39.880 align:start position:0%
commission would be study uh tasked with
 
02:34:42.309 --> 02:34:42.319 align:start position:0%
studying out how to do that and what it
 
02:34:44.389 --> 02:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
would cost and figuring out legislation
 
02:34:48.710 --> 02:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
that would implement it and finally um
 
02:34:51.349 --> 02:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
victim witness Services um we heard that
 
02:34:52.990 --> 02:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
most counties do have some type of
 
02:34:55.469 --> 02:34:55.479 align:start position:0%
victim witness service and we want to
 
02:34:57.110 --> 02:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
recognize that however there are some
 
02:34:59.910 --> 02:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
that have not the same level of services
 
02:35:02.830 --> 02:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
available or only available to certain
 
02:35:05.150 --> 02:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
victims of certain crimes um the
 
02:35:06.630 --> 02:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office has a very
 
02:35:08.670 --> 02:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
good victim witness service program and
 
02:35:10.630 --> 02:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
we want to recognize that so we would
 
02:35:13.550 --> 02:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
ask that this commission look and set a
 
02:35:17.190 --> 02:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
some type of a standard um for victim
 
02:35:19.110 --> 02:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
witness Services across the state so
 
02:35:22.630 --> 02:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
that victims of crimes are equally um
 
02:35:24.429 --> 02:35:24.439 align:start position:0%
thought of and taken care of the same
 
02:35:25.830 --> 02:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
way that we spend a lot of time and
 
02:35:29.429 --> 02:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
money taking care of defendants um often
 
02:35:31.550 --> 02:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
in these conversations victims get lost
 
02:35:33.309 --> 02:35:33.319 align:start position:0%
and we want to make sure that they are
 
02:35:35.469 --> 02:35:35.479 align:start position:0%
offered the proper support after being a
 
02:35:36.510 --> 02:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
victim of a
 
02:35:39.750 --> 02:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
crime and I believe that was it oh we
 
02:35:42.309 --> 02:35:42.319 align:start position:0%
made one more change we heard from
 
02:35:44.510 --> 02:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
everyone that was involved um that there
 
02:35:47.830 --> 02:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
was issues that commission when it did
 
02:35:50.469 --> 02:35:50.479 align:start position:0%
the bail um there was a judge in charge
 
02:35:53.790 --> 02:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
of the commission um and they asked
 
02:35:56.429 --> 02:35:56.439 align:start position:0%
specifically that we put the chair of
 
02:35:58.150 --> 02:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
Criminal Justice Committee in charge of
 
02:36:02.990 --> 02:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
the commission because they felt that um
 
02:36:07.070 --> 02:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
as its job is to suggest legislation it
 
02:36:09.510 --> 02:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
should be a legislator in charge of the
 
02:36:12.429 --> 02:36:12.439 align:start position:0%
commission because that person will know
 
02:36:14.670 --> 02:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
um the makeup of the
 
02:36:17.389 --> 02:36:17.399 align:start position:0%
house what is feasible what is not
 
02:36:19.550 --> 02:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
feasible and they would easily be able
 
02:36:22.910 --> 02:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
to get sample legislation drawn up um
 
02:36:25.070 --> 02:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
they were apparently issues with um the
 
02:36:26.550 --> 02:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
way it was shared before and I'm not
 
02:36:28.309 --> 02:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
sure what they are but this was what
 
02:36:31.070 --> 02:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
they asked for so that's what we had um
 
02:36:35.670 --> 02:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
and that's it that 653 is merely making
 
02:36:37.230 --> 02:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
um tasking that commission with looking
 
02:36:39.110 --> 02:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
into things for us does anyone have any
 
02:36:41.150 --> 02:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
questions about that or comments would
 
02:36:42.750 --> 02:36:42.760 align:start position:0%

on consent um so the last bill we have
 
02:38:47.230 --> 02:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
to take take up for today unfortunately
 
02:38:50.030 --> 02:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
is House Bill excuse me Senate Bill
 
02:38:53.110 --> 02:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
252 and we are as we speak waiting on a
 
02:38:55.710 --> 02:38:55.720 align:start position:0%
final Amendment um alls has had it for
 
02:38:58.790 --> 02:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
about 15 minutes 20 minutes um and they
 
02:39:01.790 --> 02:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
are working on it so at this point I'm
 
02:39:04.230 --> 02:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
going to have to take a probably let's
 
02:39:06.230 --> 02:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
just take 30 minutes let's meet back
 
02:39:07.150 --> 02:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
here at
 
02:39:09.950 --> 02:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
1:15 um and hopefully it we'll be here
 
02:39:12.389 --> 02:39:12.399 align:start position:0%
by then or at least I'll have an update
 
02:39:13.790 --> 02:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
and if it's going to be much longer
 
02:39:15.990 --> 02:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
we'll consider taking it up at another
 
02:39:17.790 --> 02:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
time but I'd prefer to have this done
 
02:39:21.870 --> 02:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
today so um
 
02:39:24.950 --> 02:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
115 okay 130 you have enough time for
 
02:39:24.960 --> 02:39:44.630 align:start position:0%
115 okay 130 you have enough time for
lunch

02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:44.640 --> 04:03:37.070 align:start position:0%
 
1:30

04:03:37.070 --> 04:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:37.080 --> 04:04:36.950 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:04:36.950 --> 04:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:36.960 --> 04:43:27.550 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:43:27.550 --> 04:43:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:30.590 --> 04:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
okay we are back um with the final bill
 
04:43:33.150 --> 04:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
for today that we are going to be
 
04:43:36.510 --> 04:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
considering at this point I I would um
 
04:43:38.270 --> 04:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
make a motion
 
04:43:42.788 --> 04:43:42.798 align:start position:0%
to bring in amendment number 20 excuse
 
04:43:47.270 --> 04:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
me 2470 h2b 252 can I get a second
 
04:43:48.990 --> 04:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
second seconded by representative
 
04:43:53.070 --> 04:43:53.080 align:start position:0%
gathright I'll speak to my motion this
 
04:43:55.470 --> 04:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
amendment um this is really the meat and
 
04:43:57.788 --> 04:43:57.798 align:start position:0%
potatoes of lot most of the work we did
 
04:43:58.990 --> 04:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
over the
 
04:44:03.030 --> 04:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
summer it does a number of things um I'm
 
04:44:06.070 --> 04:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
going to hit on the most important um of
 
04:44:07.670 --> 04:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
those a lot of them are minor changes
 
04:44:09.310 --> 04:44:09.320 align:start position:0%
that are just really technical language
 
04:44:12.430 --> 04:44:12.440 align:start position:0%
changes but the bigger ones are we've
 
04:44:14.350 --> 04:44:14.360 align:start position:0%
taken the list of crimes that the senate
 
04:44:17.868 --> 04:44:17.878 align:start position:0%
had proposed if you recall last year um
 
04:44:19.830 --> 04:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
we've adopted the list however we've
 
04:44:22.030 --> 04:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
limited it to the felony versions of
 
04:44:23.910 --> 04:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
those crimes because the list of crimes
 
04:44:27.430 --> 04:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
they gave um also included misdemeanor
 
04:44:30.868 --> 04:44:30.878 align:start position:0%
versions so we felt that if a person was
 
04:44:32.948 --> 04:44:32.958 align:start position:0%
going to be detained and held to be
 
04:44:36.350 --> 04:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
either see a a m istate or a judge that
 
04:44:37.470 --> 04:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
it should be a
 
04:44:40.590 --> 04:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
felony um so we adopted
 
04:44:43.868 --> 04:44:43.878 align:start position:0%
those and we also changed the the
 
04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
standard of evidence um we heard from uh
 
04:44:49.310 --> 04:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
the County attorneys that it was often
 
04:44:50.590 --> 04:44:50.600 align:start position:0%
difficult to get someone held on
 
04:44:53.670 --> 04:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
dangerousness because the standard was
 
04:44:55.948 --> 04:44:55.958 align:start position:0%
um clear and convincing evidence which
 
04:44:59.070 --> 04:44:59.080 align:start position:0%
is a fairly high standard we recognize
 
04:45:03.350 --> 04:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
that a person um being held there's a
 
04:45:05.390 --> 04:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
difference between the level of proof
 
04:45:07.150 --> 04:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
needed to arrest someone and the level
 
04:45:09.708 --> 04:45:09.718 align:start position:0%
of proof to hold someone and it's two
 
04:45:11.948 --> 04:45:11.958 align:start position:0%
different things so what we've done is a
 
04:45:13.830 --> 04:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
compromise we've we've moved it from
 
04:45:15.670 --> 04:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
substantial evidence then we started we
 
04:45:17.270 --> 04:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
went back to probable cause and then we
 
04:45:18.550 --> 04:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
realized that was probably too low
 
04:45:20.150 --> 04:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
because it's the exact standard for the
 
04:45:22.830 --> 04:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
for the crime we've struck middle ground
 
04:45:25.070 --> 04:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to say that the standard
 
04:45:26.910 --> 04:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
would be substantial evidence
 
04:45:29.350 --> 04:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
substantial evidence is more than
 
04:45:31.110 --> 04:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
probable cause but less than clear and
 
04:45:33.948 --> 04:45:33.958 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence so it makes it have
 
04:45:36.150 --> 04:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
a fair Fair hearing and there's still a
 
04:45:38.590 --> 04:45:38.600 align:start position:0%
good level of proof needed but it it's
 
04:45:41.190 --> 04:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
not something that they can't reach um
 
04:45:44.150 --> 04:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
keeping in mind as we discussed that
 
04:45:46.868 --> 04:45:46.878 align:start position:0%
it's within 24 hours of arrest so a case
 
04:45:48.230 --> 04:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be fully developed in
 
04:45:51.150 --> 04:45:51.160 align:start position:0%
that time to reach a higher standard so
 
04:45:53.550 --> 04:45:53.560 align:start position:0%
we feel like this was a good compromise
 
04:45:55.430 --> 04:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
um let me see what else did we do on
 
04:45:55.440 --> 04:45:56.230 align:start position:0%
um let me see what else did we do on
this

04:45:56.230 --> 04:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:46:00.830 --> 04:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
one we talk about electronic
 
04:46:03.310 --> 04:46:03.320 align:start position:0%
monitoring if someone is this is this
 
04:46:05.550 --> 04:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
got the one with the
 
04:46:06.628 --> 04:46:06.638 align:start position:0%
hold on a
 
04:46:14.190 --> 04:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:16.628 --> 04:46:16.638 align:start position:0%
the okay if someone's charged with a
 
04:46:20.510 --> 04:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
violation of of a protective order um
 
04:46:22.230 --> 04:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
the only way they can be released by the
 
04:46:26.708 --> 04:46:26.718 align:start position:0%
judge is with a electronic monitor so
 
04:46:28.628 --> 04:46:28.638 align:start position:0%
this is protecting our domestic violence
 
04:46:32.030 --> 04:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
victims um someone gets arrested the a
 
04:46:34.270 --> 04:46:34.280 align:start position:0%
protective order is issued they go out
 
04:46:36.150 --> 04:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
they violate that protective order by
 
04:46:38.190 --> 04:46:38.200 align:start position:0%
contacting a victim or any of the number
 
04:46:40.070 --> 04:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
of ways they can the court can still
 
04:46:41.868 --> 04:46:41.878 align:start position:0%
release them but at that time they need
 
04:46:44.350 --> 04:46:44.360 align:start position:0%
an electronic monitoring to be
 
04:46:44.360 --> 04:46:46.110 align:start position:0%
an electronic monitoring to be
released

04:46:46.110 --> 04:46:46.120 align:start position:0%
released
 
04:46:49.830 --> 04:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:52.070 --> 04:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
else representative GA would you
 
04:46:53.310 --> 04:46:53.320 align:start position:0%
anything you want to add that in well
 
04:46:57.788 --> 04:46:57.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:00.350 --> 04:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
anything have
 
04:47:02.230 --> 04:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
authority the cour should have the
 
04:47:04.470 --> 04:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
authorities stud a cash bail amount only
 
04:47:06.070 --> 04:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
if it is an amount which the defendant
 
04:47:09.190 --> 04:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
is able to meet yes we uh we continue to
 
04:47:11.350 --> 04:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
maintain the the proposition that cash
 
04:47:13.910 --> 04:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
bail um should only be used if someone
 
04:47:15.708 --> 04:47:15.718 align:start position:0%
can actually pay it the idea of cash
 
04:47:18.030 --> 04:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
bail is to get incentive for someone to
 
04:47:20.548 --> 04:47:20.558 align:start position:0%
return to court by setting a bail that
 
04:47:22.590 --> 04:47:22.600 align:start position:0%
someone could never meet it really is no
 
04:47:24.350 --> 04:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
incentive it's while it is is just
 
04:47:26.670 --> 04:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
saying I'd rather hold them so we want
 
04:47:28.510 --> 04:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
them if they're dangerous hold them for
 
04:47:30.830 --> 04:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
being dangerous if they're a Flight Risk
 
04:47:32.990 --> 04:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
hold them for a Flight Risk do not
 
04:47:35.150 --> 04:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
substitute make making a tough decision
 
04:47:37.990 --> 04:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
by using cash bail cash bail is only if
 
04:47:40.910 --> 04:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
someone can afford it and then they want
 
04:47:42.310 --> 04:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
to come back so that they don't lose the
 
04:47:44.430 --> 04:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
cash setting a bail that someone can't
 
04:47:46.548 --> 04:47:46.558 align:start position:0%
pay really is is all it's doing is
 
04:47:46.558 --> 04:47:47.830 align:start position:0%
pay really is is all it's doing is
holding

04:47:47.830 --> 04:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
holding
 
04:47:51.150 --> 04:47:51.160 align:start position:0%
them um and that just really expounds
 
04:47:52.750 --> 04:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
what was already in the statute it just
 
04:47:52.760 --> 04:47:55.548 align:start position:0%
what was already in the statute it just
clarifies

04:47:55.548 --> 04:47:55.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:58.708 --> 04:47:58.718 align:start position:0%
it um the indigeny is the electronic
 
04:48:00.750 --> 04:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
monitoring um we also enable the court
 
04:48:03.030 --> 04:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to allow up to a
 
04:48:05.670 --> 04:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
year to pay it back we I think we
 
04:48:07.750 --> 04:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
discussed that
 
04:48:09.548 --> 04:48:09.558 align:start position:0%
earlier I think that's all is there
 
04:48:11.590 --> 04:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
anything else I'm missing anyone from
 
04:48:11.600 --> 04:48:22.750 align:start position:0%
anything else I'm missing anyone from
the

04:48:22.750 --> 04:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:26.070 --> 04:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
subcomittee yeah and what line are you
 
04:48:28.230 --> 04:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
on well let's see I don't know where the
 
04:48:30.270 --> 04:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
new one is I know where the old one was
 
04:48:33.750 --> 04:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
the old one was in the area of 31 31 the
 
04:48:35.350 --> 04:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
new one one was supposed to be on page
 
04:48:38.788 --> 04:48:38.798 align:start position:0%
three right okay if if you're looking
 
04:48:41.190 --> 04:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
for the warrant part it's page four um
 
04:48:45.990 --> 04:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:49.548 --> 04:48:49.558 align:start position:0%
go page four paragraph two okay
 
04:48:51.750 --> 04:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph D yeah we added paragraph D
 
04:48:54.750 --> 04:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
unless um a search warn is obtained law
 
04:48:57.070 --> 04:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement is not able to get the uh
 
04:48:58.990 --> 04:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
information so another words if the
 
04:49:00.830 --> 04:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
court orderers somebody to be put on
 
04:49:02.070 --> 04:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring because they
 
04:49:04.830 --> 04:49:04.840 align:start position:0%
violated their protective order terms
 
04:49:06.350 --> 04:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
the police aren't able to call them and
 
04:49:08.628 --> 04:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
say hey can you tell me if this guy was
 
04:49:11.350 --> 04:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
also at the 7-Eleven today at 12 um and
 
04:49:13.548 --> 04:49:13.558 align:start position:0%
use that as a uh grounds to build a case
 
04:49:15.150 --> 04:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
against them they have to get a search
 
04:49:17.750 --> 04:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
warrant to get that information the idea
 
04:49:19.670 --> 04:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
behind this is to further protect the
 
04:49:21.948 --> 04:49:21.958 align:start position:0%
victim and help ensure that the
 
04:49:23.990 --> 04:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
defendant is living within the terms of
 
04:49:26.470 --> 04:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
his conditions and the order not to just
 
04:49:29.510 --> 04:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
open up him to tracking
 
04:49:32.910 --> 04:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
247 and I think that's
 
04:49:36.590 --> 04:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
it anyone else wish to speak um
 
04:49:38.070 --> 04:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative here G would you like to
 
04:49:38.080 --> 04:49:39.990 align:start position:0%
representative here G would you like to
address

04:49:39.990 --> 04:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
address
 
04:49:43.110 --> 04:49:43.120 align:start position:0%
this oh no I thought we just addressed
 
04:49:43.120 --> 04:49:56.910 align:start position:0%
this oh no I thought we just addressed
it

04:49:56.910 --> 04:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:01.510 --> 04:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
okay I have a question um about the
 
04:50:04.470 --> 04:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
1A uh there
 
04:50:09.190 --> 04:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
is the question I have is the cash bail
 
04:50:11.350 --> 04:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
amount only if an amount which the
 
04:50:14.470 --> 04:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
defendant is able to meet there are
 
04:50:17.590 --> 04:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances where you might this is
 
04:50:20.548 --> 04:50:20.558 align:start position:0%
unusual but it's possible they have the
 
04:50:23.230 --> 04:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
money but they can't get it because
 
04:50:25.350 --> 04:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
they're in they're in
 
04:50:28.150 --> 04:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
custody what do we do with somebody who
 
04:50:30.788 --> 04:50:30.798 align:start position:0%
can meet it but they're in custody and
 
04:50:32.590 --> 04:50:32.600 align:start position:0%
can't get
 
04:50:36.270 --> 04:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
to can't can't tap their
 
04:50:38.910 --> 04:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
resources and just no he's talking about
 
04:50:41.350 --> 04:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
setting the bail um so you're you're
 
04:50:43.310 --> 04:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
saying if you're you're setting bail on
 
04:50:45.868 --> 04:50:45.878 align:start position:0%
someone and they have the ability to pay
 
04:50:47.628 --> 04:50:47.638 align:start position:0%
the cash bail but they're unable to get
 
04:50:49.390 --> 04:50:49.400 align:start position:0%
it because they're incarcerated yeah
 
04:50:51.310 --> 04:50:51.320 align:start position:0%
yeah that that is a bit of a conundrum
 
04:50:54.150 --> 04:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
um I what you do now yeah what do you do
 
04:50:54.160 --> 04:50:56.310 align:start position:0%
um I what you do now yeah what do you do
currently

04:50:56.310 --> 04:50:56.320 align:start position:0%
currently
 
04:50:58.948 --> 04:50:58.958 align:start position:0%
um they're they've got to come up with
 
04:51:00.910 --> 04:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
it they got to get their wife they have
 
04:51:03.990 --> 04:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
to do it yeah because we know that if
 
04:51:06.190 --> 04:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
they have it they'll find a means to get
 
04:51:08.868 --> 04:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
it but I'm not sure if that continues
 
04:51:10.590 --> 04:51:10.600 align:start position:0%
here that's I would say that it does
 
04:51:12.788 --> 04:51:12.798 align:start position:0%
that it I don't I think that the the
 
04:51:15.830 --> 04:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
legislative intent throughout the bill
 
04:51:17.750 --> 04:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
is that to not use C it specifically
 
04:51:20.590 --> 04:51:20.600 align:start position:0%
even says do not set cash bail that they
 
04:51:22.910 --> 04:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
can't afford to pay because that's not
 
04:51:25.590 --> 04:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
why we're so to say that they can't meet
 
04:51:27.190 --> 04:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
it physically because they forgot their
 
04:51:29.350 --> 04:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
wallet at home I don't think that that I
 
04:51:30.670 --> 04:51:30.680 align:start position:0%
think that would be a significant
 
04:51:32.948 --> 04:51:32.958 align:start position:0%
stretch for the court to all right that
 
04:51:34.750 --> 04:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
that's my question but it's reasonable
 
04:51:37.070 --> 04:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
if it does happen but I think that the
 
04:51:38.788 --> 04:51:38.798 align:start position:0%
our intent in this legislation is very
 
04:51:40.910 --> 04:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
clear if someone has the money it
 
04:51:42.510 --> 04:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily mean has it on their
 
04:51:45.708 --> 04:51:45.718 align:start position:0%
person so any other
 
04:51:48.190 --> 04:51:48.200 align:start position:0%
questions all right seeing none I'll ask
 
04:51:49.230 --> 04:51:49.240 align:start position:0%
the clerk to call the role in the
 
04:51:50.990 --> 04:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
