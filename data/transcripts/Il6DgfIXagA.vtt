00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
she called this morning and said she had
 
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
to meet with treasury
 
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
but she will be joining us at noontime
 
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
so we're going to go longer
 
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
into the noon hour but i think everybody
 
00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
but the second thing that we're going to
 
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
be doing is the dra
 
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
is going to explain the fiscal
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
and that's information was sent to the
 
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
along with the table that they will be
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
explaining that and
 
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.010 align:start position:0%
answering other questions relative to

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
so we will start
 
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 align:start position:0%

and from what i see right now we have
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
chamber of commerce
 
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:25.520 align:start position:0%

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry valerie roshan also just
 
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
joined from portsmouth
 
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
okay valerie welcome aboard and
 
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
they are going to talk to us about
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
their experience with the ppp loans
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
and then we'll be able to ask them
 
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.230 align:start position:0%
and then we'll be able to ask them
questions

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:04.879 align:start position:0%
uh let me first of all
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
there was a few questions that were sent
 
00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
to them
 
00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
because are there
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
businesses out there that got the ppp
 
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
loan grant and are earning enough profit
 
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
now including
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
the ppp to have to pay
 
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
vpt and the businesses realize
 
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
grants are taxable by by the business
 
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
profits tax in new hampshire
 
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
when they took the money those are two
 
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
of the questions
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
sure thank you representative major and
 
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:44.630 align:start position:0%

thank you uh committee for uh having us
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
as well i corresponded previously with
 
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.430 align:start position:0%
as well i corresponded previously with
representative

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.080 align:start position:0%

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.190 align:start position:0%
almi and representative murphy on this
issue

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
both had contacted me and asked me those
 
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
two questions
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
and my answer to them was
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
one talking about if any of the
 
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.750 align:start position:0%
one talking about if any of the
businesses

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
did better than they expected uh
 
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
from 2020 versus their 2019 revenues
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
the the answer is yes we and i i think
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
my chamber colleagues will
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
also confirm that is it it depends very
 
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.110 align:start position:0%
also confirm that is it it depends very
much

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
on what the type of business it was
 
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know some of our industries
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
did have a good year in 2020
 
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
businesses that had anything to do with
 
00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.070 align:start position:0%
businesses that had anything to do with
home

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
improvement with outdoor recreation
 
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
as people were confined to their homes
 
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
and were
 
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
looking for things to do or they wanted
 
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
to fix up their homes
 
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
those businesses had a fairly good year
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
and so the answer to that question is
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
yes there
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
are some businesses who could pay
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
the bpt without any issue however
 
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
we also had numerous businesses
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
that were struggling and those are the
 
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
industries that many of you have already
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
heard of
 
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
restaurants have had a very difficult
 
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.550 align:start position:0%
restaurants have had a very difficult
year

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
even though they were able to do outdoor
 
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
dining or
 
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
many of them were able to do outdoor
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
dining in many cases that was not able
 
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
to replace
 
00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:34.959 align:start position:0%
what their normal business operations
 
00:10:34.959 --> 00:10:36.069 align:start position:0%
what their normal business operations
were

00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
some of them were able to pivot to take
 
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
out however
 
00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%
takeout again does not replace
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
having people come in sit down in a
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
dining room
 
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
and then you know decide to get dessert
 
00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:50.870 align:start position:0%
and then you know decide to get dessert
when

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
maybe they didn't order dessert versus
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
takeout so their revenues were down
 
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.550 align:start position:0%
takeout so their revenues were down
significantly

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
um hotels and lodging properties had an
 
00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:03.519 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult year we had other
 
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
businesses that
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
were shut down for a significant amount
 
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
of time and that were never able to
 
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
catch up some of our retail businesses
 
00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839 align:start position:0%
experience that so so the answer is it's
 
00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:19.519 align:start position:0%
very much a mixed bag
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
in terms of who did well and who did not
 
00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:24.710 align:start position:0%
in terms of who did well and who did not
well

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
the other question that you asked was
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
did businesses realize that they would
 
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:31.519 align:start position:0%
have to pay
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
tax when they accepted the ppp
 
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh loan and my
 
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
my answer and i and i hope my chamber
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
colleagues will jump in as well
 
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
my businesses and the ones that i've
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
talked to for the most part
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
that was not what they were concerned
 
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
about at the time that they accepted the
 
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.750 align:start position:0%
about at the time that they accepted the
ppp

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
ppp
 
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
the ppp program was put out
 
00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
by congress as a relief program
 
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959 align:start position:0%
and at the time that the ppp was first
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
introduced things were changing very
 
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
very rapidly
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
you know we are sitting here 14 months
 
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.550 align:start position:0%
you know we are sitting here 14 months
away

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
from when we first shut down those first
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
few weeks have shut down
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
things were just changing so rapidly
 
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.949 align:start position:0%
things were just changing so rapidly
businesses

00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden had no revenue coming in
 
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.629 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden had no revenue coming in
[Music]

00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
and had no idea if or when they would be
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
able to reopen
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
and the ppp was their lifeline it was
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
their lifeline to
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
try to hang on to their employees or to
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
keep their employees
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
to try to keep their businesses you know
 
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
for some of our business people
 
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
everything that they have including
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
their home
 
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
is tied up into their business
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
one example is i have a restaurant group
 
00:12:58.949 --> 00:12:58.959 align:start position:0%
that is located in hanover
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
and on the lebanon border and
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
that restaurant group when the shutdown
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
happened they gave away
 
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
100 000 in food
 
00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
they spent three days packaging up the
 
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
food they gave it to their 150 employees
 
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
just furloughed and then they gave the
 
00:13:20.069 --> 00:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
rest of it to
 
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
a local food shelter so for them the ppp
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
was a way to hang on to some of their
 
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:26.949 align:start position:0%
was a way to hang on to some of their
staff

00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
and when they were able to reopen
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
they had to use some of those ppp funds
 
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
to rebuy
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
that hundred thousand dollars of
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
perishable food that they had to let go
 
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
when the shutdown occurred so you know
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of whether they thought they
 
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
were going to be taxed on that program
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
i really don't think it entered their
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
mind they they were looking
 
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
it was survival it was about survival
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
and for many of our businesses
 
00:13:58.949 --> 00:13:58.959 align:start position:0%
it was so i would like to let my chamber
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
colleagues jump in
 
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
at this point as well wendy do you want
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
to go
 
00:14:07.509 --> 00:14:07.519 align:start position:0%
sure um i'd like to thank the committee
 
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
for um hearing us today
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
i think that sorry my voice um
 
00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
i took a little different approach in
 
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
answering your questions
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
the first one what were businesses
 
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
expect exp what was their
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
expectation when they applied for the
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
ppp loan meaning did they expect to have
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
to pay taxes on it
 
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
um i've been hearing from our members
 
00:14:28.959 --> 00:14:29.350 align:start position:0%
um i've been hearing from our members
that

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
they are definitely not back up to
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
operating order
 
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
but i wanted to um the way i approached
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
it was i
 
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
i talked to the source of the money and
 
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.790 align:start position:0%
i talked to the source of the money and
to

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
a cpa and to a financial advisor so the
 
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
first person i talked to was a
 
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
commercial lender
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
and i asked who's a chamber member i
 
00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:48.870 align:start position:0%
and i asked who's a chamber member i
said

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
um i asked her if she'd done the ppp
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
loans and she said she'd done a lot of
 
00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.189 align:start position:0%
loans and she said she'd done a lot of
them

00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
and she said in round one not one single
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
client and she did hundreds of these
 
00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.310 align:start position:0%
client and she did hundreds of these
loans

00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
loans
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
asked the question will i have to pay
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
taxes on this
 
00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
her words this money was a lifeline they
 
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
were out of money
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
and they were just trying to stay afloat
 
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
really compelling to me the next person
 
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
i talked to was a cpa who has many small
 
00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
businesses as clients also a chamber
 
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.829 align:start position:0%
businesses as clients also a chamber
member

00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:17.839 align:start position:0%
member
 
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
he said most businesses intuitively
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
intuitively looked at this as a lifeline
 
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
if the ppp funds were coming out of
 
00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
federal funds most businesses
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
did not stop to think about tax
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
ramifications ramifications on the state
 
00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
level in new hampshire
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
the last person i talked to that chamber
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
member was a financial advisor
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
and she said to many small business
 
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
owners they
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
they told her that they had to dip into
 
00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
their personal savings
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
and taken out second mortgages just to
 
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
try to keep their businesses afloat
 
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
so even with the ppp loans they're still
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
not back to where they should be
 
00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
all of them and our and our chamber
 
00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.110 align:start position:0%
all of them and our and our chamber
members

00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
seem to really um want me to impress
 
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
upon you that this was a pandemic
 
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
we did not see this coming it's probably
 
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
once in a lifetime for many of us
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
they did what they had to do to keep
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
their businesses alive
 
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
um they tried to keep employees and do
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
they tried to do all the right things
 
00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
so i do understand this committee's
 
00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
concern about not you know the tax
 
00:16:18.399 --> 00:16:19.110 align:start position:0%
concern about not you know the tax
revenue

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
that we're going to lose as a state if
 
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
you support this
 
00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:23.759 align:start position:0%
but i can tell you our businesses have
 
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
not recovered um
 
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
if you liken this to the ppp really
 
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
just put our um our businesses back
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
out from the hospital because they were
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
on life support and one of my members
 
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
say we were in life support and the ppp
 
00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:41.829 align:start position:0%
say we were in life support and the ppp
funds

00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:41.839 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
got us back out and going
 
00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:46.959 align:start position:0%
if they have to take pay taxes they're
 
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
going to be back in the emergency room
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
um many other members told me that
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
while they have tried to get back up to
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
full operations they've been unable to
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
because um of the lack of workforce so
 
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
even those that have tried to get back
 
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
you know back to pre-pamdemic have been
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
unable to so i'd like you to factor that
 
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.029 align:start position:0%
unable to so i'd like you to factor that
in

00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:05.039 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
that they're not where they need to be
 
00:17:07.679 --> 00:17:08.470 align:start position:0%
that they're not where they need to be
so

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
the first question of did they expect to
 
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
have to pay taxes
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
not a single one of them entered their
 
00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
minds because they were
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
on absolute their last leg
 
00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
um also the fact that our businesses are
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
not back up
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
i can tell you my office is on main
 
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
street in nashua
 
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
it's still very quiet most restaurants
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
are not open during the day
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
at all for lunch which i find highly
 
00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.110 align:start position:0%
at all for lunch which i find highly
unusual

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
unusual
 
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
um compared to the way it used to be and
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
that means if people aren't coming down
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
to eat the restaurants they're not going
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
to the shops either so
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
um i think the final thing i would say
 
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
is most businesses saw this as a part of
 
00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:47.919 align:start position:0%
a federal
 
00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote rescue plan it wasn't
 
00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:51.909 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote rescue plan it wasn't
perfect

00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
but it did in fact save many businesses
 
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
our net our new hampshire
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
businesses needed rescuing and these
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
funds helped them
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
so i would urge you to please support um
 
00:18:01.679 --> 00:18:02.470 align:start position:0%
so i would urge you to please support um
sp3

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
sp3
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to go who goes next
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh i'd like to don morris from the
 
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
greater salem chamber of commerce and
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
um a lot of this you guys nailed it i
 
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
think um
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
between what tracy had to say and wendy
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
had to say uh again the two the two
 
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.870 align:start position:0%
had to say uh again the two the two
questions

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh how are businesses doing and can they
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
pay that um
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
i don't necessarily agree with the
 
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.470 align:start position:0%
i don't necessarily agree with the
fundamental

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
fundamental
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
premise of that question um given the
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
spirit in which these funds were
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
given a rescue spirit but um it's been
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
very polarized
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
in um in the industries uh people are
 
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
either having great years
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
or horrible years and there's very
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
little in between
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
um so yes some can pay and some
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
probably are not going to be able to
 
00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:54.799 align:start position:0%
even as tracy had said earlier
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
but i think you need to it needs to be
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
realized that
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
um people had to those that are having
 
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
the great year
 
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
they are the you know the the industries
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
that had to pivot or because of the
 
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
pandemic they're having a great year
 
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
whether the people are home so
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
that they have a company that you know
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
trips people out so that they can work
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
remotely or their
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
home improvements because people are
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
there or they've switched their
 
00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:23.750 align:start position:0%
there or they've switched their
uh

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
shampoo industry to make hand sanitizer
 
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
those are not going to as the pandemic
 
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
subsides be sustained in that they're
 
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
going to go back to so even though
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
they're having a great year
 
00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919 align:start position:0%
it's because they pivoted and adjusted
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
to have their business survive and
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
certainly ppp helped that
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
um and then there's the ones where they
 
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:42.710 align:start position:0%
um and then there's the ones where they
were

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
forcibly shut down and tried to and use
 
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
this money to
 
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
survive and keep their employees
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
again most of this has been said and
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
it's been said well but i would like to
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
highlight the fact that
 
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
some of those businesses doing well
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
aren't that necessarily you can't
 
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
project that out
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
and some of them doing poorly hopefully
 
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
they're getting back up and running so
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
it's a longer lens
 
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
of this i'd like to highlight the fact
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
that it was relief money the spirit of
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
that relief money
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
and you're seeing i believe it's up to
 
00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:11.919 align:start position:0%
um 40 other
 
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
states are not taxing this money the
 
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
feds aren't taxing this money
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
um and i also spoke with a couple of
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
cpas that are members to talk to them
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
about what the individual businesses
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
are seeing um did they expect to pay
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
this back
 
00:20:28.149 --> 00:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely not um it was survival things
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
were changing daily
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
all that's been mentioned before there
 
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
was one other things i wanted to um
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
what oh and even the the fact that
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
you go 14 months back we were talking
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
about a virus that we thought could live
 
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
on surfaces for days on
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
end so um that money to keep their
 
00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.430 align:start position:0%
end so um that money to keep their
employees

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
if that wasn't there to keep them they
 
00:20:50.159 --> 00:20:50.470 align:start position:0%
if that wasn't there to keep them they
would

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:20:52.149 --> 00:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
have probably been desperate enough to
 
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
go out and try and do some type of work
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
i mean it
 
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
it actually helped contain the pandemic
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0%
so i think that's something that is
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
getting kind of lost in here too
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
that this was a health crisis we were
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
learning every day
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
and um the businesses were trying to
 
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
survive and
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
the spirit of this money was to to um
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
to help shut down the spread of the
 
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic as well as keep people
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
in business and keep employees um able
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
to pay their bills as well
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh no no i think everything's pretty
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
much been covered i reserve the right to
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
chime in again
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
as things come to my mind valerie you
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
want to take it away
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um i i just need to echo
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
everything that tracy
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
and wendy and donna have said but we'll
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
we'll add two more um
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
just just little pieces to add here and
 
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
but first i do want to thank you all for
 
00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
actually listening for inviting us and
 
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
for actually
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
listening um it doesn't always happen
 
00:21:55.039 --> 00:21:55.590 align:start position:0%
listening um it doesn't always happen
and

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that you folks have been
 
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
willing to do that so thank you for that
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
one of the smaller businesses that i
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
spoke with that shut down
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
and actually had to hibernate over the
 
00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.470 align:start position:0%
and actually had to hibernate over the
winter

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
winter
 
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
said that there's no way that he is
 
00:22:12.149 --> 00:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
going to be in a position to pay that
 
00:22:12.159 --> 00:22:13.430 align:start position:0%
going to be in a position to pay that
tax

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
tax because he's lost so much money he's
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
not going to be taxed
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
he's not he's not going to have to pay
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
any tax because
 
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
he spent all that money on surviving as
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
the others have said
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
so um and he's still not back up he's
 
00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:28.789 align:start position:0%
so um and he's still not back up he's
still

00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
in a he's a small restaurant and
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
he still can't go to capacity and
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
and so for him it's a it's sort of a
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
non-issue he's not going to have to pay
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
the tax because his expenses have
 
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
outweighed his income
 
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
for a a larger restaurant that i've i
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
spent some time with
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
it really is about recovery that
 
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
they don't have the staff they simply do
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
not have the staff
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
to either a open up seven days a week to
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
make the money that they need to make
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
um or b um
 
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
bring in the functions the level of
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
functions and and and you know this was
 
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
happening before combat this is not
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
alcohol but
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
um we've been we've been struggling with
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
workforce particularly in the
 
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
hospitality businesses for a long time
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
for a few years
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
so now they they you can't bring groups
 
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
back those groups that you can bring
 
00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:24.870 align:start position:0%
back those groups that you can bring
back

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
you can only bring back if you have the
 
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
staff to work them
 
00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
and you don't have the staff to work
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
them and to work the restaurants so
 
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
they are not digging out of the hole as
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
i think somebody's already said they're
 
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
just not digging out of the hole so
 
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
did they expect to pay the tax no they
 
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
did not it was a lifeline
 
00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
are they able to pay the tax now are
 
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
they able to come up with the money to
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
pay the tax now
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
no because they cannot make the revenue
 
00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
that they need to make in order to pay
 
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
those taxes
 
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
so um you know as as as
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
as one of them said to me i used that
 
00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
money to pay the bills
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
that's what i used it for i didn't put
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
in the bank i didn't put it aside for
 
00:24:01.679 --> 00:24:02.710 align:start position:0%
in the bank i didn't put it aside for
tax

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
you know i didn't i didn't pocket it i
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
paid my employees and i paid my bills
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
so i have no i you know so
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
i'm just confirming what others have
 
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
already said um that these
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
these folks their backs are against the
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
wall and so this is sort of adding um
 
00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
insult to injury by asking them at this
 
00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:23.919 align:start position:0%
point to now
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
um pay the tax so thank you for
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
listening to us
 
00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
thank you would you take questions
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
within your area nashua
 
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
upper valley et cetera
 
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
i you aware of any
 
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
businesses that wanted to get
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
a ppp loan that was not able to get
 
00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
pp loan and if so why weren't they able
 
00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:03.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
i'll go first we i did have some
 
00:25:07.149 --> 00:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
businesses that
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
investigated uh applying for the ppp
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
loans and and had a couple actually that
 
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
took the loan and then paid it
 
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
immediately back
 
00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
and decided not to stay with it and the
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
reason for that
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
was the the sba was changing things very
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
very rapidly
 
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
there was a there was a lot of changing
 
00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:31.669 align:start position:0%
there was a there was a lot of changing
of

00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
the program and the rules of it
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
you may recall that it started out
 
00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:42.799 align:start position:0%
at 60 percent had to go towards
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
employees but for some of our businesses
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
like restaurants they they had already
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
furloughed their employees because they
 
00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
were literally shut down you know they
 
00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:55.990 align:start position:0%
were literally shut down you know they
were

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
not in operation and so
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
and there were very there were competing
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
programs at the time
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
so the sba when the ppp was first
 
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
introduced it was meant that
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
businesses would retain their employees
 
00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919 align:start position:0%
but then there were also other relief
 
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
programs so it really made more sense
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
for the employees to go on
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
unemployment because there was
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
additional unemployment benefits
 
00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
that made it difficult for some of the
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
businesses to retain their staff and and
 
00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
also they were completely shut down as
 
00:26:34.159 --> 00:26:35.029 align:start position:0%
also they were completely shut down as
well

00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
so it was so confusing for some
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
businesses they started off
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
applying for ppp and then gave it back
 
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
because they were not
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
certain that they were going to meet the
 
00:26:46.799 --> 00:26:47.909 align:start position:0%
certain that they were going to meet the
criteria

00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:47.919 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
and then of course in a later iteration
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
of the ppp
 
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
it was changed so then i think it was 75
 
00:26:55.039 --> 00:26:55.590 align:start position:0%
it was changed so then i think it was 75
percent

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
of your um loan had to go
 
00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
towards for salaries and
 
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
and wages but then you could also use it
 
00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.029 align:start position:0%
and wages but then you could also use it
for

00:27:07.029 --> 00:27:07.039 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
other incidentals as well so it
 
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
it was it was a difficult time the
 
00:27:14.789 --> 00:27:14.799 align:start position:0%
program was changing
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
uh with what i think three iterations of
 
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
the ppp program
 
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
so there were times that the businesses
 
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
i don't think they fully trusted the
 
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
program sometimes
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
so we did have some that had it and then
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
gave it right back
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
we had others that applied and for
 
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
whatever reason
 
00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
were denied it was just
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
until things smoothed out i think in the
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
third iteration
 
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
it was difficult for businesses to
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
really keep up and
 
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
keep abreast as to what the expectations
 
00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.310 align:start position:0%
keep abreast as to what the expectations
were

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
if i may ask those that were denied
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
it was was there a
 
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
particular reason why they were tonight
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
wendy you had your hand raised do you
 
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
want to i wasn't i
 
00:28:06.789 --> 00:28:06.799 align:start position:0%
i don't know about that if you want to
 
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
go ahead and take that one i was going
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
yeah i i can't really say i think it
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
depends you know for some
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
it was dealing with the banks and it
 
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
depended on
 
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
you know whatever particular
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
you know circumstances i mean every
 
00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.149 align:start position:0%
you know circumstances i mean every
application

00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
since they were going through an sba
 
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
lender was a little bit varied and a
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so an answer to the
 
00:28:39.679 --> 00:28:40.310 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so an answer to the
original

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
question um the members that i know that
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
did not apply for pvp
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
were new businesses they did not meet
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
the criteria to
 
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
apply initially for ppp if in fact they
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
lasted long enough which many did not
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
they went out of business
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
um i know one business that i was a
 
00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
member of mine that not only they go out
 
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
of business they got a divorce over it
 
00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.830 align:start position:0%
of business they got a divorce over it
another

00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
fallout from the pandemic but the
 
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
companies that were new
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
that finally um they changed the
 
00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
criteria earlier this year
 
00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
and they were able to file for the
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
second round um
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
i can tell you whatever money they got
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
for the second round was not very much
 
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
and in fact they have been on life
 
00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
support this entire year
 
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
the other thing i'd like to point out in
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
piggybacking on tracy's comments were
 
00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799 align:start position:0%
um others that could not that could not
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
file for the ppp loans
 
00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
i think they just got so frustrated um
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
if you didn't have a relationship with a
 
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
commercial banker
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
good luck trying to get them to fill out
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
the application for you
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
um i can tell you speaking as a
 
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
non-profit we are not a
 
00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:45.039 align:start position:0%
um we are we are a for-profit we're a
 
00:29:45.039 --> 00:29:45.830 align:start position:0%
um we are we are a for-profit we're a
non-profit

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
non-profit
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
but we're a 501c6 so all chambers are
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
basically small businesses
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
and it was very frustrating the first
 
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
round that we were not eligible as 501
 
00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.430 align:start position:0%
round that we were not eligible as 501
c6s

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
c6s
 
00:29:57.909 --> 00:29:57.919 align:start position:0%
we were scrambling ourselves um so i
 
00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
liken myself to a small business
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
it was stressful it was hard to keep
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
staff and it was
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
hard to regroup but we were able to do
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
it um so i hope
 
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
valerie you're checking your head you
 
00:30:15.029 --> 00:30:15.039 align:start position:0%
well i was i was glad that wendy brought
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
that up we are c6's and we were not
 
00:30:18.389 --> 00:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
eligible we have been
 
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
made eligible in the next in this most
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
recent round and so
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
we did receive the ppp funding
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
um for the second round but
 
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
honestly had that not changed had that
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
status not
 
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
changed we would be in a whole lot of
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
trouble right now so
 
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
um i i as wendy said we're small
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
businesses as well we weren't eligible
 
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
and those lifelines have been
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely critical to our our
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
continuation here so
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
uh i i don't know what other i am not
 
00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919 align:start position:0%
aware of other
 
00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:56.440 align:start position:0%
businesses to answer directly for
 
00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.149 align:start position:0%
businesses to answer directly for
non-c6s

00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
non-c6s
 
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
um some of them just just chose not to
 
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
go through the hassle i know that but
 
00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:03.039 align:start position:0%
otherwise i
 
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
i can't answer it for other businesses
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative romney
 
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
followed by representative nunes
 
00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%
and tucker representative thank you
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
mr i have two uh specific questions
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh first one tracy uh i just want to
 
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
make sure we're defining our terms
 
00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
revenue versus profit so when you say
 
00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
that some businesses revenue is up
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh other business revenue is down uh
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
that's revenue but net profit
 
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
the profit though would you with the
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
same the same as
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
true for profits as well as just gross
 
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.750 align:start position:0%
true for profits as well as just gross
revenue

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
in some cases yes i mean we i have had
 
00:31:47.509 --> 00:31:47.519 align:start position:0%
some members that said to me that they
 
00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
that 2020 was actually a a pretty good
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
year for them and
 
00:31:55.029 --> 00:31:55.039 align:start position:0%
and was a profitable year again those
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
are very
 
00:31:58.950 --> 00:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
industry specific businesses
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
um you know some of my retail businesses
 
00:32:02.159 --> 00:32:02.549 align:start position:0%
um you know some of my retail businesses
they

00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
saw a little bump in the fall um even
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
though we were not supposed to have
 
00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:09.039 align:start position:0%
visitors in the state we did
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
and you know we had visitors coming that
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
were hiking
 
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
and doing outdoor activities and in some
 
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
cases some of my retail businesses
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
did see a bump up in business
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
however they had been down you know from
 
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
march until september
 
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
you know 30 40 50 percent
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
if not more so
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
their revenues went up but did they
 
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
overall profit i would say no
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
they did not donna you want to comment
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i i was talking with again some
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
of our cpa members and and
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
you you great great commenting question
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
um because for example a couple of our
 
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:56.549 align:start position:0%
um because for example a couple of our
members

00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
members are um car dealers where they're
 
00:32:59.360 --> 00:32:59.750 align:start position:0%
members are um car dealers where they're
in

00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
you know if the price of their product
 
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
is large and it goes up it may it may
 
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
show that like the revenues are up but
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
if their expenses are up as well
 
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
their profits aren't so it needs to be
 
00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
looked at on all dimensions not just the
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
revenue dimension
 
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
and uh i think that is an excellent
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
point i know that that's been coming up
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
with the whole
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
main street part um but
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
um ppp i i also want to go back to a
 
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
little bit of um
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
i wanted to chime in on the whole that
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
we are 501 c 6's
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh never mind i don't i won't go
 
00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:33.990 align:start position:0%
uh never mind i don't i won't go
backwards

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
backwards
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
but um the ppp has been used for what
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
you know and it's not it's not 100
 
00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
it's a percentage to help with rent
 
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
and salaries and things like that so
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
being aware of revenue versus profit is
 
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
super important have the follow-up
 
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
mr chair follow-up which is really a
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
second question i
 
00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate it so uh valerie you you
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
needing the money to find staff so the
 
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
good news is that
 
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
governor sununu is doing away with the
 
00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.550 align:start position:0%
governor sununu is doing away with the
300

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
300
 
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
that the feds want to give but then he's
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
converted that
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
per i saw the news story this morning uh
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
he's converted that to
 
00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar bonuses for
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
if someone uh gets a job
 
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
that's unemployed currently thousand
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
dollar bonus from
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
from the state of new hampshire using
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
federal money by the way
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
uh i forget the exact number but i think
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
it covers 10 000 people or something
 
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
there's enough money in there for 10 000
 
00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
people and i guess you got to be in the
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
job for six weeks is what what the news
 
00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
story said
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
now interestingly enough i had a
 
00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%
conversation with
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
one of the founders of aroma joe's i
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have a roman joe's in
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
your various
 
00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
locations and his his comment to me was
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
you know that if we tax the the
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
the forgiveness revenue just
 
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
that money i can use i could you know if
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
we don't tax that
 
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
that he can use that money to give
 
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
bonuses to because he's a he's a he's a
 
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
restaurant guy i mean he's a
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
coffee shop kind of guy and they they
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
having so much trouble finding people
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
that he he was going to use some of the
 
00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:19.670 align:start position:0%
that he he was going to use some of the
money

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
instead to to provide bonuses uh signing
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
bonuses so
 
00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
can you can you four of you just chime
 
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
in and to where your businesses are
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
because that's the biggest problem we
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
have it's finding employees and we have
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
35 000 people on unemployment
 
00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
so we kind of incentivized these 35 000
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
people to want to be in the workforce
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
again so
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
does anybody want to chime in on that
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for asking
 
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
representative abrami um
 
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
i have i applaud the governor for to
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
fight for
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
creating some incentives for hiring on
 
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.030 align:start position:0%
creating some incentives for hiring on
staff

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that six weeks is not
 
00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
going to get us through the summer so if
 
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
they stay for six weeks and get their
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
they could then quit so that's that's
 
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
not going to get us very far and if you
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
are of the mindset that you're not
 
00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:07.589 align:start position:0%
are of the mindset that you're not
working

00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
because you get your 300 a week you
 
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
might also be in the mindset to stay for
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
six weeks and leave
 
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
but more importantly i think we need to
 
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of other issues that are
 
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
causing people and not going back to
 
00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:21.190 align:start position:0%
causing people and not going back to
work

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
number one being child care um kids are
 
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
not all back in school
 
00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:29.839 align:start position:0%
they they they parents are home because
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
they don't have child care and there's a
 
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
disproportionate number of women by the
 
00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.230 align:start position:0%
disproportionate number of women by the
way

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
who are not working because they're the
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
primary caregivers and so they're home
 
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
they're also the primary caregivers for
 
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
their parents or those who are who have
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
been sick with cohen
 
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
so there are family issues there and
 
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
there's also a number of people who are
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
not yet comfortable
 
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
coming back in particularly front line
 
00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
jobs there are not enough people
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
vaccinated yet
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
that this frontline staff is willing to
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
come back and take that risk and until
 
00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
more people are vaccinated
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
they're holding back and saying no i
 
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
really i really do not feel comfortable
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
coming back in and putting myself and my
 
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
elderly parents
 
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
or my children at risk at risk because
 
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
i'm putting myself at risk so there are
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
a number of other i i think
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
more more compelling reasons like
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
why people are not coming back
 
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
so the the 300
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
supplement for some certainly hopefully
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
will will
 
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh and and the incentives will hopefully
 
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
bring them back
 
00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
um the the other thing is and i think
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
that that donald just or somebody just
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
touched on this
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
is the opportunity the requirement
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
now by restaurants competitively
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
to pay higher wages this was not in the
 
00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:57.829 align:start position:0%
to pay higher wages this was not in the
plan

00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
this is not part of their budget this
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
was not something that they expected
 
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
but they do have to do this we we had an
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
incident this week
 
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
where one of our small pubs he just he
 
00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:08.630 align:start position:0%
where one of our small pubs he just he
like

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
opened in like like december
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
19. so this poor young man
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
has been doing everything possible to
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
stay alive
 
00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:23.839 align:start position:0%
and he just posted
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
on social media that he was looking for
 
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
staff and he was willing to pay them
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
something like 13
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
an hour and he was eviscerated on social
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
because he wasn't paying enough
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
now this is for weight staff wait staff
 
00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:36.790 align:start position:0%
now this is for weight staff wait staff
makes

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
makes
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of money in portsmouth
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
with tips with gratuities so
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
this poor guy is trying to do the right
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
thing he's trying to raise
 
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
from two dollars to thirteen dollars and
 
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
and uh he needs first of all he's been
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
told it's not enough
 
00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
um secondly uh he needs the business in
 
00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
order to be able it's
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
sort of this whole chicken egg thing i
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
need the staff to be able to serve the
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
customers i need the customers to come
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
to come in to pay the staff so there's a
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
real chicken egg thing happening right
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
now which is causing a whole lot of
 
00:39:10.079 --> 00:39:10.870 align:start position:0%
now which is causing a whole lot of
stress

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
stress
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
for particularly our hospitality
 
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
businesses hopefully that answered your
 
00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:15.990 align:start position:0%
businesses hopefully that answered your
question

00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you keller and i just can i
 
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
just make a quick comment
 
00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
so when i talked to you know my initial
 
00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:23.589 align:start position:0%
so when i talked to you know my initial
comments

00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
i i was talking about this inability to
 
00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
find workers
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
as part of the reasons that our
 
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
businesses not have businesses have not
 
00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:31.750 align:start position:0%
businesses not have businesses have not
recovered

00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
recovered
 
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
definitely in the restaurant industry
 
00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
but even you know trying to find
 
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
you know the employees for roman joes
 
00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.230 align:start position:0%
you know the employees for roman joes
and

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
as representative um abrami said that
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
aroma jones actually is a drive-through
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
so if he can't find them
 
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
you know people to to do the
 
00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
drive-through the restaurants that need
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
servers and dishwashers and everything
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
else they're
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
they're just not back up to where they
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
um they use that ppp money to pay the
 
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
wages to pay the rent
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
you know they had to spend it on certain
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
amount of money as one of my colleagues
 
00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:04.870 align:start position:0%
amount of money as one of my colleagues
said

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
they weren't putting in the bank and
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
sitting on it they didn't add on to
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
their houses they didn't do anything fun
 
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
with it
 
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
they were just trying to survive so if
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the workforce
 
00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:14.470 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the workforce
shortage

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
shortage
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
i think the important point is it is it
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
definitely exists
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's not it's terrible right now um i
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
applaud the governor's um moves on
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
you know no longer providing the extra
 
00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:28.790 align:start position:0%
you know no longer providing the extra
300

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
300
 
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
a month and the thousand signing bonus
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
but but i just impressed upon you that
 
00:40:34.309 --> 00:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
that is this is part of the reason that
 
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
the businesses have not recovered
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
thank you everybody um we have one two
 
00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:40.870 align:start position:0%
thank you everybody um we have one two

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
four five six more to ask questions so
 
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
we're gonna keep it to two questions
 
00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:48.390 align:start position:0%
we're gonna keep it to two questions
maximum

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman and i want to
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
thank all of you for joining us today
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
getting the information
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
in from you from the people who work in
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
the towns
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
that you guys help represent in a
 
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
business sense
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
this is information that we don't get
 
00:41:14.069 --> 00:41:14.079 align:start position:0%
all the time i i want to shift back just
 
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
to ask a question about your members and
 
00:41:17.839 --> 00:41:19.349 align:start position:0%
to ask a question about your members and
businesses

00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
are there are is there any population of
 
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:22.870 align:start position:0%
are there are is there any population of
them

00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
who took the loan but are having
 
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
issues at this point qualifying for the
 
00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:29.670 align:start position:0%
issues at this point qualifying for the
forgiveness

00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
forgiveness
 
00:41:31.829 --> 00:41:31.839 align:start position:0%
or do not qualify for the goodness
 
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
because i think part of what we're
 
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
trying to understand
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
is is there going to be taxable
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
um uh on any of this at all
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
and do we need to just forgive all of it
 
00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's two different questions because
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
there are guidelines that were given out
 
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
we've talked about this already the
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
guidelines that were given out for 60
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
or 75 percent has to be applied to a
 
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
certain amount
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
i know small businesses in town that
 
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
took the loan
 
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
and said well we took the loan but we're
 
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
having problems
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
meeting the guidelines were the
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
guidelines too stringent or
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
or do you have any reports about any of
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%

qualified for the forgiveness i have not
 
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
qualifying for forgiveness yeah i i
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
would say the same
 
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
most of our businesses that have taken
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
the loan have
 
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
have uh qualified for the forgiveness
 
00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
i i can tell you i have had businesses
 
00:42:40.319 --> 00:42:40.790 align:start position:0%
i i can tell you i have had businesses
that

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
took the loan and then of course they
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
also applied for the main street relief
 
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
funds and i've had some businesses that
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
then came back to me afterwards and said
 
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
we're we're still not making it is there
 
00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
anything else i can apply for
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
okay i concur i haven't heard of anyone
 
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
that applied for forgiveness that
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
what wasn't granted it thank you very
 
00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.309 align:start position:0%
what wasn't granted it thank you very
much

00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative ames
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
followed by rep
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
spillsbury okay thank you
 
00:43:19.109 --> 00:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
and thank you all for joining us and
 
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
providing us with this information
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
we have experienced as you may have
 
00:43:25.359 --> 00:43:25.990 align:start position:0%
we have experienced as you may have
observed

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
observed
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
a spike in our business profit
 
00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
tax revenue um
 
00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:32.309 align:start position:0%
tax revenue um
[Music]

00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to understand
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
what why it derives mostly from
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
a combination of uh money paid
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
to as part of getting an extension on
 
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
the filing
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
filing deadline for a return and also
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
money paid on
 
00:43:56.309 --> 00:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
estimates one theory is that a good
 
00:43:59.670 --> 00:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
part of it is
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
represents payment of tax
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
on ppp loans no proof of that but that's
 
00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
thoughts um and there are some
 
00:44:14.309 --> 00:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
indicators that suggest that
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
that's happened in some cases so my
 
00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
question to you is whether
 
00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
um you have uh any knowledge of some
 
00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:23.950 align:start position:0%
businesses um
 
00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:25.030 align:start position:0%
businesses um
[Music]

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
paying bbt tax
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
on the um the ppp loan that they've
 
00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:33.750 align:start position:0%
on the um the ppp loan that they've
received

00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
received
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps with the hope that they'll get a
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
refund later on
 
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
but nonetheless going ahead and making
 
00:44:44.069 --> 00:44:44.079 align:start position:0%
that payment
 
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
so i specifically asked um a cpa that's
 
00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
on my board
 
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
this exact question um because i i
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
understood there were concerns with this
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
committee about
 
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
the taxes that had been paid and the
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
nightmare of the dra
 
00:44:59.589 --> 00:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
dra having to refund it that would come
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
to come to fruition
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
and he said without exception um they
 
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
just paid them
 
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
in hopes that it would be refunded
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
um i don't think any of them
 
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
were thinking that far ahead to be
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
honest um if they were
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
so that was for the 2020 taxes if they
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
were forgiven last year like for example
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
ours he didn't apply for until this year
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't impact us
 
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
um but he seemed to think that um i
 
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
asked him you know
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
what you know how tough that would be
 
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
for the dra to refund and he said they
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
would just have to come up with some
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
regulations and refund it
 
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
um and i believe that's what most of the
 
00:45:35.589 --> 00:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
cpas were advising their clients
 
00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
according to the cpa i talked to that
 
00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
they said go ahead and pay them and we
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
could file for a refund
 
00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:41.839 align:start position:0%
an amended tax return with the state and
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
then a refund
 
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839 align:start position:0%
and if i may chime into uh so i i spoke
 
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
with uh two
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
cpas that each had over you know 100
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
clients each that had
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
done ppp and there's a significant
 
00:45:56.079 --> 00:45:57.030 align:start position:0%
done ppp and there's a significant
frustration

00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
frustration
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
with this as well this was introduced
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to be some fast-track
 
00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:02.230 align:start position:0%
supposed to be some fast-track
legislation

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
and um the senate voted
 
00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
unanimously in favor back in march and
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh to seek
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
most of the cpa community was was
 
00:46:13.829 --> 00:46:13.839 align:start position:0%
waiting and waiting and waiting and
 
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
filing for extensions to find out if
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
this it would not would or would not be
 
00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.190 align:start position:0%
this it would not would or would not be
taxable

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
taxable
 
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
and um they ended up just having to file
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
as if it
 
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
was and then cross their fingers that'll
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
be in reverse reimbursed and that the
 
00:46:27.599 --> 00:46:27.990 align:start position:0%
be in reverse reimbursed and that the
committee

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:46:32.069 --> 00:46:32.079 align:start position:0%
will recognize the spirit in which these
 
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
funds were provided in the middle of a
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
pandemic as a rescue package
 
00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
and for specific things which the
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
businesses then use them for
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
so there there's a little frustration
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
there too as well i don't know if any
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
other chamber people got
 
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
an earful from their uh accountants who
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
are usually already stressed out
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
valerie do you have anything to add to
 
00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:58.150 align:start position:0%
valerie do you have anything to add to
that

00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
i i do not i think that uh wendy and and
 
00:47:01.119 --> 00:47:01.750 align:start position:0%
i i do not i think that uh wendy and and
donna

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
donna
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
have spoken well about that i
 
00:47:07.109 --> 00:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
i i keep going back to the fact that
 
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a rescue package
 
00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
this this is what allowed these people
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
they paid people
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
when they were closed so they and and
 
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
quite frankly they felt like they were
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
throwing the money throwing money away
 
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
because they had to close they didn't
 
00:47:24.549 --> 00:47:24.559 align:start position:0%
have staff they still paid them with the
 
00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
ppp money
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
they felt like they were throwing money
 
00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
away and now we're going to tax them
 
00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
so i i'm struggling
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
with with the fact that this was
 
00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.790 align:start position:0%
with with the fact that this was
intended

00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
intended
 
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
for good and and i and i totally doubt
 
00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
that the state
 
00:47:44.829 --> 00:47:44.839 align:start position:0%
um is concerned about losing was it
 
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
200.2 million
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh that i think you've calculated i i
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
totally get that
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
but taking it from the folks who are
 
00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:53.910 align:start position:0%
but taking it from the folks who are
still

00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
trying desperately to get back on track
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative spillsbury
 
00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:09.839 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you mr chairman i i
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
all four of you for being here because
 
00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
you're giving us
 
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh illustrations of things that fade in
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
our minds
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
the intensity the uncertainty the
 
00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:25.589 align:start position:0%
the intensity the uncertainty the
unknown

00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
unknown
 
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
no sense of how deep it would go
 
00:48:30.549 --> 00:48:30.559 align:start position:0%
whether they'd have to close completely
 
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
all these things
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
i think we do need to be reminded of and
 
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
i have an enormous amount of sympathy
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
for the businesses
 
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
that struggled without
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps an option that they could pin it
 
00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:44.549 align:start position:0%
perhaps an option that they could pin it
to

00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:44.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
um so it was mentioned before that
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
that it's very polarized that there are
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
skewed results
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
that some businesses did well in other
 
00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:56.630 align:start position:0%
that some businesses did well in other
businesses

00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
may never recover so here's my question
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
in sb3 we're really dealing only with
 
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
those businesses
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
that did generate a profit
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
those that closed
 
00:49:16.319 --> 00:49:29.030 align:start position:0%
those that closed
not

00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
sb3 available and
 
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
ironically to the extent that sb3
 
00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
will benefit businesses it will benefit
 
00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:39.109 align:start position:0%
will benefit businesses it will benefit
them

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
in proportion to how well they did
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
those that did really well will benefit
 
00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
really well
 
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
if i'm sitting here perplexed and
 
00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.270 align:start position:0%
if i'm sitting here perplexed and
wondering

00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
how sp3 is going to help those most in
 
00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:59.270 align:start position:0%
how sp3 is going to help those most in
need

00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:01.839 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering whether any of you have
 
00:50:01.839 --> 00:50:03.349 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering whether any of you have
considered

00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
suggestions or thoughts that the ways
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
and means committee might take under
 
00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:09.030 align:start position:0%
and means committee might take under
advisement

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
advisement
 
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
to better target the businesses that
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative i i'm not sure i
 
00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:26.069 align:start position:0%
representative i i'm not sure i
understand

00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:26.079 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:50:30.069 --> 00:50:30.079 align:start position:0%
the question so i i expected you to end
 
00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
that question with um how we would
 
00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
target those businesses
 
00:50:37.109 --> 00:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
who actually could pay the tax so i'm
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that i understand
 
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
the question but um
 
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
i i will say that you know in the
 
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
in the restaurant revitalization fund
 
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
the rrf
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
fund the calculations
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
are are really based on the revenue that
 
00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
you generated that wasn't part of a
 
00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:57.670 align:start position:0%
you generated that wasn't part of a
grant

00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
grant
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
and just speaking for the chamber and we
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
get grants
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
jpp grants joint promotional program
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
grants from the
 
00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
state travel and tourism department
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
if i had to pay taxes on those grants
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
they're not loans they're grants if i
 
00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:14.559 align:start position:0%
had to pay taxes on those grants
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
as a non-profit i probably wouldn't be
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
able to take them
 
00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
or i'd have to minimize what i take
 
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
because i can't i can't risk
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
having to pay those taxes so and i
 
00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
wonder how many of our businesses feel
 
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
that way
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
so i wonder maybe others
 
00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
are not confused by the question but i
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
think i am so
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just sharpen the question
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
because uh
 
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
i think you're addressing something
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
because i am sympathetic with those
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
businesses that struggled and failed to
 
00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
make a profit
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering how we would do something
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
that helped
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
carried the burden and took the pain
 
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
most from the pandemic
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
rather than to give a tax benefit to
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
well that's an interesting oh sorry
 
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
donna go ahead
 
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
i i just think some of that is being
 
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
done beyond this i think on the
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
key part in that uh i think valerie
 
00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
nailed it there's there's so many things
 
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
that that overlap here
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
with workers and child care and we're
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
seeing some of that we're seeing
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
uh you know the governor not
 
00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
get rid of the three hundred dollars
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
that was a big complaint the six hundred
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
dollars trying to get employees
 
00:52:41.829 --> 00:52:41.839 align:start position:0%
back and they were earning more by not
 
00:52:41.839 --> 00:52:42.549 align:start position:0%
back and they were earning more by not
working

00:52:42.549 --> 00:52:42.559 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
but then there's the whole so that it's
 
00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
happening in other arenas
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
with with child care vouchers and
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
incentives to get people back to work
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
and taking away incentives to for people
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
not to work
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
um so i think those are the things that
 
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
are that are gonna
 
00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
help those that have struggled most but
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
it's an interesting question i'll think
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
on it while uh wendy talks too i don't
 
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
know if there's something more creative
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
that we can do as well
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
um child care vouchers is interesting
 
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
i well in answering that particular
 
00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:13.990 align:start position:0%
i well in answering that particular
question

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm hearing right is you're very
 
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
concerned about the ones that are barely
 
00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
hanging on
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand you don't want to
 
00:53:22.079 --> 00:53:23.190 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand you don't want to
um

00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
you know if a company did well you don't
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
want them to have
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
and had had a great year like i could
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
tell little grocery stores around us
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
they were the only thing open for food
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
um so what you're saying is that the
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
ones that did really well that probably
 
00:53:37.349 --> 00:53:37.359 align:start position:0%
had their best year ever
 
00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
you have a hard time you know having
 
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
them not pay taxes
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
but if you look at it another way the
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
ones that did really well
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that pivoted they
 
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
changed their business model
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
so i i see what you're saying it's a lot
 
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
of revenue
 
00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:53.839 align:start position:0%
but i don't see how you can parse it out
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think there were that many
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
corporations or companies or small
 
00:53:56.559 --> 00:53:57.270 align:start position:0%
corporations or companies or small
businesses

00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:53:59.430 --> 00:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
that did have their best year ever ever
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
i think that's a very small number of
 
00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:02.069 align:start position:0%
i think that's a very small number of
businesses

00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
um and i don't see how you can split it
 
00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:05.349 align:start position:0%
um and i don't see how you can split it
out

00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
um but i do i do see your point that
 
00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
they're being they've already had the
 
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
best year ever and here we're going to
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
reward them more
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
by not taxing them on on any of that but
 
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
i just think it's a it's there aren't
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
that many cases
 
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
and from my broad reach of my members
 
00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
are go from a one-person shop up to some
 
00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
of the biggest companies
 
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
in the country um so i would just keep
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
that in mind i don't know how you're
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
gonna be able to split hairs on that but
 
00:54:31.829 --> 00:54:31.839 align:start position:0%
i do understand what your question is
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
and and wendy just to add to that point
 
00:54:35.829 --> 00:54:35.839 align:start position:0%
they pivoted and they did well i thought
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
i said this earlier you don't know how
 
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
long that's going to last
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
you know the math making business was
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
insane but as
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
mass restrictions that that's going to
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
dip back down and same thing with home
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
improvement once that
 
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
deck is put on or that or that kitchen
 
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
is redone it's redone
 
00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
so they're riding the wave of uh
 
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
pivoting and having their best year
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
ever and it really i know even at the
 
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
chamber level we
 
00:55:00.789 --> 00:55:00.799 align:start position:0%
we didn't do a one-year budget we looked
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
out two
 
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
two and a half years like what came in
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
here isn't necessary you know the grants
 
00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
and the funds here isn't necessarily
 
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
going to come back again
 
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
and things that went virtual are going
 
00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
to go
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
that we had to take things virtual the
 
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
revenues were down as we get back to in
 
00:55:20.789 --> 00:55:20.799 align:start position:0%
so looking at that they had a great year
 
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
and almost
 
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
penalizing that success because that's
 
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
what it feels like
 
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
um who knows next year
 
00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
i i think that goes back to the the
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
revenue versus profits
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
question and and one thing i can use to
 
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
illustrate that
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
in in our area we have a locally owned
 
00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
grocery store it was just reported
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
recently that they had a very very
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
good year it happens to be a co-op so if
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
extra funds they can give it back to
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
their members
 
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
however their expenses
 
00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
have gone up hugely due to
 
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
supply chain issues due to
 
00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
just the cost of goods uh the cost of
 
00:56:09.119 --> 00:56:10.549 align:start position:0%
just the cost of goods uh the cost of
transportation

00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:10.559 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
all of those things have increased so
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
while their revenue may be
 
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
up their profits are not and in fact
 
00:56:19.589 --> 00:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
they've had almost a flat year
 
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
so i i think that you know that has to
 
00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:22.950 align:start position:0%
so i i think that you know that has to
be

00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
considered as well and and for some of
 
00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
our other businesses
 
00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
too construction they had a great year
 
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
last year they
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of people were putting on
 
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
those decks and
 
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
redoing those kitchens and the cost of
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
construction materials
 
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
i went to buy some pressure treated wood
 
00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:43.829 align:start position:0%
i went to buy some pressure treated wood
last

00:56:43.829 --> 00:56:43.839 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
weekend for my garden and almost fell
 
00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:47.349 align:start position:0%
weekend for my garden and almost fell
over

00:56:47.349 --> 00:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
when i was paying over fifteen dollars
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
for an eight foot board
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's you know the cost of goods has been
 
00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:55.390 align:start position:0%
it's you know the cost of goods has been
just

00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:55.400 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
extraordinary so it it really is
 
00:57:01.829 --> 00:57:01.839 align:start position:0%
the revenue versus profits issue
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
mr chairman there follow-up um
 
00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
yes one follow-up thank you
 
00:57:12.069 --> 00:57:12.079 align:start position:0%
this revenue versus profit distinction i
 
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
think really does need to stay in the
 
00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:15.839 align:start position:0%
forefront of our mind i'm glad that you
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
so to to boil this down
 
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
every dollar of ppp forgiven which
 
00:57:30.069 --> 00:57:30.079 align:start position:0%
under the current law becomes a taxed
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
a taxable dollar is offset by a
 
00:57:33.119 --> 00:57:33.829 align:start position:0%
a taxable dollar is offset by a
qualified

00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
qualified
 
00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:37.640 align:start position:0%
expense and so
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
effectively there is no tax
 
00:57:44.069 --> 00:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
on ppp money um
 
00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
the only question we're really exploring
 
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
with sp3
 
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
is whether to allow those expenses to
 
00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
then be taken a second time against
 
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
income otherwise earned so if
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
if you could just agree with me that
 
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's not the ppp dollars that are
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
exposed to tax
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
it's only the extent that there are
 
00:58:06.839 --> 00:58:08.069 align:start position:0%
it's only the extent that there are
profits

00:58:08.069 --> 00:58:08.079 align:start position:0%
profits
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
beyond the ppv dollars which were offset
 
00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:11.670 align:start position:0%
beyond the ppv dollars which were offset
by

00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
the things that they paid for so
 
00:58:20.829 --> 00:58:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:20.839 --> 00:58:24.549 align:start position:0%
 
affecting

00:58:24.549 --> 00:58:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
so i if i may
 
00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
i think we've talked about those members
 
00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:30.950 align:start position:0%
i think we've talked about those members
that

00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
but don't know what the future holds so
 
00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
if you're asking them to pay tax on
 
00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:41.349 align:start position:0%
if you're asking them to pay tax on
dollars

00:58:41.349 --> 00:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
that they did not expect to pay tax on
 
00:58:44.319 --> 00:58:45.270 align:start position:0%
that they did not expect to pay tax on
because

00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
their revenue the ppp dollars are in
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
their revenue right they're in there
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
they're in their income stream so
 
00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:56.559 align:start position:0%
that bumps up their their revenue
 
00:58:58.309 --> 00:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
and if you're asking them to pay tax on
 
00:59:00.309 --> 00:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
that that they weren't expecting to pay
 
00:59:02.829 --> 00:59:02.839 align:start position:0%
and didn't put the dollars aside for
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
possibly or more importantly
 
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
cannot come up with it because they
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
what the next year holds there are some
 
00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
businesses that aren't going to recover
 
00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
until late into 22
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
some of them into 23 is what they've
 
00:59:21.030 --> 00:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
told us
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
so it's the uncertainty i think
 
00:59:26.309 --> 00:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
that we're that we're talking about here
 
00:59:26.319 --> 00:59:30.829 align:start position:0%
that we're that we're talking about here
and

00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:30.839 --> 00:59:37.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
oh i agree and the uncertainty and we
 
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
can see that with the fact that
 
00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559 align:start position:0%
uh someone had mentioned it earlier
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:45.839 align:start position:0%
you know you're gonna probably have to
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
pay more
 
00:59:48.549 --> 00:59:48.559 align:start position:0%
for employees you're gonna have to pay
 
00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
the lumbers up three times
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
it it it's um yeah it's the
 
00:59:55.349 --> 00:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
unpredictability which is
 
00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
where we were 14 months ago it's
 
00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:58.390 align:start position:0%
where we were 14 months ago it's
unpredictable

00:59:58.390 --> 00:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
unpredictable
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
um we're trying our best here but um
 
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:01.750 align:start position:0%
um we're trying our best here but um
question

01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
yeah profits beyond the ppp like i still
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
feel like
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's theirs instead of it being taxed
 
01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
on it that's theirs to reinvest either
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
in keeping their staff
 
01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
hiring new staff uh anticipating future
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
expenses that might be increased
 
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
i think it's it's got to have a more
 
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
long-term vision that
 
01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:31.839 align:start position:0%
you know it's okay that
 
01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
okay when do you want to add to that so
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
i i'm not looking at the future
 
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
of what the businesses we're going to
 
01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
use at it i'm looking at the language
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
from the ppp loan forgiveness itself
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
had to be used for certain expenses we
 
01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
didn't put the money away
 
01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
it was used for payroll it was used for
 
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
rent it was used for keeping us afloat
 
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
i can tell you our chamber used it for
 
01:00:53.589 --> 01:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
the proper reasons and i believe most
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
businesses did
 
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
that money's gone but not only is that
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
money gone we were making up for the
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
months and months and months that we had
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
no income coming in
 
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
so i i just think it's a misperception
 
01:01:06.069 --> 01:01:06.079 align:start position:0%
that there's all this there's been all
 
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
this money sitting around i understand
 
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
your question
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing in talking to um some
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
accountants was
 
01:01:14.549 --> 01:01:14.559 align:start position:0%
a lot of the business owners have felt
 
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
like this was federal tax money
 
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
they already paid taxes and that's where
 
01:01:20.069 --> 01:01:20.079 align:start position:0%
that money came from
 
01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
so are we gonna tax it again i'm just
 
01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
i'm just
 
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know i i'm an attorney by trade
 
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
some years ago so that just
 
01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
that training comes back back to me that
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
it's already been
 
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
taxed income they already paid taxes and
 
01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
they've got that money back
 
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
via the ppp so i it wasn't free money
 
01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
nobody treated it like free money and if
 
01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
they did shame on them
 
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
but i'm telling you the businesses that
 
01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
are chamber members and the businesses
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
that we all helped
 
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
that were non-chamber members i can tell
 
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
you every person on this call we didn't
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
care if it was a chamber member or not
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
we were going to get the best and
 
01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
fastest information out
 
01:01:55.589 --> 01:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
because a strong business community
 
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
makes a strong economy a strong economy
 
01:02:00.309 --> 01:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
makes a strong community to live so
 
01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:01.839 align:start position:0%
that's why we all killed ourselves
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
trying to help
 
01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
all the businesses not just our members
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
so i can tell you very
 
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
few didn't the minute we got our check
 
01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
we were paying ourselves back in other
 
01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
words because we were had dipped into
 
01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:13.750 align:start position:0%
words because we were had dipped into
our

01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
personal reserves um as business owners
 
01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
i don't mean the chamber but i'm saying
 
01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
you know i know businesses that had to
 
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
take out a personal line of credit
 
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
or take a second mortgage on their house
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
to keep their businesses afloat
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
so that when that ppp money arrived so
 
01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
much later
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
they were it's like you know they paid
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
bills and employees out of their own
 
01:02:34.319 --> 01:02:35.190 align:start position:0%
bills and employees out of their own
money

01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
um so i just really can't stress that
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
that this is not
 
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
they don't have a bunch of money lying
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
around i don't think they're going to
 
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
can i add to that just quickly uh mr
 
01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:49.510 align:start position:0%
can i add to that just quickly uh mr
chair

01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
yes i wonder if the perspective might be
 
01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
that this
 
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
is an investment that the state can make
 
01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
in the future of these businesses
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
rather than trying to collect it from
 
01:03:00.829 --> 01:03:00.839 align:start position:0%
them um
 
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
i because what we're saying is that
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
because of uncertainty these businesses
 
01:03:08.069 --> 01:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
don't know what their
 
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
future expenses their higher payroll
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
their higher lumber whatever it is
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
and i wonder if the the perspective can
 
01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
shift to an
 
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
investment because these businesses are
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
going to be able to pay bpt
 
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
at some point if they stay in business
 
01:03:24.069 --> 01:03:24.079 align:start position:0%
and they're not going to be able to be
 
01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
paid bbt ept
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
if they don't stay in business and i'm
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
asking you to look at that perspective
 
01:03:37.029 --> 01:03:37.039 align:start position:0%
okay i would agree with valerie there's
 
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
there's so many businesses that are are
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
just trying to crawl back
 
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
out this year and next year is still
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
looking very uncertain
 
01:03:50.029 --> 01:03:50.039 align:start position:0%
for them and again costs are rising
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
exponentially for some of these
 
01:03:52.799 --> 01:03:53.750 align:start position:0%
exponentially for some of these
businesses

01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
their supply chains have not yet
 
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.029 align:start position:0%
their supply chains have not yet
recovered

01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
recovered
 
01:03:59.270 --> 01:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
i in fact i was talking with a hardware
 
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
store yesterday
 
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
who said uh their business has been
 
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
steady has been good they're one of
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
those businesses that was
 
01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
you know in more of the in terms of
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
retail was in more of the essential
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
category so they
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
they are recovering but they cannot get
 
01:04:17.119 --> 01:04:18.069 align:start position:0%
they are recovering but they cannot get
product

01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
product
 
01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
so their business is is not only limited
 
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
by the number of people
 
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
that they can hire but they cannot
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
get the product you know their suppliers
 
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
are still not back either you can't sell
 
01:04:32.079 --> 01:04:32.789 align:start position:0%
are still not back either you can't sell
something

01:04:32.789 --> 01:04:32.799 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
if you can't put it in your store so
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
really this is about looking towards
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
the future for these businesses we react
 
01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:43.430 align:start position:0%
the future for these businesses we react
to

01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
the reps certainly i'd like to get to
 
01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
those two and then i have a final
 
01:04:48.319 --> 01:04:49.349 align:start position:0%
those two and then i have a final
question

01:04:49.349 --> 01:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
representation i thank you mr chairman
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you to the speakers uh you've
 
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
made a lot of similar comments
 
01:04:58.870 --> 01:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
that i've heard from the dover chamber
 
01:05:00.549 --> 01:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
near the seacoast
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
i'm glad you highlighted that there are
 
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
many reasons for the unemployment
 
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
my question is about if the chambers are
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
um the recovery you know as far as
 
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
planning for the future
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
because at least in the seacoast a lot
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
of the openings are on food service
 
01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that the small
 
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
percent the currently unemployed people
 
01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
many of them are not a good match for
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
food service you know you really have to
 
01:05:26.549 --> 01:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
have personality
 
01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
and hustle and stamina in some of those
 
01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:30.150 align:start position:0%
and hustle and stamina in some of those
jobs

01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
jobs
 
01:05:32.789 --> 01:05:32.799 align:start position:0%
and so just isn't a good match and poor
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
service is not acceptable
 
01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
to the restaurants it's really not an
 
01:05:37.829 --> 01:05:37.839 align:start position:0%
option so
 
01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
you know i just think it's a little more
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
complicated when you get this close to
 
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
the line
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
of so few unemployed because as you've
 
01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:45.510 align:start position:0%
of so few unemployed because as you've
said

01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
some people can't work because of child
 
01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
care some people
 
01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
can't because um they're still at risk
 
01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
but i just wondered if within your
 
01:05:53.599 --> 01:05:55.109 align:start position:0%
but i just wondered if within your
chambers

01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
chambers
 
01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been what i want to say
 
01:05:58.950 --> 01:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
ideas about
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
kind of doing it the opposite way
 
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
looking at the unemployed and seeing
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
what they could do that you know
 
01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
relatively quickly you could use them
 
01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:06.870 align:start position:0%
relatively quickly you could use them
for

01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
thanks i i'd like to jump on that yes we
 
01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:11.190 align:start position:0%
thanks i i'd like to jump on that yes we
have

01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
and and i know that all of my colleagues
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
and their chambers have as well
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
um quite a few chambers around the state
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
have been working diligently doing
 
01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
various programs for
 
01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
our businesses including you know
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
training programs for employees in the
 
01:06:32.549 --> 01:06:32.559 align:start position:0%
hospitality industry
 
01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:35.839 align:start position:0%
um working with various partners with
 
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
like the
 
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
small business development center here
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
um you know the center for women
 
01:06:47.109 --> 01:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
and enterprise and and other regional
 
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
development corporations there's quite a
 
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
few organizations in the state that are
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
working together
 
01:06:57.510 --> 01:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
to try to address workforce issues so
 
01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
it's something that we are all on top of
 
01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.510 align:start position:0%
it's something that we are all on top of
um

01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
personally i i think that the 300
 
01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
stipend that the governor has just
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
ended or will be ending is a good idea
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
it does not address all of our issues we
 
01:07:16.789 --> 01:07:16.799 align:start position:0%
had workforce issues before the pandemic
 
01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
and the pandemic has made them worse
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
but you know we're we're almost at the
 
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
point where we just really need more
 
01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:24.950 align:start position:0%
point where we just really need more
people

01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
we really need more people in this state
 
01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
to fill the
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
jobs and that's really becoming our
 
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
limiting factor
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
is the fact that we you know we are an
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
aging state
 
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
our young people have not traditionally
 
01:07:42.870 --> 01:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
tended to stay in this state and
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
and it's around a lot of different
 
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
issues you know there's so many things
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
that tie together here the cost of
 
01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:48.870 align:start position:0%
that tie together here the cost of
housing

01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
being one of them child care
 
01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
and and we're not even we're not even
 
01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:55.670 align:start position:0%
and and we're not even we're not even
sure

01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
how many people have dropped out of the
 
01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
job market for good
 
01:08:01.589 --> 01:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
you know we're we know that there's 30
 
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
000 people on unemployment
 
01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
that doesn't address how many have just
 
01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:06.559 align:start position:0%
dropped off
 
01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
and won't be coming back
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
um i'd love to chime in a little on that
 
01:08:14.069 --> 01:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
too because
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
i was talking with a colleague and um
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
i think that you know sometimes the
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
business and economic affairs
 
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
talks about the three-legged school with
 
01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:24.390 align:start position:0%
talks about the three-legged school with
education

01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
and businesses in the state there's
 
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
another three-legged stool that's
 
01:08:31.829 --> 01:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
out there right now and that's employees
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
whether it be their age their training
 
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
their drive
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
so you have your employees your
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
workforce the cost of living
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
which is you know the houses i had
 
01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
housing and then the other one was the
 
01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
wages the benefits and
 
01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
the life so that's the so it's like
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
how much your income your expenses and
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
your talent but that's kind of the new
 
01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
and again we haven't worked this out but
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's what i was
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
we have we formed like the commerce
 
01:08:58.390 --> 01:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
quarter i was talking with a peer in
 
01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
that that's what the chambers need to
 
01:09:01.590 --> 01:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
start working at because in the heart of
 
01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:02.470 align:start position:0%
start working at because in the heart of
that

01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
is the business you know the business is
 
01:09:05.669 --> 01:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
going to get those employees
 
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
trained age whatever they're going to
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
pay those employees but if the cost of
 
01:09:09.759 --> 01:09:10.229 align:start position:0%
pay those employees but if the cost of
living

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
living
 
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
whether it be insurance or housing or
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
whatever that
 
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
we're right in the heart of this new
 
01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:17.749 align:start position:0%
we're right in the heart of this new
triangle

01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
triangle
 
01:09:20.709 --> 01:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
so i'm on a tangent i think that that's
 
01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
what we all need to be working on
 
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
so if i can if i can just jump in
 
01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
quickly um i want to be
 
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
clear that there are many many jobs that
 
01:09:29.829 --> 01:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
are open
 
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
that are not in the hospitality industry
 
01:09:32.319 --> 01:09:33.189 align:start position:0%
that are not in the hospitality industry
lonza

01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
lonza
 
01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
is trying to hire like crazy uh zigzal
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
is trying to hire like crazy
 
01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
they're just there aren't the bodies and
 
01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
i think that's
 
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
that really is one of the issues um
 
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
and i i don't know that house ways and
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
means has any impact on two things
 
01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
and i apologize that i that i don't know
 
01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
this but what we need
 
01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
is to have these visas for j1s and h2bs
 
01:09:59.669 --> 01:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
push through so that we can bring in
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
some of these folks the h2bs
 
01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
are more the professional folks the j
 
01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
ones are more the student population
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
perfect for hospitality um and and i
 
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
don't know what what impact house ways
 
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
and means can have on that but that's
 
01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
that's one thing and going back to i
 
01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
think it was represented
 
01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative spillsberry's question um
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
i don't know what impact you can have on
 
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinating or getting
 
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
messaging out to people about getting
 
01:10:28.709 --> 01:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
vaccinated there are still too many
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
people who
 
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
say i don't want to be vaccinated i
 
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
don't need to be vaccinated the
 
01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
herd immunity will take care of me yeah
 
01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:36.070 align:start position:0%
herd immunity will take care of me yeah
that

01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
that's we're not going to get there
 
01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
unless we start messaging to people
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
that they need to get vaccinated and
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
that's how we get out of this bottom
 
01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
line is that's how we get out of this
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
so um that's how we get that's how we
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
get workers
 
01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
they get vaccinated um and
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
and we bring in those who can do the
 
01:10:57.030 --> 01:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
work that jay wants in the h2b so
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
if you have any impact whatsoever on
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
either of those two issues
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
please help us out i could just make one
 
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
quick comment
 
01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
um i i know not only the question was
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
about recovery
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
and not only are uh are getting the
 
01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
businesses back on their feet
 
01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
you know and having employees huge and
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's impacting them
 
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
but the other thing i would like to
 
01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
float out there is something i worry
 
01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
about as a chamber of commerce exact
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
i worry that as a population are we
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
going to get back to going out to eat
 
01:11:28.229 --> 01:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
are we our routines have changed we've
 
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
all been hunkered down for months
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
on end a year and we started ordering
 
01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:33.189 align:start position:0%
on end a year and we started ordering
online

01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
online
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
we order food online we pick things up
 
01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
are we ever going to get back to where
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
we were
 
01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
and i worry for my businesses that rely
 
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
on people to step in the door
 
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
um and i just think this compounds the
 
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
issue of
 
01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
taxation on them um if they're worrying
 
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
about getting employees but they're also
 
01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:51.430 align:start position:0%
about getting employees but they're also
worried

01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
worried
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
the future is uncertain are our regulars
 
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
and our new customers going to come back
 
01:11:58.149 --> 01:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
or are they so used to ordering amazon
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
if you live in my area
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
i live in amherst but i i commute
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
through several towns to get to nashua
 
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
um i can tell you some of the most
 
01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
prevalent delivery trucks i see are
 
01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:07.990 align:start position:0%
prevalent delivery trucks i see are
amazon

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
amazon
 
01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
prime and that makes my stomach turn as
 
01:12:12.149 --> 01:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
a chamber person because that's one more
 
01:12:12.159 --> 01:12:12.870 align:start position:0%
a chamber person because that's one more
purchase

01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
purchase
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
that wasn't purchased locally and if we
 
01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
don't have the local businesses strong
 
01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
then the communities aren't going to be
 
01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:18.149 align:start position:0%
then the communities aren't going to be
strong

01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
strong
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
and i always tell businesses i always
 
01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
told my people
 
01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
you know friends and my own husband um
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
who ordered pet food online last month
 
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
and i was ready to
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
kick him out now i'm just kidding but um
 
01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
you know i was like we have a pet store
 
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
that's a chamber member up the street
 
01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
why are you ordering dog food online
 
01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
because it's easier it comes right to my
 
01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
house and i worry for our businesses
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
when your kids were little you went and
 
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
asked that business for the scout troop
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
or the team
 
01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
could i have a donation that we can
 
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
raffle off well those businesses aren't
 
01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
going to be able to do that if they're
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
not in business and if we don't support
 
01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
the businesses in our area
 
01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
um i feel very strongly about that that
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
i hope we get back to the typical
 
01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:00.950 align:start position:0%
i hope we get back to the typical
patterns

01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
patterns
 
01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
of going to restaurants eating in i know
 
01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
people are still taking out food and
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
that aren't sitting down and eating in
 
01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:08.470 align:start position:0%
that aren't sitting down and eating in
restaurants

01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
um i went to one restaurant recently
 
01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
there used to be like a you know two
 
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
hour wait if you didn't have a
 
01:13:14.229 --> 01:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
reservation or they would never even
 
01:13:15.669 --> 01:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
take reservations and now the place was
 
01:13:18.149 --> 01:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
empty on a saturday night so
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
if you haven't been out in your local
 
01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
areas to restaurants please take a look
 
01:13:21.199 --> 01:13:21.669 align:start position:0%
areas to restaurants please take a look
at

01:13:21.669 --> 01:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
how slow business still is okay we have
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
one more rep to ask you question then i
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
have a final question
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative early thank you mr chair
 
01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the uh
 
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement i the questions that uh
 
01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative spillsberry
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
asked were not answered in any way shape
 
01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
or form
 
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
and sorry about the phone it'll stop
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
the question was
 
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
that he asked was since money is coming
 
01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
in on the ppp
 
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
and the ppp uh expenditure for wages
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
is deductible the
 
01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
for 80 plus percent of the loan
 
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
the net tax liability
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
is zero so
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
why do we not
 
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
or why do we do sb3 at all if the net
 
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
tax liability is going to be zero you've
 
01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:32.870 align:start position:0%
tax liability is going to be zero you've
got

01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
got
 
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
money coming in you've got money written
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
off as
 
01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
a legitimate business expense so
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
if it's zero no tax liability
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
or very limited tax liability why are we
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
even discussing
 
01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
sb3 or alternatively
 
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
why aren't we discussing the amendment
 
01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
that mr
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
representative spillsberry put forward
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we don't
 
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
allow both writing off the money coming
 
01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:03.110 align:start position:0%
allow both writing off the money coming
in

01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
and then writing off
 
01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
the uh the cost as well
 
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
that was not addressed by anyone on the
 
01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:15.110 align:start position:0%
that was not addressed by anyone on the
chamber

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
chamber
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
they walked around and said we're just
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
looking for money for the state
 
01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
there's no money coming into the state
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
you know in all honesty i am not
 
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
familiar enough with
 
01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
tax code to feel like i could give an
 
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
intelligent answer to that
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
and and i understand the question i i do
 
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
understand the question
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
um is it true that if i bring in a
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and i spend a thousand
 
01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
dollars that
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
that entire thousand dollars is written
 
01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
off i don't know enough about taxes to
 
01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
answer that question so
 
01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
um i'm sorry i i wish that i could i
 
01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
agree we we wear many hats as chamber
 
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
exacts but being tax experts is not one
 
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
of them so i do apologize if we didn't
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
answer it correctly i think we answered
 
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
it as best as we thought the question
 
01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
was asking
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
but again i'm not a cpa so i would
 
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm texting a cpa right now with
 
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
your question
 
01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
could i just clarify a bit on
 
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
on this essentially what the
 
01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
the uh bill is doing is to provide
 
01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
a stimulus out of state funds for
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
something that the feds did
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
on which is allowing
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
people to both deduct their expenses and
 
01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
not have to report the revenue that came
 
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
with it
 
01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:52.640 align:start position:0%
so a lot of other states did that but
 
01:16:54.149 --> 01:16:54.159 align:start position:0%
they recover it again
 
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
from the personal income tax and the
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
sales tax
 
01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
which of course we don't so that's why i
 
01:17:02.229 --> 01:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
think a lot of
 
01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
of people on the committee are are
 
01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
ambivalent okay
 
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:20.229 --> 01:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
i i appreciate the clarification
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative almi
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
um i i s it's a little about taxes
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
to be able to respond intelligently but
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
that's a good point tracy do you have
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
any comments
 
01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
i i i would have to agree with valerie i
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
i do that's not where my area of
 
01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:41.030 align:start position:0%
i do that's not where my area of
expertise

01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
expertise
 
01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
lies if i'm understanding this
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
right i i think what you're saying
 
01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
is that if sb3 was to be voted in
 
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
that the majority of businesses who did
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
suffer losses
 
01:17:59.189 --> 01:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
or or had a a level
 
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
year with their revenues and expenses
 
01:18:03.189 --> 01:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
with the ppp
 
01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
would not be taxed anyways so that
 
01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
you would only be taxing those that
 
01:18:10.470 --> 01:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
actually did have a good year
 
01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
and did do better than they did in 2019
 
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
i i think that's what i'm feeling
 
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
nope i'm
 
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
incorrect then frankly i'm not sure
 
01:18:26.709 --> 01:18:26.719 align:start position:0%
about that either
 
01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh tracy you actually
 
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
identified what my question is going to
 
01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:33.270 align:start position:0%
identified what my question is going to
be

01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
is that in any of your areas
 
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
what percentages of your businesses
 
01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
made enough profit
 
01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
in tax year that's why
 
01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
20 to have to
 
01:19:05.189 --> 01:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
um well i obviously i haven't polled all
 
01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
of them but if i had to guess
 
01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
i would say perhaps 30 percent
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
30 would would be paying no vpt
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
right that or right
 
01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
no i'm sorry 30 percent would be paying
 
01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:28.709 align:start position:0%
no i'm sorry 30 percent would be paying
bpt

01:19:28.709 --> 01:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
bpt
 
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
and uh do you have a
 
01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
i think ours would be closer to 20
 
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
because 80
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
of our chamber members are considered
 
01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
small businesses
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
50 and less um of course the sba
 
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
definition of a small business
 
01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
is i think 499 employees or less
 
01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
and the majority of the economy of the
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire is small
 
01:19:55.679 --> 01:19:56.310 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire is small
businesses

01:19:56.310 --> 01:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:19:59.430 --> 01:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
not the big corporations and
 
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:04.719 align:start position:0%
donna um i i think
 
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
mine's dropped wendy's 20 and um
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
i'm really i keep seeing the cpa i asked
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
the question
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
the little dots are coming and then no
 
01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:14.719 align:start position:0%
message came through as far as the
 
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
previous question
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
again i'm not a tax expert um but
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
so anyway and uh valerie
 
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
i i also have not polled my members
 
01:20:29.669 --> 01:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
and i i usually hesitate to respond
 
01:20:32.629 --> 01:20:32.639 align:start position:0%
unless i've spoken with a number of them
 
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
but if we're going to use the the how
 
01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
many small businesses or what percentage
 
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
of our members are small businesses and
 
01:20:41.990 --> 01:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
we consider that to be 25 people or less
 
01:20:44.229 --> 01:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
that's 80 of our membership and we have
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
close to 700 members
 
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
so if that's the if that's the formula
 
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
that we're using
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
then i would say that 20 of our
 
01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:54.470 align:start position:0%
then i would say that 20 of our
businesses

01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:20:58.629 --> 01:20:58.639 align:start position:0%
would be eligible for bpt so
 
01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
so from what i hear is there's probably
 
01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
about 20
 
01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:08.510 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:12.229 align:start position:0%
excuse me
[Music]

01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
so my answer was 20 but but that doesn't
 
01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:15.910 align:start position:0%
so my answer was 20 but but that doesn't
mean

01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
that we know the financial status how
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
they did this year they're just that's
 
01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
just the breakdown of
 
01:21:23.110 --> 01:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
smaller companies versus our larger
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
companies i mean most chambers are made
 
01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
up of small businesses not
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
not the bigger companies we're very
 
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
fortunate when we get the
 
01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
bigger companies because they pay a
 
01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
little more dues um
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
but i i think um if i might just say i
 
01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
think you asked us here today
 
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
to give you a boots on the ground report
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
of how the businesses are doing
 
01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
and i understand your technical
 
01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
questions but i think it misses the
 
01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
bigger picture from where
 
01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
our standpoint of what our expertise is
 
01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
the businesses have not fully recovered
 
01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
anywhere near it they can't find
 
01:21:53.679 --> 01:21:54.470 align:start position:0%
anywhere near it they can't find
employees

01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
and i don't know what the future is
 
01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
going to hold for businesses because
 
01:21:58.790 --> 01:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
people are so used to
 
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
buying online now i'm actually scared to
 
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
death for them um and i'm not
 
01:22:04.390 --> 01:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
exaggerating i'm not
 
01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
i just i'm just telling you my that's my
 
01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
professional opinion having been
 
01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
in this business and on the board i was
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
a board member before i was um this is
 
01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
the second chamber i've been the
 
01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:14.239 align:start position:0%
president of
 
01:22:15.270 --> 01:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm telling you that is my
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
professional opinion
 
01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
thank you all right any further
 
01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
comments or questions from the committee
 
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
yeah mr chair
 
01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh pat the secretary uh let's not forget
 
01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
even the businesses that don't make a
 
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
profit have to pay the bet and those
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
employees that were paid by the
 
01:22:36.629 --> 01:22:36.639 align:start position:0%
pp money so there's still tax obligation
 
01:22:36.639 --> 01:22:37.350 align:start position:0%
pp money so there's still tax obligation
there

01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
so that's something that i just want to
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
throw out thank you
 
01:22:44.229 --> 01:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
yes anything else from
 
01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
anybody if not we certainly appreciate
 
01:22:50.790 --> 01:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
the four members of the chambers of
 
01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
commerce being here today because
 
01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
you've added an awful lot of information
 
01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
that we didn't have
 
01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
and we didn't understand and we
 
01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate you taking the time
 
01:23:02.229 --> 01:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
to be here together to share that
 
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%

well thank you very much for having us
 
01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh i again i
 
01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
i think i go you go back to the spirit
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
in which this money was awarded
 
01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
was rescue um and
 
01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
the um if the the
 
01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
by the federal government even the
 
01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
federal government said it wasn't
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
they weren't going to tax it and 40
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
other states said that
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
and we don't know what the future holds
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%

would be
 
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
11 30.
 
01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:56.830 align:start position:0%
11 30.
[Music]

01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:56.840 --> 01:27:02.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:27:02.830 --> 01:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:30.830 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:30.840 --> 01:28:27.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:46.070 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
susan there
 
01:29:00.310 --> 01:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
hi oh thank you for arranging to have
 
01:29:01.990 --> 01:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
the chambers
 
01:29:06.070 --> 01:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
here this morning that was very useful
 
01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
yes i think they provide a very good
 
01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:10.070 align:start position:0%
yes i think they provide a very good
perspective

01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
from the area that we don't get a lot of
 
01:29:16.149 --> 01:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
our taxes from but if they die
 
01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:18.719 align:start position:0%
i'm afraid that we wouldn't have we'd
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
have even less
 
01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
employees at higher levels in the state
 
01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
yeah i agree i also think they were from
 
01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
different parts of the state
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:36.870 --> 01:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
i thought it was absolutely outstanding
 
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
very valuable anecdotes and good
 
01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:40.390 align:start position:0%
very valuable anecdotes and good
information

01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:29:43.510 --> 01:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
i think though that if we really uh
 
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
look closely at what they said they've
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
identified a lot of useful things that
 
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
potential would help but aren't within
 
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
the end but if the ways and means
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
like increasing the vaccination
 
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
vaccination rate and
 
01:29:57.189 --> 01:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
getting kids back to school and child
 
01:29:59.910 --> 01:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
care vouchers and j-1 and h-2b
 
01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
visas and you know there's all kinds of
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
things that
 
01:30:08.709 --> 01:30:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
are we back in order now or not uh
 
01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:11.750 align:start position:0%
are we back in order now or not uh
because

01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:30:15.110 --> 01:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh discussion of stuff you know 91a and
 
01:30:15.669 --> 01:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
all that
 
01:30:19.110 --> 01:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
happy horse we seem to be recording
 
01:30:22.870 --> 01:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
we're still recording i would like to
 
01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
point out
 
01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:26.639 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen all summer uh
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
janine and jen the dra
 
01:30:32.229 --> 01:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
have you let them through yes they're
 
01:30:32.239 --> 01:30:33.270 align:start position:0%
have you let them through yes they're
here

01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
okay sentence
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
we're back in action and the dra is here
 
01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
and they
 
01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
have provided us to email
 
01:30:52.149 --> 01:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
the senate bill 3 fiscal impact
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
timing and if they
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
would explain this we would certainly
 
01:30:58.709 --> 01:30:58.719 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
so caroline are you the one that take
 
01:31:02.950 --> 01:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
the lead on this
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair thank you for having us
 
01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
carolyn lear assistant commissioner
 
01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
with the new hampshire department of
 
01:31:10.709 --> 01:31:10.719 align:start position:0%
revenue um it sounds like you all have
 
01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
the document that we forwarded to you
 
01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
last night would it also be helpful if i
 
01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:21.930 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:21.930 --> 01:31:25.910 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:28.830 --> 01:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
that's it and much bigger print very
 
01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:30.390 align:start position:0%
that's it and much bigger print very
nice

01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
nice
 
01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
i anticipated that you'd want to see the
 
01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
i had my magnifying glass at my desk
 
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm suggesting we're old
 
01:31:46.390 --> 01:31:46.400 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to do with age i'm
 
01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
suggesting the numbers are the most
 
01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
important part of
 
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:57.669 --> 01:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
so i'll just go over briefly the
 
01:31:57.679 --> 01:31:58.950 align:start position:0%
so i'll just go over briefly the
methodology

01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
methodology
 
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
that we um we undertook
 
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
to try to parse out the fiscal
 
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
impact of senate bill 3 by
 
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year so as you previously
 
01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:12.470 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year so as you previously
heard

01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
heard
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
we have estimated the all-in potential
 
01:32:17.910 --> 01:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact of senate bill 3
 
01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
to be just under 100 million dollars
 
01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
we'd previously not attempted to
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
allocate this fiscal
 
01:32:27.590 --> 01:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
impact to a particular fiscal year
 
01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:28.310 align:start position:0%
impact to a particular fiscal year
because

01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
really the fiscal impact is very
 
01:32:30.719 --> 01:32:31.910 align:start position:0%
really the fiscal impact is very
sensitive

01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
sensitive
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
to when and if senate bill 3 becomes
 
01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
law for example if
 
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
senate bill 3 had become law prior to
 
01:32:44.229 --> 01:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
april 15th you would have seen a far
 
01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
larger fiscal impact
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 21 but it did not um
 
01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
for purposes of estimating the timing of
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
senate bill 3
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
we've assumed that all taxpayers are
 
01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
calendar year filers
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
that aligns with our data which is that
 
01:33:04.149 --> 01:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
approximately 90 percent of our filers
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
are calendar year filers but also of
 
01:33:06.719 --> 01:33:07.189 align:start position:0%
are calendar year filers but also of
note

01:33:07.189 --> 01:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
note
 
01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
is that our fiscal filers skew towards
 
01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
the largest multinational companies
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
um which we don't think is necessarily
 
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
the demographic of business most
 
01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:20.470 align:start position:0%
the demographic of business most
impacted

01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
impacted
 
01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
by senate bill 3. um we've assumed that
 
01:33:28.470 --> 01:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayers would report um
 
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
ppp loan forgiveness in the year
 
01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
the loan is actually forgiven
 
01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
um and we have done our best
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
to sort of predict um
 
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
when these loans will be forgiven by the
 
01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:44.870 align:start position:0%
when these loans will be forgiven by the
sba

01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
sba
 
01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
certainly for round one of the uh
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
paycheck protection loan program we have
 
01:33:49.679 --> 01:33:49.990 align:start position:0%
paycheck protection loan program we have
some

01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:33:52.470 --> 01:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
actual forgiveness data i think at the
 
01:33:53.189 --> 01:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
end of
 
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
april about 50 of the total loan
 
01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:56.709 align:start position:0%
april about 50 of the total loan
issuance

01:33:56.709 --> 01:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
issuance
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
had been forgiven at that time with the
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
second round
 
01:34:03.669 --> 01:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
it was entirely speculation because
 
01:34:03.679 --> 01:34:04.070 align:start position:0%
it was entirely speculation because
those

01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
loans um aren't really being forgiven at
 
01:34:10.229 --> 01:34:10.239 align:start position:0%
any meaningful level
 
01:34:10.239 --> 01:34:15.030 align:start position:0%
any meaningful level
yet

01:34:15.030 --> 01:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:18.229 --> 01:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
after trying to place the
 
01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
the loan in the correct um calendar year
 
01:34:23.510 --> 01:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
for the taxpayer then we then
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
undertook an analysis of when
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
that loan forgiveness would be predicted
 
01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
to impact the amount of taxes that they
 
01:34:33.189 --> 01:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
pay to the department
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
to come up with a fiscal year impact and
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
lastly and
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
most i think most importantly based on
 
01:34:40.870 --> 01:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
some of the discussions that we've had
 
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
with you
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
over the course of the last several
 
01:34:46.950 --> 01:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
weeks our analysis acknowledges
 
01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
that for many taxpayers the overall
 
01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
impact of senate bill 3 will result
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
in either the creation of a credit
 
01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:57.109 align:start position:0%
in either the creation of a credit
carryover

01:34:57.109 --> 01:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
carryover
 
01:34:59.910 --> 01:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
or a net operating loss which is why you
 
01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
see the fiscal impact
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
here spread into later
 
01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal years so in fiscal year 25
 
01:35:08.229 --> 01:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
through 28
 
01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
the reason why you see fiscal impacts in
 
01:35:12.629 --> 01:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
those years is because that we have
 
01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
presumed that some proportion
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
of ppp loans reported in a tax year
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
will generate either an nol or a credit
 
01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:22.550 align:start position:0%
will generate either an nol or a credit
carryover

01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
carryover
 
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
and therefore the fiscal impact won't be
 
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
felt by the state
 
01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
until that cco or nol is utilized by the
 
01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayer to actually offset
 
01:35:34.709 --> 01:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
with that i am happy to answer any
 
01:35:36.639 --> 01:35:38.310 align:start position:0%
with that i am happy to answer any
questions

01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
well thank you carolyn uh representative
 
01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:42.629 align:start position:0%
well thank you carolyn uh representative
elena

01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
elena
 
01:35:45.669 --> 01:35:45.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i actually have
 
01:35:48.390 --> 01:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
two areas after what we've just listened
 
01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:48.870 align:start position:0%
two areas after what we've just listened
to

01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
but on the most important one i think
 
01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
for this is that there are
 
01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
on a lot of water's edge companies
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
whose filings include their subsidiaries
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
and their subsidiaries would have
 
01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
so at least some of them been eligible
 
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
for the ppp loans
 
01:36:16.950 --> 01:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
on and it sounds to me like you're
 
01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
disregarding those at this point do you
 
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
have any way
 
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
of knowing
 
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
how many subsidiaries below a certain
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
size would be in those companies
 
01:36:33.510 --> 01:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
i actually looked into this question
 
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
representative because i heard you bring
 
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
it up yesterday
 
01:36:40.629 --> 01:36:40.639 align:start position:0%
our returns the new hampshire business
 
01:36:43.189 --> 01:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
water's edge business tax return does
 
01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
not have a place
 
01:36:47.109 --> 01:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
for a taxpayer to list their
 
01:36:47.119 --> 01:36:48.550 align:start position:0%
for a taxpayer to list their
subsidiaries

01:36:48.550 --> 01:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries
 
01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
um a waters edge return does require
 
01:36:56.470 --> 01:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
a large stack of attachments
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
and within those attachments
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
a water's edge company would be expected
 
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
to inventory their subsidiaries all this
 
01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:07.430 align:start position:0%
to inventory their subsidiaries all this
with

01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
all of the subsidiaries that are flowing
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
up for that return
 
01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
but that would be a very manual process
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
of going through those pages
 
01:37:19.350 --> 01:37:19.360 align:start position:0%
it's not scanned um and
 
01:37:23.109 --> 01:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
put into our system um it's primarily
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
used in an
 
01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
audit so an auditor would be picking up
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
those pages and looking at them
 
01:37:32.830 --> 01:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
to see the subsidiaries included on that
 
01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:36.870 align:start position:0%
to see the subsidiaries included on that
return

01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:39.109 --> 01:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
well yes so for the water's edge
 
01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
companies we're really back where we
 
01:37:41.199 --> 01:37:41.750 align:start position:0%
companies we're really back where we
were

01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:37:44.629 --> 01:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
15 years ago when all the forms were in
 
01:37:45.669 --> 01:37:45.679 align:start position:0%
the basement
 
01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
and somebody had to go look through them
 
01:37:51.109 --> 01:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
to answer a question that's that's
 
01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
really interesting thank you
 
01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
on the the other one is related to
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
the um the chambers of commerce people
 
01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:00.870 align:start position:0%
the um the chambers of commerce people
we've

01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
we've
 
01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
been listening to and i don't know if
 
01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
you heard any of that
 
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
but they are
 
01:38:10.870 --> 01:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
really worried they they represent
 
01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
mostly small
 
01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
and small businesses
 
01:38:19.510 --> 01:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
in the new hampshire side
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
size businesses and medium businesses in
 
01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:23.430 align:start position:0%
size businesses and medium businesses in
that

01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
and they figured when
 
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
the chair asked them that only about 20
 
01:38:30.550 --> 01:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
to 30 percent
 
01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
of their businesses were were actually
 
01:38:37.109 --> 01:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
likely at any time to be paying vpt
 
01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
um but they are terrified of
 
01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
that those businesses are are still
 
01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:45.510 align:start position:0%
that those businesses are are still
struggling

01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
struggling
 
01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
to stay alive and that
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
not passing sp3 would just
 
01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
would destroy those businesses do you
 
01:39:02.709 --> 01:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure uh well if you uh
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
if they're right about those
 
01:39:08.229 --> 01:39:08.239 align:start position:0%
businesses there would probably be more
 
01:39:08.950 --> 01:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
showing up
 
01:39:11.750 --> 01:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
in 22 because they would be using they
 
01:39:15.030 --> 01:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be doing credit carry forward
 
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
they'd be pulling credit carry forward
 
01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to review your question to
 
01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
make sure i understand it first before i
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
answer something you didn't ask um so is
 
01:39:32.229 --> 01:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
your question
 
01:39:35.109 --> 01:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
how would the fiscal impact present
 
01:39:35.119 --> 01:39:36.229 align:start position:0%
how would the fiscal impact present
itself

01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
itself
 
01:39:40.229 --> 01:39:40.239 align:start position:0%
for a business that did pay on
 
01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
ppp in their 2020
 
01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:51.750 align:start position:0%
ppp in their 2020
taxes

01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:54.719 align:start position:0%
representative you're muted i thought
 
01:39:54.719 --> 01:39:55.270 align:start position:0%
representative you're muted i thought
i'd

01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
i'd
 
01:39:58.709 --> 01:39:58.719 align:start position:0%
unmute it sorry the small businesses
 
01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:02.239 align:start position:0%
on that are medium enough
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
that they have been paying bpt
 
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
on they think are in a position
 
01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:12.159 align:start position:0%
where they're still struggling to stay
 
01:40:12.159 --> 01:40:12.950 align:start position:0%
where they're still struggling to stay
alive

01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
alive
 
01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
or they managed to stay alive this last
 
01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:16.070 align:start position:0%
or they managed to stay alive this last
year

01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:40:19.109 --> 01:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
but next year they will no longer be
 
01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
building a lot of patios or
 
01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
or on
 
01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
selling selling a product like
 
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
hand sanitizer and we'll have to go back
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
to something else that maybe isn't as
 
01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:36.229 align:start position:0%
to something else that maybe isn't as
profitable

01:40:36.229 --> 01:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
profitable
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
anymore and therefore
 
01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
are still in the struggling category as
 
01:40:45.109 --> 01:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
to whether they're going to survive
 
01:40:50.070 --> 01:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
and if they get if they don't
 
01:40:53.109 --> 01:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
if they have to pay
 
01:40:56.310 --> 01:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
pay on some of their profits during
 
01:41:00.149 --> 01:41:00.159 align:start position:0%
during last year on
 
01:41:03.189 --> 01:41:03.199 align:start position:0%
they they would want
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
that money back right away or
 
01:41:09.189 --> 01:41:09.199 align:start position:0%
um if they have credit carry forward
 
01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
from the previous year
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
right so our analysis assumes a
 
01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:20.390 align:start position:0%
right so our analysis assumes a
historical

01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
historical
 
01:41:24.070 --> 01:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
rate of cco um
 
01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
utilization and um reporting
 
01:41:29.910 --> 01:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
so i guess to your point if they're
 
01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
extra motivated to receive a refund
 
01:41:35.430 --> 01:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
instead of a cco
 
01:41:38.470 --> 01:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
for example um then i think you're
 
01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:39.430 align:start position:0%
for example um then i think you're
correct

01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
that in the fiscal 22 and fiscal 23
 
01:41:47.910 --> 01:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
years you could see a greater fiscal
 
01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:49.270 align:start position:0%
years you could see a greater fiscal
impact

01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
um but alternatively
 
01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
i think if you
 
01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
assume that a greater proportion than
 
01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:01.430 align:start position:0%
assume that a greater proportion than
normal

01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
normal
 
01:42:06.070 --> 01:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
of taxpayers are going to generate ccos
 
01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
because or generate nols because of just
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
the overall economic
 
01:42:13.350 --> 01:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
conditions then you could see an even
 
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
more delayed
 
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact i think there are a lot of
 
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
unique factors to
 
01:42:24.790 --> 01:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
these coveted pandemic tax years
 
01:42:29.189 --> 01:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
that could um
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
both increase and decrease the fiscal
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
impact in any
 
01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
also if they do have ccos they're going
 
01:42:43.109 --> 01:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
immediately reducing their estimates if
 
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:46.950 align:start position:0%
immediately reducing their estimates if
they're

01:42:46.950 --> 01:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
they're cash poor and a fair number of
 
01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
these businesses
 
01:42:55.189 --> 01:42:55.199 align:start position:0%
on got personal loans or
 
01:42:57.590 --> 01:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
remortgage their houses in order to keep
 
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
going and
 
01:43:02.310 --> 01:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:05.109 --> 01:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
and i definitely understand that logic
 
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
and instinctively
 
01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
it seems correct that taxpayers would
 
01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
reduce their estimate payments
 
01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
what's interesting is that during the
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
course of the pandemic we actually went
 
01:43:15.750 --> 01:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
back and looked what happened during the
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
prior recession
 
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
to see if taxpayers did modify their
 
01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
estimate payments
 
01:43:25.590 --> 01:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
to reflect the prevailing economic
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
conditions under the belief that you
 
01:43:29.669 --> 01:43:29.679 align:start position:0%
know if you really needed that money you
 
01:43:31.430 --> 01:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
were going to be
 
01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
motivated to reduce your estimate
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
payments as low as you could justify
 
01:43:38.229 --> 01:43:38.239 align:start position:0%
and we didn't see that happening during
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
the prior recession
 
01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679 align:start position:0%
um that doesn't mean that it won't
 
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
happen during this recession
 
01:43:45.669 --> 01:43:45.679 align:start position:0%
they're they're completely different for
 
01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
sure um
 
01:43:50.950 --> 01:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
but i don't know that it's a certainty
 
01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
that's really interesting i'd just like
 
01:43:55.590 --> 01:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
to point out that the last recession
 
01:43:59.109 --> 01:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
lasted about four years here
 
01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
in those terms but it was in our
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
revenues more i think than it was
 
01:44:08.229 --> 01:44:08.239 align:start position:0%
in the businesses they recovered before
 
01:44:10.149 --> 01:44:10.159 align:start position:0%
we did
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
so they were paying less
 
01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
okay reps on early
 
01:44:25.109 --> 01:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um going back to the
 
01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
cco and nols
 
01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
it appears as though we may be headed
 
01:44:34.229 --> 01:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
into a period of inflation
 
01:44:38.629 --> 01:44:38.639 align:start position:0%
and your timing uh shows
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:47.109 --> 01:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
a rather high loss period if i'm reading
 
01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
that right am i
 
01:44:50.310 --> 01:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
am i reading that correct 23 is going to
 
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
be the hit year
 
01:44:54.709 --> 01:44:54.719 align:start position:0%
yes you're correct so if we have
 
01:44:54.719 --> 01:44:56.149 align:start position:0%
yes you're correct so if we have
inflation

01:44:56.149 --> 01:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
01:44:58.629 --> 01:44:58.639 align:start position:0%
is the hit going to be either as bad or
 
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
is it going to be worse
 
01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
for the overall revenues coming into the
 
01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:03.510 align:start position:0%
for the overall revenues coming into the
state

01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
if inflation does in fact take place
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
because of all the money that's being
 
01:45:10.870 --> 01:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
well it's not being created it's not
 
01:45:12.550 --> 01:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
coming from anything real it's just
 
01:45:14.830 --> 01:45:14.840 align:start position:0%
being printed
 
01:45:16.950 --> 01:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
so am i
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
looking at that the right way i i'm a
 
01:45:21.750 --> 01:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
little confused on that one
 
01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know if uh melissa rollins has
 
01:45:25.590 --> 01:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
any thoughts on that
 
01:45:29.109 --> 01:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
i'm a lawyer by trade so the economics
 
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
of it
 
01:45:32.629 --> 01:45:32.639 align:start position:0%
are not my strong suit
 
01:45:34.550 --> 01:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative lori for
 
01:45:36.070 --> 01:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
your question um
 
01:45:38.550 --> 01:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
it's a good question we haven't analyzed
 
01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:39.350 align:start position:0%
it's a good question we haven't analyzed
that

01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
um i think you're right if it does
 
01:45:43.350 --> 01:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
inflation um we have been keeping an eye
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
on it
 
01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
it's a little controversial right now if
 
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
you've read any of the articles whether
 
01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to continue or whether this
 
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
is just sort of a true up
 
01:45:54.950 --> 01:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
from where the pandemic was um
 
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
i've read articles both on from
 
01:45:58.709 --> 01:45:58.719 align:start position:0%
economists saying it could go
 
01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
um either way so
 
01:46:07.109 --> 01:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
i think if it does continue
 
01:46:10.070 --> 01:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
right if inflation does hit and this
 
01:46:12.790 --> 01:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
isn't just a pandemic situation
 
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
then it could be
 
01:46:19.750 --> 01:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
more a bigger hit however the inflation
 
01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
will hit
 
01:46:22.629 --> 01:46:22.639 align:start position:0%
everything across the board so it could
 
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
even it out
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
um however based on like i said what
 
01:46:27.669 --> 01:46:27.679 align:start position:0%
we've been reading
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
we're definitely keeping an eye on it
 
01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
but um it seems like most economists
 
01:46:33.109 --> 01:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
think that the inflation
 
01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:35.679 align:start position:0%
is peaking because of how low it was a
 
01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
year ago
 
01:46:38.709 --> 01:46:38.719 align:start position:0%
um with the pandemic and that this
 
01:46:40.229 --> 01:46:40.239 align:start position:0%
should just be
 
01:46:42.149 --> 01:46:42.159 align:start position:0%
a blip and then it will normalize in the
 
01:46:45.189 --> 01:46:45.199 align:start position:0%
next couple of months
 
01:46:48.790 --> 01:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh let's hope so thank you okay
 
01:46:52.629 --> 01:46:52.639 align:start position:0%
before we go to representative brownie
 
01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
the cco that you use in this analysis is
 
01:46:56.880 --> 01:46:59.910 align:start position:0%
the cco that you use in this analysis is
that

01:46:59.910 --> 01:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
the way we're doing things now without
 
01:47:06.390 --> 01:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
the change in the law as suggested in
 
01:47:08.950 --> 01:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
house bill too
 
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's correct the it's based on current
 
01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:12.550 align:start position:0%
that's correct the it's based on current
law

01:47:12.550 --> 01:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
meaning that there's no cap in the
 
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
amount of cco that a taxpayer can carry
 
01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:18.310 align:start position:0%
amount of cco that a taxpayer can carry
forward

01:47:18.310 --> 01:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:47:21.990 --> 01:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
okay and if if we did
 
01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
if hb2 did pass
 
01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
the raid as opposed
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh how much would this change
 
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
the figures in this table
 
01:47:39.590 --> 01:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
so i think what you would see primarily
 
01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:39.910 align:start position:0%
so i think what you would see primarily
is

01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:47:43.109 --> 01:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
you see a 19.2 million total impact
 
01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2024. i think a good
 
01:47:48.030 --> 01:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
proportion of that would actually hit in
 
01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:49.430 align:start position:0%
proportion of that would actually hit in
2023

01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
2023
 
01:47:52.709 --> 01:47:52.719 align:start position:0%
because you would see more refunds and
 
01:47:55.990 --> 01:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
fewer credit carryovers as well as
 
01:47:57.750 --> 01:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps a larger
 
01:48:02.790 --> 01:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
impact in 2022 okay
 
01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about ccos and
 
01:48:06.790 --> 01:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
they're talking about
 
01:48:09.990 --> 01:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
the corporate tax rate and suggested
 
01:48:11.669 --> 01:48:11.679 align:start position:0%
going from 21
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
to 28 knowing that the cco
 
01:48:21.189 --> 01:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
last year has gotten up to about 275
 
01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:22.639 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the cco looks like
 
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:48:30.870 --> 01:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
but assume it's not dropping
 
01:48:34.470 --> 01:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh then that that could
 
01:48:38.070 --> 01:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
affect our cash flow
 
01:48:47.350 --> 01:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
coming up in this future years
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:53.270 --> 01:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
um did you have any data any updated
 
01:48:54.550 --> 01:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
data on where we are with
 
01:48:59.109 --> 01:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
ccos this year i don't i don't um
 
01:49:01.270 --> 01:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
we normally don't rerun the numbers
 
01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
until july
 
01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
yeah so i think to your question
 
01:49:07.270 --> 01:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
to the extent that taxpayers change
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
their behavior
 
01:49:14.870 --> 01:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
and instead of claiming cco's
 
01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
claim refunds that could certainly
 
01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:18.149 align:start position:0%
claim refunds that could certainly
impact

01:49:18.149 --> 01:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:49:21.589 --> 01:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
um cash flow in this state
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
um what we don't know is whether that's
 
01:49:28.390 --> 01:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
likely to happen or not
 
01:49:32.229 --> 01:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
okay representative thank you mr chair
 
01:49:34.310 --> 01:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
i got a couple of cookies uh first
 
01:49:36.070 --> 01:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
before i go to the chart
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure i have the
 
01:49:39.589 --> 01:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
numbers right how many
 
01:49:41.430 --> 01:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
do we know how many companies received
 
01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
ppp loans
 
01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
how many companies what how many
 
01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
companies in new hampshire receive the
 
01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:53.990 align:start position:0%
companies in new hampshire receive the
ppp

01:49:53.990 --> 01:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
ppp
 
01:49:57.750 --> 01:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
loan round one and round two okay
 
01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to see quickly if we have it
 
01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
in our fiscal note
 
01:50:04.950 --> 01:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:06.390 --> 01:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
and while you're looking how many
 
01:50:09.990 --> 01:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
dollars total
 
01:50:14.950 --> 01:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
so the total dollars are 814 billion
 
01:50:18.310 --> 01:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
no that's for the whole not for are you
 
01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
for now were you asking for just new
 
01:50:22.149 --> 01:50:22.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire yes new hampshire
 
01:50:24.229 --> 01:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
i can get you we can get you the uh
 
01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
total numbers
 
01:50:28.709 --> 01:50:28.719 align:start position:0%
for um numbers and dollars for new
 
01:50:30.870 --> 01:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire i don't have them handy
 
01:50:32.229 --> 01:50:32.239 align:start position:0%
but you know where to get it though
 
01:50:32.239 --> 01:50:35.189 align:start position:0%
but you know where to get it though
right

01:50:35.189 --> 01:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:36.709 --> 01:50:36.719 align:start position:0%
okay well fine if we can get that that
 
01:50:38.550 --> 01:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
would be great so
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
when i'm when i'm looking at the chart
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
so if you had to give a plus or minus
 
01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:50.950 --> 01:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
of impact financially
 
01:50:52.950 --> 01:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh would you what kind of a plus or
 
01:50:54.229 --> 01:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
minus would you put around it
 
01:50:57.430 --> 01:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
five percent ten percent
 
01:51:00.310 --> 01:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
it's going to fall within a range like
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
for 22 you have 25.4 million
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
is that is that give or take five
 
01:51:06.950 --> 01:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
percent either way
 
01:51:09.669 --> 01:51:09.679 align:start position:0%
or ten percent either way uh you know
 
01:51:10.470 --> 01:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
what i mean
 
01:51:13.510 --> 01:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
i mean so i so i think what i would say
 
01:51:14.390 --> 01:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
quickly have a percentage but i would
 
01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:18.390 align:start position:0%
quickly have a percentage but i would
say

01:51:18.390 --> 01:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:51:20.950 --> 01:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
sort of the worst case scenario i would
 
01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:21.830 align:start position:0%
sort of the worst case scenario i would
see

01:51:21.830 --> 01:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
is that the fiscal impact in 25
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
26 27 and 28
 
01:51:32.229 --> 01:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
actually occurs in 22 23 24
 
01:51:33.990 --> 01:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
along with what is already reported
 
01:51:36.390 --> 01:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
there so that roughly
 
01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
10 million that you have spread across
 
01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
25 through 28
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
if that gets actually claimed in
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
22 23 and 24 that would be sort of
 
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
the maximum fiscal impact right so
 
01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:50.870 align:start position:0%
the maximum fiscal impact right so
that's

01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:51:53.350 --> 01:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
that's the way to view this is that the
 
01:51:55.669 --> 01:51:55.679 align:start position:0%
tough year is going to be 23
 
01:51:59.589 --> 01:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
it starts in 22 19 and 24
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
then after that it's really uh
 
01:52:01.679 --> 01:52:02.629 align:start position:0%
then after that it's really uh
manageable

01:52:02.629 --> 01:52:02.639 align:start position:0%
manageable
 
01:52:05.990 --> 01:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
very manageable at the you know 1.7
 
01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
million to 4.4 million
 
01:52:11.669 --> 01:52:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh range so that's his trailer issue
 
01:52:13.510 --> 01:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
that we have to deal with down the road
 
01:52:17.430 --> 01:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
so okay so i have one more mr chair
 
01:52:19.589 --> 01:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
yesterday when we were discussing the
 
01:52:22.149 --> 01:52:22.159 align:start position:0%
actual bill
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
i i made this i made the comment that
 
01:52:29.669 --> 01:52:29.679 align:start position:0%
that no matter what the ppp
 
01:52:33.270 --> 01:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
loan expenses that are used
 
01:52:40.310 --> 01:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:42.629 --> 01:52:42.639 align:start position:0%
would be deductible as a business
 
01:52:42.639 --> 01:52:43.589 align:start position:0%
would be deductible as a business
expense

01:52:43.589 --> 01:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
expense
 
01:52:46.629 --> 01:52:46.639 align:start position:0%
whether sp3 passed or not i just wanted
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
to get from the dra
 
01:52:51.589 --> 01:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:54.149 --> 01:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
correct right that's that's what i
 
01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
thought uh
 
01:52:57.830 --> 01:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
representatives mr pillsbury uh uh
 
01:52:59.589 --> 01:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
pointed to
 
01:53:02.629 --> 01:53:02.639 align:start position:0%
roman two in the bill and my
 
01:53:04.470 --> 01:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
my interpretation of roman two in the
 
01:53:06.870 --> 01:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
bill no deduction shall be denied
 
01:53:10.870 --> 01:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
no tax attribute shall be reduced
 
01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
no basic uh basis increase shall be
 
01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:14.310 align:start position:0%
no basic uh basis increase shall be
denied

01:53:14.310 --> 01:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
denied
 
01:53:16.390 --> 01:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
by a reason of exclusion from gross
 
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
business income provided
 
01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
by paragraph one and i said that that
 
01:53:23.109 --> 01:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
was just covering it i mean
 
01:53:26.629 --> 01:53:26.639 align:start position:0%
uh that that it still would be
 
01:53:29.109 --> 01:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
whether we passed this bill or not the
 
01:53:29.119 --> 01:53:29.830 align:start position:0%
whether we passed this bill or not the
the

01:53:29.830 --> 01:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:53:32.950 --> 01:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh the deduction of this
 
01:53:32.960 --> 01:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh the deduction of this
expense

01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:34.810 align:start position:0%
expense
 
01:53:34.810 --> 01:53:36.070 align:start position:0%
expense
[Music]

01:53:36.070 --> 01:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:53:39.589 --> 01:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
that uh were that were gained from the
 
01:53:42.629 --> 01:53:42.639 align:start position:0%
the loan or the forgiven loan
 
01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh is is there uh so
 
01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
okay you're verifying that correct
 
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
correct i i'm fighting my best urges a
 
01:53:55.189 --> 01:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
bit to get into the weeds with you on it
 
01:53:58.470 --> 01:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
but i think really paragraph two is
 
01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
necessary because under normal
 
01:54:05.430 --> 01:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
tax law if an item of
 
01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
income is excluded then under
 
01:54:11.589 --> 01:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
standard tax law the expense would be
 
01:54:11.599 --> 01:54:13.109 align:start position:0%
standard tax law the expense would be
disallowed

01:54:13.109 --> 01:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
disallowed
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
so roman 2 and the bill is really felt
 
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
in suspenders to make
 
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
clear that despite the fact that we're
 
01:54:21.589 --> 01:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
excluding the income
 
01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
we're still going to allow the expenses
 
01:54:25.189 --> 01:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
because otherwise that wouldn't be the
 
01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
standard tax
 
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
treatment but you are correct that under
 
01:54:33.109 --> 01:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
current law as well as under sb3
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
in both of those scenarios the expenses
 
01:54:40.070 --> 01:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
will be allowed okay thank you
 
01:54:42.629 --> 01:54:42.639 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure that i put a
 
01:54:44.149 --> 01:54:44.159 align:start position:0%
little doubt in my mind that
 
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
that because that's been my view the
 
01:54:51.189 --> 01:54:51.199 align:start position:0%
whole time thank you
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman yes represent
 
01:55:07.350 --> 01:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:10.910 --> 01:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
that data about the reduction
 
01:55:15.990 --> 01:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
non-reduction in estimated payments
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't during the great recession it
 
01:55:19.510 --> 01:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't quite
 
01:55:23.109 --> 01:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
jibe with the fact that in fact we lost
 
01:55:26.229 --> 01:55:26.239 align:start position:0%
fair amount of revenue in the business
 
01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
taxes during those four years
 
01:55:31.669 --> 01:55:31.679 align:start position:0%
yeah and we looked at we what we looked
 
01:55:33.510 --> 01:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
at representative was
 
01:55:36.870 --> 01:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
a single year when we where we felt
 
01:55:40.070 --> 01:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
that the the taxpayers should have
 
01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
felt the re recession and therefore
 
01:55:47.109 --> 01:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
should have um should have adjusted
 
01:55:49.109 --> 01:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
their estimates and they did not
 
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
but then in later years of course they
 
01:55:54.550 --> 01:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:58.830 --> 01:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:03.030 align:start position:0%
 
year

01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:12.149 --> 01:56:12.159 align:start position:0%
just for future information
 
01:56:15.430 --> 01:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
i've asked the dra to put together a
 
01:56:18.790 --> 01:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
table similar to this which
 
01:56:22.790 --> 01:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
goes out beyond the next biennium of 22
 
01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
and 23
 
01:56:28.390 --> 01:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
that would show the effect
 
01:56:33.990 --> 01:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
of the tax reductions that we put into
 
01:56:41.189 --> 01:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms rate going to eight and
 
01:56:44.709 --> 01:56:44.719 align:start position:0%
a half percent
 
01:56:48.709 --> 01:56:48.719 align:start position:0%
the bet threshold to 250 thousand
 
01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
dollars the bet rate to 0.55
 
01:56:57.990 --> 01:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
and the change in the bpt
 
01:57:01.350 --> 01:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
credits due to
 
01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh also business tax credit carry
 
01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:05.990 align:start position:0%
uh also business tax credit carry
forward

01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
single sales factor and the bpt rate
 
01:57:11.830 --> 01:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
going to 7.6
 
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
they will carry forward that through
 
01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
those years
 
01:57:19.430 --> 01:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:22.470 --> 01:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
how this meshes with
 
01:57:25.750 --> 01:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
senate bill 3 so that once we
 
01:57:28.709 --> 01:57:28.719 align:start position:0%
get out of the next biennium where do we
 
01:57:28.719 --> 01:57:29.350 align:start position:0%
get out of the next biennium where do we
stand

01:57:29.350 --> 01:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
stand
 
01:57:32.950 --> 01:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
relative wise in revenue when we take
 
01:57:33.830 --> 01:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
all these things
 
01:57:36.470 --> 01:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
other changes and revenues into
 
01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:37.669 align:start position:0%
other changes and revenues into
consideration

01:57:37.669 --> 01:57:37.679 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we'll have that from the
 
01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:41.589 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we'll have that from the
dnr

01:57:41.589 --> 01:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
dnr
 
01:57:43.240 --> 01:57:43.250 align:start position:0%
soon how is that coming
 
01:57:43.250 --> 01:57:44.709 align:start position:0%
soon how is that coming

we are just about finished editing it
 
01:57:53.910 --> 01:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
and it should be over to you
 
01:57:57.350 --> 01:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
i would think carolyn within the day
 
01:58:00.629 --> 01:58:00.639 align:start position:0%
okay so that i would think so
 
01:58:04.070 --> 01:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
fine we're not scheduled for another
 
01:58:05.589 --> 01:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
meeting until next
 
01:58:09.350 --> 01:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
tuesday but if you get it back
 
01:58:11.109 --> 01:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
and get it to me as soon as you can i
 
01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
can discuss it and then
 
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
send it to the full committee so they
 
01:58:16.229 --> 01:58:16.239 align:start position:0%
can go over it
 
01:58:21.350 --> 01:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
prior to our next meeting
 
01:58:23.589 --> 01:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
any further questions of the dra uh
 
01:58:25.030 --> 01:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative tucker
 
01:58:27.109 --> 01:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
well i just wanted to say i'm delighted
 
01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
you asked for that
 
01:58:30.629 --> 01:58:30.639 align:start position:0%
i i think there are a lot of different
 
01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
places that
 
01:58:33.030 --> 01:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
adjustments could be made and it's
 
01:58:35.109 --> 01:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
important to have that
 
01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
the answers to your question thank you
 
01:58:38.950 --> 01:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
very much for
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
asking the dra to do that we need to
 
01:58:43.189 --> 01:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
understand the
 
01:58:46.149 --> 01:58:46.159 align:start position:0%
relationship between all these different
 
01:58:46.159 --> 01:58:46.870 align:start position:0%
relationship between all these different
bills

01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:58:50.629 --> 01:58:50.639 align:start position:0%
and their facets and changes in rates
 
01:58:54.229 --> 01:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
right we always seem to when we make a
 
01:58:57.350 --> 01:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
reduction in taxes we seem to
 
01:59:00.709 --> 01:59:00.719 align:start position:0%
on the front part of it not have
 
01:59:03.030 --> 01:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
affect much but it goes into the outer
 
01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
ears and we need to understand that
 
01:59:08.950 --> 01:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much any further
 
01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:10.390 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much any further
questions

01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
if not we're right on time
 
01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
um hopefully uh
 
01:59:19.830 --> 01:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
emily block brockton
 
01:59:23.669 --> 01:59:23.679 align:start position:0%
is available jen
 
01:59:26.470 --> 01:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
have you heard from her it doesn't look
 
01:59:27.990 --> 01:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
like she's signed on
 
01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
quite yet um
 
01:59:35.830 --> 01:59:35.840 align:start position:0%

real close to noon but i have not heard
anything

01:59:39.910 --> 01:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:59:45.430 --> 01:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
from her yet okay if the committee
 
01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't mind uh
 
01:59:53.350 --> 01:59:53.360 align:start position:0%

01:59:58.870 --> 01:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
and come back at 12 10. and hopefully by
 
02:00:00.070 --> 02:00:00.080 align:start position:0%

will do she'll have the latest on the
rules

02:00:08.709 --> 02:00:08.719 align:start position:0%
rules
 
02:00:11.189 --> 02:00:11.199 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to utilize the
 
02:00:13.189 --> 02:00:13.199 align:start position:0%
american recovery funds that
 
02:00:15.109 --> 02:00:15.119 align:start position:0%

02:00:18.149 --> 02:00:18.159 align:start position:0%
states of 1.9 trillion dollars
 
02:00:21.830 --> 02:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
which we need to understand so i have to
 
02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
leave the meeting for a little bit
 
02:00:26.629 --> 02:00:26.639 align:start position:0%
and i'll try to get back okay
 
02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:30.800 align:start position:0%

okay

02:14:27.830 --> 02:14:27.840 align:start position:0%

02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:53.510 --> 02:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
so you've had a pretty busy morning
 
02:14:55.910 --> 02:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
you know we we did talk with treasury we
 
02:14:58.470 --> 02:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
also did a webinar for our members had 3
 
02:14:58.480 --> 02:14:59.030 align:start position:0%
also did a webinar for our members had 3
000

02:14:59.030 --> 02:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
000
 
02:15:07.510 --> 02:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:09.589 --> 02:15:09.599 align:start position:0%
that's questions five questions per
 
02:15:09.599 --> 02:15:13.510 align:start position:0%
that's questions five questions per
person

02:15:13.510 --> 02:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:16.069 --> 02:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
fifteen hundred questions i mean one a
 
02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:17.410 align:start position:0%
second is quite a bit
 
02:15:17.410 --> 02:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
second is quite a bit
[Music]

02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:17.530 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:15:17.530 --> 02:15:21.669 align:start position:0%
[Music]
[Laughter]

02:15:21.669 --> 02:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:24.870 --> 02:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
well we it is 12
 
02:15:28.550 --> 02:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
16 um looks like
 
02:15:33.270 --> 02:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
most everybody's getting back here
 
02:15:35.430 --> 02:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
we'll wait another couple of minutes how
 
02:15:38.149 --> 02:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
much time do you have
 
02:15:40.550 --> 02:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
so i do have a hard stop at the top of
 
02:15:42.470 --> 02:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
the next hour at one
 
02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
um but i think i can run through this in
 
02:15:46.550 --> 02:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
about 30 minutes
 
02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:49.589 align:start position:0%
about 30 minutes
good

02:15:49.589 --> 02:15:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:51.189 --> 02:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
but we're likely to have more than that
 
02:16:01.270 --> 02:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:04.310 --> 02:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
janine or john
 
02:16:07.189 --> 02:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
yep we're going to be recording this so
 
02:16:08.950 --> 02:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
that we'll be able to
 
02:16:12.390 --> 02:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
revisit it yes that's correct everything
 
02:16:48.230 --> 02:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:50.309 --> 02:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
oh wait one more minute and then we'll
 
02:17:16.549 --> 02:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:18.709 --> 02:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
normal i think most of us are back 17
 
02:17:19.910 --> 02:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
are back
 
02:17:22.950 --> 02:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
we know jen wasn't going to be back i'm
 
02:17:26.389 --> 02:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:30.469 --> 02:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
thanks all right then we can get started
 
02:17:35.270 --> 02:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
we were fortunate to have emily
 
02:17:38.469 --> 02:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
swanson brought back and
 
02:17:41.349 --> 02:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
she was scheduled for 11 but then she
 
02:17:42.950 --> 02:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
got pulled away to
 
02:17:48.230 --> 02:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:50.709 --> 02:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
but she was able to join us shortly
 
02:17:53.349 --> 02:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
after noon time
 
02:17:56.230 --> 02:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
and hopefully she'll have some good
 
02:17:56.240 --> 02:17:57.589 align:start position:0%
and hopefully she'll have some good
information

02:17:57.589 --> 02:17:57.599 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:18:01.270 --> 02:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
on what the rules are and how we can use
 
02:18:04.709 --> 02:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
the american recovery funds
 
02:18:08.070 --> 02:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
that we'll be getting so emily it's
 
02:18:10.950 --> 02:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
all yours thank you so much mr chairman
 
02:18:12.309 --> 02:18:12.319 align:start position:0%

02:18:14.389 --> 02:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
i it's a real pleasure to come meet with
 
02:18:15.750 --> 02:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
you guys again and
 
02:18:18.309 --> 02:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
while i hope to have um answers to many
 
02:18:19.830 --> 02:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
of the questions that we discussed
 
02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
in the last time that we meet that we
 
02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:22.870 align:start position:0%
in the last time that we meet that we
met

02:18:22.870 --> 02:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
met
 
02:18:25.110 --> 02:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
um there are still several unanswered
 
02:18:26.070 --> 02:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
questions but i'll be
 
02:18:28.230 --> 02:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
very clear about what those are that we
 
02:18:30.469 --> 02:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
keep encouraging treasury to provide
 
02:18:32.950 --> 02:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
us because you know there are some
 
02:18:34.309 --> 02:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
significant voids
 
02:18:36.389 --> 02:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
um and information but there is a lot of
 
02:18:38.150 --> 02:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
really good stuff that they gave us so
 
02:18:39.509 --> 02:18:39.519 align:start position:0%
we're pretty excited
 
02:18:41.509 --> 02:18:41.519 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of information to
 
02:18:44.709 --> 02:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
process and there's a lot of um
 
02:18:46.950 --> 02:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
source material that they've provided so
 
02:18:47.750 --> 02:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
let me let me
 
02:18:50.790 --> 02:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
dive right in you will you'll be able to
 
02:18:53.990 --> 02:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
email me copy this so we can get a
 
02:18:55.589 --> 02:18:55.599 align:start position:0%
distributor there
 
02:18:58.870 --> 02:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
yes yes and throughout the document i
 
02:18:59.589 --> 02:18:59.599 align:start position:0%
would say too
 
02:19:01.589 --> 02:19:01.599 align:start position:0%
before we get started i reference
 
02:19:03.669 --> 02:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
specific page numbers of where i
 
02:19:05.429 --> 02:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
found that information in the source
 
02:19:06.950 --> 02:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
document so if you do
 
02:19:09.910 --> 02:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
revisit um a specific clause that i
 
02:19:11.190 --> 02:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
discussed i i
 
02:19:13.030 --> 02:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
put you directly to where i found that
 
02:19:14.709 --> 02:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
information or my team found that
 
02:19:15.990 --> 02:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
information so
 
02:19:19.030 --> 02:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
so the law was enacted on march
 
02:19:21.669 --> 02:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
10th i spoke with you in the april time
 
02:19:21.679 --> 02:19:22.150 align:start position:0%
10th i spoke with you in the april time
frame

02:19:22.150 --> 02:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
frame
 
02:19:24.790 --> 02:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
and then here we are in may we were kind
 
02:19:27.110 --> 02:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
of guessing that probably treasury would
 
02:19:29.110 --> 02:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
um take a lot of time to really think
 
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
and put out careful
 
02:19:33.509 --> 02:19:33.519 align:start position:0%
um guidance and they did so on
 
02:19:36.549 --> 02:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
may 10th exactly 60 days
 
02:19:39.990 --> 02:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
after enacting the law and according to
 
02:19:42.150 --> 02:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
the law that's when they had to do it by
 
02:19:44.230 --> 02:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
they released what's called an interim
 
02:19:45.270 --> 02:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
final rule
 
02:19:47.669 --> 02:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
and gfoa members uh have said to me a
 
02:19:49.750 --> 02:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
couple times well that's an oxymoron how
 
02:19:51.110 --> 02:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
can it be interim
 
02:19:53.750 --> 02:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
and final at the same time well indeed
 
02:19:55.750 --> 02:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
it is not final final
 
02:19:58.710 --> 02:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
um this is expedited rulemaking from the
 
02:20:00.389 --> 02:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
united states treasury and that's why
 
02:20:01.990 --> 02:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
they call it an interim final
 
02:20:05.030 --> 02:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
rule but within the uh within the rule
 
02:20:05.040 --> 02:20:05.670 align:start position:0%
rule but within the uh within the rule
itself

02:20:05.670 --> 02:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
itself
 
02:20:07.429 --> 02:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of questions sprinkled
 
02:20:09.670 --> 02:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
throughout it's like what should
 
02:20:11.510 --> 02:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
it does this work for your entity what
 
02:20:12.950 --> 02:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
should we include how
 
02:20:15.910 --> 02:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
how could this be a better final rule
 
02:20:17.590 --> 02:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
with your input so
 
02:20:20.550 --> 02:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
feedback is solicited for this interim
 
02:20:21.910 --> 02:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
final rule
 
02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
and comments are due by july 17th so 60
 
02:20:26.469 --> 02:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
days from
 
02:20:29.990 --> 02:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
may 17th would be july 17th um the
 
02:20:31.590 --> 02:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
united states treasury also put out an
 
02:20:33.270 --> 02:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
faq sheet which is um
 
02:20:35.429 --> 02:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
a good digestible way of understanding
 
02:20:37.510 --> 02:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
the interim final rule they've asked
 
02:20:39.110 --> 02:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
sort of plain english questions and
 
02:20:40.870 --> 02:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
they've tried to answer each question
 
02:20:41.830 --> 02:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
with links so that's
 
02:20:43.510 --> 02:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
that's a really nice document and then
 
02:20:45.510 --> 02:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
they also have a fact sheet that they've
 
02:20:46.469 --> 02:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
put out
 
02:20:48.790 --> 02:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
um one thing that's missing from this
 
02:20:50.070 --> 02:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
guidance and this is the
 
02:20:52.150 --> 02:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
one thing that we truly are very
 
02:20:54.150 --> 02:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
frustrated about is the fact that we
 
02:20:56.230 --> 02:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
do not have any more guidance than we
 
02:20:58.469 --> 02:20:58.479 align:start position:0%
did on non-entitlement units
 
02:21:01.510 --> 02:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
we know that states have been assigned a
 
02:21:03.510 --> 02:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
specific allocation
 
02:21:06.070 --> 02:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
of what that any in the eu's or the
 
02:21:08.309 --> 02:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
aggregate of the non-entitlement units
 
02:21:10.870 --> 02:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
is coming their way but the frustrating
 
02:21:11.990 --> 02:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
part is right now we
 
02:21:15.750 --> 02:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
don't know who's calculating the 75
 
02:21:18.870 --> 02:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
threshold who it who is um
 
02:21:21.830 --> 02:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
a sub-recipient of whom um if there is
 
02:21:23.429 --> 02:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
any interrelated uh
 
02:21:25.349 --> 02:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
concepts that we need to make sure that
 
02:21:27.510 --> 02:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
we let any use aware
 
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
of um so so for example let me be a
 
02:21:31.429 --> 02:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
little bit more clear
 
02:21:33.349 --> 02:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
um you know if there is a
 
02:21:34.630 --> 02:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
non-entitlement unit
 
02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
and they are eligible they obviously are
 
02:21:38.550 --> 02:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
eligible to receive money from the
 
02:21:40.150 --> 02:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
american rescue plan
 
02:21:44.150 --> 02:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
we need to know who does that 75 percent
 
02:21:46.230 --> 02:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
of their most recent budget calculation
 
02:21:49.110 --> 02:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
is it the state or is it the treasury
 
02:21:50.469 --> 02:21:50.479 align:start position:0%
then we need to know
 
02:21:52.790 --> 02:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
how do those smaller entities certify
 
02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
that money
 
02:21:55.750 --> 02:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
did they talk to the state or do they
 
02:21:57.349 --> 02:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
talk to the treasury
 
02:21:59.429 --> 02:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
and then the third thing is we need to
 
02:22:00.550 --> 02:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
know if those small
 
02:22:03.910 --> 02:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
local governments are sub-recipients of
 
02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
the state which means then
 
02:22:07.910 --> 02:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
they would be held to the same rules of
 
02:22:08.790 --> 02:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:22:11.510 --> 02:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
so those reporting relationships are
 
02:22:12.630 --> 02:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
also important so
 
02:22:14.389 --> 02:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
we're continuing to sort of urge
 
02:22:16.150 --> 02:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
treasury that was point of the call is
 
02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:16.870 align:start position:0%
treasury that was point of the call is
to

02:22:16.870 --> 02:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:22:19.750 --> 02:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
just now is to urge them to bring forth
 
02:22:21.590 --> 02:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
more information as much information as
 
02:22:22.950 --> 02:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
we could possibly
 
02:22:24.870 --> 02:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
help them to distribute on this
 
02:22:26.309 --> 02:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
non-entitlement unit
 
02:22:29.590 --> 02:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
because as you know states have
 
02:22:32.870 --> 02:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
an extension of 30 days past
 
02:22:35.110 --> 02:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
may 10th to distribute the funds to the
 
02:22:36.790 --> 02:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
non-entitlement units
 
02:22:39.990 --> 02:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
then states can appeal one more time
 
02:22:42.550 --> 02:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
for an additional 30 days to the
 
02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
treasury to distribute those funds
 
02:22:46.870 --> 02:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day the legislation
 
02:22:49.590 --> 02:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
says states have to get this money to
 
02:22:51.270 --> 02:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
the non-entitlement units
 
02:22:55.670 --> 02:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
by july 10th states can't do that
 
02:22:57.910 --> 02:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
until we have more information from
 
02:22:57.920 --> 02:22:58.710 align:start position:0%
until we have more information from
treasury

02:22:58.710 --> 02:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
treasury
 
02:22:59.990 --> 02:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of critical
 
02:23:01.510 --> 02:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
information that we're missing here so
 
02:23:03.110 --> 02:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
we're pressing the treasury trying to
 
02:23:04.230 --> 02:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
get them to give us
 
02:23:06.469 --> 02:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
um specifically who's responsible for
 
02:23:06.479 --> 02:23:08.070 align:start position:0%
um specifically who's responsible for
what

02:23:08.070 --> 02:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:23:11.510 --> 02:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
okay so now we'll jump into for
 
02:23:13.270 --> 02:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
the guidance in particular i'm going to
 
02:23:15.910 --> 02:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
talk about three big pillars number one
 
02:23:19.270 --> 02:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
process and certification number two
 
02:23:21.590 --> 02:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
eligible use of proceeds and number
 
02:23:21.600 --> 02:23:22.550 align:start position:0%
eligible use of proceeds and number
three

02:23:22.550 --> 02:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:23:24.950 --> 02:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements so those are the
 
02:23:26.950 --> 02:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
three big pillars that the guidance has
 
02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
provided us
 
02:23:31.590 --> 02:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
in this in this um in this guidance that
 
02:23:33.510 --> 02:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
they put out
 
02:23:37.110 --> 02:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
number one certification
 
02:23:39.990 --> 02:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
for jurisdictions that are eligible to
 
02:23:41.990 --> 02:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
receive money directly from the treasury
 
02:23:42.630 --> 02:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
that means
 
02:23:45.750 --> 02:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
counties and cities above 50 000 in
 
02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:47.190 align:start position:0%
counties and cities above 50 000 in
population

02:23:47.190 --> 02:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
population
 
02:23:48.950 --> 02:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
they have to go to the united states
 
02:23:51.190 --> 02:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
treasury website to certify
 
02:23:54.309 --> 02:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
the proceed and they have to have two
 
02:23:55.990 --> 02:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
separate people to do that
 
02:23:56.950 --> 02:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
number one they have to have an
 
02:23:59.110 --> 02:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
administrator of the account
 
02:24:00.469 --> 02:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
and number two they have to have an
 
02:24:02.630 --> 02:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
executive of the account so
 
02:24:04.230 --> 02:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
the administrator of the count is the
 
02:24:06.150 --> 02:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
person who receives information from the
 
02:24:08.469 --> 02:24:08.479 align:start position:0%
treasury and maybe dispatches it out
 
02:24:11.670 --> 02:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
into her organization but the what's
 
02:24:13.590 --> 02:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
really caught the ire of a lot of people
 
02:24:15.190 --> 02:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
who are certifying right now
 
02:24:16.870 --> 02:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
is that the treasury is being
 
02:24:16.880 --> 02:24:18.389 align:start position:0%
is that the treasury is being
exceptionally

02:24:18.389 --> 02:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
exceptionally
 
02:24:21.830 --> 02:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
um careful about who
 
02:24:25.910 --> 02:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
can who can be the administrator of the
 
02:24:27.750 --> 02:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
account so they've gone through
 
02:24:30.790 --> 02:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
an identification process a rigorous
 
02:24:32.790 --> 02:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
identification process for people who
 
02:24:35.349 --> 02:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
certify gfoa members have said
 
02:24:37.670 --> 02:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
they have to present their social
 
02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
security number
 
02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
their driver's licenses their facial
 
02:24:43.349 --> 02:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
scan and in the event that
 
02:24:46.389 --> 02:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
a couple of gfoa members told me that
 
02:24:48.870 --> 02:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
their facial scan failed i guess because
 
02:24:50.790 --> 02:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
of covet or something i don't know
 
02:24:52.550 --> 02:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
um and then they had to surrender
 
02:24:54.389 --> 02:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
medical records so
 
02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
a tremendous amount of private finance
 
02:24:59.830 --> 02:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
private information for the
 
02:25:01.429 --> 02:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
administrator of the account and when we
 
02:25:02.630 --> 02:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
do talk with treasury and
 
02:25:04.710 --> 02:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
we say there are local policies that
 
02:25:06.870 --> 02:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
prohibit you know providing this type of
 
02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:07.830 align:start position:0%
prohibit you know providing this type of
information

02:25:07.830 --> 02:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:25:09.349 --> 02:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
the treasury is just kind of like i'm
 
02:25:11.030 --> 02:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
sorry but we need to make sure that
 
02:25:12.630 --> 02:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
person is who they say that they are
 
02:25:15.349 --> 02:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
so id dot me is the only choice and
 
02:25:17.110 --> 02:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of information that they
 
02:25:20.790 --> 02:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
um that they then um have to provide
 
02:25:24.230 --> 02:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
now in terms of the process
 
02:25:27.270 --> 02:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
you know the id me process is is is
 
02:25:29.910 --> 02:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
is what it is um but in terms of the
 
02:25:31.990 --> 02:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
timing a lot of gfoa members have said
 
02:25:34.550 --> 02:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
is there a timeline do i have to do this
 
02:25:36.150 --> 02:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
by a certain date
 
02:25:39.030 --> 02:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
and in the guidance it does not set a
 
02:25:40.550 --> 02:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
timeline so there's no
 
02:25:43.590 --> 02:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
ultimate timeline um but
 
02:25:46.230 --> 02:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
what we do advise gfy members of course
 
02:25:47.030 --> 02:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:25:50.070 --> 02:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
you know your first tranche starts the
 
02:25:52.150 --> 02:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
clock ticking on your second tranche so
 
02:25:53.670 --> 02:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
to the extent that you can certify
 
02:25:53.680 --> 02:25:54.550 align:start position:0%
to the extent that you can certify
sooner

02:25:54.550 --> 02:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
sooner
 
02:25:56.950 --> 02:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
then that means when your second tranche
 
02:25:58.790 --> 02:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
comes out one year after you receive
 
02:25:59.830 --> 02:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
your first
 
02:26:01.830 --> 02:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
then it the sooner the better for your
 
02:26:03.270 --> 02:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
budgeting purposes
 
02:26:04.950 --> 02:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
um so those are things that we've kind
 
02:26:06.790 --> 02:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
of pulled out of the guidance in terms
 
02:26:09.030 --> 02:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
of process
 
02:26:12.150 --> 02:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
okay now we'll talk into eligible use of
 
02:26:13.750 --> 02:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
proceeds and i wanted to
 
02:26:16.950 --> 02:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
make sure first to talk about what the
 
02:26:18.550 --> 02:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
guidance says in very
 
02:26:21.910 --> 02:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
broad terms so what
 
02:26:24.550 --> 02:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
what qualifications matter as you
 
02:26:26.469 --> 02:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
approach these proceeds
 
02:26:28.950 --> 02:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
in in a lump sum as you're looking at
 
02:26:29.590 --> 02:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
the money
 
02:26:31.830 --> 02:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
you see it in your account what are the
 
02:26:33.349 --> 02:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
broad statements what are the things i
 
02:26:35.110 --> 02:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
can do with it and what are the things i
 
02:26:36.710 --> 02:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
can't do with it
 
02:26:39.830 --> 02:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that we discussed
 
02:26:41.750 --> 02:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
the last time we talked is that that
 
02:26:44.950 --> 02:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
covered period question can i use these
 
02:26:44.960 --> 02:26:45.469 align:start position:0%
covered period question can i use these
funds

02:26:45.469 --> 02:26:45.479 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:26:49.270 --> 02:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
retroactively or do i only can i only
 
02:26:50.230 --> 02:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
use these funds
 
02:26:53.190 --> 02:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
prospectively and what the united states
 
02:26:54.710 --> 02:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
treasury said in the guidance
 
02:26:57.750 --> 02:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
on page 88 is that um
 
02:26:59.830 --> 02:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
the covered period unless otherwise
 
02:27:01.990 --> 02:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
noted is march 3rd 2021
 
02:27:05.510 --> 02:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
of this year through december 31st 2024
 
02:27:08.950 --> 02:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
so a bracket of march 3rd to december
 
02:27:12.550 --> 02:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
31st 24 is that period of time
 
02:27:16.710 --> 02:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
that governments can obligate the funds
 
02:27:18.710 --> 02:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
and that's an important distinction
 
02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
actually actually a
 
02:27:23.270 --> 02:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
a very um sort of liberal interpretation
 
02:27:24.469 --> 02:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
i think of the law
 
02:27:26.870 --> 02:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
because then what they say is you can
 
02:27:30.309 --> 02:27:30.319 align:start position:0%
obligate those funds by 2024 but you
 
02:27:31.830 --> 02:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
don't have to spend them
 
02:27:34.870 --> 02:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
until 2026.
 
02:27:37.190 --> 02:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
so it's an accounting term basically
 
02:27:37.200 --> 02:27:37.910 align:start position:0%
so it's an accounting term basically
says

02:27:37.910 --> 02:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
says
 
02:27:40.950 --> 02:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
you tie up the funds and promises before
 
02:27:43.990 --> 02:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
2024 but you have until 2026 to
 
02:27:46.790 --> 02:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
expend them this uh this this special
 
02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:47.590 align:start position:0%
expend them this uh this this special
notification

02:27:47.590 --> 02:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
notification
 
02:27:49.750 --> 02:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
is important for those who are using the
 
02:27:51.429 --> 02:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
proceeds for infrastructure
 
02:27:53.349 --> 02:27:53.359 align:start position:0%
so you've contracted with the company to
 
02:27:55.590 --> 02:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
provide a parking lot for example
 
02:27:57.349 --> 02:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
that parking lot won't be completed
 
02:27:59.030 --> 02:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
through various contracting services
 
02:28:00.389 --> 02:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
through 2026
 
02:28:03.349 --> 02:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
and that's um that that's that's
 
02:28:04.710 --> 02:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
specifically what that's getting to
 
02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:05.990 align:start position:0%
specifically what that's getting to
there

02:28:05.990 --> 02:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:28:08.790 --> 02:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
the law says you cannot spend the funds
 
02:28:10.469 --> 02:28:10.479 align:start position:0%
on pension deposits
 
02:28:12.630 --> 02:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
so basically what that means is pension
 
02:28:13.750 --> 02:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
deposits are a
 
02:28:16.870 --> 02:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
lump sum added into the asset structure
 
02:28:19.190 --> 02:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
of your pension fund
 
02:28:20.710 --> 02:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
that's an important distinction that
 
02:28:23.190 --> 02:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
they make because they also say
 
02:28:26.710 --> 02:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
if you are paying pensions as a benefit
 
02:28:29.510 --> 02:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
that is a part of payroll those are
 
02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:30.550 align:start position:0%
that is a part of payroll those are
excluded

02:28:30.550 --> 02:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
excluded
 
02:28:33.750 --> 02:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
from that prohibition so you can't take
 
02:28:35.910 --> 02:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
the funds as a lump sum and put it into
 
02:28:38.150 --> 02:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
your pension fund
 
02:28:41.429 --> 02:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
states cannot spend the funds to reduce
 
02:28:45.110 --> 02:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
taxes or to delay a tax increase
 
02:28:47.190 --> 02:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
guidance went actually a little bit
 
02:28:48.870 --> 02:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
further into
 
02:28:50.950 --> 02:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
that question that we had about whether
 
02:28:53.670 --> 02:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
this applies to states and locals
 
02:28:56.230 --> 02:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
or just states because as we read the
 
02:28:57.349 --> 02:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
legislative text
 
02:29:00.070 --> 02:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
we only saw it in section 602 so we said
 
02:29:01.670 --> 02:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
this must only be
 
02:29:04.150 --> 02:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
a state prohibition and the guidance
 
02:29:05.910 --> 02:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
verifies that they say
 
02:29:08.230 --> 02:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about the uh this
 
02:29:09.349 --> 02:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
prohibition that
 
02:29:11.110 --> 02:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
you cannot spend the funds to reduce
 
02:29:12.790 --> 02:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
taxes or delay a tax increase we're
 
02:29:13.510 --> 02:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
02:29:16.150 --> 02:29:16.160 align:start position:0%
only states we are not talking about
 
02:29:17.670 --> 02:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
local governments so
 
02:29:19.429 --> 02:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of gfoa members are local
 
02:29:21.510 --> 02:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
governments and their consideration
 
02:29:23.349 --> 02:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
here of course is that well it doesn't
 
02:29:24.870 --> 02:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
apply to me so if i'm talking about
 
02:29:27.030 --> 02:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
property taxes or local collections
 
02:29:29.990 --> 02:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
um then then that prohibition doesn't
 
02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:31.830 align:start position:0%
um then then that prohibition doesn't
apply

02:29:31.830 --> 02:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
apply
 
02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
and last but not least in this this we
 
02:29:36.070 --> 02:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
we could use a little bit more clarity
 
02:29:37.750 --> 02:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
from the treasury but they say
 
02:29:39.510 --> 02:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
you can't use these funds as a
 
02:29:41.349 --> 02:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
non-federal match
 
02:29:43.270 --> 02:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
or other federal programs like for
 
02:29:44.870 --> 02:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
example if you have
 
02:29:47.190 --> 02:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
medicaid payments that's what um that's
 
02:29:48.870 --> 02:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
the non-federal match that they had
 
02:29:49.750 --> 02:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
referred to
 
02:29:52.070 --> 02:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
but there are other scenarios so and
 
02:29:53.510 --> 02:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
they also talk about
 
02:29:56.389 --> 02:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
um just sort of the relationship
 
02:29:58.230 --> 02:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes for local governments is if
 
02:30:00.070 --> 02:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
the federal government funds flow
 
02:30:01.110 --> 02:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
through the state
 
02:30:03.190 --> 02:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
be sure not to classify them as state
 
02:30:05.349 --> 02:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
proceeds because they are indeed coming
 
02:30:07.429 --> 02:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
from the federal government so
 
02:30:10.790 --> 02:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
big overarching no-no's and and
 
02:30:12.710 --> 02:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
and captures of time for that covered
 
02:30:14.950 --> 02:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
period is something that we kind of pull
 
02:30:16.469 --> 02:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
down now as you can see from the page
 
02:30:18.230 --> 02:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
numbers the frustrating part
 
02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
is that this was like in the middle of
 
02:30:22.150 --> 02:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
the text it wasn't like at the beginning
 
02:30:23.990 --> 02:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't at the end so you have to
 
02:30:25.190 --> 02:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
search for these
 
02:30:29.349 --> 02:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
um and so just providing those as as
 
02:30:30.950 --> 02:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
as we come across them and trying to
 
02:30:34.230 --> 02:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
reconcile them okay so now let's go into
 
02:30:36.710 --> 02:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
specific eligible expenditures that's
 
02:30:38.070 --> 02:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
covered in the guidance
 
02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
and let's go back to the legislative
 
02:30:41.590 --> 02:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
text remember all that
 
02:30:43.349 --> 02:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
legalese that we were kind of battling
 
02:30:45.270 --> 02:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
with we were trying to figure out what
 
02:30:48.710 --> 02:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
is eligible what is ineligible eligible
 
02:30:49.990 --> 02:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
category use a
 
02:30:51.590 --> 02:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
is that you can use the proceeds on
 
02:30:53.830 --> 02:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
coven 19 or a negative economic impact
 
02:30:54.630 --> 02:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
of it
 
02:30:58.550 --> 02:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
lgbt premium pay for eligible workers
 
02:31:01.190 --> 02:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
eligible you see for government services
 
02:31:03.190 --> 02:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
to the extent of the loss of revenue
 
02:31:06.150 --> 02:31:06.160 align:start position:0%
and eligible uc was the easy one with
 
02:31:07.429 --> 02:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
the fewest words
 
02:31:09.429 --> 02:31:09.439 align:start position:0%
investment in water sewer and broadband
 
02:31:09.439 --> 02:31:11.190 align:start position:0%
investment in water sewer and broadband
infrastructure

02:31:11.190 --> 02:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
02:31:14.070 --> 02:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
the key point about these four eligible
 
02:31:16.630 --> 02:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
uses is number one it's the same it's
 
02:31:18.469 --> 02:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
the exact same words
 
02:31:21.190 --> 02:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
between section 602 and 603 and what
 
02:31:22.630 --> 02:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
that means is
 
02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
these are exactly the same for states as
 
02:31:25.920 --> 02:31:26.230 align:start position:0%
these are exactly the same for states as
they

02:31:26.230 --> 02:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:31:28.790 --> 02:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
are local governments so the law is
 
02:31:28.800 --> 02:31:29.349 align:start position:0%
are local governments so the law is
equal

02:31:29.349 --> 02:31:29.359 align:start position:0%
equal
 
02:31:32.150 --> 02:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
in the way that um the eligible use
 
02:31:33.590 --> 02:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
categories applies
 
02:31:38.230 --> 02:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
to the states as it does to the locals
 
02:31:39.590 --> 02:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
and the second thing that's most
 
02:31:42.070 --> 02:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
important about this is that
 
02:31:45.429 --> 02:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
every item is mutually
 
02:31:48.309 --> 02:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
exclusive and what that means is you
 
02:31:50.870 --> 02:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
don't have to satisfy the conditions
 
02:31:53.830 --> 02:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
of eligible you see in order to use the
 
02:31:55.990 --> 02:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
proceeds to pay for
 
02:31:59.830 --> 02:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
an eligible use a category
 
02:32:02.389 --> 02:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
and i think a lot of gfoa members have
 
02:32:04.469 --> 02:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
gotten hung up on that they're trying to
 
02:32:06.469 --> 02:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
combine the categories they're trying to
 
02:32:08.150 --> 02:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
look at things and say
 
02:32:10.950 --> 02:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
well emily i've recouped this revenue so
 
02:32:12.950 --> 02:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
can i use it on buying
 
02:32:16.070 --> 02:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
um uh ambulatory services or
 
02:32:19.429 --> 02:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
ambulances well you know the answer is
 
02:32:22.309 --> 02:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
you don't have to recoup revenue to
 
02:32:23.349 --> 02:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
spend money on
 
02:32:25.670 --> 02:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
eligible use category a you can just
 
02:32:27.429 --> 02:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
spend it
 
02:32:30.950 --> 02:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
and that i think is a key element for uh
 
02:32:32.950 --> 02:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
smaller jurisdictions in particular to
 
02:32:32.960 --> 02:32:34.070 align:start position:0%
smaller jurisdictions in particular to
understand

02:32:34.070 --> 02:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:32:37.830 --> 02:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
you can do just a and you can do just c
 
02:32:39.270 --> 02:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
and just b and just d
 
02:32:41.349 --> 02:32:41.359 align:start position:0%
you don't have to satisfy the conditions
 
02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
of any of the other eligibilities
 
02:32:42.960 --> 02:32:43.750 align:start position:0%
of any of the other eligibilities
categories

02:32:43.750 --> 02:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
categories
 
02:32:46.550 --> 02:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about them in individual
 
02:32:48.230 --> 02:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
segments let's jump into the
 
02:32:50.950 --> 02:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
very first eligible use a category
 
02:32:52.309 --> 02:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
carbon 19 or
 
02:32:54.870 --> 02:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
negative economic impacts of it now this
 
02:32:55.910 --> 02:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
is by far
 
02:32:59.110 --> 02:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
the most generous of
 
02:33:02.389 --> 02:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
all of the of all of the categories
 
02:33:03.910 --> 02:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
there's a significant amount should i
 
02:33:06.469 --> 02:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
stop i'm happy to take um
 
02:33:09.910 --> 02:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
your questions as i go along
 
02:33:13.670 --> 02:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
um one of the things
 
02:33:17.270 --> 02:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
is you mentioned
 
02:33:20.870 --> 02:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
the state and can reduce
 
02:33:24.550 --> 02:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
tax i mean locals could reduce taxes
 
02:33:28.870 --> 02:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
but the state could how about the county
 
02:33:31.990 --> 02:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
yes the county can so so the uh
 
02:33:35.270 --> 02:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
cities counties and towns um
 
02:33:37.590 --> 02:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
can use the funds to reduce or delay or
 
02:33:39.270 --> 02:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
offset a tax increase
 
02:33:42.790 --> 02:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
thank you yep representative romney has
 
02:33:43.510 --> 02:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
a question
 
02:33:44.950 --> 02:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i want to ask this question now
 
02:33:46.309 --> 02:33:46.319 align:start position:0%
because we may run out of time because
 
02:33:48.070 --> 02:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
this is a real specific question
 
02:33:49.990 --> 02:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
that we need answered we're not a
 
02:33:51.670 --> 02:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
conforming state
 
02:33:53.429 --> 02:33:53.439 align:start position:0%
so that we have to take legislative
 
02:33:54.950 --> 02:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
action to if
 
02:33:58.070 --> 02:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
the uh forgive the uh
 
02:34:00.630 --> 02:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
forgiven loans not being treated as
 
02:34:00.640 --> 02:34:01.510 align:start position:0%
forgiven loans not being treated as
revenue

02:34:01.510 --> 02:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
02:34:05.590 --> 02:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
for taxable reasons so
 
02:34:07.750 --> 02:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
we're struggling with that right now and
 
02:34:09.429 --> 02:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
if we pass a bill that we have it's
 
02:34:12.070 --> 02:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
going to cost the state 99.4 million as
 
02:34:14.309 --> 02:34:14.319 align:start position:0%
they have to call it 100 million
 
02:34:16.950 --> 02:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
the question is can some of this money
 
02:34:18.469 --> 02:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
from this program
 
02:34:22.469 --> 02:34:22.479 align:start position:0%
be used to offset that 100 million
 
02:34:23.429 --> 02:34:23.439 align:start position:0%
if we're not because we're not a
 
02:34:25.190 --> 02:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
conforming state and i guess the bigger
 
02:34:27.590 --> 02:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
question is conforming states
 
02:34:31.750 --> 02:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh do they get a buy on that because
 
02:34:33.830 --> 02:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
they were already conforming and by our
 
02:34:35.590 --> 02:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
legislation we're going to conform after
 
02:34:36.550 --> 02:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
the fact
 
02:34:39.910 --> 02:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
they had already conformed right uh
 
02:34:42.830 --> 02:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
right um i remember right the
 
02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:43.990 align:start position:0%
right um i remember right the
conformance

02:34:43.990 --> 02:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
conformance
 
02:34:46.950 --> 02:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
understood the question is can we use
 
02:34:48.070 --> 02:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
the money out
 
02:34:51.349 --> 02:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
of the arpa funds that we received to to
 
02:34:55.510 --> 02:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
reimburse that um 99 million dollars
 
02:34:57.429 --> 02:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
my knee jerk reaction here and i think
 
02:34:59.429 --> 02:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
that we probably need to verify this
 
02:35:01.510 --> 02:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
with the state but my knee-jerk reaction
 
02:35:05.030 --> 02:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
is that the um the reimbursement
 
02:35:07.670 --> 02:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
for non-conformance in that period of
 
02:35:09.349 --> 02:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
time is backward-looking and not
 
02:35:09.359 --> 02:35:10.550 align:start position:0%
time is backward-looking and not
forward-looking

02:35:10.550 --> 02:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
forward-looking
 
02:35:14.070 --> 02:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
and so the treasury may have
 
02:35:15.510 --> 02:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
i know this might not be the answer that
 
02:35:17.590 --> 02:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
you want to hear but because the covered
 
02:35:20.790 --> 02:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
period starts march 3rd 2021
 
02:35:23.670 --> 02:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
and um that activity happened prior to
 
02:35:24.389 --> 02:35:24.399 align:start position:0%
march 3rd
 
02:35:27.429 --> 02:35:27.439 align:start position:0%
2021 then they probably will not
 
02:35:30.710 --> 02:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
be very likely to cover that
 
02:35:32.150 --> 02:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
so if we had our bill passed before
 
02:35:33.910 --> 02:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
march march 3rd
 
02:35:35.510 --> 02:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
we would have been okay and signed by
 
02:35:37.670 --> 02:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
02:35:41.429 --> 02:35:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:44.950 --> 02:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
we had on
 
02:35:46.550 --> 02:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
something from the treasury saying that
 
02:35:49.110 --> 02:35:49.120 align:start position:0%
the ppp loans
 
02:35:53.590 --> 02:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:00.070 --> 02:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:03.110 --> 02:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
can you check on that
 
02:36:05.830 --> 02:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
emily i'm happy to yes i'm absolutely
 
02:36:07.190 --> 02:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
happy to make that question
 
02:36:08.790 --> 02:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
and and you know what actually i
 
02:36:10.550 --> 02:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
probably will engage
 
02:36:11.830 --> 02:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
the national council of state
 
02:36:14.469 --> 02:36:14.479 align:start position:0%
legislatures and nga along with us
 
02:36:16.230 --> 02:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
so that we can all ask that question
 
02:36:17.590 --> 02:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
together um
 
02:36:19.190 --> 02:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to engage treasury on
 
02:36:20.870 --> 02:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
02:36:23.750 --> 02:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
why don't we take another question from
 
02:36:28.469 --> 02:36:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:32.630 --> 02:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:36.309 --> 02:36:36.319 align:start position:0%
i guess there it is i found it
 
02:36:39.030 --> 02:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh the question is if there's a
 
02:36:40.870 --> 02:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
difference between conforming in
 
02:36:42.550 --> 02:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
non-conforming states
 
02:36:44.790 --> 02:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
and a benefit is given to the conforming
 
02:36:44.800 --> 02:36:46.230 align:start position:0%
and a benefit is given to the conforming
states

02:36:46.230 --> 02:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:36:48.469 --> 02:36:48.479 align:start position:0%
to the detriment of the non-conforming
 
02:36:50.469 --> 02:36:50.479 align:start position:0%
states with the non-conforming states
 
02:36:52.070 --> 02:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
that have legal action against the
 
02:36:56.870 --> 02:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:59.670 --> 02:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
i think that's an absolutely fair point
 
02:37:00.389 --> 02:37:00.399 align:start position:0%
but i guess
 
02:37:03.190 --> 02:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
i guess maybe i'm going back to the key
 
02:37:05.590 --> 02:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
part of the guidance that says
 
02:37:08.150 --> 02:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
you know if you were conforming prior to
 
02:37:09.429 --> 02:37:09.439 align:start position:0%
the covered period here
 
02:37:11.510 --> 02:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
then that is a that's a whole other
 
02:37:13.190 --> 02:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
that's a whole other
 
02:37:16.790 --> 02:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
situation than now
 
02:37:19.510 --> 02:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
which is that you are in the process of
 
02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:20.309 align:start position:0%
which is that you are in the process of
conforming

02:37:20.309 --> 02:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
conforming
 
02:37:21.990 --> 02:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
and therefore have occurred these
 
02:37:24.150 --> 02:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
expenses or accrue these taxes on the
 
02:37:25.590 --> 02:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
ppp forgivables
 
02:37:28.150 --> 02:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
and so i think it's timing that is the
 
02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:28.710 align:start position:0%
and so i think it's timing that is the
major

02:37:28.710 --> 02:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
major
 
02:37:32.230 --> 02:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
question here and i would urge obviously
 
02:37:34.230 --> 02:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
urge the treasury to cover it but
 
02:37:37.030 --> 02:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if they've addressed it yet
 
02:37:37.040 --> 02:37:37.349 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if they've addressed it yet
well

02:37:37.349 --> 02:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:37:40.630 --> 02:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
representative then uh why don't you
 
02:37:41.510 --> 02:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
continue to ask
 
02:37:44.870 --> 02:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative yeah uh just very quickly
 
02:37:47.990 --> 02:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
on page 86 in the middle
 
02:37:51.110 --> 02:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
on there it of the guidance
 
02:37:55.429 --> 02:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
there is a statement that on
 
02:37:57.349 --> 02:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
the treasury has determined and
 
02:37:59.270 --> 02:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
previously announced that income tax
 
02:38:00.950 --> 02:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
changes even those made during the
 
02:38:02.070 --> 02:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
covered period
 
02:38:04.309 --> 02:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
that simply conform with recent changes
 
02:38:05.910 --> 02:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
in federal law
 
02:38:08.950 --> 02:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:11.190 --> 02:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
for taxation of loan forgiveness under
 
02:38:13.030 --> 02:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
the paycheck protection program are
 
02:38:13.040 --> 02:38:13.830 align:start position:0%
the paycheck protection program are
permissible

02:38:13.830 --> 02:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
permissible
 
02:38:16.550 --> 02:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
under the offset provision and i figured
 
02:38:17.590 --> 02:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
that that
 
02:38:21.590 --> 02:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
covered it permissible under the offset
 
02:38:21.600 --> 02:38:22.389 align:start position:0%
covered it permissible under the offset
provision

02:38:22.389 --> 02:38:22.399 align:start position:0%
provision
 
02:38:25.750 --> 02:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
of the coverage change
 
02:38:28.790 --> 02:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
i left out on the
 
02:38:30.790 --> 02:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
federal taxation of unemployment
 
02:38:30.800 --> 02:38:34.469 align:start position:0%
federal taxation of unemployment
insurance

02:38:34.469 --> 02:38:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:37.590 --> 02:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:40.389 --> 02:38:40.399 align:start position:0%
i know those hands up but i'd like to
 
02:38:41.830 --> 02:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
02:38:44.790 --> 02:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
emily finishes her presentation and
 
02:38:46.790 --> 02:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
whatever time is left because she
 
02:38:49.670 --> 02:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
he has a drop that time of one o'clock
 
02:38:51.030 --> 02:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
whatever time is left we'll
 
02:38:53.270 --> 02:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
deal with the questions go ahead and
 
02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:54.950 align:start position:0%
deal with the questions go ahead and
annoy

02:38:54.950 --> 02:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
annoy
 
02:38:57.110 --> 02:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and you know to be honest i'm
 
02:38:58.230 --> 02:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at that
 
02:39:00.950 --> 02:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
section right now with fresh eyes um
 
02:39:02.550 --> 02:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
certainly from your perspective
 
02:39:04.150 --> 02:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
and i do need to do a little bit of
 
02:39:05.830 --> 02:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
research to be firm
 
02:39:08.790 --> 02:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
in in this but we'll absolutely reach
 
02:39:10.230 --> 02:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
out to the treasury if they determine
 
02:39:10.710 --> 02:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:39:14.150 --> 02:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
impermissible but looking at
 
02:39:17.910 --> 02:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
the cover change i'm trying to figure
 
02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:18.309 align:start position:0%
the cover change i'm trying to figure
out

02:39:18.309 --> 02:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:39:20.870 --> 02:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
where it is whether or not it is a
 
02:39:22.630 --> 02:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
revenue recoupment
 
02:39:25.830 --> 02:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
category or a covid 19 expenditure
 
02:39:27.349 --> 02:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
that i think is an important distinction
 
02:39:28.710 --> 02:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
but i will go back to that for sure
 
02:39:29.429 --> 02:39:29.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:39:32.950 --> 02:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
um okay so in the taxation yes
 
02:39:35.830 --> 02:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
so in in terms of elsewhere's category a
 
02:39:35.840 --> 02:39:36.550 align:start position:0%
so in in terms of elsewhere's category a
um

02:39:36.550 --> 02:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:38.950 --> 02:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
remember this is a very generous portion
 
02:39:38.960 --> 02:39:39.670 align:start position:0%
remember this is a very generous portion
of

02:39:39.670 --> 02:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:39:42.309 --> 02:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
what cities counties and states can do
 
02:39:43.510 --> 02:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
with this money
 
02:39:46.309 --> 02:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
moving 19 and negative economic impacts
 
02:39:48.309 --> 02:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
includes public health emergency
 
02:39:50.309 --> 02:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
it includes public health and safety
 
02:39:52.070 --> 02:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
payroll it includes
 
02:39:54.150 --> 02:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
capital investments in public facilities
 
02:39:55.590 --> 02:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
so they go into it
 
02:39:58.070 --> 02:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
in fact the real estate of the guidance
 
02:39:58.080 --> 02:39:58.630 align:start position:0%
in fact the real estate of the guidance
20

02:39:58.630 --> 02:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
20
 
02:40:01.590 --> 02:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
27 pages is dedicated to just this
 
02:40:03.990 --> 02:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
category so a significant fortune
 
02:40:06.309 --> 02:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
of the guidance is dedicated to what you
 
02:40:07.030 --> 02:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
can do
 
02:40:09.429 --> 02:40:09.439 align:start position:0%
as responding to coven 19. now what
 
02:40:11.190 --> 02:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
we're telling gfoa members is
 
02:40:13.030 --> 02:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
if you find something that falls within
 
02:40:14.389 --> 02:40:14.399 align:start position:0%
these categories
 
02:40:16.230 --> 02:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
that you're asking if it's an eligible
 
02:40:19.190 --> 02:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
use and you can tie it back to covet 19
 
02:40:22.630 --> 02:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
mitigating covered 19. it's very often
 
02:40:25.269 --> 02:40:25.279 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes especially if you're
 
02:40:27.190 --> 02:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
talking about capital investments if
 
02:40:30.309 --> 02:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:32.469 --> 02:40:32.479 align:start position:0%
health care and any kind of health care
 
02:40:32.479 --> 02:40:33.510 align:start position:0%
health care and any kind of health care
expenditures

02:40:33.510 --> 02:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
02:40:35.510 --> 02:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
but i think more importantly what a lot
 
02:40:37.910 --> 02:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
of folks are kind of zoning in on again
 
02:40:39.990 --> 02:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
is that question about is public health
 
02:40:42.309 --> 02:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
and safety payroll covered
 
02:40:46.309 --> 02:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
and indeed we found that on page 21 that
 
02:40:48.309 --> 02:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
public health and safety payroll is
 
02:40:49.910 --> 02:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
covered including
 
02:40:52.550 --> 02:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
the benefits that are including the
 
02:40:54.230 --> 02:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
benefits that are associated with that
 
02:40:55.030 --> 02:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
payroll so
 
02:40:57.590 --> 02:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
a significant chunk of money operating
 
02:40:57.600 --> 02:40:58.469 align:start position:0%
a significant chunk of money operating
money

02:40:58.469 --> 02:40:58.479 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:41:01.110 --> 02:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
for local governments is included in
 
02:41:01.120 --> 02:41:01.510 align:start position:0%
for local governments is included in
this

02:41:01.510 --> 02:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:41:04.150 --> 02:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
category in particular but remember you
 
02:41:04.710 --> 02:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
can only
 
02:41:06.389 --> 02:41:06.399 align:start position:0%
cover the public health and safety
 
02:41:08.070 --> 02:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
payroll from march 3rd
 
02:41:11.190 --> 02:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
to december 31st 2021. so that's
 
02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:12.309 align:start position:0%
to december 31st 2021. so that's
included

02:41:12.309 --> 02:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
included
 
02:41:14.389 --> 02:41:14.399 align:start position:0%
then they go into the negative economic
 
02:41:14.399 --> 02:41:15.349 align:start position:0%
then they go into the negative economic
impacts

02:41:15.349 --> 02:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
impacts
 
02:41:17.590 --> 02:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
that is even much broader and i know
 
02:41:18.950 --> 02:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
last time we talked
 
02:41:21.990 --> 02:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
um uh i i believe we talked about the
 
02:41:24.230 --> 02:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
fact that um hospitality taxes flow
 
02:41:25.190 --> 02:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
through the state and then are
 
02:41:27.110 --> 02:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
redistributed i think that's what
 
02:41:28.950 --> 02:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
maybe we we have talked about in new
 
02:41:30.230 --> 02:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire and
 
02:41:32.630 --> 02:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
um indeed uh what it says for an
 
02:41:34.710 --> 02:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
eligible use of proceeds is that
 
02:41:37.910 --> 02:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
um it is of course tax revenue is
 
02:41:39.590 --> 02:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
considered here but also
 
02:41:42.469 --> 02:41:42.479 align:start position:0%
direct direct grants and direct help to
 
02:41:43.990 --> 02:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
industries that were impacted by
 
02:41:47.030 --> 02:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
covid19 is covered so if there's
 
02:41:48.630 --> 02:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
any kind of capital improvements that
 
02:41:50.070 --> 02:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
your businesses need to do
 
02:41:51.590 --> 02:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
then you can go ahead and use these
 
02:41:53.110 --> 02:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
funds to help um
 
02:41:55.830 --> 02:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
both businesses and tourism industry you
 
02:41:57.349 --> 02:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
know in your state
 
02:41:59.190 --> 02:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
so i think that that's an important
 
02:42:00.790 --> 02:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
luxury that you're kind of opening up
 
02:42:02.389 --> 02:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
pandora's box and they're saying you can
 
02:42:03.990 --> 02:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
do all of these things
 
02:42:06.070 --> 02:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
um local governments are probably going
 
02:42:08.070 --> 02:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
to start asking well can i give
 
02:42:11.349 --> 02:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
benefits directly to citizens so to the
 
02:42:13.590 --> 02:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
extent that there's food insecurity or
 
02:42:13.600 --> 02:42:14.230 align:start position:0%
extent that there's food insecurity or
there's

02:42:14.230 --> 02:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:42:17.349 --> 02:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
um um or there is
 
02:42:20.389 --> 02:42:20.399 align:start position:0%
um uh utilities in arrearages
 
02:42:23.590 --> 02:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
um can i help those citizens with that
 
02:42:26.150 --> 02:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
situation and what the guidance says is
 
02:42:26.160 --> 02:42:26.630 align:start position:0%
situation and what the guidance says is
that

02:42:26.630 --> 02:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:42:29.830 --> 02:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
you can use the money to provide those
 
02:42:31.110 --> 02:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
social services
 
02:42:33.429 --> 02:42:33.439 align:start position:0%
in your community but then they're also
 
02:42:35.349 --> 02:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
very clear about the fact that if the
 
02:42:38.710 --> 02:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
covered period begins on march 3rd 2021
 
02:42:41.110 --> 02:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
if there were a rearranges in utility
 
02:42:43.670 --> 02:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
bills that occurred prior to that
 
02:42:46.630 --> 02:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
we're pressing the treasury again to say
 
02:42:48.710 --> 02:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
can we cover a rear edges to make sure
 
02:42:50.389 --> 02:42:50.399 align:start position:0%
those people can get to today
 
02:42:53.750 --> 02:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
can get to right now so those are all it
 
02:42:54.870 --> 02:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
really is a very
 
02:42:57.590 --> 02:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
large category that then would allow for
 
02:42:59.030 --> 02:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
people to use these proceeds in a
 
02:43:00.710 --> 02:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
variety of different ways
 
02:43:03.670 --> 02:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
and and and to be to be honest many of
 
02:43:05.910 --> 02:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
them are operating expenditures
 
02:43:08.469 --> 02:43:08.479 align:start position:0%
so your local governments your state
 
02:43:10.070 --> 02:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
government could use this on
 
02:43:13.110 --> 02:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
operating funds you can you can
 
02:43:14.309 --> 02:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
you can figure out how to use these
 
02:43:16.230 --> 02:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
money on operating expenditures so that
 
02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:17.269 align:start position:0%
money on operating expenditures so that
then

02:43:17.269 --> 02:43:17.279 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:43:19.590 --> 02:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
you might be able to deposit proceeds
 
02:43:21.030 --> 02:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
into your
 
02:43:24.630 --> 02:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
um into your rainy day or your reserve
 
02:43:27.590 --> 02:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
funds um as a as an alternative with
 
02:43:28.389 --> 02:43:28.399 align:start position:0%
those otherwise
 
02:43:31.910 --> 02:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
um operating operating funds
 
02:43:34.230 --> 02:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
okay so putting that shelf back again
 
02:43:35.429 --> 02:43:35.439 align:start position:0%
remember everything
 
02:43:37.110 --> 02:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
in that category has to be qualified
 
02:43:39.510 --> 02:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
back to mitigating covet 19
 
02:43:41.110 --> 02:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
then you kind of pull out the next book
 
02:43:43.110 --> 02:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
which is the premium pay for eligible
 
02:43:43.120 --> 02:43:44.230 align:start position:0%
which is the premium pay for eligible
workers

02:43:44.230 --> 02:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
workers
 
02:43:47.349 --> 02:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
and this one as opposed to 28 pages this
 
02:43:47.910 --> 02:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
one was
 
02:43:51.190 --> 02:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
about five pages so much smaller what it
 
02:43:51.200 --> 02:43:51.510 align:start position:0%
about five pages so much smaller what it
says

02:43:51.510 --> 02:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
says
 
02:43:54.630 --> 02:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
is you can pay a workers 13
 
02:43:58.710 --> 02:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
per hour up to a total maximum of 25 000
 
02:44:00.710 --> 02:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
and the executive has to make a
 
02:44:03.110 --> 02:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
determination of who's eligible
 
02:44:05.110 --> 02:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
in the jurisdiction lots of
 
02:44:07.030 --> 02:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions have called us back and
 
02:44:07.040 --> 02:44:07.750 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions have called us back and
said

02:44:07.750 --> 02:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:44:10.790 --> 02:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
hey i want to provide premium pay to
 
02:44:12.710 --> 02:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
all of my employees lots of counties
 
02:44:14.230 --> 02:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
have actually talked about that
 
02:44:16.790 --> 02:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
if i want to pay for all of my employees
 
02:44:18.389 --> 02:44:18.399 align:start position:0%
are there any conditions that i need to
 
02:44:19.510 --> 02:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
be aware of
 
02:44:22.389 --> 02:44:22.399 align:start position:0%
and yes indeed in the guidance there is
 
02:44:23.670 --> 02:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
one condition
 
02:44:26.790 --> 02:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
you cannot pay over a hundred fifty
 
02:44:26.800 --> 02:44:27.750 align:start position:0%
you cannot pay over a hundred fifty
percent

02:44:27.750 --> 02:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:44:30.950 --> 02:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
of the average wage of the state or the
 
02:44:33.670 --> 02:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
county that the worker resides in
 
02:44:36.950 --> 02:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
whichever is greater and if you do pay
 
02:44:39.990 --> 02:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
over 150 through this premium pay
 
02:44:43.110 --> 02:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
bonus then you have to justify it
 
02:44:44.790 --> 02:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
so a lot of counties are calling and
 
02:44:46.870 --> 02:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
saying who's justifying and what kind of
 
02:44:48.230 --> 02:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
words are they using how are they
 
02:44:49.590 --> 02:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
justifying it so
 
02:44:51.510 --> 02:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
there there's we're currently in
 
02:44:53.110 --> 02:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
development kind of thinking about how
 
02:44:55.269 --> 02:44:55.279 align:start position:0%
they might be able to apply premium pay
 
02:44:58.389 --> 02:44:58.399 align:start position:0%
and also conditionally premium pay
 
02:45:00.790 --> 02:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
can be paid retroactively throughout the
 
02:45:02.070 --> 02:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
guidance it says
 
02:45:05.990 --> 02:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
you can use this money to pay for 2020.
 
02:45:08.070 --> 02:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
and so gfoy members are calling and
 
02:45:10.150 --> 02:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
saying do i just pay him a check
 
02:45:13.670 --> 02:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
now like based on the last 18 months or
 
02:45:15.590 --> 02:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
how do i do this and the guidance
 
02:45:17.510 --> 02:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't go into process of how to make
 
02:45:18.790 --> 02:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
those premium payments
 
02:45:20.870 --> 02:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
but it does say they're sort of kind of
 
02:45:22.309 --> 02:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
opening it up broader
 
02:45:24.070 --> 02:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
and the last thing i'd say about premium
 
02:45:25.429 --> 02:45:25.439 align:start position:0%
pay is that
 
02:45:28.230 --> 02:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
it's not just limited to the employees
 
02:45:29.750 --> 02:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
of the government
 
02:45:32.230 --> 02:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
the guidance made it much larger the
 
02:45:33.750 --> 02:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
guidance they said
 
02:45:37.190 --> 02:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
you can pay other workers in your
 
02:45:38.230 --> 02:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
community through
 
02:45:40.710 --> 02:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
grants whether they are food production
 
02:45:42.550 --> 02:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
facilities grocery stores
 
02:45:45.750 --> 02:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
restaurants janitors truck drivers they
 
02:45:46.230 --> 02:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
02:45:48.790 --> 02:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
really open that up quite a bit actually
 
02:45:50.550 --> 02:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
probably more than i would argue the
 
02:45:51.990 --> 02:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
legislative intent was
 
02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
but they said you can use this for
 
02:45:55.990 --> 02:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
providing grant revenue in order to pay
 
02:45:58.469 --> 02:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
that premium pay to those folks in your
 
02:45:58.479 --> 02:46:00.389 align:start position:0%
that premium pay to those folks in your
economy

02:46:00.389 --> 02:46:00.399 align:start position:0%
economy
 
02:46:03.190 --> 02:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
okay putting that book back on the shelf
 
02:46:05.030 --> 02:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm pulling out
 
02:46:07.990 --> 02:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
probably the most vexing part of the
 
02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:09.030 align:start position:0%
probably the most vexing part of the
legislation

02:46:09.030 --> 02:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:46:10.870 --> 02:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
and that is you can use it for
 
02:46:12.790 --> 02:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
government services to the extent
 
02:46:15.750 --> 02:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
that your government lost revenue and
 
02:46:17.670 --> 02:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
treasury has tackled this issue in a
 
02:46:17.680 --> 02:46:18.150 align:start position:0%
treasury has tackled this issue in a
very

02:46:18.150 --> 02:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:46:22.150 --> 02:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
important way they've said okay
 
02:46:25.349 --> 02:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
we know that everybody has lost some
 
02:46:27.429 --> 02:46:27.439 align:start position:0%
revenue at a certain point in time
 
02:46:29.990 --> 02:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
and we also know that jurisdictions have
 
02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:30.630 align:start position:0%
and we also know that jurisdictions have
levied

02:46:30.630 --> 02:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
levied
 
02:46:34.230 --> 02:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
or have increased millage for um
 
02:46:36.309 --> 02:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
in order to accommodate for that dip in
 
02:46:38.309 --> 02:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
revenues and all of this all of these
 
02:46:39.269 --> 02:46:39.279 align:start position:0%
different sorts
 
02:46:41.750 --> 02:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
of of changes that are happening between
 
02:46:43.190 --> 02:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
and among all the local governments and
 
02:46:44.950 --> 02:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
the state governments because remember
 
02:46:47.510 --> 02:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
this law this this written rule is the
 
02:46:49.590 --> 02:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
same for states and local governments
 
02:46:51.670 --> 02:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
and so what the treasury has said is
 
02:46:53.990 --> 02:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
that we need a little bit of data we
 
02:46:55.190 --> 02:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
need to control
 
02:46:57.590 --> 02:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
the environment here we need to control
 
02:46:58.550 --> 02:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
the inputs
 
02:47:00.550 --> 02:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
and we need to control the outputs
 
02:47:02.870 --> 02:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
because this definition is so broad
 
02:47:05.429 --> 02:47:05.439 align:start position:0%
so here's how they try to control it
 
02:47:07.190 --> 02:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
they try to control it by asking
 
02:47:09.269 --> 02:47:09.279 align:start position:0%
everyone to identify what their base
 
02:47:11.030 --> 02:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
year is the base year is the
 
02:47:14.389 --> 02:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
most recent closed uh year
 
02:47:16.710 --> 02:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
financial year fiscal year that you have
 
02:47:18.710 --> 02:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
in your organization so if it's
 
02:47:22.309 --> 02:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
um if it's july to june
 
02:47:25.510 --> 02:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh 2019 then that's your most
 
02:47:28.150 --> 02:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
recent full fiscal year and that's what
 
02:47:28.790 --> 02:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
they call
 
02:47:31.590 --> 02:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
your base year revenue that base your
 
02:47:32.950 --> 02:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
revenue is representative
 
02:47:35.990 --> 02:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
of a normal year for you and they say
 
02:47:38.469 --> 02:47:38.479 align:start position:0%
actually look back three years because
 
02:47:39.110 --> 02:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
if you look
 
02:47:40.389 --> 02:47:40.399 align:start position:0%
and you look back three years and you
 
02:47:41.830 --> 02:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
see that there's a growth rate that
 
02:47:44.630 --> 02:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
happened between 2016 and 2019
 
02:47:47.670 --> 02:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
and it is greater than 4.1 percent use
 
02:47:49.030 --> 02:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
that as a growth rate
 
02:47:51.349 --> 02:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
otherwise we're going to assume
 
02:47:52.550 --> 02:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
everybody can grow
 
02:47:55.030 --> 02:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
at 4.1 which is actually a pretty
 
02:47:55.040 --> 02:47:55.670 align:start position:0%
at 4.1 which is actually a pretty
generous

02:47:55.670 --> 02:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
generous
 
02:47:58.950 --> 02:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
growth rate and then they say okay
 
02:48:02.230 --> 02:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
for every december 31st over the covered
 
02:48:04.230 --> 02:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
period we need you to check
 
02:48:07.670 --> 02:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
your actual revenue collected
 
02:48:09.910 --> 02:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
and if your actual revenue collected on
 
02:48:11.750 --> 02:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
december 31st of every year
 
02:48:14.230 --> 02:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
is less than that projected revenue
 
02:48:16.070 --> 02:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
based on that 4.1
 
02:48:18.309 --> 02:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
growth or greater then you get to
 
02:48:20.550 --> 02:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
collect that gray part
 
02:48:22.950 --> 02:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
that gray part that's underneath that's
 
02:48:24.389 --> 02:48:24.399 align:start position:0%
above the black part and
 
02:48:26.070 --> 02:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
underneath that diamond you get to
 
02:48:28.150 --> 02:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
collect that gray part now
 
02:48:30.150 --> 02:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
lots of dfy members have said well what
 
02:48:32.070 --> 02:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
if the black part what if the actual
 
02:48:34.309 --> 02:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
revenues collected was above
 
02:48:36.309 --> 02:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
that projection well then you can
 
02:48:37.750 --> 02:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
collect zero
 
02:48:40.309 --> 02:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
is the answer to that so these are the
 
02:48:41.990 --> 02:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
data that you need to come to the table
 
02:48:43.990 --> 02:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
with but they've complicated it a little
 
02:48:47.349 --> 02:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
bit as only treasury can
 
02:48:51.110 --> 02:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
and they said okay we have to qualify
 
02:48:53.190 --> 02:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
what kind of revenues can be captured
 
02:48:56.550 --> 02:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
in this in this revenue calculation
 
02:48:58.790 --> 02:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
and because they can rely on sort of
 
02:49:00.469 --> 02:49:00.479 align:start position:0%
census of government's data
 
02:49:01.750 --> 02:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
they've said that there's certain
 
02:49:03.110 --> 02:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
information that's outside of the
 
02:49:04.230 --> 02:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
revenue calculation
 
02:49:05.990 --> 02:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
federal transfers are out you can't
 
02:49:07.670 --> 02:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
include those in your revenues
 
02:49:10.070 --> 02:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
you can't include you can't double count
 
02:49:11.750 --> 02:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
your inter-governmental transfers they
 
02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:12.070 align:start position:0%
your inter-governmental transfers they
say

02:49:12.070 --> 02:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:49:14.230 --> 02:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
no they also say you can't include
 
02:49:15.990 --> 02:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
revenues from utilities
 
02:49:17.349 --> 02:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is because they
 
02:49:19.510 --> 02:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
say well you know
 
02:49:22.790 --> 02:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
utilities generally um
 
02:49:25.269 --> 02:49:25.279 align:start position:0%
receive assistance from the governments
 
02:49:26.389 --> 02:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
that they're in
 
02:49:29.110 --> 02:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
it's very rare that utilities provide
 
02:49:30.230 --> 02:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
assistance to
 
02:49:33.750 --> 02:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
the governments and so they say exclude
 
02:49:36.230 --> 02:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
utilities and they define utilities as
 
02:49:38.710 --> 02:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
water supply
 
02:49:41.990 --> 02:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
they do not refer to sewerage which is a
 
02:49:43.510 --> 02:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
very interesting thing so it's just
 
02:49:46.950 --> 02:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
clean safe drinking water electric gas
 
02:49:48.630 --> 02:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
and public mass transit system so you
 
02:49:49.990 --> 02:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
have to exclude those from the revenue
 
02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:51.269 align:start position:0%
have to exclude those from the revenue
calculation

02:49:51.269 --> 02:49:51.279 align:start position:0%
calculation
 
02:49:52.950 --> 02:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
exclude right refunds and other
 
02:49:55.670 --> 02:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
correcting transactions and exclude
 
02:49:57.190 --> 02:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
anything you receive from the issuance
 
02:50:00.469 --> 02:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
of debt and for states it says
 
02:50:01.990 --> 02:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
you have to exclude your liquor store
 
02:50:04.070 --> 02:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
revenues in that calculation
 
02:50:06.630 --> 02:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
then they say okay well then if it feels
 
02:50:08.230 --> 02:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
like they've excluded a lot
 
02:50:11.190 --> 02:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
but then what is in and essentially what
 
02:50:12.550 --> 02:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
they say is everything else
 
02:50:15.349 --> 02:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
taxes fees other revenues to support
 
02:50:17.269 --> 02:50:17.279 align:start position:0%
public services including component
 
02:50:18.950 --> 02:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
units and enterprise funds
 
02:50:21.269 --> 02:50:21.279 align:start position:0%
which as you can imagine there's myriad
 
02:50:22.389 --> 02:50:22.399 align:start position:0%
different things
 
02:50:24.630 --> 02:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
that counties and cities can have that
 
02:50:26.550 --> 02:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
create fees like zoos or
 
02:50:29.429 --> 02:50:29.439 align:start position:0%
parking or civic centers or things like
 
02:50:31.349 --> 02:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
that can all fall under
 
02:50:34.150 --> 02:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
revenue categories that can be captured
 
02:50:34.790 --> 02:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
what can you
 
02:50:39.190 --> 02:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
do with the revenue so a second sorry
 
02:50:41.670 --> 02:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
next what you do is you say how okay
 
02:50:43.670 --> 02:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
i've determined my revenue now what do i
 
02:50:45.429 --> 02:50:45.439 align:start position:0%
do with it so you look at your night
 
02:50:47.429 --> 02:50:47.439 align:start position:0%
2019 base year revenue
 
02:50:50.230 --> 02:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
and you project the revenue at 4.1
 
02:50:52.309 --> 02:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
percent or greater
 
02:50:54.070 --> 02:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
and then that multiplier you have to
 
02:50:56.710 --> 02:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
figure out at every december 31st of
 
02:50:57.910 --> 02:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
every year
 
02:50:59.670 --> 02:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
how much you've collected in actual
 
02:51:00.950 --> 02:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
revenues this is
 
02:51:03.269 --> 02:51:03.279 align:start position:0%
tough for a lot of local governments
 
02:51:03.990 --> 02:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
again because our
 
02:51:06.550 --> 02:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal year wraps around that december
 
02:51:07.830 --> 02:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
31st figure
 
02:51:09.670 --> 02:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of accruals that
 
02:51:12.070 --> 02:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
probably haven't happened or closed
 
02:51:15.429 --> 02:51:15.439 align:start position:0%
by december 31st so that's that is a
 
02:51:17.990 --> 02:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
that is an awkward period of time and we
 
02:51:19.750 --> 02:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
will be commenting the treasury on that
 
02:51:21.830 --> 02:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
because it just simply is very hard for
 
02:51:23.429 --> 02:51:23.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of people to show actuals on
 
02:51:25.750 --> 02:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
december 31st but that nevertheless
 
02:51:27.590 --> 02:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
that's what they say in the guidance and
 
02:51:28.870 --> 02:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
then of course
 
02:51:31.590 --> 02:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
if you're if your projected growth
 
02:51:31.600 --> 02:51:32.790 align:start position:0%
if you're if your projected growth
exceeds

02:51:32.790 --> 02:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
exceeds
 
02:51:34.710 --> 02:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry if your actuals exceeds your
 
02:51:36.070 --> 02:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
projected growth then
 
02:51:37.750 --> 02:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
obviously your collection is zero for
 
02:51:40.230 --> 02:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
that year now
 
02:51:42.550 --> 02:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
there is a condition too so once you've
 
02:51:43.990 --> 02:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
decided how much you're going to collect
 
02:51:46.870 --> 02:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
then you say you know what can i spend
 
02:51:48.710 --> 02:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
it on
 
02:51:50.389 --> 02:51:50.399 align:start position:0%
and they say you have to spend it on
 
02:51:52.710 --> 02:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
government services
 
02:51:55.670 --> 02:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
and government services means that you
 
02:51:57.750 --> 02:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
have to be able to
 
02:52:00.950 --> 02:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
provide direct service to aid or aid
 
02:52:03.590 --> 02:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
to citizens like you have to help emily
 
02:52:03.600 --> 02:52:04.070 align:start position:0%
to citizens like you have to help emily
brock

02:52:04.070 --> 02:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
brock
 
02:52:06.230 --> 02:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
right now because emily brock is
 
02:52:07.590 --> 02:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
suffering through the middle of the
 
02:52:07.600 --> 02:52:09.190 align:start position:0%
suffering through the middle of the
pandemic

02:52:09.190 --> 02:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
02:52:10.950 --> 02:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
and because of that because of that
 
02:52:10.960 --> 02:52:12.309 align:start position:0%
and because of that because of that
definition

02:52:12.309 --> 02:52:12.319 align:start position:0%
definition
 
02:52:15.190 --> 02:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
you're also saying we want to make sure
 
02:52:16.550 --> 02:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
that you don't use it on
 
02:52:20.070 --> 02:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
past promises or debt that you issued
 
02:52:21.910 --> 02:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
before now
 
02:52:25.190 --> 02:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
so don't use the money on debt service
 
02:52:27.349 --> 02:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
and also they say and this is the most
 
02:52:29.830 --> 02:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
contentious part of this guidance
 
02:52:32.150 --> 02:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
they also say don't put it in your rainy
 
02:52:33.269 --> 02:52:33.279 align:start position:0%
day funds
 
02:52:37.030 --> 02:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
or your reserves and of course
 
02:52:40.309 --> 02:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
everyone went bonkers about that because
 
02:52:42.710 --> 02:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
we used our reserves to get through this
 
02:52:44.710 --> 02:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
pandemic and that's the whole point here
 
02:52:45.349 --> 02:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
but what
 
02:52:48.469 --> 02:52:48.479 align:start position:0%
treasury is arguing is that if you use
 
02:52:50.550 --> 02:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
this money to deposit into your rainy
 
02:52:51.990 --> 02:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
day funds or reserves
 
02:52:55.510 --> 02:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
you're not helping emily brock right now
 
02:52:59.269 --> 02:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
you're helping future citizens
 
02:53:02.790 --> 02:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
and so they're saying that is prohibited
 
02:53:05.990 --> 02:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
as an eligible use in category c
 
02:53:07.510 --> 02:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
so i think an important distinction
 
02:53:09.190 --> 02:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
there now
 
02:53:11.110 --> 02:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
last but not least this was again the
 
02:53:13.429 --> 02:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
first words and probably the most
 
02:53:16.309 --> 02:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
the easiest to digest water sewer
 
02:53:17.510 --> 02:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure they did
 
02:53:20.550 --> 02:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
add in storm water in there as well
 
02:53:23.190 --> 02:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
so all uh very good things and they were
 
02:53:23.990 --> 02:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
also very
 
02:53:26.550 --> 02:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
generous about what does it mean to be
 
02:53:27.590 --> 02:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
an investment
 
02:53:30.790 --> 02:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
in and it means building or upgrading
 
02:53:32.070 --> 02:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure it means
 
02:53:34.389 --> 02:53:34.399 align:start position:0%
engineering scoping it means approaching
 
02:53:35.830 --> 02:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
a project it means
 
02:53:38.950 --> 02:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
preparing for a project um now
 
02:53:42.070 --> 02:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
clearly the the covered period applies
 
02:53:43.510 --> 02:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
to this period so
 
02:53:45.510 --> 02:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh all of those all of those costs have
 
02:53:46.710 --> 02:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
to be incurred
 
02:53:51.110 --> 02:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
by march 3rd 2021 and december
 
02:53:54.309 --> 02:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
31st 2024 but they can be expended
 
02:53:54.319 --> 02:53:55.269 align:start position:0%
31st 2024 but they can be expended
through

02:53:55.269 --> 02:53:55.279 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:53:58.550 --> 02:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
december 31st 2026 so there's a lot of
 
02:54:01.110 --> 02:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
flexibility built into the water
 
02:54:03.990 --> 02:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
storm water and sewer infrastructure
 
02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:04.550 align:start position:0%
storm water and sewer infrastructure
section

02:54:04.550 --> 02:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:54:07.590 --> 02:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
in the guidance they also are very
 
02:54:09.510 --> 02:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
specific about broadband infrastructure
 
02:54:10.870 --> 02:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
and this is where you start to see sort
 
02:54:10.880 --> 02:54:11.429 align:start position:0%
and this is where you start to see sort
of

02:54:11.429 --> 02:54:11.439 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:54:14.150 --> 02:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
equity components kind of come into the
 
02:54:15.590 --> 02:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
guidance they're saying
 
02:54:17.510 --> 02:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
if you do want to invest in broadband
 
02:54:19.349 --> 02:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
we'd prefer that it'd be owned by the
 
02:54:19.359 --> 02:54:20.150 align:start position:0%
we'd prefer that it'd be owned by the
government

02:54:20.150 --> 02:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
government
 
02:54:22.230 --> 02:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
first of all and then second of all that
 
02:54:23.910 --> 02:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
it's with um that you're investing in
 
02:54:25.510 --> 02:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
technology for tomorrow you're not
 
02:54:27.429 --> 02:54:27.439 align:start position:0%
investing in yesterday's technology so
 
02:54:28.150 --> 02:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
they set
 
02:54:29.990 --> 02:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
minimum parameters for upload and
 
02:54:31.269 --> 02:54:31.279 align:start position:0%
download speeds
 
02:54:33.349 --> 02:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
and that they have to be fiber optic
 
02:54:33.359 --> 02:54:34.309 align:start position:0%
and that they have to be fiber optic
investments

02:54:34.309 --> 02:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
investments
 
02:54:37.510 --> 02:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
the other thing to remember broadband
 
02:54:39.269 --> 02:54:39.279 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is generally a state
 
02:54:40.790 --> 02:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
venture but there are a lot of
 
02:54:42.550 --> 02:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
communities that have come together
 
02:54:45.590 --> 02:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
to create broadband cooperatives so
 
02:54:47.830 --> 02:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
these two these projects are also being
 
02:54:49.670 --> 02:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
looked at by local governments which is
 
02:54:52.389 --> 02:54:52.399 align:start position:0%
i think a great thing
 
02:54:56.710 --> 02:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
um in uh um
 
02:54:59.990 --> 02:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
in the guidance they also talk about um
 
02:55:03.349 --> 02:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
what audit and reconciliation um
 
02:55:06.150 --> 02:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
these processes need to be put in place
 
02:55:07.910 --> 02:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
and there's a few things that are of
 
02:55:07.920 --> 02:55:08.389 align:start position:0%
and there's a few things that are of
note

02:55:08.389 --> 02:55:08.399 align:start position:0%
note
 
02:55:10.550 --> 02:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
number one there's an interim report
 
02:55:12.070 --> 02:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's due like
 
02:55:13.670 --> 02:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
right around the corner there's an
 
02:55:17.510 --> 02:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
interim report due on july 31st 2021
 
02:55:19.429 --> 02:55:19.439 align:start position:0%
and like is everybody gonna have their
 
02:55:21.110 --> 02:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
money by then you know like
 
02:55:22.790 --> 02:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
i mean how are we supposed to do a
 
02:55:25.349 --> 02:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
report if nobody has their money so
 
02:55:27.349 --> 02:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
we're still we're still working with
 
02:55:29.349 --> 02:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
them on that on what type of information
 
02:55:30.950 --> 02:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to be reconciling but
 
02:55:33.429 --> 02:55:33.439 align:start position:0%
the broad categories we can expect them
 
02:55:35.269 --> 02:55:35.279 align:start position:0%
to be asking new hampshire
 
02:55:37.110 --> 02:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
what do you intend to be spending this
 
02:55:39.349 --> 02:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
money on and so there's probably going
 
02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
to be very broad categories that they're
 
02:55:42.389 --> 02:55:42.399 align:start position:0%
going to ask for
 
02:55:44.309 --> 02:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
then of course there's quarterly reports
 
02:55:45.429 --> 02:55:45.439 align:start position:0%
that are more
 
02:55:48.710 --> 02:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
um your accounting and auditing typical
 
02:55:50.550 --> 02:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
accounting and auditing so like
 
02:55:52.389 --> 02:55:52.399 align:start position:0%
individual payments and grants that
 
02:55:54.230 --> 02:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
you've sent out from this report so
 
02:55:55.429 --> 02:55:55.439 align:start position:0%
those are going to be
 
02:55:59.030 --> 02:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
periodic um pretty constant
 
02:56:01.990 --> 02:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
probably for all direct recipients and
 
02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:02.710 align:start position:0%
probably for all direct recipients and
then

02:56:02.710 --> 02:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:56:04.630 --> 02:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
last but not least there's recovery plan
 
02:56:07.030 --> 02:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
performance reports due from states
 
02:56:09.510 --> 02:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
and large cities and counties over 250
 
02:56:09.520 --> 02:56:10.230 align:start position:0%
and large cities and counties over 250
000

02:56:10.230 --> 02:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
000
 
02:56:11.429 --> 02:56:11.439 align:start position:0%
and what they're going to be asking
 
02:56:12.870 --> 02:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
there this is when you're going to start
 
02:56:13.269 --> 02:56:13.279 align:start position:0%
to see
 
02:56:16.150 --> 02:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
sort of the biden question that they're
 
02:56:17.349 --> 02:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
going to be asking about
 
02:56:19.030 --> 02:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
performance indicators based on
 
02:56:21.269 --> 02:56:21.279 align:start position:0%
objectives and as you read through the
 
02:56:23.030 --> 02:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
guidance you see things that are
 
02:56:26.150 --> 02:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
interesting like reference to climate
 
02:56:28.950 --> 02:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
um reference to equity and social
 
02:56:28.960 --> 02:56:29.990 align:start position:0%
um reference to equity and social
services

02:56:29.990 --> 02:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:56:32.070 --> 02:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
so those might be those performance
 
02:56:33.110 --> 02:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
indicators that
 
02:56:35.910 --> 02:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
we'll see in those annual reports that
 
02:56:35.920 --> 02:56:36.230 align:start position:0%
we'll see in those annual reports that
the

02:56:36.230 --> 02:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:56:37.750 --> 02:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
president will be asking for but
 
02:56:39.349 --> 02:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
nevertheless those are the things that
 
02:56:39.359 --> 02:56:39.990 align:start position:0%
nevertheless those are the things that
are

02:56:39.990 --> 02:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:56:42.710 --> 02:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
um important for the administration in
 
02:56:42.720 --> 02:56:43.190 align:start position:0%
um important for the administration in
terms

02:56:43.190 --> 02:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
terms
 
02:56:45.590 --> 02:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
of ensuring that they have captured the
 
02:56:47.110 --> 02:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
legislative intent of the american
 
02:56:48.630 --> 02:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
rescue plan act so
 
02:56:51.670 --> 02:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
that's um all i have for you i i know
 
02:56:53.830 --> 02:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
i've come up to the very last minute but
 
02:56:54.550 --> 02:56:54.560 align:start position:0%
stop now i
 
02:56:56.790 --> 02:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
realize there's a couple questions all
 
02:56:58.710 --> 02:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
right we have two minutes left
 
02:57:01.750 --> 02:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
and so one question from representative
 
02:57:01.760 --> 02:57:03.670 align:start position:0%
and so one question from representative
romney

02:57:03.670 --> 02:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
romney
 
02:57:06.870 --> 02:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
followed by representing your league
 
02:57:10.389 --> 02:57:10.399 align:start position:0%
representative real quick last time we
 
02:57:13.269 --> 02:57:13.279 align:start position:0%
you you presented you said may 10th may
 
02:57:13.279 --> 02:57:14.309 align:start position:0%
you you presented you said may 10th may
11th

02:57:14.309 --> 02:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
11th
 
02:57:15.910 --> 02:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
the plans were supposed to be developed
 
02:57:18.070 --> 02:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
and approved by that point
 
02:57:19.990 --> 02:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
so is that goal post been moved
 
02:57:22.950 --> 02:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
officially or what well
 
02:57:24.870 --> 02:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh you mean from the united states
 
02:57:25.990 --> 02:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
treasury to
 
02:57:29.750 --> 02:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
to spend it out well indeed so
 
02:57:31.750 --> 02:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
what the treasury interpreted was that
 
02:57:32.790 --> 02:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
no no no
 
02:57:35.190 --> 02:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
what the what the legislative text says
 
02:57:36.389 --> 02:57:36.399 align:start position:0%
is that you have to
 
02:57:38.550 --> 02:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
certify those proceeds by may 10th and
 
02:57:40.309 --> 02:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
so what they did is they opened up that
 
02:57:41.830 --> 02:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
certification portal
 
02:57:44.389 --> 02:57:44.399 align:start position:0%
and now they're putting the onus on all
 
02:57:46.389 --> 02:57:46.399 align:start position:0%
of those jurisdictions to certify the
 
02:57:46.399 --> 02:57:47.590 align:start position:0%
of those jurisdictions to certify the
proceeds

02:57:47.590 --> 02:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
proceeds
 
02:57:49.510 --> 02:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's up to you i mean if you if you
 
02:57:51.429 --> 02:57:51.439 align:start position:0%
can't do it by may 10th
 
02:57:53.429 --> 02:57:53.439 align:start position:0%
or may 17th or where are we today may
 
02:57:56.230 --> 02:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
19th you should do it sooner than later
 
02:57:59.190 --> 02:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
i think it's their point but but
 
02:58:01.110 --> 02:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
everybody didn't have to certify by
 
02:58:02.790 --> 02:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
may 10th they just had to open up the
 
02:58:04.790 --> 02:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
portal by may 10th is what their
 
02:58:06.830 --> 02:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
argument is
 
02:58:09.630 --> 02:58:09.640 align:start position:0%
represented by representative unions and
 
02:58:09.640 --> 02:58:11.510 align:start position:0%
represented by representative unions and
representing

02:58:11.510 --> 02:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
representing
 
02:58:14.950 --> 02:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative on broadband the question
 
02:58:14.960 --> 02:58:15.590 align:start position:0%
representative on broadband the question
is

02:58:15.590 --> 02:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:58:17.830 --> 02:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
since most of the communities in new
 
02:58:17.840 --> 02:58:18.790 align:start position:0%
since most of the communities in new
hampshire

02:58:18.790 --> 02:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:58:22.389 --> 02:58:22.399 align:start position:0%
uh contract with entities is
 
02:58:24.469 --> 02:58:24.479 align:start position:0%
is that government or how does that work
 
02:58:25.429 --> 02:58:25.439 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
02:58:29.349 --> 02:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
we just don't have town operations for
 
02:58:33.030 --> 02:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
broadband nor should the town actually
 
02:58:35.990 --> 02:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
they are not definitive on operations on
 
02:58:37.910 --> 02:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
whether it should be operated by private
 
02:58:39.830 --> 02:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
corporations or if it's publicly
 
02:58:41.590 --> 02:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
operated fiber optic
 
02:58:43.910 --> 02:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
so i think they well they said they
 
02:58:45.269 --> 02:58:45.279 align:start position:0%
would really like for it to be a
 
02:58:45.279 --> 02:58:45.830 align:start position:0%
would really like for it to be a
government

02:58:45.830 --> 02:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
government
 
02:58:47.590 --> 02:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
enterprise you can read in the guidance
 
02:58:49.830 --> 02:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
that it's that they realize they can't
 
02:58:52.950 --> 02:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
they can't um make that a requirement of
 
02:58:52.960 --> 02:58:53.429 align:start position:0%
they can't um make that a requirement of
this

02:58:53.429 --> 02:58:53.439 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:58:55.349 --> 02:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
specific investment because of the way
 
02:58:56.870 --> 02:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
that fiber optic
 
02:58:59.190 --> 02:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
fiber optic broadband delivery works i
 
02:59:00.950 --> 02:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
mean there's the initial mile the middle
 
02:59:03.030 --> 02:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
mile and the last mile right and so
 
02:59:05.030 --> 02:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of corporations that are
 
02:59:06.870 --> 02:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
involved in that process so
 
02:59:08.469 --> 02:59:08.479 align:start position:0%
um i think that they realize they
 
02:59:09.910 --> 02:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't control that
 
02:59:12.309 --> 02:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
so that the language is more suggestive
 
02:59:13.190 --> 02:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
than it is
 
02:59:15.830 --> 02:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
definitive representative followed by
 
02:59:17.429 --> 02:59:17.439 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury
 
02:59:19.110 --> 02:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you ms
 
02:59:20.550 --> 02:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
brock very quickly
 
02:59:23.349 --> 02:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
um the the dates for the municipalities
 
02:59:25.190 --> 02:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh if i understood you correctly that's
 
02:59:27.110 --> 02:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
not all exactly
 
02:59:29.110 --> 02:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
ironed out yet for the municipalities
 
02:59:30.710 --> 02:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
and how they have to report this
 
02:59:32.389 --> 02:59:32.399 align:start position:0%
can you just clarify that for me just a
 
02:59:33.990 --> 02:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
little bit because i know that my town
 
02:59:35.590 --> 02:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
administrator is going to ask me because
 
02:59:37.910 --> 02:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
he's watching
 
02:59:40.830 --> 02:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
so um in terms of timing for what for
 
02:59:40.840 --> 02:59:43.190 align:start position:0%
so um in terms of timing for what for
reporting

02:59:43.190 --> 02:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
02:59:46.790 --> 02:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
okay right so in terms of reporting
 
02:59:49.110 --> 02:59:49.120 align:start position:0%
so there's no guideline or timeline on
 
02:59:50.870 --> 02:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
certification but the sooner the better
 
02:59:50.880 --> 02:59:51.750 align:start position:0%
certification but the sooner the better
obviously

02:59:51.750 --> 02:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
02:59:54.309 --> 02:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
in terms of reporting the information
 
02:59:55.349 --> 02:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
there will be
 
02:59:57.429 --> 02:59:57.439 align:start position:0%
there will be an initial report due on
 
02:59:58.870 --> 02:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
july 31st
 
03:00:01.910 --> 03:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
2021 so that will be the initial report
 
03:00:02.790 --> 03:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
that's due
 
03:00:05.750 --> 03:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
but as you certify you'll start to see
 
03:00:07.590 --> 03:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
that they will develop these quarterly
 
03:00:09.429 --> 03:00:09.439 align:start position:0%
reporting schedules and the quarterly
 
03:00:09.439 --> 03:00:10.070 align:start position:0%
reporting schedules and the quarterly
reporting

03:00:10.070 --> 03:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
03:00:12.550 --> 03:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
schedules will start may 10th and we'll
 
03:00:13.590 --> 03:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
start to see
 
03:00:16.550 --> 03:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
quarterly reports due um from direct
 
03:00:16.560 --> 03:00:17.750 align:start position:0%
quarterly reports due um from direct
recipients

03:00:17.750 --> 03:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
recipients
 
03:00:21.590 --> 03:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
at basically at quarterly times from the
 
03:00:22.870 --> 03:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
united states
 
03:00:25.910 --> 03:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
office of the inspector general so oig
 
03:00:27.429 --> 03:00:27.439 align:start position:0%
will be issuing out those
 
03:00:29.269 --> 03:00:29.279 align:start position:0%
intervals and we'll be making sure to
 
03:00:30.710 --> 03:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
keep those in bright lines because those
 
03:00:32.150 --> 03:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
are things that are important to gfy
 
03:00:33.349 --> 03:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
members as well
 
03:00:36.870 --> 03:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
representative spellsbury thank you
 
03:00:38.550 --> 03:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
our county is due to receive about eight
 
03:00:40.550 --> 03:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars we understand
 
03:00:43.030 --> 03:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh coincidentally we're considering a 54
 
03:00:44.389 --> 03:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
million dollar
 
03:00:48.150 --> 03:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh project to renovate and expand
 
03:00:50.710 --> 03:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
the county nursing home that of course
 
03:00:52.710 --> 03:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
is not broadband water or sewer
 
03:00:54.630 --> 03:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh how much freedom is there on other
 
03:00:57.190 --> 03:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure projects
 
03:00:59.910 --> 03:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
um is so in eligible use category a if
 
03:01:01.590 --> 03:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
the expansion can be drawn
 
03:01:05.510 --> 03:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
back to um the mitigating the effects of
 
03:01:07.670 --> 03:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
kovic 19 in your economy
 
03:01:09.510 --> 03:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
then infrastructure falls underneath
 
03:01:11.190 --> 03:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
there in fact they actually use the
 
03:01:11.200 --> 03:01:12.070 align:start position:0%
there in fact they actually use the
words

03:01:12.070 --> 03:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
words
 
03:01:15.910 --> 03:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
um going back to my slides they use the
 
03:01:15.920 --> 03:01:19.030 align:start position:0%
um going back to my slides they use the
words

03:01:19.030 --> 03:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:21.349 --> 03:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
capital investments in public facilities
 
03:01:22.070 --> 03:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
to meet
 
03:01:25.510 --> 03:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic operational needs etc so
 
03:01:27.830 --> 03:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
what that would mean from a nursing
 
03:01:29.750 --> 03:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
facility perspective that falls
 
03:01:31.750 --> 03:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
fairly well into there and we've
 
03:01:33.349 --> 03:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
received a lot of questions from
 
03:01:33.359 --> 03:01:34.150 align:start position:0%
received a lot of questions from
counties

03:01:34.150 --> 03:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
counties
 
03:01:35.990 --> 03:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
that are that are really thinking about
 
03:01:38.389 --> 03:01:38.399 align:start position:0%
health care capital investments
 
03:01:41.990 --> 03:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
healthcare infrastructure and
 
03:01:44.070 --> 03:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
and eligible use category a allows for
 
03:01:45.750 --> 03:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
them to sort of capture that
 
03:01:47.510 --> 03:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
so if it's an eight million dollars and
 
03:01:49.830 --> 03:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's a 54 million dollar project
 
03:01:51.750 --> 03:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
then obviously a portion of it could be
 
03:01:53.269 --> 03:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
cash financed or
 
03:01:55.429 --> 03:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
pay go and then the rest of it could be
 
03:01:56.630 --> 03:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
bonded so i think
 
03:01:58.150 --> 03:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
great flexibility and eligible use
 
03:02:00.070 --> 03:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
category a for that for that
 
03:02:06.309 --> 03:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:08.870 --> 03:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
emily i do have to jump i do have to
 
03:02:09.830 --> 03:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
jump but
 
03:02:11.750 --> 03:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's been a real pleasure and i'm
 
03:02:13.830 --> 03:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
i'm also very happy to answer questions
 
03:02:14.790 --> 03:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
by email
 
03:02:17.349 --> 03:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
um and i will stick my email in the chat
 
03:02:19.190 --> 03:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
if you do have more specific questions
 
03:02:19.200 --> 03:02:19.750 align:start position:0%
if you do have more specific questions
or

03:02:19.750 --> 03:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:02:21.750 --> 03:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
if your administrators of your various
 
03:02:23.670 --> 03:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
local governments have questions as well
 
03:02:25.030 --> 03:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly happy to provide these
 
03:02:26.469 --> 03:02:26.479 align:start position:0%
slides to them as well
 
03:02:29.910 --> 03:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
can you provide us a copy of the slides
 
03:02:32.710 --> 03:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
and provide us also in your email
 
03:02:35.510 --> 03:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
for sure welcome thank you very much for
 
03:02:36.550 --> 03:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
taking the time
 
03:02:40.870 --> 03:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate it thank you
 
03:02:43.110 --> 03:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
all right committee i think that's been
 
03:02:45.190 --> 03:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
a very fruitful morning
 
03:02:48.870 --> 03:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:53.110 --> 03:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
i've scheduled next week tuesday
 
03:02:56.790 --> 03:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
wednesday and thursday in case we
 
03:03:01.269 --> 03:03:01.279 align:start position:0%
need them for revenue estimates
 
03:03:06.070 --> 03:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
on tuesday we'd like to be able to
 
03:03:10.710 --> 03:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
find the exact senate bill 3.
 
03:03:12.870 --> 03:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
we'll start off with a work session and
 
03:03:14.630 --> 03:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
then hopefully
 
03:03:17.910 --> 03:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
we can proceed into a uh executive
 
03:03:17.920 --> 03:03:19.670 align:start position:0%
we can proceed into a uh executive
session

03:03:19.670 --> 03:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
session
 
03:03:22.790 --> 03:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
because we we've run out of time
 
03:03:25.990 --> 03:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
any uh further questions or comments
 
03:03:28.630 --> 03:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
representative nunes uh yes thank you mr
 
03:03:28.640 --> 03:03:29.349 align:start position:0%
representative nunes uh yes thank you mr
chairman

03:03:29.349 --> 03:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:03:31.670 --> 03:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh will miss brock be coming back to
 
03:03:33.429 --> 03:03:33.439 align:start position:0%
visit with us again
 
03:03:36.550 --> 03:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh as more of these rules roll out and
 
03:03:39.750 --> 03:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
more information is given i think that
 
03:03:41.429 --> 03:03:41.439 align:start position:0%
what we see here this big
 
03:03:43.510 --> 03:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
broad overview we're trying to
 
03:03:44.630 --> 03:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
understand it all
 
03:03:47.750 --> 03:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
it is a lot we do have town
 
03:03:50.070 --> 03:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
administrators and county administrators
 
03:03:52.150 --> 03:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
that want to speak with all of us about
 
03:03:52.160 --> 03:03:53.030 align:start position:0%
that want to speak with all of us about
this

03:03:53.030 --> 03:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:03:54.790 --> 03:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh they're very interested in when
 
03:03:56.550 --> 03:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to get the funds
 
03:03:58.710 --> 03:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
and how they can spend it and what how
 
03:04:00.150 --> 03:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
they have to report it and
 
03:04:02.550 --> 03:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
i i'm sure many of you are working with
 
03:04:04.550 --> 03:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
your towns just like i am
 
03:04:06.070 --> 03:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
to try to hold their hand through the
 
03:04:06.080 --> 03:04:08.070 align:start position:0%
to try to hold their hand through the
process

03:04:08.070 --> 03:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:04:09.910 --> 03:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
i think that the more information we can
 
03:04:11.670 --> 03:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
get as soon as it comes out the better
 
03:04:12.550 --> 03:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
we'll be
 
03:04:15.030 --> 03:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
in helping our town administrators
 
03:04:16.630 --> 03:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
figure out how they need to get all this
 
03:04:18.070 --> 03:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
stuff certified and reported to the
 
03:04:18.080 --> 03:04:19.269 align:start position:0%
stuff certified and reported to the
government

03:04:19.269 --> 03:04:19.279 align:start position:0%
government
 
03:04:22.550 --> 03:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
i agree with you numerous
 
03:04:26.070 --> 03:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
and just as soon as enough
 
03:04:27.910 --> 03:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
new information comes out we'll have her
 
03:04:27.920 --> 03:04:31.590 align:start position:0%
new information comes out we'll have her
back

03:04:31.590 --> 03:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:34.630 --> 03:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
and it's easy because of zoom as you
 
03:04:37.030 --> 03:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
as you heard she was pulled away from 11
 
03:04:39.510 --> 03:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
o'clock made to meet the treasurer
 
03:04:42.150 --> 03:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
at 11 and then was able to meet with us
 
03:04:42.710 --> 03:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
at 12
 
03:04:45.910 --> 03:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
now she's on to another meeting
 
03:04:48.630 --> 03:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
okay anything else hopefully she gets
 
03:04:50.950 --> 03:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
some lunch in between
 
03:04:53.990 --> 03:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
yes all right then
 
03:04:58.630 --> 03:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh i have nothing else for today
 
03:05:03.349 --> 03:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh think about what you've heard
 
03:05:06.070 --> 03:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
and if if you have any amendments on
 
03:05:07.750 --> 03:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
senate bill 3
 
03:05:11.349 --> 03:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
or if anything you want to share
 
03:05:13.429 --> 03:05:13.439 align:start position:0%
prior to that then maybe we could do it
 
03:05:17.030 --> 03:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
