00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
um you know the society is is neutral on
 
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
um and in terms of fairness i think
 
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:09.519 align:start position:0%
philosophical or political question and
 
00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
not really one that
 
00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:12.639 align:start position:0%
uh that we're looking to take a position
 
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
on thank you
 
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
okay i agree i i i would
 
00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
um just add that if you
 
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
if um if the bill
 
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
is amended to exclude um
 
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
or to disallow deductions
 
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's really more confusing for that's
 
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
going to be more confusing for
 
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers than just not passing the bill
 
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.709 align:start position:0%
taxpayers than just not passing the bill
altogether

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 align:start position:0%
altogether
 
00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
in my opinion um i mean either way what
 
00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
what you know it it's just a way to
 
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
um to make the
 
00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
ppp loan proceeds taxable you know
 
00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
whether you
 
00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 align:start position:0%
included his income or disallowed the
 
00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.229 align:start position:0%
included his income or disallowed the
deductions

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
deductions
 
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's the same it's the same result the
 
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.670 align:start position:0%
it's the same it's the same result the
the

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
forgiven amount becomes a taxable
 
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
cost to the business and i think
 
00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
the disallowance of the expenses is a
 
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
more confusing
 
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
um avenue to do that
 
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
because um it's much less clear what the
 
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.149 align:start position:0%
because um it's much less clear what the
timing

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 align:start position:0%
timing
 
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
should be of that um
 
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.270 align:start position:0%
should be of that um
[Music]

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
recognition of the disallowed should it
 
00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 align:start position:0%
go back to the 2020
 
00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 align:start position:0%
year when the expenses were um
 
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
paid for or does that disallowance
 
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.789 align:start position:0%
paid for or does that disallowance
happen

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
in the year that the um loan is forgiven
 
00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 align:start position:0%
you know we'd need more guidance i think
 
00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:46.630 align:start position:0%
you know we'd need more guidance i think
to

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
for things to be clear so again we
 
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
you know we're neutral on the bill um
 
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
and so i don't think i want to get into
 
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
the fairness
 
00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
question but i think it's always
 
00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 align:start position:0%
important to
 
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
try to um at least keep things as
 
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
clear and simple as possible um
 
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
no matter what the you know what the
 
00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 align:start position:0%
ultimate result ends up being
 
00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
well thank you for that that's very
 
00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 align:start position:0%
helpful okay uh before i go to the next
 
00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.309 align:start position:0%
helpful okay uh before i go to the next
question

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
um kyle
 
00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
and kevin do you represent the society
 
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
and did you take a vote that you'd be
 
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
neutral on this bill
 
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
or is that your own ferns
 
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
we we don't didn't take a a vote as a
 
00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
society we
 
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
as a society we've um it's our policy
 
00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
not to advocate one way or the other
 
00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 align:start position:0%
for you know for tax
 
00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
increases or tax decreases we're
 
00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
you know what we're trying to do and
 
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
what our mission is is to
 
00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 align:start position:0%
um help explain how
 
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
um different changes in tax law um
 
00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
you know impact uh taxpayers
 
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
and also you know if we do advocate for
 
00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 align:start position:0%
anything as i just said we advocate for
 
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
clarity um and to
 
00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
as much as possible simplicity to um
 
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
so that it's easy for taxpayers to
 
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.990 align:start position:0%
so that it's easy for taxpayers to
comply

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
comply
 
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
and it's clear as to what the rules are
 
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.110 align:start position:0%
and it's clear as to what the rules are
but

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
um you know we're not we don't as a
 
00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 align:start position:0%
matter of policy and
 
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
i mean this has been voted on in general
 
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
not specific to every time we
 
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
talk about something but um you know we
 
00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:40.159 align:start position:0%
we don't advocate
 
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
for increases in taxes decreases in
 
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.550 align:start position:0%
for increases in taxes decreases in
taxes

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
um or you know new taxes
 
00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
you know we're we're not going to
 
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
advocate one way or the other for that
 
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.470 align:start position:0%
advocate one way or the other for that
it's

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
it's just the reporting and compliance
 
00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
that we advocate for
 
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
um you know being as clear as possible
 
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
for our clients what you said is
 
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
it's much clearer to your clients
 
00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
and yourselves if uh senator
 
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
bill three does not pass
 
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
because their client would get the ppp
 
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.870 align:start position:0%
because their client would get the ppp
loans

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
loans
 
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
and then they could and if they use it
 
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
for what
 
00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
they apply for they're not going to pay
 
00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
any taxes because
 
00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think the you know the
 
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.390 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think the you know the
amendment

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
that's been proposed to sp3
 
00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
confusion to the timing of when those
 
00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:50.469 align:start position:0%
confusion to the timing of when those
expenses

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
don't get deducted and
 
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
i mean right so um
 
00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
if if you're going to amend sb3
 
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
for that it would be simpler just to not
 
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
pass it at all and allow the current law
 
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
that's in place that the dra has already
 
00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
issued guidance on
 
00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
um to stand because we at this point we
 
00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:16.150 align:start position:0%
um to stand because we at this point we
understand

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
the you know we understand how that
 
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
is gonna and we're at a point where uh
 
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
maybe trying to say you gotta forget
 
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
it and then if that's the case
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
in order to be balanced but we'd have to
 
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.029 align:start position:0%
in order to be balanced but we'd have to
say

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
for those that believe it this way is
 
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.469 align:start position:0%
for those that believe it this way is
that

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
then you can't deduct the expenses if
 
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.390 align:start position:0%
then you can't deduct the expenses if
they

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
go to the way of the political winds
 
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
but anyway we'll go to the next question
 
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.510 align:start position:0%
but anyway we'll go to the next question
miss

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
miss
 
00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
ribson a major yes i have to leave in 10
 
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
minutes could i ask a question that i
 
00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
think is clarifying before i go
 
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
i sure can represent elementary thank
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
on i don't
 
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
thinking about the water's edge
 
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
on for on mr
 
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
hayfield on do you have any idea
 
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
on whether the subsidiaries of the
 
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
larger businesses
 
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
on were able to qualify
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
for ppp loans on their own
 
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
i've seen some indication of that
 
00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 align:start position:0%
looking through who got a ppp loan in
 
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
lebanon but
 
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how whether that they were
 
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
very small
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
people those and they probably didn't
 
00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
get good advice
 
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea what the advice
 
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
would be on that
 
00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh well i do think i i is your
 
00:06:59.589 --> 00:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
if your question is do um with
 
00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries of those larger
 
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
water's edge groups qualify for ppp and
 
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
did some of them receive them i
 
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
i think the answer is yes in certain
 
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances i think
 
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
there was um
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
you know the general rule that
 
00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
businesses over i think 300 employees
 
00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
um could not apply or qualify for ppp
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
there were exceptions to that and i
 
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:26.950 align:start position:0%
there were exceptions to that and i
think

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
some of those exceptions depended on the
 
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
industry so
 
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
i believe restaurants and and some
 
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
hospitality businesses
 
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.360 align:start position:0%
could qualify based on their
 
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.909 align:start position:0%
could qualify based on their
subsidiaries

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:41.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
you know situation and not not not have
 
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.710 align:start position:0%
you know situation and not not not have
to

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
sort of look at the larger group
 
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question so i
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
think so yes i believe some
 
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
probably did qualify but and some didn't
 
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
okay representative spellsbury
 
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh yes i think it's been very very
 
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.469 align:start position:0%
uh yes i think it's been very very
interesting

00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
commentary so far and
 
00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879 align:start position:0%
i by the way do not in any way disagree
 
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
with the notion that just
 
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
failing to pass sp3 it might be a
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
simpler and more direct route
 
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
my concern is that if there is a
 
00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
political will to csv3
 
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
go forward that the amendment may be
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
necessary and
 
00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:39.519 align:start position:0%
did i hear you correctly to agree in
 
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
your comment uh
 
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
i believe to um representative ames
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative major that it is
 
00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:51.519 align:start position:0%
essentially true that
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
all uh ppp loans
 
00:08:58.389 --> 00:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
must be offset by qualified deductions
 
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
yes um so if in order to qualify for
 
00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:08.949 align:start position:0%
yes um so if in order to qualify for
forgiveness

00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
forgiveness
 
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
they have to have used the loan proceeds
 
00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.550 align:start position:0%
they have to have used the loan proceeds
for

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
the various types of expenses that were
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
allowed under the program
 
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
most of those being wages but there were
 
00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
some other expenses that were also
 
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
qualified and so then do you agree that
 
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:24.550 align:start position:0%
qualified and so then do you agree that
the

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
the um necessary consequence of that is
 
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
that that portion
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
of their um revenue
 
00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
attributable to the ppp loan uh
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i i guess i'm kevin i don't
 
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
know if you had
 
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
no i'm not sure i understand the
 
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
question but to the extent of the ppp
 
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
i'm glad to rephrase it
 
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
all right well if i can offer a response
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
which may be the answer that
 
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
ppp funds a big piece of that were to be
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
used for wages and in some cases
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
it was all used for wages so to the
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
extent that wages were paid with ppp
 
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
funds those wages will be included in
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
the bet
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
calculation now if
 
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
the the issue is that
 
00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:22.959 align:start position:0%
the sb3 is passed without an amendment
 
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
it follows essentially the irs
 
00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:26.470 align:start position:0%
it follows essentially the irs
guidelines

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
the income would not be taxable but the
 
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
deductions for payroll would still be
 
00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.069 align:start position:0%
deductions for payroll would still be
allowed

00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
those deductions for payroll would still
 
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
be included in the bet calculation
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire return does that
 
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
different perhaps but helpful i i i
 
00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
think you're confirming that there is a
 
00:10:48.079 --> 00:10:48.470 align:start position:0%
think you're confirming that there is a
b

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
b
 
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
e t uh impact on uh
 
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
from from payroll um but
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
uh i guess i'm just asking you to
 
00:10:57.839 --> 00:10:59.509 align:start position:0%
uh i guess i'm just asking you to
confirm

00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
confirm
 
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
that there that that to the extent that
 
00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:02.870 align:start position:0%
that there that that to the extent that
uh

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
ppp loans are forgiven as a result of
 
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
having been used for qualified expenses
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
that particular revenue is not
 
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959 align:start position:0%
i mean even if sp3 is not passed i mean
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
if that's
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
if if if new hampshire law stays the way
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
and forgiven ppp is uh
 
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
therefore included in taxable income it
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
will be entirely
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
offset by the expenses for which it was
 
00:11:45.839 --> 00:11:46.710 align:start position:0%
offset by the expenses for which it was
used

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
used
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
the the expenses for which it was used
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
will be included as deductions on the
 
00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:50.949 align:start position:0%
will be included as deductions on the
return

00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:50.959 align:start position:0%
return
 
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
yes that's right okay
 
00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:57.519 align:start position:0%
so there's no net text effect uh
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
if i may uh chairman major i had another
 
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.150 align:start position:0%
if i may uh chairman major i had another
question

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh so you know in our search
 
00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:08.839 align:start position:0%
for uh for evidence and data we of
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
course i have to rely heavily on
 
00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:13.190 align:start position:0%
course i have to rely heavily on
anecdote

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
anecdote
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
and the problem with anecdote is it's
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
spotty uh you don't know how well
 
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
reinforced it is but i'm thinking of
 
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:20.790 align:start position:0%
reinforced it is but i'm thinking of
several

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
several
 
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh business owners who i know well here
 
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
in town
 
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
with whom i've had conversation on this
 
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.949 align:start position:0%
with whom i've had conversation on this
topic

00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
topic
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
and i i just wonder if i can just
 
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
describe those two situations very
 
00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.629 align:start position:0%
describe those two situations very
briefly

00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
whether you find them to be
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
representative or aberrations
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
in one case i'm talking about the owner
 
00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
of a moving company
 
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
and the other case i'm talking about the
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
owner of a glass company
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
uh both of them of course were filled
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
with fear
 
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh when the government imposed uh
 
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
limitations came about and
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh uh things temporarily took
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
a nosedive for their businesses in march
 
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
and april
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh but by may particularly june july
 
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
things started to look differently
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
and uh they both would have predicted
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
severe impacts but as it turns out they
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
both did extraordinarily well
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
in 2020. in the case of the glass
 
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
company they weren't in
 
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
installing showers so much but they were
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
busy all over the place installing
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
plexiglass dividers in schools and
 
00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:37.829 align:start position:0%
plexiglass dividers in schools and
elsewhere

00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:37.839 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
and in the case of the moving company
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
virtually nobody moved for a couple of
 
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.230 align:start position:0%
virtually nobody moved for a couple of
months

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
and then they saw a surge like they'd
 
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
never seen before and broke all their
 
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
records in the second half of the year
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
so i just i think if we were
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
sitting here uh 12 to 14 months ago
 
00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
using our crystal ball we would have
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
drawn very different conclusions about
 
00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
who would be winners and who would be
 
00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:02.310 align:start position:0%
who would be winners and who would be
losers

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
losers
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
there would have been a temptation to
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
assume there were no winners
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
and as things turned out i think maybe
 
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of surprises have occurred
 
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
in your practice and just
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
gazing across your clientele do you see
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
many similar situations or you think
 
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:20.069 align:start position:0%
many similar situations or you think
that

00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
um i i have seen some of
 
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
those situations um
 
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
and then i've i've also seen um some
 
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
many uh clients who who
 
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
did um struggle and were negatively
 
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
impacted for the entire
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
year um you know for
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
and it really just depends on the
 
00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:50.959 align:start position:0%
business who their customers were
 
00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
and how their customers were impacted
 
00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
and sort of how that trickled down to
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
them but yeah i
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
i have seen stories like you've
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
described and
 
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
i've seen um many stories
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
of uh sort of the opposite impact as
 
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:08.870 align:start position:0%
of uh sort of the opposite impact as
well

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
um it's you know pretty diverse in
 
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
i would agree with carl it's pretty
 
00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.350 align:start position:0%
i would agree with carl it's pretty
diverse

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
diverse
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
so basically the conclusion is there's
 
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
murphy thank you mr chairman and uh
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
thanks to our guests for joining us and
 
00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:45.990 align:start position:0%
thanks to our guests for joining us and
i

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
actually was asking the question that
 
00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury just brought
 
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.030 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury just brought
up

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
in my mind given that the cares act and
 
00:15:55.269 --> 00:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
the ppp
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
funds were meant to help employees
 
00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839 align:start position:0%
stay afloat and employees get paid
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
pay for health benefits pay for
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
retirement benefits and wages
 
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
and given that you both have said that
 
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:09.910 align:start position:0%
and given that you both have said that
your

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:16:11.749 --> 00:16:11.759 align:start position:0%
clientele is not the water's edge of the
 
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
large corporations
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
it probably is even more appropriate for
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
the question that representative
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
spillsbury asked because it gives us a
 
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
flavor of the state
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
and so i was thinking about the various
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
businesses you have the business that
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
took ppe dollars and regardless of how
 
00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:28.550 align:start position:0%
took ppe dollars and regardless of how
they

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
invested it or used it they folded and
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
declared bankruptcy they had no business
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
profits tax to speak
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
of you then have a company that changed
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
their way
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh received the ppe uh monies
 
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
uh changed their model perhaps and
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps broke even or had minimal profit
 
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
not necessarily impacted with the
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
business profits tax and then you have
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
the other group that um representative
 
00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839 align:start position:0%
spillsbury talked about and
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to just to get a handle in
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
you on your in your experiences and in
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
your practices
 
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
there's another group that you know made
 
00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:08.630 align:start position:0%
there's another group that you know made
really

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
um a significant profit out of the covet
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
you know whether they were
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
they changed a business model they were
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
putting up plexiglas or whatever that
 
00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
might be
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
but actually do have had a significant
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
profit and did take ppp
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
dollars do you have a sense and i'm just
 
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
trying to get a sense of
 
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
um percentages in your practices how
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
would those three groups
 
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
break down is the group that made a
 
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
significant profit
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
and impacted with the bpp
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
um attacks uh is that a large number or
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
just a sense i know you don't have an
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
exact number but where do you think
 
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
um yeah i guess it would be really hard
 
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
so i yeah i don't know
 
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i haven't done any sort of review
 
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
of that nature
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
are you impressed with a significant
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
number of uh businesses that have
 
00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
changed their model and have had a
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
significant um
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
increase in the profit margin of the
 
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
i can't say that i can again i haven't
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
looked at that particular
 
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
ratio to determine if profit margins are
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
up for
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
and and if and if so what what
 
00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
percentage of my clients that represents
 
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
okay i mean there's there there are some
 
00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.830 align:start position:0%
okay i mean there's there there are some
absolutely

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
representative romney thank you mr chair
 
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
um one thing that came up in our
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
hearings was
 
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
a discussion of the main street program
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
which took some of the 1.8 billion that
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
the state got
 
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
and used it for a similar state-driven
 
00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.230 align:start position:0%
and used it for a similar state-driven
program

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh i'm just curious and my our
 
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
understanding is that
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh there's uh this per
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
this is totally different and that
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
there'd be no forgiveness of
 
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
of uh of the revenue uh or the
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
the of the uh of the loan i don't even
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
know i think it was created as a loan
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
program i'm not even sure
 
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
but if any of your clients mention the
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
main street program to you
 
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
or whether they want to see
 
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
some kind of a similar thing done with
 
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
well i mean in terms of of businesses
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
that receive them
 
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sure any business owner would be
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
happy not to have to pay tax on them
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
um and you know in getting banks
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
to the kind of the original question
 
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
when this all started is
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
in terms of the extensions and things my
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
firm at least has
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
for for any client unless there's a
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
clear indication that they're going to
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
have to pay the main street relief funds
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
those funds were included in 2020
 
00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
even though it was presumed
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
even though there may be a small chance
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
they can't have to pay it back and so
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
that income is included in the 2020
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
estimates for the extensions
 
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
but i'm i can only imagine that
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
businesses would
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
be happy to see that the main street
 
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
funds are included with the non-taxation
 
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
of ppp funds if that happens
 
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:42.070 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
members

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
cpa organization
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
and it looks like they're taking a stand
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
of many cpa organizations that are
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
taking a stand
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
one way or the other relative to senate
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm not aware of
 
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware i i don't know no no
 
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
no do you have the do you have the
 
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
okay so there's specific firms not
 
00:22:09.669 --> 00:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily the cpa society
 
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right this one's amazing
 
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
rich professional association
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
and it just came in this morning i guess
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
this morning i i read it once and i oh
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
my god
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
and i'm gonna have to read that slowly
 
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
i was surprised i would have thought
 
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.510 align:start position:0%
i was surprised i would have thought
that

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:38.549 --> 00:22:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
but you know you don't know of many uh
 
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799 align:start position:0%
cpas that are
 
00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
out there but i don't i don't know how
 
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
many more of these letters we're going
 
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
to get from cpa
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
groups representative major
 
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
um i think robin abbott is on uh
 
00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:54.559 align:start position:0%
listening to this
 
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
and she may be able to give some light
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
if maceman rich has contacted the
 
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
society about
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
a position to my knowledge we haven't
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
heard from anyone
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
any individual society asking for
 
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
position we've heard from a lot of
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
individual society excuse me uh
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
individual firms
 
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
asking what the outcome is of senate
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
bill 3 and it's been more
 
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
for clarification how to treat um
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
treat the the grant or loan um
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
in in the tax returns but uh robin may
 
00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%
be able to say if
 
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559 align:start position:0%
others have contacted her out of
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
position but to my knowledge
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
um we've really been hearing mainly from
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
firms of
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
have you all made a decision okay
 
00:23:45.029 --> 00:23:45.039 align:start position:0%
i notice in the uh attendees
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
there's a nhs cpa is that a firm or an
 
00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:51.029 align:start position:0%
there's a nhs cpa is that a firm or an
organization

00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.039 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
that would be robin abbott the executive
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
director of the new hampshire society of
 
00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.269 align:start position:0%
director of the new hampshire society of
cpas

00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
cpas
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
would she be willing to join us
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh robin i am here can you hear me
 
00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
yes were you able to listen to the
 
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
discussion there i did
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
listen to the whole discussion and thank
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
you very much for having us on today
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
um i missed the last maybe 10 seconds of
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
your comments but i
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
theresa summed it up very nicely as well
 
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
as carl and
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
kevin so i really want to thank them for
 
00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
being present they are they are stellar
 
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
in what they do and which is why they
 
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
represent our tax committee
 
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
but to your point um i would say there
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
are no specific firms that have reached
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
out to us with the position
 
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
however many have shown quite
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
a great deal of interest on which they
 
00:24:48.549 --> 00:24:48.559 align:start position:0%
this was going so that they could advise
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
their clients
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
because their clients have been very
 
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
stressed about this situation in
 
00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.750 align:start position:0%
stressed about this situation in
particular

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
the one organization i would say that
 
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
does take a stand that you may know of
 
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
is a national organization called the
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
american institute
 
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
of certified public accountants that's
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
the aicpa
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
so many of you have probably heard of
 
00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
them before
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
they tend to take a more national
 
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
legislative stance
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes will trickle down their
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
guidance to us
 
00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
whether or not we use that is really up
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
to the society and and our board and our
 
00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:18.710 align:start position:0%
to the society and and our board and our
members

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
and and carl said it perfectly um as did
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
kevin as we are neutral on bills but
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
what we try to do is educate our members
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
and educate the legislators as far as
 
00:25:29.909 --> 00:25:29.919 align:start position:0%
you know what both sides are
 
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
or are doing so i hope that answers your
 
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.070 align:start position:0%
or are doing so i hope that answers your
question

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh yes it does thank you uh does the
 
00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:37.990 align:start position:0%
uh yes it does thank you uh does the
committee

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
have any further questions to ask of
 
00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
this distinguished
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
group of people representative major
 
00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
representative tudor here
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
did did i hear um you talk about a straw
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
poll in the beginning of this that i
 
00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
missed that or
 
00:25:53.909 --> 00:25:53.919 align:start position:0%
were you going to tell us about a straw
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
poll i'd be happy to tell you it was it
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
was really just kind of a soft pull to
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
some of my more active members as far as
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
what their sentiment was on sb3
 
00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
and many who have had interest in this
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
from the beginning
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
um and i would say you know carl summed
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
it up perfectly
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
most cpas are really
 
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
participating in extensions with their
 
00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
clients or
 
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
if they aren't they are paying a portion
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
of of what they expect as the ppp
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
with with a bit of um you know
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
uncomfortableness i i
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
would say what i hear mostly is that
 
00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
most of our members
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
and again we do not take a stand but
 
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
most of our members are in support of
 
00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
sb3 we're one of the only states that is
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
sort of taxing this money so
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
kind of has an icky feel to it when when
 
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
and i understand our tax structure is
 
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
very different from other states
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
around the country including in new
 
00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
england but what we've sort of heard is
 
00:26:47.679 --> 00:26:48.390 align:start position:0%
england but what we've sort of heard is
that

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
people are feeling sort of not so great
 
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
about being taxed on sort of this found
 
00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.430 align:start position:0%
about being taxed on sort of this found
money

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
um but again understanding our tax
 
00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.269 align:start position:0%
um but again understanding our tax
structure

00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
structure
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
is different um you know we're doing
 
00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
what we have to do but i will say this
 
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
and and to credit carl and kevin for
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
being here today
 
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
when there was that irx extension on the
 
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
17th and they had the deadline on the
 
00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.430 align:start position:0%
17th and they had the deadline on the
15th

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
15th
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
this has probably been one of the worst
 
00:27:13.919 --> 00:27:14.470 align:start position:0%
this has probably been one of the worst
years

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
by far for members that they have ever
 
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
experienced i mean i'm getting calls on
 
00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
a routine basis of
 
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
yep that's it i'm done i'm hanging up my
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
for sale sign
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
i'm good i'm not doing this anymore it's
 
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
been really challenging
 
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
so if there's any way that you can make
 
00:27:30.789 --> 00:27:30.799 align:start position:0%
the practitioners and their
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
clients lives a little bit clearer a
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
little easier
 
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
that would go a long way right and clear
 
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
and easier doesn't mean you're taking a
 
00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.070 align:start position:0%
and easier doesn't mean you're taking a
stand

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
stand
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
all right any uh further questions
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
saying thank you very much for appearing
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%

00:28:28.840 --> 00:29:38.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:38.840 --> 00:30:07.830 align:start position:0%

00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:31.269 --> 00:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
do you need help figuring out the
 
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%

and but having chris do
 
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
we have on our revenues
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
we have four revenues that uh
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
going to dhhs l chip
 
00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519 align:start position:0%
affordable housing and likewise
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
and chris is going to talk about these
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
you get committee members especially
 
00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
those that have
 
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
come on in the last few years uh
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
a history of how this happened and
 
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
so you're all set chris all right thank
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
you for major
 
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
um so the reason that i'm here today to
 
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
talk about this if if some of you were
 
00:33:32.549 --> 00:33:32.559 align:start position:0%
on the call i think
 
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
two meetings ago and i brought up the
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
liquor commission there was a
 
00:33:40.149 --> 00:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
potential for a transfer of liquor funds
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
over to
 
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire granite advantage
 
00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.909 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire granite advantage
program

00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
um and and we didn't know the amount we
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
still don't know the amount
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
and then the members of the committee
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
were asking you know what other programs
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
do we see money come in on a cash basis
 
00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
that then is moved to uh
 
00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
a restricted or a certain purpose
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
instead of going into the unrestricted
 
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
general fund and i named four that you
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
know in addition to that i named three
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
others that i was aware of
 
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
um as a follow-up repsome spillsbury
 
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
reached out to me to get a little bit
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
more information
 
00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
um you know kind of why this occurred
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
and some of the history and i had done
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
some work for him which he then asked
 
00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919 align:start position:0%
represent major just suggesting maybe i
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
should talk to the committee
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
in total and kind of go over some of
 
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
these funds and how they occurred and
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
and where we are today with them so that
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm going to do at a kind of
 
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
a high level i'm going to share my
 
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:33.589 align:start position:0%
a high level i'm going to share my
screen

00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
screen
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
and it's just going to be it's a
 
00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
narrative of the different programs
 
00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
basically law or chapter law but i'll
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
talk through kind of how we got to that
 
00:34:41.839 --> 00:34:45.829 align:start position:0%
talk through kind of how we got to that
point

00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
oh well i can't share my screen
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
it's disabled right now but that's i'm
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
johnny janine i just changed those
 
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
settings chris sorry about that
 
00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
so you should see uh l chip and some
 
00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
yellow highlights so
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
so the lchip program is the landing
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
community heritage investment program
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
program that matches local or non-profit
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
funds to conserve property buildings
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
throughout the state it's a competitive
 
00:35:27.839 --> 00:35:29.430 align:start position:0%
throughout the state it's a competitive
program

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
it's something that you know started
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
back in the early 2000s and
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
for from 2002 to 2008
 
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature would put appropriations
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
in the budget to fund
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
l-chip and what would typically occur is
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
there'd be an appropriation for a
 
00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:47.670 align:start position:0%
there'd be an appropriation for a
certain

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
certain
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
amount through the budget process it
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
would be reduced or removed in
 
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
total so the program didn't have the
 
00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:55.190 align:start position:0%
total so the program didn't have the
seed

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
seed
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
money to do what it was charged to do
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes there was other efforts to add
 
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
money in separate bills and those
 
00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.390 align:start position:0%
money in separate bills and those
wouldn't

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
survive so there was lots of discussion
 
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
in the legislative body and
 
00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
and interested groups to try to come up
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
with a dedicated
 
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism for the l-chip program
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
and what was decided is that a surcharge
 
00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:18.950 align:start position:0%
and what was decided is that a surcharge
on

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
certain um documents that the
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
register of deed register of deeds
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
processes and
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
in this sheet before you can see
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
roman 2 the highlighted part an
 
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
additional charge of 25
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
shall be assessed so that was the amount
 
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
that was agreed up to
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
um in 2008 session
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
to fund the l-chip program and then what
 
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
occurred with that is they basically
 
00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.030 align:start position:0%
occurred with that is they basically
said

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
register of deed you shall collect this
 
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
and remit it back to the state of new
 
00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.030 align:start position:0%
and remit it back to the state of new
hampshire

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
basically using the same mechanism that
 
00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
the rep money comes to the state of new
 
00:36:55.119 --> 00:36:56.150 align:start position:0%
the rep money comes to the state of new
hampshire

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
and it would go to the dra who would
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
then peel off or
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
or account for the rep the surcharge
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
related to the l-chip program
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
and then that would be used to pay the
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
lchip program
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
through treasury if you were to look at
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
the operating budget you will find
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
in the treasury's operating budget
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
there's a an accounting unit that is for
 
00:37:18.079 --> 00:37:19.510 align:start position:0%
there's a an accounting unit that is for
lchip

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
lchip
 
00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
so the treasury actually cuts a check to
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
l-chip at the
 
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
start of each fiscal year
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
there's an estimated budget on what they
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
think they might gain in revenue
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
and if they don't gain that then they
 
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
don't get all the the appropriation
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
if they get more than what they've
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
estimated they're able to come through
 
00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:37.990 align:start position:0%
estimated they're able to come through
fiscal

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
through treasury to accept the
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
additional revenue which they've done
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
so so it is money that comes in and
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
on a monthly basis there's an adjustment
 
00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:49.990 align:start position:0%
on a monthly basis there's an adjustment
made

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
to remove it from the the cash
 
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
and put it where it belongs with
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
treasury to go to l-chip
 
00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
right now they're estimating about five
 
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year that that is
 
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
removed as a result of the surcharge so
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
it's not the ret
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
tax that that is doing this it's it's a
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
separate surcharge
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
um but it just comes in in the door kind
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
of on the back of the ret tax as it's
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
because back when they put this together
 
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of discussion about
 
00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
creating more work at the local level
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of collecting and remitting um
 
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
revenue back to the state so that's the
 
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
l chip i mean if anybody has any
 
00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.670 align:start position:0%
l chip i mean if anybody has any
questions

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
um any questions i see representative
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
yes thanks chris um so when we do our
 
00:38:35.359 --> 00:38:35.829 align:start position:0%
yes thanks chris um so when we do our
revenue

00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
estimates we're not including that 25
 
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
no no um usually that's kind of it's
 
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
backed out so that
 
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
when you get to the end of the year you
 
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
know there's
 
00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the every month that's backed
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
out of the the uh
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
cash number right so at the end of the
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
year there's an adjustment made
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
you've heard about all these adjustments
 
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
that occur at the end of the year
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
so when you get your total at the end
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
you know that the
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
five million you know it's been three to
 
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
five million a year
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
um is not included in your base number
 
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
okay so and i guess one other oh sorry
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:12.079 align:start position:0%
okay i'm just wondering does that get
 
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
budgeted somewhere that five million or
 
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
is that just
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
money that comes into that fund so
 
00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:18.079 align:start position:0%
that's budgeted in the treasury's
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh operating budget i get it okay so
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
it's been in there for for a number of
 
00:39:22.079 --> 00:39:22.870 align:start position:0%
it's been in there for for a number of
years

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
um and it continues to be there
 
00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:27.839 align:start position:0%
for i think for a number of reasons i
 
00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
think one of them is so that um
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
people who are interested in what's
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
going on with the lg program can
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
actually see there's an appropriation
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
that goes to that
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
to that program um one thing that did
 
00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:39.030 align:start position:0%
to that program um one thing that did
occur

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
occur
 
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
when when they this surcharge was put in
 
00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:42.550 align:start position:0%
when when they this surcharge was put in
place

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
the first few um budget cycles
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
the l-chip program still didn't get 100
 
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
of the revenue generated the legislature
 
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
would put language in
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
um house bill 2 or or a version of the
 
00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:55.430 align:start position:0%
um house bill 2 or or a version of the
op

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
op
 
00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
of the trailer bill to redirect um
 
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
some of that revenue back to the general
 
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
fund these were years when
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
we were going through the great
 
00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
recession or coming out of the great
 
00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.390 align:start position:0%
recession or coming out of the great
recession

00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
recession
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
um so you may have heard of you know if
 
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
you've been around at all you've heard
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
the term uh rating dedicated funds you
 
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
know rate on the fund
 
00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
and and so that was was occurring and
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
there was efforts by
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
the supporters of the lchip program and
 
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
other dedicated funds to
 
00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
um ask the legislature to stop doing
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
that so that
 
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
since about 2017 i think
 
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
there's been no adjustment that
 
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
everything has gone to the lchip program
 
00:40:36.069 --> 00:40:36.079 align:start position:0%
and when we get the periodic reports
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
from the department
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
of bigger services it'll tell us like
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
a recent one says um l chip
 
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
approximately five hundred thousand
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
dollars which would be
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
which will come out of re tt on the 16th
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
of the month
 
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
yep once yeah so
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
so there's an accounting for it but
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
depending on when you're looking at a
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
report it still may be in the cache
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
so that so it gets a little confusing
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
but it is adjusted out
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
and again when you're doing your
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
estimates in the committee
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
so the next is the uh the school
 
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
building aid debt service
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
that comes out of the meals and rooms
 
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
tax so again similar to
 
00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
tourette there's a note typically on
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
some of the um reports that you get that
 
00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:24.710 align:start position:0%
some of the um reports that you get that
says

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh by the certain day of the month the
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
the amount going to the building a debt
 
00:41:30.309 --> 00:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
service will be
 
00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
um will be removed from from the the
 
00:41:33.359 --> 00:41:34.710 align:start position:0%
um will be removed from from the the
numbers

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
so what occurred here is back in 2008
 
00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:38.309 align:start position:0%
so what occurred here is back in 2008
2000

00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
2000
 
00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
well 2009 10 and 11 so so those
 
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal years but starting in 2008
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
session year
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
there was concerns on with the recession
 
00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
just getting
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
started a concern on meeting the promise
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
to the communities that had borrowed
 
00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
money to build school buildings and the
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
state's school building aid
 
00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
program where they match a percentage i
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
think it's up to like 20
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
of of the cost of the debt service for
 
00:42:08.079 --> 00:42:08.470 align:start position:0%
of of the cost of the debt service for
these

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:42:12.069 --> 00:42:12.079 align:start position:0%
buildings at that time um you know
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
building aid it was a significant amount
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
of the budget it was about 40 million
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
and decisions had to be made on how do
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
we fund some of these things we don't
 
00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:24.079 align:start position:0%
have the revenue to support it
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
so back in 2009 during um this was
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
what i'm showing you is the language
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
that's contained in chapter 144 laws of
 
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
2009 that was house bill 2 at the time
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to see that a number of
 
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
things occurred with the meals and rooms
 
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
tax at that time
 
00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
it went from eight percent to nine
 
00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to see there was a section
 
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
put in that said
 
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
you're going to take the amount
 
00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.069 align:start position:0%
you're going to take the amount
necessary

00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
so the yellow bold here to pay the
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
interest on the
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
bonds and notes that were authorized in
 
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
the 198 colon 15a relates to the school
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
building aid
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
debt as well as the amount of 3.15
 
00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:04.470 align:start position:0%
debt as well as the amount of 3.15
percent

00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
that would go to the former dread travel
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
and tourism
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
um that number came up earlier this uh
 
00:43:12.069 --> 00:43:12.079 align:start position:0%
with this committee
 
00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
about a month ago six weeks ago there
 
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
was some question about this number
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
being suspended in the budget
 
00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
and that is correct so instead of
 
00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
the budget reflecting 3.15 percent of
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
the meals and rooms collected it's
 
00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
something slightly
 
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
less than that there's still over 17
 
00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
million dollars over the biennium going
 
00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839 align:start position:0%
to travel and tourism but
 
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
the governor and the house proposal is
 
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
slightly different than what 3.15 would
 
00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:39.670 align:start position:0%
slightly different than what 3.15 would
equal

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
and as i said the the school building
 
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
aid during that period
 
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
in 2009 it was going to be a 40 million
 
00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:48.069 align:start position:0%
in 2009 it was going to be a 40 million
appropriation

00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:48.079 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
and then in 10 and 11 it was just under
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
45 million and then 46.2 million
 
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
so you're paying on this debt service
 
00:43:59.190 --> 00:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
out to 2030.
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
so until that point unless something
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
changes you'll see
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
an amount um taken off every month
 
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
to pay this uh bond debt service related
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
to the bonds for school building aid
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
the amount is the amount is going down
 
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
now so the the high point or the most
 
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
that was ever paid in a particular year
 
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
was about 14 million
 
00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
it's down to about 8 million now a year
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
and it'll continue to trickle down as we
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
again it was it was a decision made at a
 
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
time when revenues were
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
lower than anticipated um there was no
 
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
projection to go forward but the state
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to to continue to meet that
 
00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
obligation or promise it had made to the
 
00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:40.230 align:start position:0%
obligation or promise it had made to the
schools

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
and the communities related to the
 
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
so that's all i really had to say on
 
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
that and i can move to the next thing
 
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
unless there's a question
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem to be any questions go
 
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
ahead all right
 
00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:56.750 align:start position:0%
i just raised my hand norm
 
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:58.150 align:start position:0%
i just raised my hand norm
[Music]

00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
i just happened to notice on the in the
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
first page of that last
 
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
two slides that campsites were to be
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
taxed and that that didn't last very
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
long now did it
 
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
no no that's why i didn't bring it up
 
00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
i couldn't resist um i know that was
 
00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:14.710 align:start position:0%
i couldn't resist um i know that was
ripped

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
ripped
 
00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
very quickly and and i guess i should
 
00:45:18.069 --> 00:45:18.079 align:start position:0%
say the
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
part of the reason i show you that that
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
there was an increase in the meals in
 
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
rooms tax rate
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
that was part of the debate for
 
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
justifying that it was okay
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
to at least for the the uh biennium they
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
were budgeting for the 10 and 11
 
00:45:30.079 --> 00:45:31.430 align:start position:0%
were budgeting for the 10 and 11
biennium

00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
that increase would have allowed for
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
enough money to cover the debt service
 
00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
associated with the school bonding aid
 
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
skill school building aid bonding debt
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
service so
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
um that that was the reason i showed it
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
there it wasn't to create any other
 
00:45:45.359 --> 00:45:50.630 align:start position:0%
there it wasn't to create any other
discussion

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
the next and the more recent um
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
one that is that you guys are hearing
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
about is the liquor fund transfer
 
00:45:58.829 --> 00:45:58.839 align:start position:0%
related to the new hampshire granite
 
00:45:58.839 --> 00:46:00.390 align:start position:0%
related to the new hampshire granite
advantage

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
so as many um as many people know back
 
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
in 2014
 
00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
there was changes to to medicaid and
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
health insurance through
 
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
through uh um
 
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
that basically president obama's changed
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
to health care
 
00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
and one of the changes was to allow for
 
00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
and there was a lot of discussion a lot
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
of concern in the state
 
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
as in many states about this expansion
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
and the costs associated with it when it
 
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
was first
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
proposed the federal government was
 
00:46:47.109 --> 00:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
paying 100 percent of that expanded
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
expansion cost or the medicaid
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
cost associated with that and then over
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
the years it was going to come down
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
from 100 percent to where we are today
 
00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
at 90 percent
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
um so there was concerns that and it was
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
um kind of likened to the idea of uh uh
 
00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:07.839 align:start position:0%
special ed funding that the feds had
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
always promised that would be provided
 
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
to states and
 
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
and there was feelings that they've
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
never fully
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
lived up to that promise that they would
 
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
do the same thing with the
 
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
federal dollars associated with the
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
medicaid expansion
 
00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
so the legislature passed bills to
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
get it started and then again in 2018
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
because of some changes with the funding
 
00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:32.950 align:start position:0%
because of some changes with the funding
mix

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
mix
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
re-authorize it as the new hampshire
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
granite advantage health care
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
program and then created a trust fund
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
and one of the things in the trust fund
 
00:47:43.109 --> 00:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
that was negotiated at a time and has
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
been a focus is that
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
no state general fund shall be deposited
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
into the fund
 
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
so the medicaid expansion program
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
should continue forward without any
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
general funds that was very important
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
and something that's remained in statute
 
00:47:59.190 --> 00:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
since then
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
but as we've gotten um increased in the
 
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
numbers of people participating in the
 
00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.230 align:start position:0%
numbers of people participating in the
program

00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
along with the um funding
 
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
mix being more the state providing a
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
greater share
 
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
there was some concerns that
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
there's not enough money coming in
 
00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
through the health insurance premium
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
or any other way that is covering the
 
00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:21.190 align:start position:0%
or any other way that is covering the
full

00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
full
 
00:48:24.069 --> 00:48:24.079 align:start position:0%
cost between the 90 percent the federal
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
government pays for in the 10 percent
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
so in the in the law there's there's a
 
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
section it's a roman
 
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
six and you're going to see the
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
highlighted piece if you were to remove
 
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
the highlighted piece that was that's
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
what was there
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
up until 2019. so basically read the
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
commission accordance with the most
 
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
current available information
 
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
shall be responsible for determining
 
00:48:49.109 --> 00:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
quarterly commencing no later than
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
december 31 2018
 
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
whether there is sufficient funding in
 
00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
the fund to cover projected program
 
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
costs for the non-federal share
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
for the next six month period if at any
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
time the commissioner
 
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
determines that a pr projected shortfall
 
00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.349 align:start position:0%
determines that a pr projected shortfall
exists

00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
exists
 
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
he or she will terminate the program in
 
00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
accordance with the federally approved
 
00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:07.510 align:start position:0%
accordance with the federally approved
terms

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
terms
 
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
and conditions issued by cmc
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
so prior to the liquor commission aspect
 
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
being added that was the concern
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
and if that language wasn't in there
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
earlier this year
 
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
health and human services would have had
 
00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
to abide if
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
there had been no change would have had
 
00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:26.559 align:start position:0%
to abide by this language and start to
 
00:49:26.559 --> 00:49:27.670 align:start position:0%
to abide by this language and start to
terminate

00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
terminate
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
or close down the the medicaid expanded
 
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
program because of a
 
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
lack of funding so one way to
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
address this was to use the liquor
 
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
commission fund
 
00:49:44.069 --> 00:49:44.079 align:start position:0%
and the suggestion is it's not
 
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
at this point it's not general funds so
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
you've you've still abided by the
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
no use of general funds but because of
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
the uncertainty and knowing
 
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
what kind of shortfall you're going to
 
00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079 align:start position:0%
have in the out years
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
they've allowed for an open
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
appropriation and for the amount
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
necessary to be transferred from the
 
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
liquor commission fund
 
00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
and then there's a statement that um you
 
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
know if there's then if there's no
 
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
if there's insufficient funds from the
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
liquor fund
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
then they shall at that point start the
 
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
process to close or
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
re um eliminate the program
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
so that's that's how that occurred and
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
that's the reason it's occurred is that
 
00:50:22.319 --> 00:50:22.790 align:start position:0%
that's the reason it's occurred is that
the

00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature a couple years ago was
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
a a mechanism that could fund the
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
program if there was a shortfall
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
and then the last one and probably the
 
00:50:38.549 --> 00:50:38.559 align:start position:0%
most recent one
 
00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
that you've seen is the affordable
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
housing affordable housing is not a new
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
issue in the state of new hampshire it's
 
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
been discussed uh
 
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
you know for over 10 years now in
 
00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
various venues
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
if you were to do a simple search in in
 
00:50:51.119 --> 00:50:52.309 align:start position:0%
if you were to do a simple search in in
the

00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
bill search function in on the website
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
um you're going to see bills going back
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
you know it's like i said 10 years or
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
more for study committees
 
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
commissions bills that would have
 
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.190 align:start position:0%
commissions bills that would have
provided

00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
provided
 
00:51:07.589 --> 00:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
capital appropriations to do affordable
 
00:51:07.599 --> 00:51:08.470 align:start position:0%
capital appropriations to do affordable
housing

00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
housing
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
incentives for your municipalities and
 
00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:11.589 align:start position:0%
incentives for your municipalities and
and

00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
local governments to set up affordable
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
housing funds
 
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
and in the last few years you've heard a
 
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion about workforce and
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
the inability
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
for the workforce to find housing which
 
00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:26.549 align:start position:0%
for the workforce to find housing which
is

00:51:26.549 --> 00:51:26.559 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
creating some challenges for businesses
 
00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
that want to grow or expand or move into
 
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
the area
 
00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
so this last budget session it was felt
 
00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:35.030 align:start position:0%
so this last budget session it was felt
that

00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
you know this is probably the right time
 
00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:38.309 align:start position:0%
you know this is probably the right time
to

00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
dedicate or restrict five million
 
00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
dollars a year that comes in through the
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
transfer tax to to go into
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
the affordable housing fund and and then
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
the housing finance authority is
 
00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
responsible for that fund
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
and they would um be the group um making
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
it available to the communities and the
 
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
places and businesses that that would be
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
eligible for it
 
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
so you saw that hit the first time back
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
in september
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
of this f20 september 20
 
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
and uh it caused a lot of questions at
 
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
that time because as you saw a reduction
 
00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:17.510 align:start position:0%
that time because as you saw a reduction
of

00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
a comment about a reduction of 5 million
 
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
dollars for the the
 
00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
housing finance authority for the
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
affordable housing
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
in the revenue focus that came out after
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
that month
 
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
so i think you know the reason i'm i'm
 
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
talking about this is just to provide
 
00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
you a little bit of a
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
history that on why some of these
 
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
actions occurred it's
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
many times it's not as a result of oh
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
today i think it's a good idea that i
 
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
take money and restrict it from this
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
fund for a purpose that
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
is fairly newly discussed you most of
 
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
these have
 
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
had discussions for a number of
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
legislative sessions
 
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
and there's been a number of different
 
00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
um efforts to find a way to
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
have a steady revenue stream for them
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
so so those are the four that you know
 
00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
stuck out and that we
 
00:53:07.109 --> 00:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
you know i kind of talked about at a
 
00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
high level the other day
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
and this is just a little bit lower but
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
still at a high level
 
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
so that's all i have well thank you
 
00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:16.390 align:start position:0%
so that's all i have well thank you
chris

00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
chris
 
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
and with this mechanism if you continue
 
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh dedicating
 
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:31.109 --> 00:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
items then there'd be a lot less general
 
00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
funds that can be utilized to support
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
the rest of the
 
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
budget and it's a kind of short search
 
00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
short circuits the regular budget
 
00:53:42.319 --> 00:53:43.990 align:start position:0%
short circuits the regular budget
process

00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
i i think reps of almighty jumped off
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
the call for she had a conflict with
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
another meeting but if i think she was
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
on the call
 
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
she would probably um i'm going to
 
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
suggest that she would make a comment
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
about the whole dedicated fund
 
00:53:59.109 --> 00:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
process where that you know that's
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
in some ways this is a is like that you
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
know it's it's restricting a certain
 
00:54:03.119 --> 00:54:04.710 align:start position:0%
know it's it's restricting a certain
revenue

00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
or a piece of a certain revenue for a
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
purpose the dedicated funds
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
are truly that where the revenue doesn't
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
come into the
 
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
um the collections of the general fund
 
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
or the highway fund or
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
that we see on in the revenue focus but
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
they're they go directly to those funds
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
the four that i just shared with you are
 
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
slightly different in that they do kind
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
of pass through the
 
00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
the collection of the revenue that that
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
you see in the revenue focus but and
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
then they're deposited to a
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
this particular place representative has
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
his hand up reps of major
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
yeah i just want to ask chris if you can
 
00:54:40.789 --> 00:54:40.799 align:start position:0%
send us this uh
 
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
slide pack yep yep i'll do that
 
00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you very much chris
 
00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
you all appreciate it
 
00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:53.839 align:start position:0%
you're welcome and uh
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
i've asked the dre to be present
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:09.359 --> 00:55:13.270 align:start position:0%
 
on

00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
the revenues
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
lost due to senate bill 3 and they
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
emailed you the latest estimate but
 
00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:32.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:32.839 --> 00:55:38.150 align:start position:0%
 
melissa

00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:40.559 align:start position:0%
mr chair uh representative gomarlo cut
 
00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
out so i've just promoted
 
00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
carolyn melissa and devin oh thank you
 
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
good morning representatives good
 
00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:53.109 align:start position:0%
good morning representatives good
morning

00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
so carolyn could you give us an update
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
of where you are
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
on uh senate bill three
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
and its effect on revenues yeah so
 
00:56:06.549 --> 00:56:06.559 align:start position:0%
um what you saw this morning was our
 
00:56:06.559 --> 00:56:07.589 align:start position:0%
um what you saw this morning was our
analysis

00:56:07.589 --> 00:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact assuming that all
 
00:56:17.829 --> 00:56:17.839 align:start position:0%
ppp loans were issued
 
00:56:20.549 --> 00:56:20.559 align:start position:0%
by the end of the month um that is a
 
00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact of just under 100 million
 
00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:23.910 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact of just under 100 million
dollars

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
and i saw a news article come across my
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
screen this morning that i didn't have
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to open up that said
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
that as of today they have exhausted the
 
00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
full appropriation
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
for ppp so i think that is a good final
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
um impact for you folks to use
 
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
i saw the same thing this morning
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
um right now uh you know where
 
00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
where do we go from here i think the
 
00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:52.470 align:start position:0%
where do we go from here i think the
department

00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
is trying to look at some possible
 
00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:56.150 align:start position:0%
is trying to look at some possible
methodologies

00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
methodologies
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
for helping you understand the
 
00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal year impact of
 
00:57:05.829 --> 00:57:05.839 align:start position:0%
our analysis you know we we've presented
 
00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
it as a total but not
 
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
broken it up by fiscal year
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
but certainly we would expect it to
 
00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
happen across
 
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
many fiscal years um representative ames
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
had forwarded the california analysis
 
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
and we're actually trying to do some
 
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
digging to see if we can speak with
 
00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:25.430 align:start position:0%
digging to see if we can speak with
someone

00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
someone
 
00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
from california to see how they broke
 
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
their analysis up by fiscal year
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
for pp um
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
for their ppp bill yeah
 
00:57:43.589 --> 00:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
and the california on their analysis
 
00:57:43.599 --> 00:57:45.750 align:start position:0%
and the california on their analysis
they

00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
they said it's gonna cost them six point
 
00:57:53.109 --> 00:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
two billion dollars uh by forgiving the
 
00:57:53.119 --> 00:57:54.230 align:start position:0%
two billion dollars uh by forgiving the
loan

00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
loan
 
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
but i have no idea what their total
 
00:58:02.069 --> 00:58:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
corporate taxes agreed and i also noted
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
when i
 
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
pulled up that bill it was a bit more
 
00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:10.799 align:start position:0%
comprehensive than ours
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
it also included the impact
 
00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
for certain federal treatment of
 
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
eidl loans which is not contained
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
without within our sb3
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
so we'll have to carefully sort of uh
 
00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
evaluate whether
 
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
the california methodology works for our
 
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
bill um but we are looking into that
 
00:58:41.349 --> 00:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
yeah uh that's great i'm glad you're
 
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
looking at that um
 
00:58:47.349 --> 00:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
the other another difference for
 
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
california is that they've
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
excluded publicly traded
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
companies and i don't know what that
 
00:58:58.309 --> 00:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
the dimensions of that would be but i
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
don't think we could do that in new
 
00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:00.069 align:start position:0%
don't think we could do that in new
hampshire

00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
even if we wanted to um and then there's
 
00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
a 25
 
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
000 rule that they've got in there
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
so firms that have
 
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
who's i can't remember how it works but
 
00:59:13.829 --> 00:59:13.839 align:start position:0%
there's a 25
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
000 um bar
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
maybe you can explain it i can't quite
 
00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
put it together i think it's the 25
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
decline 2020 over 19.
 
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
and i think the only other thing that i
 
00:59:38.309 --> 00:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
would add is i think
 
00:59:41.349 --> 00:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
the testimony that you heard
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
from the cpas today was very helpful
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
um i think that we often don't have the
 
00:59:50.789 --> 00:59:50.799 align:start position:0%
you know the very granular taxpayer
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
perspective on these things because
 
00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
we're not return preparers
 
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
um so i think it's definitely helpful to
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
understand what they're seeing
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
in the field to know that really there's
 
01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
a spectrum
 
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
of treatments that taxpayers have
 
01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:06.150 align:start position:0%
of treatments that taxpayers have
adopted

01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
and certainly we are seeing
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
currently and melissa can jump in with
 
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
the stats if she wants to
 
01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
but we are seeing very high levels of
 
01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
um extensions this year and
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
i think that means that we're going to
 
01:00:22.079 --> 01:00:23.990 align:start position:0%
i think that means that we're going to
have

01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
really limited information about what
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers have done on their 2020
 
01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:32.799 align:start position:0%
returns until such time as those
 
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
extended returns are in fact
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
filed what we have now for data is just
 
01:00:41.829 --> 01:00:41.839 align:start position:0%
so limited that it's not particularly
 
01:00:41.839 --> 01:00:43.670 align:start position:0%
so limited that it's not particularly
useful

01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
useful
 
01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
go ahead yeah um
 
01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
yeah so the extensions are um
 
01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong but the amount
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
of money
 
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
um paid with uh for extensions
 
01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
is is unprecedented in size
 
01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
and um and yet it's a black hole for you
 
01:01:09.829 --> 01:01:09.839 align:start position:0%
you don't
 
01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
all you have is a number is that correct
 
01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
that's exactly right melissa do you have
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
the exact stats
 
01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
sure melissa allen senior financial
 
01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
analyst for the department
 
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah everything you're saying
 
01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
representative ames is completely
 
01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
accurate so extensions this month
 
01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
were 131.5 million that is we have a
 
01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:32.799 align:start position:0%
10-year trend on the
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
estimate analysis and voucher analysis
 
01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
that we send out to you and that is by
 
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
far the highest we have
 
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
ever seen it's 195 percent above fiscal
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
year 20
 
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
however i caution you to compare it to
 
01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 because we do know that
 
01:01:49.349 --> 01:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
the federal due date
 
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
and state new hampshire due date in
 
01:01:54.309 --> 01:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 was extended to june
 
01:01:55.829 --> 01:01:55.839 align:start position:0%
um for new hampshire and july for
 
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
federal but if you do
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
compare that to fiscal year 19 it's
 
01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
about 50
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
or 51 million above or 63
 
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
above 2019 so a very significant
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
um increase in dollars
 
01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chairman um
 
01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:25.839 align:start position:0%
i i thought that the the question that
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
uh representative ames asked
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
yesterday during our discussion about
 
01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:31.349 align:start position:0%
yesterday during our discussion about
timing

01:02:31.349 --> 01:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
timing
 
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
um it posed potential conundrums that we
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
hadn't thought about and i certainly
 
01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't in a position to uh uh to clarify
 
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
so both of the accountants who
 
01:02:48.309 --> 01:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
spoke to us this morning uh alluded to
 
01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
that same concern
 
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh when they were talking about the
 
01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
relative merits
 
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
of amending
 
01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
sb3 versus just not passing it
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
and it it seemed to me when they were
 
01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:09.039 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
that uh the discrepancies in timing
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
actually highlight
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
a fundamental flaw in
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
the intent of sb3 and that is
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
if it's already true
 
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
that qualifying for loan forgiveness
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
requires deploying
 
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
the funds for qualified expenses they've
 
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
already been offset
 
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh what we're doing here if we also
 
01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:40.150 align:start position:0%
uh what we're doing here if we also
allow

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
allow
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
the deductions to be taken is we're
 
01:03:42.839 --> 01:03:44.630 align:start position:0%
the deductions to be taken is we're
de-linking

01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
de-linking
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh the expenses from the source of funds
 
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
and this de-linking this this allowing
 
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
expenses that were already used that
 
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
were already paid for with one set of
 
01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:56.630 align:start position:0%
were already paid for with one set of
funds

01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
to be deducted against another set of
 
01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.309 align:start position:0%
to be deducted against another set of
revenue

01:04:00.309 --> 01:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:14.789 --> 01:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
was there i yeah i agree and um i was
 
01:04:14.799 --> 01:04:15.430 align:start position:0%
was there i yeah i agree and um i was
there

01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
a question or were you just asking if i
 
01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
agreed with that
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
i suppose i'm asking if you agree but i
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
i i guess the point is that if the
 
01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:27.750 align:start position:0%
i i guess the point is that if the
amendment

01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:30.799 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the amendment to sp3 is
 
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
in effect to neutralize the impact of
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
sb3 is it probably
 
01:04:38.829 --> 01:04:38.839 align:start position:0%
not correct that the accountant's
 
01:04:38.839 --> 01:04:40.230 align:start position:0%
not correct that the accountant's
observation

01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
observation
 
01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
is it might be better to just not pass
 
01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:43.270 align:start position:0%
is it might be better to just not pass
sb3

01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
sb3
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
because that would be the less
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
complicated route
 
01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:52.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
that it would certainly
 
01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
be a complication to taxpayers relative
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
to the timing of the disallowed expenses
 
01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
um and i think that exists
 
01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:08.799 align:start position:0%
potentially as well with
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
sb3 as proposed in both scenarios i
 
01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:13.270 align:start position:0%
sb3 as proposed in both scenarios i
think

01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:05:15.270 --> 01:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
what you're looking at is the
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
possibility of
 
01:05:22.069 --> 01:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
a large number of amended 2020 returns
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
regardless of what form senate bill 3
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
ultimately takes but as
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
you can certainly imagine
 
01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:34.640 align:start position:0%
an amended return that results in a
 
01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:35.510 align:start position:0%
an amended return that results in a
reduced

01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
01:05:38.789 --> 01:05:38.799 align:start position:0%
tax liability feels a bit different to a
 
01:05:38.799 --> 01:05:40.150 align:start position:0%
tax liability feels a bit different to a
taxpayer

01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayer
 
01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
than an amended return that results in
 
01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
an increased
 
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
liability so i think
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
for planning purposes one is probably
 
01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
more palatable to a taxpayer than the
 
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.390 align:start position:0%
more palatable to a taxpayer than the
other

01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you good observation
 
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
rep senator browning that leads us to
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
the question of
 
01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:07.839 align:start position:0%
the same conversation here of uh whether
 
01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
we amend or
 
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh if we amend
 
01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
is it is it the same as
 
01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
just killing the bill in terms of
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
so if you amend
 
01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
the the bill concurrent with
 
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury's draft
 
01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:34.470 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury's draft
amendment

01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
i think what you would see is a very
 
01:06:36.799 --> 01:06:37.670 align:start position:0%
i think what you would see is a very
drastic

01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
drastic
 
01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
reduction in the fiscal impact
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
but there would be
 
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
still a small fiscal impact i believe
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
that the requirement to qualify for
 
01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
forgiveness was not that 100 percent
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
be spent on qualified expenses i believe
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
80 be spent on qualified expenses
 
01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
and so there would still be potentially
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
a 20
 
01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
or less um amount
 
01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
of what we've currently calculated that
 
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
would be a fiscal
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
impact but it would certainly be
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
so what i to take away from what they
 
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
were saying uh that the accountants
 
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
related to bet
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
with the amendment or or killing the
 
01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:38.549 align:start position:0%
with the amendment or or killing the
bill

01:07:38.549 --> 01:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
or amending it there may be some
 
01:07:43.589 --> 01:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
interaction with the bet that may be a
 
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
little different is
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
what i kind of took away from what they
 
01:07:49.589 --> 01:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i think the direct bet impact
 
01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
is the same um regardless of
 
01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
how sp3 makes it out
 
01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
of committee if it does um the bet
 
01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
direct impact is um
 
01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
is the same i believe what carl and
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
kevin were saying
 
01:08:15.029 --> 01:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
was that for many taxpayers
 
01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
they have so much bet credit that
 
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
sb3 doesn't really impact their ultimate
 
01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
tax liability um
 
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
and that is actually baked into our
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
our analysis that you have currently we
 
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
we account for those
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that will not have a bet
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
or will not have a bpt liability due to
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
their bet credit
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
um regardless of what we do
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
questions can i uh
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
norm can i know in other hands can i
 
01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
interject one other thing
 
01:09:01.829 --> 01:09:01.839 align:start position:0%
uh yes so may 11th is coming upon us
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
the six days away uh a general question
 
01:09:05.759 --> 01:09:06.229 align:start position:0%
the six days away uh a general question
anybody

01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
has anybody heard including dra of
 
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
of the treasury federal treasury coming
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
up with guidance on the 1.9 trillion
 
01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.070 align:start position:0%
up with guidance on the 1.9 trillion
dollars

01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
that does have a bearing on our
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
discussions i think
 
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
and i i i haven't heard any anything uh
 
01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
has anybody heard anything
 
01:09:25.349 --> 01:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
i've been looking i haven't seen
 
01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
anything right we're all waiting for the
 
01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:27.669 align:start position:0%
anything right we're all waiting for the
guidance

01:09:27.669 --> 01:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
01:09:30.789 --> 01:09:30.799 align:start position:0%
and it's six days away we're not going
 
01:09:30.799 --> 01:09:31.110 align:start position:0%
and it's six days away we're not going
to

01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
exact senate bill three on the 11th if
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
more information such as this guidance
 
01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:39.910 align:start position:0%
more information such as this guidance
right

01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
i'm just just reminding everybody that
 
01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
that's still hanging out there
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
any um questions asked of the dra
 
01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
if not i want to remind the committee
 
01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:54.950 align:start position:0%
if not i want to remind the committee
that

01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
before we get to house bill 565
 
01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
next week we're going to have an exec
 
01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll exact six of the seven
 
01:10:10.719 --> 01:10:11.910 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll exact six of the seven
bills

01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
the one we won't be exacting the senate
 
01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
bill 3
 
01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
and then on wednesday the 12th
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to continue with revenues
 
01:10:30.149 --> 01:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
and hopefully
 
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
we can have somebody come in and i'm
 
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
hoping that we have
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
guidance on the latest stimulus
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
the next thing we want to discuss is
 
01:10:47.189 --> 01:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
has been working with the senate
 
01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:50.790 align:start position:0%
has been working with the senate
relative

01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
relative
 
01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
to house bill 565 which we had passed
 
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
and it also appears
 
01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
in an ominous bill over there so
 
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:02.630 align:start position:0%
in an ominous bill over there so
represent

01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
romney would you explain that yeah so i
 
01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
touched on it briefly yesterday but i i
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
since then i did have a conversation
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
with senator d'alessandro
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
and with uh representative hill who
 
01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
chairs the
 
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
legislative administration committee
 
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
which is where this
 
01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:23.679 align:start position:0%
is senate bill 100 which is an omnibus
 
01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:24.310 align:start position:0%
is senate bill 100 which is an omnibus
bill

01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
on section four relates to a uh
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
committee to study charitable gaming
 
01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
so our our uh representative
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
and i chatted with representative ames
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh yesterday morning about this as well
 
01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh but now i got a little more detail so
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
house bill 565 passed out of our
 
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
committee which was our version of
 
01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
of the uh a study committee uh chair
 
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
study channel gaming committee
 
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh passed unanimous out of us that
 
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
passed on the floor in consent
 
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
whenever the senate the senate passed it
 
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh but then put it on the table
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
it's still unclear why they put it on
 
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
the table but i could think of some
 
01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
scenarios why they put it on the table
 
01:12:09.189 --> 01:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
now in our bill
 
01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
we just said three members of the house
 
01:12:13.189 --> 01:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
and two members of the
 
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh picked by the speaker and two members
 
01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
of the senate
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
appointed by the senate president
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
in the hou and the senate version
 
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
they they say two members of the senate
 
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
one that comes from finance and one that
 
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
comes from ways and means
 
01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
and then they say in their version they
 
01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
say three members of the house
 
01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
one from ways and means one from finance
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
the other is either or or
 
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
other committee appointed by the the
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
house speaker so
 
01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
what i suggested to senator d'alessandro
 
01:12:56.149 --> 01:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
this morning is that you know we have no
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
problem with the senate picking who they
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
want to be on their
 
01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
on the committee uh but
 
01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
we may want to change what
 
01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
the makeup on our side is and uh
 
01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
i said uh i i think
 
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
i think it's better that that the
 
01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
members come all from ways and means
 
01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:16.470 align:start position:0%
members come all from ways and means
because

01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
on the house side because we're the most
 
01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
familiar with this
 
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
and then per our conversation yesterday
 
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
suggested well can we make it at least
 
01:13:34.229 --> 01:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
one from
 
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
the minority party which would probably
 
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
happen on its own
 
01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh usually these they usually if it's
 
01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
three members it'll be two from the
 
01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
majority party one from the minority
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
party most committees that i've been on
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
over the years that's the way it works
 
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
but we we could state it that way so
 
01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
he had no problem senator alessandro
 
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
said yeah that's fine but why don't you
 
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
make it two and two
 
01:13:59.430 --> 01:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
so that's another option um
 
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
this is not a partisan uh committee
 
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh at all we're just trying to study all
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
aspects of charitable gaming
 
01:14:11.669 --> 01:14:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh so i'm fine with it either way
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh if we if we amend
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
senate bill uh 100
 
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
section part 4 where this resides
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
um to do to say either
 
01:14:28.149 --> 01:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
uh two uh two members or three members
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
ways of means two from the majority
 
01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
party one from the minority party
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
or four members of ways of means
 
01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
to two members that come from the uh
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
minority party and two to come from the
 
01:14:41.669 --> 01:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
majority party
 
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
so uh i was just trying to get a feel
 
01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
committee of would anybody object if
 
01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh either way uh on this
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
okay so and then i i
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh so there's a chant these are omnibus
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
bills so when i talk to
 
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh to the uh representative hill
 
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
chairs legislative administration he
 
01:15:10.709 --> 01:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
says that there's about six or seven
 
01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
commissions or committees
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
that are there he says there's probably
 
01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
going to be only one or two that are
 
01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
going to survive and they're going to
 
01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
amend out
 
01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
some of these others so
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
ours being one that will survive and
 
01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
then what i'm gonna do i said well i
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
need to get you an amendment
 
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
he says no no i don't do that i'm gonna
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
be putting an amendment through
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
just give us the language that you want
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
for this bill which i'll do
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
so uh but then he then he was a little
 
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
and there's reason why we should pass
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
this and then also you know uh
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
support and then i asked senator del
 
01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
santo this morning
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
i said if we amend this and if
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason this omnibus bus
 
01:15:58.870 --> 01:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't make it through the house
 
01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:00.550 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't make it through the house
floor

01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
floor
 
01:16:03.669 --> 01:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
uh that you'll be willing to amend the
 
01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
house bill 565 in the same manner and he
 
01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
said yeah absolutely so
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
we're good either way but but
 
01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh representative hill said
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
you know there could be a reason why he
 
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
thought more conspiracy
 
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
theory than i did there could be another
 
01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
reason why they
 
01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
they tabled it is because they may hang
 
01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
other bills onto this one and make it a
 
01:16:32.229 --> 01:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
christmas tree
 
01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
and i see hey i like to laugh at rick
 
01:16:35.199 --> 01:16:37.189 align:start position:0%
and i see hey i like to laugh at rick
rich

01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
rich
 
01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
yes uh so uh
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
so he says yeah we'll make sure we pass
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
it so that
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
you know they can't make both of these
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
christmas trees
 
01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
so uh because what happens if they do
 
01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:50.550 align:start position:0%
so uh because what happens if they do
that

01:16:50.550 --> 01:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
is it odd it could be that we just get
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
so frustrated with the senate
 
01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
that they hung all these other things
 
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
that we just veto the whole you know we
 
01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
we vote no on the floor to the amended
 
01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
five six 565. so
 
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
um that's some of the high intrigue here
 
01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
does anybody have a problem with what
 
01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
pat has said i i don't i i
 
01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh i guess i wonder um
 
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
i do have a favor between four members
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
from the house and two members from the
 
01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:28.390 align:start position:0%
from the house and two members from the
house

01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
not really i'd be honest with you i i
 
01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
think it'd probably be better
 
01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
to have the four um that's what i'm
 
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
thinking too
 
01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
about who's gonna show up from the
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
senate a little more participation on
 
01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
our side
 
01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i agree again it's not a partisan
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
thing to me it's
 
01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
it's uh i don't think it is i i think we
 
01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
need to have more representation there
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
um to keep the quorum or whatever to
 
01:17:58.630 --> 01:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
do yeah okay i'm going to have to leave
