this uh my name is Carrie spear I
 
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
represent uh Nash Ward three and
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas couldn't be here
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
today because she's introducing seven
 
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
other bills so she asked me to
 
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
bill I'm going to read essentially what
 
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
she wrote as
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
her uh comments for this bill but I have
 
00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
well this bill is specifically set up to
 
00:10:59.069 --> 00:10:59.079 align:start position:0%
uh well you know let me start that again
 
00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:02.519 align:start position:0%
the committee has worked for a whole
 
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
year on Banning certain past products to
 
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
come into at at consumer products uh in
 
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:13.720 align:start position:0%
the to come into the state and we are uh
 
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
the bill that passes
 
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
1649 and we did a lot of work on that
 
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
and and I I I think we understand what
 
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
the problem is with PFS this bill is
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
specifically geared to
 
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
ban uh p
 
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
in ski board and boat wax a very simple
 
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
it's a very simple idea and the I and
 
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
the reason why I say it's simple is that
 
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
it's a single product it's easy to it's
 
00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:45.959 align:start position:0%
very easy to ban and all the states
 
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
around us have already banned it banned
 
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
the those versions with
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
pasas now the in the FIS which stands
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
for the international ski Federation
 
00:11:58.910 --> 00:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
which is the governing body for the
 
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
inter ational skiing and snowboarding
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
have already had banned it in 1921 so
 
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
this is not new all over Europe they
 
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
don't use it the Olympics don't use it
 
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's already been
 
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:14.120 align:start position:0%
done for reasons that I'm not clear on
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
they're still selling it out there and
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
every company that
 
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
makes the
 
00:12:23.629 --> 00:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
wax makes a
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
past free less free thank you a preast
 
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:32.680 align:start position:0%
free version now my husband uh races
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
both nationally and locally nobody on
 
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
the racing teams in the United
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
States at least at the national level
 
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
use wax with PS there are alternatives
 
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
it's not a problem it costs the same
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
amount of money and they work just as
 
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
well because the Olympic teams are using
 
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
it and they're not having a problem and
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:59.790 --> 00:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
2021 so the purpose of this bill is to
 
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
add the that consumer product to the
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
list that we had from uh the previous
 
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
bill the bill 14 uh
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
1649 and that's about all it is it's
 
00:13:13.949 --> 00:13:13.959 align:start position:0%
just to add that one product and I would
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
like to make a comment about why we
 
00:13:17.629 --> 00:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
didn't add it last time although we did
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
think of it last time it wasn't added
 
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
last time because last time we were
 
00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
concentrating on what ends up in the
 
00:13:28.829 --> 00:13:28.839 align:start position:0%
landfill these products are directly
 
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:31.240 align:start position:0%
going into the water they're not going
 
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
into the landfill typically they go
 
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
directly into the water they're on this
 
00:13:37.629 --> 00:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
water skis they're on the
 
00:13:40.509 --> 00:13:40.519 align:start position:0%
uh Mountain SK downhill skiing and all
 
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
kinds of skis going directly into the
 
00:13:44.189 --> 00:13:44.199 align:start position:0%
water so doesn't it's not typically a
 
00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
landfill problem but goes directly into
 
00:13:52.949 --> 00:13:52.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
out that the Lakes down here in the
 
00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
southern part of the
 
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
state are are
 
00:14:02.189 --> 00:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
4,000 to
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
26,000 times the fish that are caught in
 
00:14:10.189 --> 00:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
these Lakes have have P at levels 4,000
 
00:14:13.629 --> 00:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
and 26,000 times the EPA recommended
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
level and we have a number of lakes
 
00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:18.839 align:start position:0%
Beaver Lake Robinson Pond and Hudson
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
Horseshoe Pond in Marram canaby Lake in
 
00:14:23.949 --> 00:14:23.959 align:start position:0%
Salem and CET cobit L uh Pond and
 
00:14:26.069 --> 00:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
Windham you're not even allowed to eat
 
00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
the fish in those
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
Lakes so it the problem is pretty bad
 
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
and I think it's time to stop adding to
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
the problem and so that's what this bill
 
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.749 align:start position:0%
the problem and so that's what this bill
is

00:14:36.749 --> 00:14:36.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
okay uh will anybody else like to
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:03.160 align:start position:0%
so I get all I can do I can give my
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
little personal story there was a period
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
of time it was about I don't know how
 
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
long it was five years ago or something
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
because they uh I I don't know if it was
 
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
past or not because it didn't say it but
 
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
for my cross country skiing I was using
 
00:15:21.389 --> 00:15:21.399 align:start position:0%
the liquid ski wax it's much easier than
 
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
the stick the that that all the
 
00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
professionals use because then you got
 
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
to put it up you got to heat up your
 
00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
thing you know this stuff this was
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
Liquid you just rub it all over it was
 
00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839 align:start position:0%
great and and but it dried up it was
 
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
like the marketplace suddenly
 
00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
disappeared and I asked the guy up in
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
Jackson cross country ski I said do you
 
00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
know what happened and he said I think
 
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
it was P so but the product is now back
 
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
on the market and assuming it's past
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
free I don't know but but it's now I can
 
00:15:56.829 --> 00:15:56.839 align:start position:0%
now buy that product that I was buying
 
00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
that I couldn't buy before so whether
 
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
it's past or not who knows but uh we did
 
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
create in the past legislation we did
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
create a a place where things can be
 
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
added and
 
00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:12.839 align:start position:0%
um so and uh we knew full well that
 
00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
things would get added over time um and
 
00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
it just requires the companies who are
 
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
producing the product to have to report
 
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
to uh the uh
 
00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
State Wetlands board well it's not the
 
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
wetlands but it's a a board that U with
 
00:16:32.829 --> 00:16:32.839 align:start position:0%
the product and then they they have this
 
00:16:36.309 --> 00:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
National Registry now in which they will
 
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:39.759 align:start position:0%
check this make sure it's
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
kosher with that if I
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
167 minutes ahead of the game I guess I
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
was expecting a little bit
 
00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:04.839 align:start position:0%
that we used to use that's it was P oh
 
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
so if you're going to testify on the
 
00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.510 align:start position:0%
so if you're going to testify on the
next

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
next
 
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
bill I'm guessing that maybe you're
 
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:08.200 align:start position:0%
there here for the the next bill one of
 
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
these bills you have to fill out a pink
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:57.710 align:start position:0%

00:30:10.029 --> 00:30:10.039 align:start position:0%
okay we'll open up the public hearing on
 
00:30:12.269 --> 00:30:12.279 align:start position:0%
House Bill 312 and hear from the prime
 
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative Mett good
 
00:30:18.269 --> 00:30:18.279 align:start position:0%
morning representative
 
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
M thank you Mr
 
00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
chairman for the record uh I am
 
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
representative Mike
 
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
Moffett of miramac County District 4
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
which includes the beautiful towns of
 
00:30:33.149 --> 00:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
Canterbury and Lowden uh I've introduced
 
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
many bills and many committees over the
 
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
years this the first time I believe I've
 
00:30:40.269 --> 00:30:40.279 align:start position:0%
been in this historic Commerce Committee
 
00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:43.240 align:start position:0%
so I'm a bit nervous but I'm sure it'll
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
work out so uh on June 21st 2021 there
 
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:50.120 align:start position:0%
was a unanimous US Supreme Court
 
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
decision in NCAA versus alustin Landmark
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
court case which cleared the way for
 
00:31:00.909 --> 00:31:00.919 align:start position:0%
college student and athletes to Market
 
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
themselves commercially in ways that had
 
00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
preious previously been uh prohibited by
 
00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.870 align:start position:0%
preious previously been uh prohibited by
the

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799 align:start position:0%
NCAA and in a concurring opinion Brett
 
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
Kavanaugh stated that antitrust laws
 
00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
quote should not be a cover for
 
00:31:19.149 --> 00:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
exploitation of student athletes unquote
 
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
so the ruling gave College athletes uh
 
00:31:23.389 --> 00:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
Freedom a lot more freedom uh and
 
00:31:26.509 --> 00:31:26.519 align:start position:0%
control of their own name image and
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
likeness n ni we call it nil name image
 
00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.750 align:start position:0%
likeness n ni we call it nil name image
and

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:33.789 --> 00:31:33.799 align:start position:0%
likeness so the the legal action
 
00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:35.519 align:start position:0%
actually started around 2014 when a
 
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
former UCLA basketball player named Edo
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
Bannon saw imagery of himself it was it
 
00:31:43.389 --> 00:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
was him his number his uniform UCLA in a
 
00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:46.039 align:start position:0%
video game and he saw that walked by he
 
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
said that's me and uh uh nobody asked me
 
00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
if they could use my imagery for
 
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:55.240 align:start position:0%
commercial uh gain so anyway that was
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
the impetus and the Genesis behind the
 
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
court case it took as usual years so
 
00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
anyway uh so now we have new sports
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
landscape or
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
sportscape um essentially the players
 
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
today are not unlike pro- free agents
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
there's a transfer portal uh some of you
 
00:32:16.669 --> 00:32:16.679 align:start position:0%
follow Sports know that uh big- time
 
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
college football players and basketball
 
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
players especially football they're
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
going from college to college to college
 
00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:24.200 align:start position:0%
uh willy-nilly
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
um one of them actually finished playing
 
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
six years as they get an extra year from
 
00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
covid um so it's a different world uh
 
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
many years many years ago when I
 
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:37.240 align:start position:0%
transferred from UNH to Plymouth State I
 
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
I had to sit out a year before I could
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
play college basketball so anyway all
 
00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:44.200 align:start position:0%
this newno found freedoms created some
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
situations that that do beg attention
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
with athletes now controlling their own
 
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
nil name image and likeness some see a
 
00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
need for some guard rail some guard rail
 
00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
some definition
 
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh for example what if players wanted to
 
00:33:04.509 --> 00:33:04.519 align:start position:0%
endorse or tie in with foreign agents or
 
00:33:07.149 --> 00:33:07.159 align:start position:0%
Chinese companies just to pick a country
 
00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
um what if they wanted to tie in with
 
00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
Casino or Sports gaming interests what
 
00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to tie in with addictive
 
00:33:18.389 --> 00:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
products uh tobacco alcohol or or or
 
00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:22.360 align:start position:0%
others what if I heard uh representative
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
from Derry um mentioning um some
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
cannabis spill earlier
 
00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:31.240 align:start position:0%
um what if a college athlete wanted to
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
sign an endorsement deal with Acapulco
 
00:33:37.389 --> 00:33:37.399 align:start position:0%
Gold which many of you may not know
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
that's a marijuana brand uh currently
 
00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
unavailable in New Hampshire I believe
 
00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
um but but along those lines and that's
 
00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
the reason that the inevitably
 
00:33:50.669 --> 00:33:50.679 align:start position:0%
something's going to pop up what if the
 
00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
college athlete was does want to endorse
 
00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:56.360 align:start position:0%
aapco gold uh which is legal in
 
00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but not new I'm sure I
 
00:34:00.909 --> 00:34:00.919 align:start position:0%
mean these things are on the horizon so
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
states have been devising statutes to
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
provide some boundaries with regard to
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
this brand new world of sports
 
00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
endorsement the measure you're looking
 
00:34:11.869 --> 00:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
at here HP 312 was modeled on a New
 
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
Jersey Law it says in paragraph one that
 
00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:17.560 align:start position:0%
colleges cannot restrict student
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
athletes from marketing themselves and
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
earning compensation for the use of
 
00:34:25.069 --> 00:34:25.079 align:start position:0%
their nil name image and likeness so
 
00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a freedom paragraph
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
uh paragraph 2 requires athletes to be
 
00:34:34.869 --> 00:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
represented by licensed attorneys now
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
some states allow anyone to represent
 
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
athletes I used to teach sports
 
00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
management I used to uh I used to teach
 
00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
a basic intro to sports law
 
00:34:50.349 --> 00:34:50.359 align:start position:0%
course um and so New Hampshire now does
 
00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
have some some irsa that cover sports
 
00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:57.800 align:start position:0%
agency but um some states allow anyone
 
00:34:59.670 --> 00:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
to be an agent kind of like Colonel Tom
 
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
Parker represented Elvis but a need was
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
seen to protect athletes from
 
00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:06.200 align:start position:0%
Contracting with foreign agents or
 
00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.270 align:start position:0%
Contracting with foreign agents or
unqualified

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
unqualified
 
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh so as as the
 
00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
committee reviews this it may want to
 
00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
broaden paragraph to to include
 
00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
registered Sports agents in addition to
 
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
licensed attorneys paragraph three uh
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
does requir Sports agents or attorneys
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
to comply with Federal sport agent law
 
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
there is a federal law covering sports
 
00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:32.440 align:start position:0%
agency in uh finally paragraph four
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
seeks to restrict the endorsement
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
Universe for college athletes in other
 
00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
words uh addictive drugs adult
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
entertainment uh you'll note and we did
 
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
model this on New Jersey you will note
 
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
that firearms and weapons are proscribed
 
00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
as well and that may not fly in the live
 
00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
Li fre your die State uh I'm looking
 
00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
around to see if John burrett is going
 
00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
to show up and say that College students
 
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
should be able to make deals with gun
 
00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:03.560 align:start position:0%
companies and I I would not be
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with that uh they could
 
00:36:09.309 --> 00:36:09.319 align:start position:0%
they could be bathon athletes that's an
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
excellent point Mr chair bathon does
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
involve shooting and skiing is uh is the
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
hundreds of we just had the hundreds of
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
people watching at home yes banon
 
00:36:24.309 --> 00:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
shooting and skiing excellent point uh
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
so also uh I not noticed uh the the
 
00:36:31.349 --> 00:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
section of law uh
 
00:36:35.309 --> 00:36:35.319 align:start position:0%
356 D Delta colon 3 already provides
 
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
some definition regarding contracts I
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
noticed that this section of law uh was
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
mostly tenant rights so that just tells
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
you OS and the in the U drafting
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
attorneys this is a new area so they had
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
to put this possible legislation
 
00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
somewhere stud uh student athlete rights
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
uh following tenant rights
 
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
the the the measure about sports agency
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
that we put in law a couple years ago is
 
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
in a different section of of our
 
00:37:10.349 --> 00:37:10.359 align:start position:0%
statute so just because other states
 
00:37:13.829 --> 00:37:13.839 align:start position:0%
most other states have laws in this area
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
uh does that mean we need to that I was
 
00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:17.480 align:start position:0%
just SP speaking with the good folks
 
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
from un outside um there there's
 
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
no uh fire that needs to be put out uh
 
00:37:28.349 --> 00:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
this the intent of this is to be
 
00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
proactive uh
 
00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
preemptive uh get this on your radar
 
00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
screens and uh inevitably they're going
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
to be some things that are going to pop
 
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
up that need
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
attention uh New York uh New Hampshire
 
00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
is not California we're not New York
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not even
 
00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:47.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts we don't have a lot of
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
major college sports action uh or major
 
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
corporations who' be getting into
 
00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:54.200 align:start position:0%
serious commercial Partnerships uh the
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
sports Cape is changing Dartmouth
 
00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
basketball men's basetball recently
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
unionized although they backed off of
 
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
that uh had they had the union stayed in
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
place could the union have made a deal
 
00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
with uh representing the whole team a a
 
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
commercial deal uh it's a move point
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
right now with the Dartmouth men's
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
basketball unionized effort having
 
00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:17.720 align:start position:0%
stopped but that again is a type of
 
00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
thing that is going to happen is going
 
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
to come up and that we will need to
 
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
address at some point but also uh small
 
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
school athletes are now free to
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
similarly makes commercial Arrangements
 
00:38:31.069 --> 00:38:31.079 align:start position:0%
it's not just this is important it's not
 
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:33.400 align:start position:0%
just big schools division 3 non-s
 
00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
scholarship small schools athletes can
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
Market themselves now now I was no Larry
 
00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
Bird I was a small fish in a small pond
 
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
but had the had NC versus alter that's
 
00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:47.560 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case passed back when I
 
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
was around I can totally see a
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
fraternity brother majoring in business
 
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
saying hey let's uh let's do some
 
00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
posters let's do a calendar uh let's see
 
00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
if we can get uh uh you to Fred Ford or
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
the seller Pub to be a uh
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
endorser uh alcohol by the way um is
 
00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
prescribed uh it's one of the things uh
 
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
that the laws have uh prohibited and
 
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
when I mentioned alcohol uh when I was
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
in college the drinking age was 18 so
 
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
that was a that was different this
 
00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
legislature and its wisdom had lowered
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
the drinking age to 18 the day after I
 
00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
turned 18 and that uh timing is
 
00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
everything but that uh obviously that's
 
00:39:32.829 --> 00:39:32.839 align:start position:0%
not the case today but whether it's
 
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
alcohol or or uh or drugs or substances
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
those are things that are out there that
 
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
need to be uh considered at some point
 
00:39:44.589 --> 00:39:44.599 align:start position:0%
so uh some schools probably already have
 
00:39:47.069 --> 00:39:47.079 align:start position:0%
local policies addressing nil issues I
 
00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
just talked as I mentioned with the UNH
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
folks and and good on them they already
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
have started and apparently have some
 
00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
policies in place and and you'll
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
probably hear from them but what if
 
00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
these college policies differ uh UNH has
 
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
some policies in place it sounds like uh
 
00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
dmouth but what what about southern New
 
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire University what if they have
 
00:40:10.109 --> 00:40:10.119 align:start position:0%
uh policies that are in conflict and
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
this is right this is where someday
 
00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lawsuit saying
 
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
well you know college a says uh their
 
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:22.280 align:start position:0%
athletes can can um do this and college
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
B my college says we can't that's not
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
you know and then there will be a a
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
lawsuit so
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
so again some preemptive uh legislation
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
might um put us ahead of that game um
 
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
for example if a college student in the
 
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
band can wear Dartmouth hockey shirts
 
00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
while getting paid for a music gig why
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
can't the Dartmouth cheerleaders
 
00:40:46.349 --> 00:40:46.359 align:start position:0%
similarly wear Dartmouth hockey shirts
 
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
and do a calendar for their own profit
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
miss you know Miss January wearing a
 
00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth hoey shirt um if people who
 
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
have music skills can Market themselves
 
00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
why can't people have athletic skills in
 
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
college so anyway uh commercial deals we
 
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
never dreamed of are going to pop up and
 
00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
to establish a section of law in this
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
area could provide some early definition
 
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
in a place to put appropriate future
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
sections in down the road as necessary
 
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
um I'd be happy to try to take any
 
00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:19.240 align:start position:0%
questions if there are
 
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
any representative pusk thank you Mr
 
00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
question representative Moffett uh
 
00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
actually it's an
 
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
observation um line seven on on page one
 
00:41:38.349 --> 00:41:38.359 align:start position:0%
I guess it says accredited four-year
 
00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
institutions uh I suspect you are aware
 
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
that there are two-year institutions
 
00:41:46.349 --> 00:41:46.359 align:start position:0%
that are now accredited and offering
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
scholarships uh to athletes so I'd like
 
00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
to see that you know considered that you
 
00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
also have for two-year
 
00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
institutions thank you representative uh
 
00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:00.200 align:start position:0%
yes I am aware that there are two-year
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
institutions that do Sports uh I spent
 
00:42:04.829 --> 00:42:04.839 align:start position:0%
20 years at a two-year institution
 
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
actually and they coach the basketball
 
00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:07.960 align:start position:0%
team there for three of those years uh
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
observation uh and it's true it's a very
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
good point because uh some two-year
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
school there were different classes uh I
 
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
I worked at nhti non-s scholarship
 
00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
obviously exactly there are two-year
 
00:42:22.349 --> 00:42:22.359 align:start position:0%
schools that do offer scholarships but
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
whether they offer scholarships or not
 
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
um nil the the Supreme Court case means
 
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
that these students uh if and I'm sure
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
that the the wheels are turning some of
 
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
them are thinking of ways to make money
 
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
as wearing as athletes uh so good point
 
00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
it we should also acknowledge uh the
 
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
fact that there are two years follow for
 
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
the question me inquire thank you Mr
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
chair also on page two lines four and
 
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
five uh I would really appreciate if you
 
00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
could get with of the
 
00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
weapons uh piece because uh when I was
 
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
in the Explorer Scouts I was a shooter
 
00:43:04.589 --> 00:43:04.599 align:start position:0%
and uh it it made me do very well when I
 
00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:06.200 align:start position:0%
went to Air Force basic
 
00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
training uh and uh the Shooting Sports I
 
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
believe are sports so I would hope that
 
00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:15.800 align:start position:0%
that part would be amended
 
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
out yes thank you uh representative uh I
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
already touched on that because when I
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
reread this uh that's that's where the
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh reference to John Burt came into
 
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
place he's a former representative who
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
is a very staunched second amendment
 
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
advocate so I I again this came was
 
00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:35.720 align:start position:0%
largely modeled on the New Jersey statue
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
which we fine-tuned and I I the the the
 
00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
gun situation in New Jersey is very
 
00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
different from New Hampshire and I I I
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned that on my own and and you you
 
00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
just did too and I if this moves forward
 
00:43:48.549 --> 00:43:48.559 align:start position:0%
whatever the committee does with it uh
 
00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
if you took the gun part out uh uh that
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
would not be an issue for me and I as I
 
00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
can I follow up I guess you as as I used
 
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
to live in New Jersey I'm extremely
 
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
aware of the uh
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
anti-nra uh sentiments down there thank
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%

paragraph okay uh earning compensation
 
00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
from the use of a student's nil shall
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
not affect a student's institutional
 
00:46:06.109 --> 00:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
scholarship eligibility right
 
00:46:06.119 --> 00:46:10.230 align:start position:0%
scholarship eligibility right
um

00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:13.960 align:start position:0%
so the concern in the past has been that
 
00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
it used to be if you were on scholarship
 
00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
the NCAA had prohibitions you couldn't
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh be you couldn't do this you couldn't
 
00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:25.240 align:start position:0%
uh make
 
00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:29.240 align:start position:0%
money endorsement money money uh through
 
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:31.960 align:start position:0%
um you know selling your nil name image
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
and likeness so what 14 says uh it
 
00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
refers to uh this shall not affect the
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
students institutional scholarship
 
00:46:44.109 --> 00:46:44.119 align:start position:0%
eligibility in other words uh if a if a
 
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
college student um makes a big deal and
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
they when I say makes a big deal makes a
 
00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
has a contract it makes a lot of money
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
uh that shouldn't take away a
 
00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
scholarship if they get a scholarship
 
00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
they should be able to uh make a lot of
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
money real quick along those lines uh
 
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
Terry Rogers there was a Nebraska uh
 
00:47:06.309 --> 00:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
football player who was a wonderful
 
00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:07.720 align:start position:0%
football player and he was on
 
00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
scholarship and he they offered him a
 
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
deal to be a sports writer which which
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
I've done and so the fact that that this
 
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
football player was writing a sports
 
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
column and getting a lot of money for
 
00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:21.640 align:start position:0%
the sports column they made him take
 
00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
some of that money he made from writing
 
00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:26.119 align:start position:0%
the sports column and take it away from
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
his scholarship which uh I I thought was
 
00:47:32.109 --> 00:47:32.119 align:start position:0%
terrible but that's what the NCAA did
 
00:47:34.549 --> 00:47:34.559 align:start position:0%
this court case has changed that so now
 
00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
the the football player who wrote the
 
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
sports column could keep all that money
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
um and he would keep a scholarship so uh
 
00:47:43.829 --> 00:47:43.839 align:start position:0%
yeah great question I I see your
 
00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
question and and uh this would protect
 
00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
students who are on scholarship of which
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we don't have very many
 
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
uh UNH does have some people on
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
scholarship so if someone at UNH was on
 
00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
scholarship athletic scholarship and and
 
00:47:58.990 --> 00:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
they made a deal and were making a ton
 
00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
of money elsewhere in una's financial
 
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
aid whatever looks at that person said
 
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
well you're rich now you don't we don't
 
00:48:07.309 --> 00:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
need to give you scholarship this
 
00:48:11.549 --> 00:48:11.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:13.720 align:start position:0%
scholarship doesn't the Supreme Court
 
00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
decision already do that
 
00:48:20.589 --> 00:48:20.599 align:start position:0%
did the question was does it doesn't the
 
00:48:22.349 --> 00:48:22.359 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision say that the
 
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
school the schools the NCAA and schools
 
00:48:28.109 --> 00:48:28.119 align:start position:0%
were originally
 
00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
rebar you know you know the students was
 
00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:33.400 align:start position:0%
rebar from doing it did that decision
 
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
when that decision I guess we need to
 
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
get a copy of the decision and see
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
what's in it but didn't it address the
 
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
issue of of uh the repercussions of of a
 
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
student doing it that the school would
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
do this or I mean did did it was that
 
00:48:50.589 --> 00:48:50.599 align:start position:0%
that issue mute sure Mr chairman I'm
 
00:48:52.589 --> 00:48:52.599 align:start position:0%
tracking you uh I'd have to look at the
 
00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
language in the Supreme Court decision
 
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
but you're right the intent of the
 
00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision was to free the
 
00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
players to be a to allow them to to you
 
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
know uh commercialize their let name
 
00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:07.480 align:start position:0%
image and likeness and uh the Supreme
 
00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
Court that I believe the Supreme Court
 
00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:12.079 align:start position:0%
case covers that so uh we got to look
 
00:49:14.349 --> 00:49:14.359 align:start position:0%
and see what the decision said right I
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
know the statutes all over the country
 
00:49:21.309 --> 00:49:21.319 align:start position:0%
now uh affirming that Supreme Court uh
 
00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:23.240 align:start position:0%
case but there are there are situations
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
where definition is will be right
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
because what I'm my Furious what this
 
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
bill is really doing is is telling is
 
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
saying okay fine we got this decision
 
00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
but now here's the things the students
 
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:36.680 align:start position:0%
can't do right well again I'm not sure I
 
00:49:38.789 --> 00:49:38.799 align:start position:0%
I think that's a good idea I mean I why
 
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
shouldn't if the student wants to do
 
00:49:44.349 --> 00:49:44.359 align:start position:0%
tobacco wants to do video games and
 
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
wants to do the you know these whatever
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
sin that someone thinks that New Jersey
 
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
thinks is a sin right okay that if they
 
00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:54.280 align:start position:0%
want to do these things then who are we
 
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
to say no they can't do it if that if
 
00:49:58.789 --> 00:49:58.799 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court had ruled that that
 
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
that that the NCAA and the colleges
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
can't say no uh and and I agree that
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
there shouldn't be any repercussions you
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
know shouldn't you know against the
 
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
student but shouldn't we just let let
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
let bygones May byon and let them
 
00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
advertise wherever they want to
 
00:50:17.549 --> 00:50:17.559 align:start position:0%
advertise with I totally get your point
 
00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
uh and Live Free or Die uh again the the
 
00:50:24.589 --> 00:50:24.599 align:start position:0%
first paragraph the first part of this
 
00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:29.720 align:start position:0%
uh HB uh reaffirms or confirms the
 
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
freedom part of it you know there are
 
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
four parts of this and I I hear you and
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
I get your point I had similar thoughts
 
00:50:37.789 --> 00:50:37.799 align:start position:0%
and as I said the the language we did
 
00:50:41.069 --> 00:50:41.079 align:start position:0%
use use from another state to model this
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh this proposal uh and I've already
 
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
said the the paragraph four uh the parts
 
00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
of that that uh I'm not that comfortable
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
with should basically I think your
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
question is should we as a state
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
prescribe or prohibit athletes from end
 
00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
endorsing part uh some people think we
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
should uh you'll notice we have a lot of
 
00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
sponsors for this measure and not all
 
00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:05.240 align:start position:0%
sponsors are necessarily in sync on
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
whether we should Outlaw uh College
 
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
athletes from endorsing fair enough
 
00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:12.630 align:start position:0%
athletes from endorsing fair enough
represent

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:51:15.069 --> 00:51:15.079 align:start position:0%
Teresa so uh thank you for taking a
 
00:51:18.109 --> 00:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
question um so the the scholarship that
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
you mentioned is it uh strictly Merit
 
00:51:23.309 --> 00:51:23.319 align:start position:0%
based scholarship or is it also need
 
00:51:26.349 --> 00:51:26.359 align:start position:0%
based scholarship uh good question uh
 
00:51:28.589 --> 00:51:28.599 align:start position:0%
does Scholarships in question are they
 
00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:30.559 align:start position:0%
academic or athletic is that kind of
 
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
what your question is yeah so on that
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
that paragraph we say they they
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
shouldn't affect the scholarship so
 
00:51:38.069 --> 00:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
scholarship can be need- based or uh it
 
00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
can be uh Merit based so it does it
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
refer to all the scholarships or or it
 
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
refers only to uh Merit based
 
00:51:48.349 --> 00:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
scholarship sure that's a great question
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's an interesting question because
 
00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
there are clearly athletic scholarships
 
00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
and there financial aid and there are
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
some scholarships somebody could be on a
 
00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
academic scholarship
 
00:52:00.789 --> 00:52:00.799 align:start position:0%
and so uh the the language here about uh
 
00:52:02.589 --> 00:52:02.599 align:start position:0%
protecting scholarships if somebody
 
00:52:05.069 --> 00:52:05.079 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of money uh would that
 
00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
impact a an academic scholarship uh
 
00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
depending upon what the committee does
 
00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
with this that's interesting point that
 
00:52:17.549 --> 00:52:17.559 align:start position:0%
may want to confirm uh that it also you
 
00:52:20.589 --> 00:52:20.599 align:start position:0%
know this legislation would also protect
 
00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
uh academic scholarships if if a uh if a
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
student uh perhaps a non-athlete uh gets
 
00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
Rich from selling their nil uh they
 
00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
should their their academic scholarship
 
00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
should also be safe I that's the type of
 
00:52:39.069 --> 00:52:39.079 align:start position:0%
thing that's uh that's going to be
 
00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
happening more and more is with this new
 
00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:44.839 align:start position:0%
world thank you for your question
 
00:52:44.839 --> 00:52:46.150 align:start position:0%
world thank you for your question
represent

00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
for coming in to testify this morning um
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
how would this affect need-based
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
scholarships which are based on how much
 
00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
money the student or the student's
 
00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
family has thank you for your question
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
how would this affect need-based
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
scholarships I don't think it would
 
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
affect need-based at all this is a
 
00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
sports type uh sports related measure uh
 
00:53:12.069 --> 00:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
directly tied to the Supreme Court case
 
00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:14.200 align:start position:0%
so need-based scholarships that through
 
00:53:17.230 --> 00:53:17.240 align:start position:0%
financial aid uh I I just don't see that
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
them being impacted unless it's an
 
00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
athlete uh who's getting money uh for
 
00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:24.440 align:start position:0%
financial because of their athletic
 
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:26.680 align:start position:0%
situation in which case the language
 
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
here is intended to protect
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
scholarship further question may inquire
 
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um so did I understand
 
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
correctly that um need-based
 
00:53:41.069 --> 00:53:41.079 align:start position:0%
scholarships would not be
 
00:53:43.309 --> 00:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
protected not by thank you for your
 
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
question not not by the language in here
 
00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
that was not the intent was to protect
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
need-based scholarships uh that that
 
00:53:52.589 --> 00:53:52.599 align:start position:0%
would be something locally that
 
00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:55.160 align:start position:0%
institutions uh their policies would
 
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
would cover um again the focus here was
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
on on um student athletes but but uh
 
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
people in a band people in the marching
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
band who have wonderful music skills if
 
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
they uh wear a a UNH hockey jersey in
 
00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
their band uh there are going to be
 
00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
potential trademark issues I I know I'm
 
00:54:18.309 --> 00:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
throwing a lot of stuff out there but
 
00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
these are things that are coming and uh
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
to start start the process of of maybe
 
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
putting one
 
00:54:28.349 --> 00:54:28.359 align:start position:0%
line into legislation so that when these
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
things come to us uh there'll be a place
 
00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:35.240 align:start position:0%
to uh to go to uh to fix them isn't this
 
00:54:38.309 --> 00:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
bill discriminatory so uh a Harvard
 
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
student who happens to invent Facebook
 
00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
while he's a student and makes millions
 
00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
of dollars he doesn't have to worry
 
00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
about put his face on on the product but
 
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
a call Harvard football player
 
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
does yes I get you the point is well
 
00:54:59.470 --> 00:54:59.480 align:start position:0%
taken and um I I understand that what
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
you're saying and and uh and again this
 
00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
this is this is sports Centric you got
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
it all
 
00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
right okay um before I let you go and
 
00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:11.640 align:start position:0%
this is really for everybody in the room
 
00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:13.559 align:start position:0%
um uh the Commerce Committee has
 
00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
actually visited this type of issue
 
00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:20.440 align:start position:0%
already and it was related to JD
 
00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
Salinger and JD Salinger was very upset
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
that he he didn't want anybody to ever
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
see his picture
 
00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
uh and when he lived in in uh corish in
 
00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
Cornish yeah and uh uh and the first
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
Scandal was that some guy was
 
00:55:37.029 --> 00:55:37.039 align:start position:0%
advertising that his he had a toilet he
 
00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
was a plumber and he had his toilet and
 
00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
he was advertising it was JD salinger's
 
00:55:44.789 --> 00:55:44.799 align:start position:0%
toilet and he had it on on on Google or
 
00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
something you know something but then
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
but the issue the bill came into is
 
00:55:51.069 --> 00:55:51.079 align:start position:0%
protection of people's identity the bill
 
00:55:54.029 --> 00:55:54.039 align:start position:0%
was put in by his family and oh my God
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
we got emails from every sports athlete
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
all over the country hockey B there all
 
00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
of them it turns out that the NFL can
 
00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
use people's image on their Madden
 
00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
because they have a contract with the
 
00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
Players Association all right so what
 
00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
this is really getting into is obviously
 
00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
this is college students and that means
 
00:56:21.789 --> 00:56:21.799 align:start position:0%
the contract between the college and the
 
00:56:25.390 --> 00:56:25.400 align:start position:0%
student and getting that scholarship and
 
00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:27.400 align:start position:0%
that in Rel reltionship that contractual
 
00:56:29.829 --> 00:56:29.839 align:start position:0%
Arrangement so it's somewhat related so
 
00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
we will do a little research on this was
 
00:56:34.109 --> 00:56:34.119 align:start position:0%
back in 2011 2012 is when we had that
 
00:56:36.029 --> 00:56:36.039 align:start position:0%
bill but at the end of the day my memory
 
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
was we killed the bill uh because
 
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
basically we didn't want to get involved
 
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
in this contractual Arrangement and that
 
00:56:45.069 --> 00:56:45.079 align:start position:0%
if the Supreme Court rules that that
 
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
college students can have sell their
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
picture and and do it with anybody they
 
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
want then all the power to them I'm
 
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
tracking you Mr chairman um but as I
 
00:56:56.589 --> 00:56:56.599 align:start position:0%
said that there are things that are
 
00:56:59.309 --> 00:56:59.319 align:start position:0%
coming at us and so we we're trying to
 
00:57:02.349 --> 00:57:02.359 align:start position:0%
start to anticipate them and and uh and
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
be proactive and I I'm sure Congress
 
00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:06.440 align:start position:0%
committee uh whatever you do with this
 
00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
uh with this measure will be uh will be
 
00:57:11.829 --> 00:57:11.839 align:start position:0%
enlightened I'm sure thank you thank you
 
00:57:13.549 --> 00:57:13.559 align:start position:0%
very much thank you all all right chair
 
00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:15.880 align:start position:0%
we'll call on representative Pressa who
 
00:57:34.029 --> 00:57:34.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:35.309 --> 00:57:35.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
chairman uh my name is Adam pieza I
 
00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:41.240 align:start position:0%
represent Hillsboro District 12 I am in
 
00:57:43.309 --> 00:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
support of this bill with the exception
 
00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
of removing page two lines 20 through 23
 
00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:48.990 align:start position:0%
of removing page two lines 20 through 23
section

00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:57:52.109 --> 00:57:52.119 align:start position:0%
4 that allows the institution and any
 
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
athletic body governing that to use the
 
00:57:57.789 --> 00:57:57.799 align:start position:0%
athletes naming image likeness without
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
compensating the
 
00:58:01.789 --> 00:58:01.799 align:start position:0%
athlete the majority of athletes
 
00:58:03.549 --> 00:58:03.559 align:start position:0%
especially in New Hampshire don't get
 
00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
any nil
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
money there's many D3 programs that
 
00:58:10.029 --> 00:58:10.039 align:start position:0%
don't have the exposure for it and what
 
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
you see is a lot of athletes on top of
 
00:58:15.390 --> 00:58:15.400 align:start position:0%
School athletics having to work a
 
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
job to just pay the pay their basic rent
 
00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:20.680 align:start position:0%
food everything else and I think that
 
00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
takes away a lot from both the Athletics
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
and the academics portion as a former
 
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
division 3 athlete and a current college
 
00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:32.200 align:start position:0%
coach I think that
 
00:58:36.270 --> 00:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
that if this was removed it would allow
 
00:58:37.589 --> 00:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
the athletes to focus a lot more on
 
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:42.200 align:start position:0%
subjects yeah that's about it actually
 
00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:43.309 align:start position:0%
subjects yeah that's about it actually
that's

00:58:43.309 --> 00:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:58:45.390 --> 00:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
it okay I'm gonna play The Devil's
 
00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
Advocate is if we were not to pass this
 
00:58:50.789 --> 00:58:50.799 align:start position:0%
bill at all would you be S is there
 
00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
something in here that you really want
 
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:59.710 --> 00:58:59.720 align:start position:0%
on page one line
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
23 the athlete needs to be represented
 
00:59:04.589 --> 00:59:04.599 align:start position:0%
by have legal representation provided by
 
00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
attorneys I think when this bill first
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
passed there were a lot of companies
 
00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:12.200 align:start position:0%
preying on some athletes I can't
 
00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
remember the athletes name but last year
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
an athlete received a few
 
00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
hundred, and in return the company
 
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
received 25% of that athletes earnings
 
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
for the next 20 years I think that's
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
unacceptable because athlete that
 
00:59:27.029 --> 00:59:27.039 align:start position:0%
athlete didn't any
 
00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
representation and he came from a poor
 
00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:30.680 align:start position:0%
family and he just took the money
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
because his family needed it but now
 
00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:33.880 align:start position:0%
he's in this long contract where he's
 
00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
forced to give that company everything
 
00:59:37.349 --> 00:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
he earns for the next two
 
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
decades so I do think there should be
 
00:59:41.029 --> 00:59:41.039 align:start position:0%
some representation for the athlete
 
00:59:43.109 --> 00:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
isn't that like an agent I think it
 
00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
should be legal representation and I if
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
this that's the only thing that passes
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
in this spell before
 
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
it right but I mean it does isn't didn't
 
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
he treat that company as an agent that
 
00:59:57.390 --> 00:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
they were going to promote him or
 
00:59:58.829 --> 00:59:58.839 align:start position:0%
yeah but the company was praying on the
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
fact that he needed the money and I feel
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
like if there he was represented by an
 
01:00:03.789 --> 01:00:03.799 align:start position:0%
attorney he'd be able to negotiate a
 
01:00:06.029 --> 01:00:06.039 align:start position:0%
better opt offer oh he didn't have
 
01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:07.880 align:start position:0%
proper repres he had no representation
 
01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
it was just him no but this that's
 
01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:13.720 align:start position:0%
what okay got says an institution shall
 
01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:17.390 align:start position:0%
what okay got says an institution shall
not

01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
prevent that is under all that
 
01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:24.440 align:start position:0%
section so it's affirming what you want
 
01:00:27.029 --> 01:00:27.039 align:start position:0%
on page one
 
01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:30.440 align:start position:0%
yeah chairman asked there if there was
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
anything else for the bill so I was just
 
01:00:33.309 --> 01:00:33.319 align:start position:0%
pointing out you were looking for the
 
01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:36.200 align:start position:0%
positive right yeah okay positive is we
 
01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:37.799 align:start position:0%
would make sure that any student that
 
01:00:39.549 --> 01:00:39.559 align:start position:0%
did did this that they had proper
 
01:00:41.029 --> 01:00:41.039 align:start position:0%
representation and make sure they know
 
01:00:42.829 --> 01:00:42.839 align:start position:0%
what they're
 
01:00:47.349 --> 01:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
signing sounds fair enough to me okay no
 
01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee members
 
01:00:51.029 --> 01:00:51.039 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh I have one more
 
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
card left here and it looks like is this
 
01:00:57.309 --> 01:00:57.319 align:start position:0%
a tag team okay
 
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
Ridge good morning Mr chair members
 
01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:25.480 align:start position:0%
committee um for the record my name is
 
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
Lauren Banker I serve as the senior
 
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
director of government relations for the
 
01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
University system of New Hampshire I'm
 
01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
joined by my colleague Allison Rich
 
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
who's a director of um uh director of
 
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
Athletics at the University of New
 
01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:39.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um we are here in opposition
 
01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
to HB 312 um I just wanted to give a
 
01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
brief summary and then I'm going to pass
 
01:01:45.549 --> 01:01:45.559 align:start position:0%
it along to my colleague to talk a
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
little bit more about some technical
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
concerns that we have with the
 
01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:53.240 align:start position:0%
legislation um as well as uh maybe some
 
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
clarification on some of the questions
 
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
that were asked earlier
 
01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
so the university system of New
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire supports a students right to
 
01:02:02.029 --> 01:02:02.039 align:start position:0%
profit from their name image and
 
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
likeness um also known as nil and our
 
01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
campuses have policies in place to
 
01:02:08.829 --> 01:02:08.839 align:start position:0%
support students in their efforts to do
 
01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
so we believe this bill is problematic
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
given the everchanging climate of nil
 
01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
provisions on the national level and
 
01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
we're strongly urging uh the legislature
 
01:02:20.589 --> 01:02:20.599 align:start position:0%
to avoid developing a patchwork system
 
01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
that could undermine our ability to
 
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
attract and retain uh student athletes
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we're seeing a lot of
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
demographic changes now it's um very
 
01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
competitive in the higher ed landscape
 
01:02:34.349 --> 01:02:34.359 align:start position:0%
and anything we can do to um keep
 
01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
athletes um keep student athletes keep
 
01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
students attract and retain them to stay
 
01:02:41.309 --> 01:02:41.319 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire and go to our
 
01:02:43.069 --> 01:02:43.079 align:start position:0%
institutions um is something that we
 
01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
really prioritize and um we have
 
01:02:47.309 --> 01:02:47.319 align:start position:0%
concerns with this legislation being
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
able to undermine that um so I'll pass
 
01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
it along to my colleague who can speak a
 
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
little bit more too sure thank you very
 
01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:55.480 align:start position:0%
much for having me again excuse me my
 
01:02:57.269 --> 01:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
name is Allison Rich I'm the director of
 
01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
Athletics at the University of New
 
01:03:02.589 --> 01:03:02.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um just a a brief uh overview
 
01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
very brief um name image and likeness
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
this was something that originally was
 
01:03:08.990 --> 01:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
not permitted by the NCAA so if a
 
01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
student athlete wrote a book or created
 
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
a product or wanted to be an influencer
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
um he or she had to separate who they
 
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:18.559 align:start position:0%
were as an athlete from their ability to
 
01:03:20.069 --> 01:03:20.079 align:start position:0%
profit so they couldn't use the
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
reputation as an
 
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
athlete this was something that was
 
01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
evolving over the years the NCA was
 
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
looking at changing this so that student
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
athletes could do everything that
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
non-student athletes could do uh the
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
Austin case um just to clarify a little
 
01:03:36.029 --> 01:03:36.039 align:start position:0%
bit that case regarded um educational
 
01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
benefits it was not related to name
 
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
image and likeness but it was right at
 
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
the same time that name image image and
 
01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:44.039 align:start position:0%
likeness rules were being created uh by
 
01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
the NCAA so they it gets confused quite
 
01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:49.839 align:start position:0%
a bit so that um precludes institutions
 
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
from limiting the amount of educational
 
01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:53.839 align:start position:0%
benefits that are received by student
 
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
athletes so there's a a cap right now of
 
01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
$ 5980 a year that a student athlete can
 
01:04:01.309 --> 01:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
receive on top of their scholarship on
 
01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
their educational benefits how much was
 
01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
that I'm sorry $5,988 I know it's it's
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
really a a strange number why not six um
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
so so that's so the timing of that when
 
01:04:16.589 --> 01:04:16.599 align:start position:0%
the Austin case was decided there was
 
01:04:19.109 --> 01:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
some uh comments by the Department of
 
01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
Justice the NCAA saying you should be
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
very careful about the regulations that
 
01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
you impose on anything regarding a
 
01:04:27.069 --> 01:04:27.079 align:start position:0%
student athletes ability to earn money
 
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
um so the name the a name image and
 
01:04:31.589 --> 01:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
likeness roles by the NCAA were created
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
permissible so all student athletes uh
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
at any level of NCA school can
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
participate in name image and likeness
 
01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
activities that that rule was passed in
 
01:04:43.829 --> 01:04:43.839 align:start position:0%
July of 2021 there are a number of
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
states that do have nil laws in place
 
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
and many of those were created in 2020
 
01:04:52.109 --> 01:04:52.119 align:start position:0%
or 2021 before the NCA rules were passed
 
01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
in an effort to protect students to say
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
if your if your the nciaa prohibits you
 
01:04:59.829 --> 01:04:59.839 align:start position:0%
from participating in nil the state law
 
01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:02.200 align:start position:0%
will override that and say that you can
 
01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
so many of these are somewhat moot um
 
01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
they're still in place one has already
 
01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
been repealed a few have been um
 
01:05:10.829 --> 01:05:10.839 align:start position:0%
modified significantly to make them less
 
01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
and less stringent so as NC as the n n
 
01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
has developed over the years student
 
01:05:18.109 --> 01:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
athletes have been able to participate
 
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
and they do at UNH we do have policies
 
01:05:22.269 --> 01:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
in place to protect the student athletes
 
01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
we recommend that they reach out and
 
01:05:26.549 --> 01:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
connect with an advisor or an agent if
 
01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
they are um uh entering into contracts
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
um it's not required but we do we do uh
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
recommend that of them we help them if
 
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
they have questions of how to select
 
01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
that type of representation um and that
 
01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:40.279 align:start position:0%
has been that is permissible so this
 
01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
this bill wouldn't change that um that
 
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
is permissible for all student athletes
 
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
to to participate in right now right now
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
we're as many of you probably know the
 
01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
NCA is in a an interesting situation um
 
01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
we have an impending potential
 
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
settlement of three antitrust cases
 
01:05:57.230 --> 01:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
known collectively as the house uh
 
01:06:00.029 --> 01:06:00.039 align:start position:0%
settlement uh that if it is approved by
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
finally by the by the judge will go into
 
01:06:03.789 --> 01:06:03.799 align:start position:0%
effect will it be approved in the
 
01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
beginning of April will go into effect
 
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
this summer um what that that will do is
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
it will change a little bit of the
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
relationship the dynamic of relationship
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
between schools and student athletes so
 
01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
it will still maintain the nil
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
opportunities it will allow schools to
 
01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
bring nil in house so that if a donor
 
01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
would like to give money um to a student
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
athlete for their name imtion likeness
 
01:06:28.349 --> 01:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
actual work performed that's something
 
01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
that will be in effect as well um that
 
01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
that will be permitted so there'll be a
 
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
number of changes coming there are also
 
01:06:38.109 --> 01:06:38.119 align:start position:0%
several um bills in the um state in the
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
Senate and in the house regarding name
 
01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
image and likeness and student athletes
 
01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
um and their status as employees
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully not employees and so there's a
 
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
lot of things happening right now in
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
this landscape so we don't know exactly
 
01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
what it's going to look like the the
 
01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
bill I I recognized this bill because I
 
01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
I was at Princeton University before
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
this and was very familiar with the New
 
01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
Jersey bill um which was enacted but has
 
01:07:03.069 --> 01:07:03.079 align:start position:0%
not gone into effect yet because it was
 
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
again as a preemptive measure measure
 
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
and would be effective five five
 
01:07:09.549 --> 01:07:09.559 align:start position:0%
academic years after uh it was enacted
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
and I think that was really to maintain
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
you know to to ensure that MCA rules
 
01:07:15.630 --> 01:07:15.640 align:start position:0%
were changed student athletes were
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
protected all of that um I haven't heard
 
01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:19.480 align:start position:0%
a lot right now about it going to effect
 
01:07:21.069 --> 01:07:21.079 align:start position:0%
but I think if all of this changes with
 
01:07:23.269 --> 01:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
the house case you will see that that
 
01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
bill or that law will probably go away
 
01:07:28.589 --> 01:07:28.599 align:start position:0%
um because it's not necessary anymore so
 
01:07:32.109 --> 01:07:32.119 align:start position:0%
um there there was a time when these
 
01:07:34.029 --> 01:07:34.039 align:start position:0%
laws were were important because we
 
01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:35.839 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure students had these
 
01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:37.240 align:start position:0%
the ability to capitalize on their name
 
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
image and likeness right now we're kind
 
01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
of moving in the other direction because
 
01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
all schools are permitting this students
 
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
have a great opportunity to um to make
 
01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
money on their name image and likeness
 
01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
and they have a lot more autonomy than
 
01:07:51.230 --> 01:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
ever before um at UNH we use this as an
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide them additional
 
01:07:54.269 --> 01:07:54.279 align:start position:0%
education we provide them Financial
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
education we talk to them about
 
01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
contracts um we we help them with how do
 
01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
you how do you look for Meaningful and
 
01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
real opportunities as opposed to
 
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
somebody that might come and take
 
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
advantage so there's a lot more
 
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
information that student athletes have
 
01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
so for us it's been a great opportunity
 
01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
to talk about these things and help our
 
01:08:13.150 --> 01:08:13.160 align:start position:0%
student athletes with that type of
 
01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
education that will help them in the
 
01:08:16.030 --> 01:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
rest of their lives whether they ever
 
01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:19.480 align:start position:0%
enter into an ni deal nil deal or not um
 
01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
and they also have opportunities we have
 
01:08:23.309 --> 01:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
jersey sales where they're profiting on
 
01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
the sale of of their name on those
 
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:25.990 align:start position:0%
the sale of of their name on those
jerseys

01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
jerseys
 
01:08:27.630 --> 01:08:27.640 align:start position:0%
um some of them are representing local
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
companies and and we'll continue to do
 
01:08:30.510 --> 01:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
so and we're going to do everything we
 
01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
can to support them in their abilities
 
01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:35.480 align:start position:0%
uh to be able to capitalize on that so
 
01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
this bill um would be a little more
 
01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
restrictive potentially than what's
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
happening um it would not permit student
 
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
the schools to be involved in the
 
01:08:46.149 --> 01:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
process with right now we are permitted
 
01:08:48.030 --> 01:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
to not enter into deals with student
 
01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
athletes but to connect um so we have
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
sponsors that we've linked with our
 
01:08:54.669 --> 01:08:54.679 align:start position:0%
student athletes who are who are hiring
 
01:08:57.269 --> 01:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
them to do this legitimate work um other
 
01:08:59.950 --> 01:08:59.960 align:start position:0%
companies uh alums things like that that
 
01:09:01.229 --> 01:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
would be something that we would not be
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
permitted to do um if this bill were to
 
01:09:05.470 --> 01:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
pass um and eventually we'd like to be
 
01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
able to do some in-house um which would
 
01:09:10.510 --> 01:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
allow our donors to give directly um to
 
01:09:12.269 --> 01:09:12.279 align:start position:0%
the school to be given to the student
 
01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
athletes so um there are Protections in
 
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
place for student athletes um there's
 
01:09:19.149 --> 01:09:19.159 align:start position:0%
also nothing in this bill um that's
 
01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
relative to international student
 
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
athletes and international student
 
01:09:24.749 --> 01:09:24.759 align:start position:0%
athletes right now um based on federal
 
01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
law not permitted to earn money um for
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
their nil u in this country they can do
 
01:09:31.229 --> 01:09:31.239 align:start position:0%
it in their home country so again want
 
01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:32.679 align:start position:0%
to make sure that those student athletes
 
01:09:35.189 --> 01:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
are are protected as well so right now
 
01:09:37.229 --> 01:09:37.239 align:start position:0%
um I think we're in a really good spot U
 
01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
we've been managing nil and expanding
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
the opportunities for our student
 
01:09:41.829 --> 01:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
athletes um we're staying on top of
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
every change uh nationally federally
 
01:09:46.269 --> 01:09:46.279 align:start position:0%
with the NCAA and we'll continue to do
 
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
so and I think we're able to do that and
 
01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
uh and really provide a great experience
 
01:09:52.349 --> 01:09:52.359 align:start position:0%
our student athletes re recruit and
 
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
retain outstanding student athletes
 
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
instead of them potentially going
 
01:09:57.390 --> 01:09:57.400 align:start position:0%
elsewhere where where it's a little
 
01:09:59.310 --> 01:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
easier for them to capitalize on the on
 
01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
nil we want it to we want it to be a
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
great experience once they get to our
 
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
school they love it they stay many of
 
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
them move to New Hampshire and stay here
 
01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
as adults and and live their lives here
 
01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
and business so we love contributing to
 
01:10:12.189 --> 01:10:12.199 align:start position:0%
the state that way our student athletes
 
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
love it at UNH we just want to make sure
 
01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
that we have the ability to bring them

I'm here to introduce House Bill 427
 
01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
which is amending the the UCC it really
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
deals with two subjects uh predominant
 
01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
portion is ownership of Securities and I
 
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
also have a section on deposit accounts
 
01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
I provided you a handout so you can
 
01:11:50.590 --> 01:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
follow along as I'm um speaking here and
 
01:11:54.030 --> 01:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
I also provided the testimony of uh
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
attorney Don Grandy who who more
 
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
eloquently legally explains the
 
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
issue so what is the universal excuse me
 
01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
Uniform Commercial Code it's the
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
commercial Bible it has a goal of
 
01:12:11.669 --> 01:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
substantial uniformity of rules for
 
01:12:11.679 --> 01:12:12.870 align:start position:0%
substantial uniformity of rules for
business

01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
transactions excluding real property
 
01:12:18.189 --> 01:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
that will facilitate
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
Commerce individual states can can adopt
 
01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
or reject proposals to suit local needs
 
01:12:28.030 --> 01:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
adoption is generally uniform but not
 
01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:30.189 align:start position:0%
adoption is generally uniform but not
universally

01:12:30.189 --> 01:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
universally
 
01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
so proposals are generated by the
 
01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
American law Institute and the National
 
01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
Conference of Commissioners of the
 
01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
uniform state laws New Hampshire has
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
representation along with all the other
 
01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
states so the first section I'd like to
 
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
speak about
 
01:12:53.629 --> 01:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
um is uh section five of the bill uh
 
01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:57.400 align:start position:0%
simple provision it's IT addresses RSA
 
01:13:00.189 --> 01:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
382a 9102
 
01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
a29 it disallows programmable medium of
 
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
exchange as an identified deposit
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
account so what is this doing it's
 
01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
essentially prohibiting Central Bank
 
01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:14.629 align:start position:0%
essentially prohibiting Central Bank
digital

01:13:14.629 --> 01:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
digital
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
currency Central Bank digital currency
 
01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
can more readily be understood as
 
01:13:25.629 --> 01:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
monetary coupons the issuer since it's a
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
coupon can control the time and place of
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
use create quotas for usage of that
 
01:13:34.629 --> 01:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
quote unquote currency and cause it to
 
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
expire at will this is a fantastic deal
 
01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
if you're a government issuer and you
 
01:13:43.709 --> 01:13:43.719 align:start position:0%
want to control people control Commerce
 
01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
or use the excuse to control inflation
 
01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
it's a horrible deal for we the people I
 
01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
encourage your adoption of section
 
01:13:59.550 --> 01:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
five the remainder of the bill deals
 
01:14:02.950 --> 01:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
with the ownership of
 
01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
today when we buy stock now and I'm on
 
01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:16.110 align:start position:0%
today when we buy stock now and I'm on
this

01:14:16.110 --> 01:14:16.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:14:19.149 --> 01:14:19.159 align:start position:0%
page you the the Money Follows the path
 
01:14:22.229 --> 01:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
from you as the investor to The
 
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
Brokerage and eventually to the banks
 
01:14:27.669 --> 01:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
and what is known as a depository trust
 
01:14:27.679 --> 01:14:31.590 align:start position:0%
and what is known as a depository trust
clearance

01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
Corporation in in the 1990s on the next
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
page the
 
01:14:39.629 --> 01:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
UCC amend was
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
amended and that Amendment many have
 
01:14:45.870 --> 01:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
dubbed the Armageddon
 
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
plan so what we're doing is rather than
 
01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
purchasing stock now we're purchasing
 
01:14:57.390 --> 01:14:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
they become part of a large anonymized
 
01:15:05.950 --> 01:15:05.960 align:start position:0%
deidentified stock pool held by the DT
 
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
dtcc the pool can be used as collateral
 
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
by the custodian of the
 
01:15:17.149 --> 01:15:17.159 align:start position:0%
dtcc note we could have adopted tracing
 
01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:19.960 align:start position:0%
so your ownership could be tracked into
 
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
that pool that has not been
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
done the ramifications of this really
 
01:15:30.629 --> 01:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
appear when there is a financial crisis
 
01:15:34.709 --> 01:15:34.719 align:start position:0%
a liquidity crisis the ucc's provisions
 
01:15:38.350 --> 01:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
that we're amending provide that the two
 
01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
big to fail
 
01:15:43.709 --> 01:15:43.719 align:start position:0%

01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
have priority to your Investments
 
01:15:53.470 --> 01:15:53.480 align:start position:0%
because they now been deidentified from

01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
debts of the broker or insolvency of the

01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:13.560 align:start position:0%

01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
reestablishes ownership of people's

secuity and
 
01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
money now we are not the only state
 
01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
looking at this many have said or propos
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
propos that oh go back to the UCC
 
01:16:29.550 --> 01:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
commission have them make an amendment
 
01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
send it through the
 
01:16:34.149 --> 01:16:34.159 align:start position:0%
process they did this and they did this
 
01:16:34.159 --> 01:16:34.950 align:start position:0%
process they did this and they did this
on

01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
purpose there are other states that are
 
01:16:41.229 --> 01:16:41.239 align:start position:0%
not waiting for uh us to go that route
 
01:16:43.950 --> 01:16:43.960 align:start position:0%
13 have already proposed legislation
 
01:16:46.990 --> 01:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
three more are working on
 
01:16:50.149 --> 01:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
drafts I present to you one other code
 
01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:52.400 align:start position:0%
that offers more Universal
 
01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
steal with that I encourage passage of
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
uh of HP
 
01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
427 uh and I again uh refer you to Don
 
01:17:11.470 --> 01:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
Grandy's more legalistic testimony and I
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
will also note that uh David Webb is
 
01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
here uh from Sweden he is the author of
 
01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:24.440 align:start position:0%
the book The Great taking he has in deep
 
01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
knowledge of this entire process and how
 
01:17:31.229 --> 01:17:31.239 align:start position:0%
these rules came into being and uh would
 
01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:33.159 align:start position:0%
be more than willing to answer all your
 
01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
questions and I will take I have his
 
01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
card but this other person Don I don't

01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
members representative
 
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
for coming in this morning to testify I
 
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
have two questions the first first is
 
01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
dtcc if you look at the uh the slide on
 
01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
how you're you're uh you're buying
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
stock depository trust and clearance
 
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
Corporation I'm sorry depository trust
 
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
and clearance Corporation it's where all
 
01:18:18.910 --> 01:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
this all these stocks get uh anonymized
 
01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
deidentified and put into a big pool
 
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
that can be used as collateral by the
 
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
custodian thank you and the second uh
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
question is when I read this spill last
 
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
night I understood programmable medium
 
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
of exchange to apply to all types of
 
01:18:39.070 --> 01:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency not just currency issued
 
01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
by the government um why wouldn't it
 
01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
apply to all types of crypto
 
01:18:47.629 --> 01:18:47.639 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency I don't believe
 
01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency is in uh is considered a
 
01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
deposit account and this is amending the
 
01:18:56.430 --> 01:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
language of deposit
 
01:19:00.149 --> 01:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
account well no um it it says it does
 
01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:04.360 align:start position:0%
not include a programmable medium of
 
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
exchange okay and you've said that the
 
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
programmable medium of exchange would
 
01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
only be governmen issued
 
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency and my question is why
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:22.629 --> 01:19:22.639 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency again the the only thing
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
I can say is the language in section
 
01:19:26.910 --> 01:19:26.920 align:start position:0%
five is amending the definition of a
 
01:19:30.430 --> 01:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
deposit account so
 
01:19:34.590 --> 01:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think cryptocurrency is
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
currently considered that potentially
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon is in a better
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:46.709 --> 01:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
am yeah it definition probably needs to
 
01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
be cleared and because yes the crypto is
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
a commodity whereas we are talking about
 
01:19:55.709 --> 01:19:55.719 align:start position:0%
uh fiduciary you know exactly you know
 
01:19:56.830 --> 01:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
money we're talking about money we're
 
01:19:59.669 --> 01:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
talking about money what is it f ficia
 
01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
what is it finza so finza stuff yes so
 
01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
that is the difference so but yes
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
probably so is this model legislation or
 
01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
where where would you have gotten this
 
01:20:13.149 --> 01:20:13.159 align:start position:0%
this this language where did this come
 
01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
from it is it is model legislation that
 
01:20:17.790 --> 01:20:17.800 align:start position:0%
several of the other states are also
 
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
pursuing yes so they they the just the
 
01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
general assumption is that in terms of a
 
01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
what a deposit account means uh and I
 
01:20:30.669 --> 01:20:30.679 align:start position:0%
would say my when I first arrived here
 
01:20:33.070 --> 01:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
on this committee deposit account always
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
meant a cash checking account it's a
 
01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
it's cash it had it had a monetary value
 
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
so um I I do I think that what happened
 
01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
was is that the nature of this
 
01:20:49.790 --> 01:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
legislation was that they want to add
 
01:20:52.189 --> 01:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
this program ofal medium exchange into
 
01:20:57.030 --> 01:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
it uh so that in to clarify what it can
 
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
be right so it means it not can't be
 
01:21:15.189 --> 01:21:15.199 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin so crypto right any can't be any
 
01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
cryptocur because that's a commodity
 
01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:27.910 --> 01:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
spirit right now of all about 160 some
 
01:21:29.590 --> 01:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
OD countries looked into Central Bank
 
01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:30.830 align:start position:0%
OD countries looked into Central Bank
digital

01:21:30.830 --> 01:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
digital
 
01:21:34.990 --> 01:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
currency only 15% went ahead with it the
 
01:21:37.470 --> 01:21:37.480 align:start position:0%
United States has laws uh has Bills
 
01:21:39.189 --> 01:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
currently before both the Senate and the
 
01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
house to forbid it the Federal Reserve
 
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
says they are not interested in it and
 
01:21:45.629 --> 01:21:45.639 align:start position:0%
don't want any part of
 
01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
it why do we think we need a law to
 
01:21:51.709 --> 01:21:51.719 align:start position:0%
prohibit something that no one wants to
 
01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
do well the European Union just created
 
01:21:56.669 --> 01:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
a digital
 
01:21:59.550 --> 01:21:59.560 align:start position:0%
wallet what do you put in a digital
 
01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:01.750 align:start position:0%
wallet what do you put in a digital
wallet

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
wallet
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
Euros or programmable currencies so it
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
it is a preventative measure uh we
 
01:22:12.030 --> 01:22:12.040 align:start position:0%
changed the administration again and we
 
01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
may have an entirely different point of
 
01:22:19.790 --> 01:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:21.390 align:start position:0%
 
protective

01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
protective
 
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
for thank you
 
01:22:28.830 --> 01:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you okay
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
web all the way from Sweden
 
01:22:41.070 --> 01:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the opportunity
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
to thank you for the opportunity to
 
01:22:45.229 --> 01:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
speak with you I'm I'm
 
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
grateful um let me Begin by saying for
 
01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:50.590 align:start position:0%
grateful um let me Begin by saying for
four

01:22:50.590 --> 01:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:53.480 align:start position:0%
centuries Securities were personal
 
01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:55.189 align:start position:0%
centuries Securities were personal
property

01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
now what that meant was the in the event
 
01:23:01.470 --> 01:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
of insolvency in the financial
 
01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
system you the public were absolutely
 
01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
bulletproof because it was your property
 
01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:10.280 align:start position:0%
your personal property that's why they
 
01:23:12.629 --> 01:23:12.639 align:start position:0%
were called
 
01:23:15.310 --> 01:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
Securities now what that meant was if
 
01:23:19.229 --> 01:23:19.239 align:start position:0%
your intermediary failed you could say
 
01:23:21.709 --> 01:23:21.719 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry you're out of business here's
 
01:23:24.590 --> 01:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
where you deliver my stuff
 
01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
that has been
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
subverted now how do we know that it's
 
01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
plain as day you cannot revindicate
 
01:23:38.270 --> 01:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
revindicate means to take back your own
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
Securities out of the insolvency of a
 
01:23:41.679 --> 01:23:42.750 align:start position:0%
Securities out of the insolvency of a
financial

01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
financial
 
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
intermediary you were no longer able to
 
01:23:48.270 --> 01:23:48.280 align:start position:0%
do that now how do we know that we know
 
01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
that because when Europe was being
 
01:23:57.070 --> 01:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
pressured to conform to this us model
 
01:23:59.310 --> 01:23:59.320 align:start position:0%
they formed something called the legal
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
certainty group to investigate how to do
 
01:24:05.870 --> 01:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
it now what they meant by legal
 
01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
certainty is legal certainty that the
 
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
secured creditors keep the assets that's
 
01:24:16.229 --> 01:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
what they meant by legal certainty
 
01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
finality certainty of finality so what
 
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
they what they what they have done is to
 
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
shift this certainty from the public
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
being absolutely bulletproof in the
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
event of catastrophic failure to the
 
01:24:33.030 --> 01:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
secured creditors being absolutely
 
01:24:35.709 --> 01:24:35.719 align:start position:0%
bulletproof in a catastropic
 
01:24:39.189 --> 01:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
catastrophic failure it's a shift shift
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
of this legal certainty so how do we
 
01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
know this the legal certainty group sent
 
01:24:48.510 --> 01:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
a detailed questionnaire to the New York
 
01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
fed the New York fed is the fed this is
 
01:24:54.669 --> 01:24:54.679 align:start position:0%
the business end of the Fed and
 
01:24:58.510 --> 01:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
attorneys for the FED responded to that
 
01:25:01.790 --> 01:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
questionnaire in March of
 
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
2006 um they
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
specifically state that they are
 
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
commenting on the operation of UCC
 
01:25:14.629 --> 01:25:14.639 align:start position:0%
article 8 and portions of article 9 so
 
01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
we have a definitive primary source
 
01:25:22.669 --> 01:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
document directly from the top of the
 
01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
financial system this this document will
 
01:25:27.550 --> 01:25:27.560 align:start position:0%
not be acknowledged by anyone you will
 
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
hear from from the UN uniform law
 
01:25:32.430 --> 01:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
commission it will not be acknowledged
 
01:25:35.229 --> 01:25:35.239 align:start position:0%
by the Securities industry financial
 
01:25:37.669 --> 01:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
Market Association they they they don't
 
01:25:40.109 --> 01:25:40.119 align:start position:0%
seem to know that this document
 
01:25:45.310 --> 01:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
exists um the FED makes clear that
 
01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
Securities are held in pooled form you
 
01:25:50.830 --> 01:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
do not have the right to revindicate the
 
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
Securities out of insolvency in the and
 
01:25:57.550 --> 01:25:57.560 align:start position:0%
in the event of insolvency the investor
 
01:26:00.229 --> 01:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
is always
 
01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
vulnerable further that and they put
 
01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
this in
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
quotations segregation segregated
 
01:26:10.590 --> 01:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
accounts that has no
 
01:26:14.430 --> 01:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
effect now how is this how is this being
 
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
done your relationship is with a lower
 
01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
level intermediary in the
 
01:26:26.350 --> 01:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
system um you're a a brokerage firm or a
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
custodian you have a contract with them
 
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
but the property is actually held at a
 
01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
higher level in the system and you have
 
01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:36.189 align:start position:0%
higher level in the system and you have
no

01:26:36.189 --> 01:26:36.199 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
relationship with the with that entity
 
01:26:42.910 --> 01:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
that is holding the property and
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
once uh Securities enter a chain of uses
 
01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
collateral they are reused many times
 
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
over these these chain of collateral use
 
01:26:58.669 --> 01:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
and reuse hypothecation and
 
01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
rehypothecation of Securities are very
 
01:27:06.629 --> 01:27:06.639 align:start position:0%
very long now so this this what enabled
 
01:27:10.149 --> 01:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
this was the amendments to the Uniform
 
01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
Commercial Code in
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
1994 the so this Federal Reserve
 
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
Document Speaks specifically to this
 
01:27:21.070 --> 01:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
another very important document is
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
something called policy perspectives
 
01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
that was published in the UCLA law
 
01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
review in
 
01:27:30.629 --> 01:27:30.639 align:start position:0%
1996 that is a detailed historical
 
01:27:33.870 --> 01:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
discussion of this by James S Rogers who
 
01:27:38.189 --> 01:27:38.199 align:start position:0%
was the drafter he wrote the changes to
 
01:27:38.199 --> 01:27:38.910 align:start position:0%
was the drafter he wrote the changes to
the

01:27:38.910 --> 01:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
UCC he he talks about this being done
 
01:27:48.350 --> 01:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
for Armageddon planning this isn't this
 
01:27:51.070 --> 01:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
isn't uh other people saying this this
 
01:27:54.669 --> 01:27:54.679 align:start position:0%
is the drafter so the intent this was
 
01:27:57.310 --> 01:27:57.320 align:start position:0%
not about modernizing the system making
 
01:28:00.229 --> 01:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
it more convenient more efficient this
 
01:28:02.189 --> 01:28:02.199 align:start position:0%
was about about
 
01:28:06.830 --> 01:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
ensuring that certainty was shifted to
 
01:28:10.270 --> 01:28:10.280 align:start position:0%
the the secured creditors in the event
 
01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
of financial
 
01:28:16.830 --> 01:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
failure um another very important thing
 
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
to understand is the failure of Leman
 
01:28:23.550 --> 01:28:23.560 align:start position:0%
Brothers in uh in in the last financial
 
01:28:29.229 --> 01:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
crisis 2008 2009 there um the the people
 
01:28:31.470 --> 01:28:31.480 align:start position:0%
that say there's nothing to be done here
 
01:28:33.910 --> 01:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
will say well no one lost any money in
 
01:28:36.189 --> 01:28:36.199 align:start position:0%
the failure of lemman Brothers the
 
01:28:38.590 --> 01:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
important thing to understand is that
 
01:28:42.189 --> 01:28:42.199 align:start position:0%
all client accounts were frozen the
 
01:28:45.629 --> 01:28:45.639 align:start position:0%
moment that bankruptcy was filed so
 
01:28:49.790 --> 01:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
retail accounts were sold the clients
 
01:28:51.629 --> 01:28:51.639 align:start position:0%
weren't able to take their money back
 
01:28:53.669 --> 01:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
out of their accounts in the teeth of a
 
01:28:57.070 --> 01:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
CL a crisis it took it took some weeks
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%
and months for those accounts to be sold
 
01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
and then they could have access to them
 
01:29:05.790 --> 01:29:05.800 align:start position:0%
again but the the the bigger thing that
 
01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
happened here is many sophisticated
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
institutional clients unbeknownst to
 
01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
them their treasury Securities their
 
01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
collateral was being used by Layman
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
Brothers under swap contracts to arrange
 
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
financing for Leman Brothers which is
 
01:29:29.390 --> 01:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
common practice there is nothing unusual
 
01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
about that um and as long as the music
 
01:29:36.550 --> 01:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't stop those clients would never
 
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
know that their Securities were being
 
01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
used but the music stopped now this is
 
01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
the very interesting thing JP Morgan was
 
01:29:50.470 --> 01:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
the custodian for client assets JP
 
01:29:53.390 --> 01:29:53.400 align:start position:0%
Morgan was also the secured creditor
 
01:29:55.669 --> 01:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
that took the client
 
01:29:58.990 --> 01:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
Assets Now imagine this this is in the
 
01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
teeth of a terrible Financial collapse
 
01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
those firms relied on on that collateral
 
01:30:06.510 --> 01:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
operate um so five years later there was
 
01:30:14.030 --> 01:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
a Bankruptcy Court decision in the
 
01:30:16.350 --> 01:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
southern district court of
 
01:30:18.790 --> 01:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
Manhattan um what was happening there
 
01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
was these sophisticated clients these
 
01:30:23.109 --> 01:30:23.119 align:start position:0%
are the big boys you would think
 
01:30:24.990 --> 01:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't run a file of something like
 
01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
this they were suing 5 years later still
 
01:30:30.430 --> 01:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
trying to recover their
 
01:30:33.870 --> 01:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
collateral and the bankruptcy court the
 
01:30:38.189 --> 01:30:38.199 align:start position:0%
judge found that JP Morgan was entitled
 
01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
to take the take their
 
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
assets um the only consideration was
 
01:30:49.470 --> 01:30:49.480 align:start position:0%
whether JP Morgan was in the protected
 
01:30:52.669 --> 01:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
class to be able to take these assets
 
01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
and that's basically the largest
 
01:30:58.830 --> 01:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
financial institutions have this super
 
01:31:01.470 --> 01:31:01.480 align:start position:0%
priority to keep the Assets in a
 
01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:04.400 align:start position:0%
collapse and they need that because
 
01:31:07.070 --> 01:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
there are so many claimants the the
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
Securities are now used so many times
 
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
over so this is a real issue there's
 
01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:13.590 align:start position:0%
over so this is a real issue there's
another

01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:31:15.950 --> 01:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
document a bank for international
 
01:31:18.270 --> 01:31:18.280 align:start position:0%
settlements document from
 
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
2014 um about um the collateral
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
management system that we now have
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
globally and there's a chart in this
 
01:31:31.310 --> 01:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
showing the flow of collateral from
 
01:31:34.669 --> 01:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
collateral givers to Collateral takers
 
01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
collateral givers are everything Equity
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
trading desks Bond death custodians
 
01:31:45.870 --> 01:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
globally that flows through a collateral
 
01:31:48.669 --> 01:31:48.679 align:start position:0%
management system that operates
 
01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
particularly in a time of crisis when
 
01:31:54.669 --> 01:31:54.679 align:start position:0%
the value of the collateral is calling
 
01:31:57.030 --> 01:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
so there will be more and more calls for
 
01:31:57.040 --> 01:31:58.030 align:start position:0%
so there will be more and more calls for
more

01:31:58.030 --> 01:31:58.040 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
collateral where that is going the
 
01:32:03.550 --> 01:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
destination the collateral takers are
 
01:32:05.229 --> 01:32:05.239 align:start position:0%
the central clearing
 
01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
counterparties that house the
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
derivatives complex this is this is um
 
01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
um where the collateral is being used
 
01:32:19.510 --> 01:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
now when they made this change in 1994
 
01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:22.280 align:start position:0%
to allow the use of these pooled assets
 
01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
legally they were doing it illegally
 
01:32:27.229 --> 01:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
prior to this they had to paper it
 
01:32:30.750 --> 01:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
over that is there's no coincidence that
 
01:32:33.109 --> 01:32:33.119 align:start position:0%
that is when the derivatives complex
 
01:32:33.119 --> 01:32:34.510 align:start position:0%
that is when the derivatives complex
began

01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
began
 
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
exploding so in 2001 it was about $110
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
trillion by 2007 it was 700 trillion 700
 
01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:48.400 align:start position:0%
trillion 10 times Global GDP it's
 
01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
estimated that now it may be 20 times
 
01:32:54.430 --> 01:32:54.440 align:start position:0%
Global GDP this is this this is where
 
01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
the collateral is being
 
01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
used um and ultimately that's where it
 
01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
will be taken Behind these um these
 
01:33:08.430 --> 01:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
contracts so so when when we own the
 
01:33:10.350 --> 01:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
property as
 
01:33:14.109 --> 01:33:14.119 align:start position:0%
certificates um we had certainty now we
 
01:33:16.270 --> 01:33:16.280 align:start position:0%
have something that functions like a
 
01:33:19.310 --> 01:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
contract this idea of a Securities
 
01:33:22.109 --> 01:33:22.119 align:start position:0%
entitlement that is very weak in the
 
01:33:24.709 --> 01:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
event of insolvency but at the other end
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
of the food chain certainty has been
 
01:33:31.030 --> 01:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
given two contracts these derivative
 
01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:34.719 align:start position:0%
contracts but only for the biggest banks
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
that are behind those contracts and this
 
01:33:41.229 --> 01:33:41.239 align:start position:0%
is the Armageddon planning now how do we
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
face up to this how do we understand it
 
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:33:49.550 --> 01:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
UCC you will see the statements that the
 
01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
entitlement holder has priority over the
 
01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
secured creditor of the
 
01:33:59.629 --> 01:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
intermediary and that is the statement
 
01:34:02.669 --> 01:34:02.679 align:start position:0%
that was promulgated to sell the
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
amendments to the UCC in
 
01:34:09.270 --> 01:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
1994 what they neglected to show was
 
01:34:13.229 --> 01:34:13.239 align:start position:0%
there were two exceptions to that and
 
01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill does is simply and
 
01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
elegantly removing those exceptions
 
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
under which the collateral you know
 
01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
leaves the barn you know the barn door
 
01:34:28.950 --> 01:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
is open and the collateral is out um so
 
01:34:32.910 --> 01:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
these um so by striking these exceptions
 
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
you then just have language that the
 
01:34:37.950 --> 01:34:37.960 align:start position:0%
entitlement holders have priority to
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
their own
 
01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
assets um these Exceptions there are two
 
01:34:46.030 --> 01:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
that have to be we have to remove the
 
01:34:49.310 --> 01:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
first is that if the secured creditor of
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
the intermediary has control
 
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
the secured creditor has priority
 
01:34:59.149 --> 01:34:59.159 align:start position:0%
control is a concept from bankruptcy law
 
01:35:02.590 --> 01:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
which means just the ability to act upon
 
01:35:06.390 --> 01:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
the asset now what we know with paper
 
01:35:08.229 --> 01:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
certificates it was clear who had
 
01:35:10.189 --> 01:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
control by
 
01:35:12.750 --> 01:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
dematerializing it becomes unclear who
 
01:35:16.270 --> 01:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
has control but the what you know is the
 
01:35:18.910 --> 01:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
control always resides
 
01:35:21.669 --> 01:35:21.679 align:start position:0%
elsewhere um at a at a higher level in
 
01:35:24.990 --> 01:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
the system the second ception is that if
 
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
the secured creditor is a creditor of um
 
01:35:30.669 --> 01:35:30.679 align:start position:0%
a clearing
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
entity that secured creditor always has
 
01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
priority clearing entities are basically
 
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
any broker a clearing a clearing firm
 
01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's Leman Brothers It's Goldman
 
01:35:46.030 --> 01:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
Sachs and it is certainly depository
 
01:35:47.950 --> 01:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
trust and Clearing
 
01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:49.709 align:start position:0%
trust and Clearing
Corporation

01:35:49.709 --> 01:35:49.719 align:start position:0%
Corporation
 
01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
um so I I probably said enough for now
 
01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sure you have a lot of concerns
 
01:35:59.790 --> 01:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
and questions and I'm I'm available now
 
01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:00.590 align:start position:0%
and questions and I'm I'm available now
and

01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
later so you're not in Stockholm you
 
01:36:04.990 --> 01:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
you'll be here for our
 
01:36:07.470 --> 01:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh when will that be I
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
don't know how long you here at State
 
01:36:12.510 --> 01:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
Side uh I just came over to do this
 
01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:16.239 align:start position:0%
actually okay yeah uh yeah we wouldn't
 
01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh the subcommittee would be uh can't
 
01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:20.159 align:start position:0%
even be next week would have to be the
 
01:36:20.159 --> 01:36:21.109 align:start position:0%
even be next week would have to be the
week

01:36:21.109 --> 01:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:36:24.669 --> 01:36:24.679 align:start position:0%
after okay it's possible if possible I
 
01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
can come back absolutely that would be
 
01:36:29.709 --> 01:36:29.719 align:start position:0%
great just a quick question
 
01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan's hand I saw
 
01:36:34.350 --> 01:36:34.360 align:start position:0%
first okay thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:36:35.669 --> 01:36:35.679 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question and thanks
 
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
for coming here from Stockholm
 
01:36:41.790 --> 01:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
um so just to make sure I understand
 
01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
what's going on here so I I use Char
 
01:36:48.109 --> 01:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
Schwab as my brokerage I buy some stock
 
01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
in Dollar General just bought that this
 
01:36:52.510 --> 01:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
week that's why I say that um but I uh
 
01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:55.679 align:start position:0%
so I buy that and then you're saying
 
01:36:59.229 --> 01:36:59.239 align:start position:0%
Charles I don't technically own it like
 
01:37:00.910 --> 01:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
we think I do I think I do but I don't
 
01:37:02.669 --> 01:37:02.679 align:start position:0%
technically own it the way you're
 
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
describing it to me it gets sent to
 
01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps another bank or maybe Charles
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
Schwab itself to use as collateral to
 
01:37:12.510 --> 01:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
run other sort of security type
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
Arrangements derivatives whatever is
 
01:37:17.390 --> 01:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
that what you're telling me yeah I'll
 
01:37:19.669 --> 01:37:19.679 align:start position:0%
let me what you have you'll hear this
 
01:37:22.830 --> 01:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
term beneficial ownership that is a term
 
01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
you'll see it in some of your documents
 
01:37:26.990 --> 01:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
beneficial ownership is a term that
 
01:37:29.669 --> 01:37:29.679 align:start position:0%
arose coincident with these changes in
 
01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
'94 beneficial ownership is basically an
 
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
appearance of ownership they make it
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
appear that you own it because you can
 
01:37:39.709 --> 01:37:39.719 align:start position:0%
vote the shares you can buy and sell
 
01:37:42.510 --> 01:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
them it works like ownership in every
 
01:37:44.629 --> 01:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
case except
 
01:37:46.750 --> 01:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
insolvency that's the Armageddon
 
01:37:50.910 --> 01:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
planning so how to what happens is
 
01:37:55.149 --> 01:37:55.159 align:start position:0%
literally all securities are pulled at
 
01:37:57.870 --> 01:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
depository trust clearing Corp this
 
01:38:01.109 --> 01:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
houses the entire Securities complex of
 
01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
the United States and much of the world
 
01:38:08.709 --> 01:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
it's all there so any individual broker
 
01:38:13.270 --> 01:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
is a clearing member of depository trust
 
01:38:16.189 --> 01:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
and essentially has an account at
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
depository trust where all of the client
 
01:38:22.149 --> 01:38:22.159 align:start position:0%
Securities are pulled there with no
 
01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
specific identification of any person to
 
01:38:28.750 --> 01:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
any security so and that's how they're
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
able to use those Securities for the
 
01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
firm's purposes now James Rogers in this
 
01:38:40.350 --> 01:38:40.360 align:start position:0%
document policy perspectives he says um
 
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
what do Securities firms do they sell
 
01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
Securities and the party that has bought
 
01:38:48.350 --> 01:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
that security has no idea whether they
 
01:38:52.030 --> 01:38:52.040 align:start position:0%
did that uh uh wrongly they don't know
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
whose security it was they they are
 
01:38:56.430 --> 01:38:56.440 align:start position:0%
entitled to finality of settlement what
 
01:38:59.030 --> 01:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
do Securities firms do they borrow money
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
using Securities they do that under swap
 
01:39:07.149 --> 01:39:07.159 align:start position:0%
contracts so um who the party on the
 
01:39:09.270 --> 01:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
other side of that contract they can't
 
01:39:14.189 --> 01:39:14.199 align:start position:0%
know whose Securities were being used so
 
01:39:18.070 --> 01:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
um the he also explains in this document
 
01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
that when they were coming up with this
 
01:39:23.470 --> 01:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
approach many attorneys were uncom
 
01:39:25.589 --> 01:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
fortable with the idea that the
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
Securities could be used
 
01:39:32.589 --> 01:39:32.599 align:start position:0%
wrongfully and he said after careful
 
01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
consideration they eventually agreed as
 
01:39:37.510 --> 01:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
I say they got more expensive
 
01:39:40.990 --> 01:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
attorneys um so so they eventually
 
01:39:43.990 --> 01:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
agreed that the Securities can be used
 
01:39:46.510 --> 01:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
wrongfully the fed's
 
01:39:49.870 --> 01:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
response to the legal certainty group
 
01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
says in that even fault from fraud and
 
01:39:58.109 --> 01:39:58.119 align:start position:0%
negligence does not prevent the secured
 
01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
creditor from taking the Securities so
 
01:40:07.229 --> 01:40:07.239 align:start position:0%
this is um this is a
 
01:40:10.149 --> 01:40:10.159 align:start position:0%
reality um we if you're in the security
 
01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
system you just have an appearance of
 
01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
ownership as a direct answer to what
 
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
you're saying it's important to
 
01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
understand this is not just small
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
investors this is important for States
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
this is the pension plans of the state
 
01:40:29.589 --> 01:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
this is the finances of the state the
 
01:40:31.950 --> 01:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
another important thing to understand is
 
01:40:35.750 --> 01:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
the the the the tiny interests that
 
01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
benefit from this that run the banking
 
01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
system really at the highest
 
01:40:42.669 --> 01:40:42.679 align:start position:0%
level uh they want people in the
 
01:40:45.669 --> 01:40:45.679 align:start position:0%
financial services industry to think
 
01:40:48.189 --> 01:40:48.199 align:start position:0%
we're all on the same side in this we're
 
01:40:51.390 --> 01:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
protecting you actually the financial
 
01:40:53.669 --> 01:40:53.679 align:start position:0%
service people in financial service
 
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
let's say in the state they are at the
 
01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
bottom of the food chain they are the
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
intermediaries that will incur the wrath
 
01:41:06.550 --> 01:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
of their clients they will when their
 
01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
assets are
 
01:41:12.910 --> 01:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
lost um the the the financial services
 
01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
firms in this state do not have the
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:24.270 --> 01:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
level really
 
01:41:28.270 --> 01:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
okay so if we were to presumably one of
 
01:41:30.149 --> 01:41:30.159 align:start position:0%
the biggest I mean there's probably a
 
01:41:32.350 --> 01:41:32.360 align:start position:0%
lot of a lot of arguments for the
 
01:41:34.270 --> 01:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
current system we have I'm assuming the
 
01:41:36.629 --> 01:41:36.639 align:start position:0%
biggest one is probably liquidity you
 
01:41:38.589 --> 01:41:38.599 align:start position:0%
know are we going to you would if you
 
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
lock up things that they can't be used
 
01:41:42.310 --> 01:41:42.320 align:start position:0%
as collateral I'm not saying that we
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
should be using things as collateral
 
01:41:45.550 --> 01:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
without the be without the uh the
 
01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
permission of the of the perceived owner
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
but pres presumably this could really
 
01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
drain liquidity from the system is that
 
01:41:54.910 --> 01:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
that not a potential concern I imagine
 
01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
maybe the people behind you will will
 
01:41:58.750 --> 01:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
bring that up they they they will say
 
01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
this and let me say that the reason I
 
01:42:04.149 --> 01:42:04.159 align:start position:0%
went to Sweden in
 
01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
2009 was that I discovered this then and
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
Sweden and Finland were the only
 
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639 align:start position:0%
countries that had not been subverted in
 
01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
this way they all the G30 countries had
 
01:42:19.589 --> 01:42:19.599 align:start position:0%
been pushed to dematerialize In This Way
 
01:42:23.189 --> 01:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
in 19 beginning in 1970 but the way the
 
01:42:25.790 --> 01:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
swedes did it so they had a
 
01:42:29.589 --> 01:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
modern uh indirect holding system but
 
01:42:34.910 --> 01:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
they they used computers which existed
 
01:42:38.790 --> 01:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
to to have specific identification of
 
01:42:41.830 --> 01:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
every person to every
 
01:42:44.589 --> 01:42:44.599 align:start position:0%
security and by going there I was
 
01:42:46.709 --> 01:42:46.719 align:start position:0%
actually able to move my Swedish
 
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
government bonds from here there and
 
01:42:53.629 --> 01:42:53.639 align:start position:0%
really own them there so it's not true
 
01:42:58.229 --> 01:42:58.239 align:start position:0%
that you can't have a modern efficient
 
01:43:00.589 --> 01:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
system that is entirely
 
01:43:04.310 --> 01:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
electronic but the way it was done here
 
01:43:09.070 --> 01:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
was to sever sever this direct record
 
01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
and create this pooled
 
01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
nature um the other thing is by just
 
01:43:17.550 --> 01:43:17.560 align:start position:0%
striking these exceptions none of the
 
01:43:20.270 --> 01:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
plumbing changes this is why this is
 
01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
actually a very
 
01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
conservative approach appr it's an
 
01:43:28.189 --> 01:43:28.199 align:start position:0%
elegant conservative approach because
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
nothing will change in how the system
 
01:43:35.310 --> 01:43:35.320 align:start position:0%
operates it will only come into play if
 
01:43:39.229 --> 01:43:39.239 align:start position:0%
there is insolvency in which case you
 
01:43:41.189 --> 01:43:41.199 align:start position:0%
want to have made these
 
01:43:45.589 --> 01:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
changes thank you okay you still have a
 
01:43:45.599 --> 01:43:47.470 align:start position:0%
changes thank you okay you still have a
question

01:43:47.470 --> 01:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:43:49.950 --> 01:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
or U I think I can get the answer by
 
01:43:53.350 --> 01:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
looking at the video okay all right so
 
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
my question is really
 
01:43:59.830 --> 01:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
simple it says in here banks that are
 
01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
too big to
 
01:44:04.430 --> 01:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
fail right banks are too big to
 
01:44:06.430 --> 01:44:06.440 align:start position:0%
fail and now you're talking about
 
01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:08.719 align:start position:0%
armagedon so are you saying that
 
01:44:11.589 --> 01:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
Armageddon this is a yes no answer is
 
01:44:13.709 --> 01:44:13.719 align:start position:0%
are you saying the Armageddon is the
 
01:44:16.109 --> 01:44:16.119 align:start position:0%
bank that was too big to fail the
 
01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
Armageddon is that it did fail that's
 
01:44:21.629 --> 01:44:21.639 align:start position:0%
what we're fearful
 
01:44:24.189 --> 01:44:24.199 align:start position:0%
of is that that's yes no is that what
 
01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
you're trying to say to
 
01:44:29.109 --> 01:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
us uh I'm not sure what is the armagon
 
01:44:30.830 --> 01:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
what is the armag the armagon is the
 
01:44:33.790 --> 01:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
banks that are too big to fail right the
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
the the Armageddon planning is is that
 
01:44:40.430 --> 01:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
the the assets will be taken by the
 
01:44:44.350 --> 01:44:44.360 align:start position:0%
biggest banks great okay representative
 
01:44:46.350 --> 01:44:46.360 align:start position:0%
burough thank you and thank you for
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question just a quick question
 
01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
I I missed who you represent and why you
 
01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
came all the way from Sweden I I
 
01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:56.550 align:start position:0%
came all the way from Sweden I I
represent

01:44:56.550 --> 01:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:45:00.790 --> 01:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
myself um I don't represent any entity
 
01:45:05.310 --> 01:45:05.320 align:start position:0%
this is my work this is what I do um and
 
01:45:09.790 --> 01:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
I don't uh uh whatever comes from this
 
01:45:14.390 --> 01:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
book goes to support uh don Grandy's
 
01:45:18.149 --> 01:45:18.159 align:start position:0%
efforts who who wrote the Bill um so
 
01:45:22.510 --> 01:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
this is entirely because I um care about
 
01:45:26.830 --> 01:45:26.840 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen here to all of us
 
01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:28.310 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen here to all of us
representative

01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:45:32.189 --> 01:45:32.199 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair um I'm confused
 
01:45:35.229 --> 01:45:35.239 align:start position:0%
by something early on in your testimony
 
01:45:38.589 --> 01:45:38.599 align:start position:0%
you said that nobody lost money um under
 
01:45:42.149 --> 01:45:42.159 align:start position:0%
the current system uh with the Leman
 
01:45:44.830 --> 01:45:44.840 align:start position:0%
Brothers failure but then later on in
 
01:45:47.550 --> 01:45:47.560 align:start position:0%
your testimony you said that JP Morgan
 
01:45:50.830 --> 01:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
was allowed by a court to take investors
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
collateral because JP Morgan was a
 
01:45:55.350 --> 01:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
creditor in which case the investors
 
01:45:57.510 --> 01:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
would have lost money so which is
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
correct yes it's I I made the first
 
01:46:03.550 --> 01:46:03.560 align:start position:0%
statement because that's what the bank
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
lobbyists will say is that and they have
 
01:46:09.109 --> 01:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
that that no one lost money in lit
 
01:46:11.709 --> 01:46:11.719 align:start position:0%
Brothers this is an analogy for this
 
01:46:14.350 --> 01:46:14.360 align:start position:0%
let's say you come out of your home in
 
01:46:17.189 --> 01:46:17.199 align:start position:0%
the morning uh you need to go to work
 
01:46:21.550 --> 01:46:21.560 align:start position:0%
and your car is gone and 5 years later
 
01:46:24.589 --> 01:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
your car is is returned by the police
 
01:46:27.629 --> 01:46:27.639 align:start position:0%
does that mean your car was not
 
01:46:30.510 --> 01:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
stolen obviously not that's what
 
01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
happened with I I'm agreeing with you
 
01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
that's what happened to these very
 
01:46:39.390 --> 01:46:39.400 align:start position:0%
sophisticated enormously power powerful
 
01:46:42.910 --> 01:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
investors investment firms they lost the
 
01:46:44.990 --> 01:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
use of their collateral when they most
 
01:46:49.310 --> 01:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
needed it and for over five
 
01:46:51.550 --> 01:46:51.560 align:start position:0%
years uh follow-up question please
 
01:46:53.830 --> 01:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
further question thank you
 
01:46:57.910 --> 01:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
um so is what you're saying that
 
01:47:00.589 --> 01:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
eventually they lost their collateral or
 
01:47:02.550 --> 01:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
eventually they got it back but there
 
01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
was a long judicial process well it it
 
01:47:08.629 --> 01:47:08.639 align:start position:0%
was possible to make recovery because
 
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
another even bigger Financial bubble was
 
01:47:15.589 --> 01:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
blown blown up that allowed that to
 
01:47:19.550 --> 01:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
happen um so they they did eventually
 
01:47:22.109 --> 01:47:22.119 align:start position:0%
make recovery but that's the purpose of
 
01:47:25.109 --> 01:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
that car now ology the car the car is
 
01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
still stolen the property was stolen
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
when they needed to when they needed it
 
01:47:32.270 --> 01:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
most they may have gone out of business
 
01:47:35.229 --> 01:47:35.239 align:start position:0%
in the interim those firms to have lost
 
01:47:38.430 --> 01:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
their their capital in that crisis they
 
01:47:40.750 --> 01:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
might not have even existed five years
 
01:47:44.669 --> 01:47:44.679 align:start position:0%
later so um I don't does that help to
 
01:47:46.629 --> 01:47:46.639 align:start position:0%
answer the question that's great thank
 
01:47:49.189 --> 01:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm sorry um one one more
 
01:47:53.550 --> 01:47:53.560 align:start position:0%
followup okay thank you um
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
so did any company go out of business as
 
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
a result I I don't know actually I I I
 
01:48:03.310 --> 01:48:03.320 align:start position:0%
think there there were a lot of firms
 
01:48:04.830 --> 01:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
who went out of business but I don't
 
01:48:07.790 --> 01:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
know about specific firms that had their
 
01:48:11.669 --> 01:48:11.679 align:start position:0%
collateral taken but um well I won't go
 
01:48:15.589 --> 01:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
into a story that fa thank you very much
 
01:48:18.709 --> 01:48:18.719 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll we'll uh I'm sure J
 
01:48:19.950 --> 01:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
will make sure you know when our
 
01:48:22.109 --> 01:48:22.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee's been scheduled okay thank
 
01:48:23.950 --> 01:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
01:48:26.470 --> 01:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
okay uh for the other side of the story
 
01:48:37.950 --> 01:48:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:40.750 --> 01:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
commission thank you chair uh good
 
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
morning committee my name is Charles
 
01:48:46.390 --> 01:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
money uh last year I was appointed by
 
01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
Governor zunu as a uniform law
 
01:48:52.109 --> 01:48:52.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the State of New
 
01:48:52.119 --> 01:48:53.990 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the State of New
Hampshire

01:48:53.990 --> 01:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh amendments similar to HB 427 were
 
01:49:01.270 --> 01:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
presented to several States last
 
01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
year uh none of them passed and I think
 
01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
the same result should happen in New
 
01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh you've heard Mr
 
01:49:16.189 --> 01:49:16.199 align:start position:0%
web you know I don't know whether to say
 
01:49:18.669 --> 01:49:18.679 align:start position:0%
I don't know what to say or I have too
 
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
much to say but I will say
 
01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
and I choose these words carefully
 
01:49:27.870 --> 01:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
virtually every statement he made about
 
01:49:30.070 --> 01:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
the operation and characterization of
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
UCC article 8 was
 
01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
wrong and I've never been involved in a
 
01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
debate where we didn't debate based on
 
01:49:41.070 --> 01:49:41.080 align:start position:0%
policy disagreements and arguments about
 
01:49:43.709 --> 01:49:43.719 align:start position:0%
instrumental effects of law and the
 
01:49:47.589 --> 01:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
like and I'm very sad to have to to to
 
01:49:51.229 --> 01:49:51.239 align:start position:0%
make that and I can't uh dispute all of
 
01:49:54.589 --> 01:49:54.599 align:start position:0%
them uh but what I would like to do as a
 
01:49:56.709 --> 01:49:56.719 align:start position:0%
first step and the chair has mentioned
 
01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee and there's an
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us really to roll up our
 
01:50:02.669 --> 01:50:02.679 align:start position:0%
sleeves and get to the nitty-gritty but
 
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
what I would like to do today is a bit
 
01:50:07.589 --> 01:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
of education and and
 
01:50:11.189 --> 01:50:11.199 align:start position:0%
description uh this is inspired by the
 
01:50:14.229 --> 01:50:14.239 align:start position:0%
book that was mentioned the great taken
 
01:50:17.629 --> 01:50:17.639 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a classic conspiracy theory
 
01:50:20.350 --> 01:50:20.360 align:start position:0%
I won't take my time but I really hope I
 
01:50:22.990 --> 01:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
get a question about that because I
 
01:50:26.510 --> 01:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
would love to uh explain how it just
 
01:50:31.149 --> 01:50:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:34.109 --> 01:50:34.119 align:start position:0%
uh so let me talk a little about the the
 
01:50:36.430 --> 01:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
the background and the intermediated
 
01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
holding system for Securities I've
 
01:50:41.910 --> 01:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
distributed a handout exhibit a is just
 
01:50:45.709 --> 01:50:45.719 align:start position:0%
a diagram of the uh holding system in
 
01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
the United States and many other
 
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
countries depository Trust Company uh
 
01:50:53.990 --> 01:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
Securities deposit
 
01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
uh uh is at the top Banks and Brokers
 
01:51:01.790 --> 01:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
have accounts with it uh and those
 
01:51:04.189 --> 01:51:04.199 align:start position:0%
participants who have accounts uh have
 
01:51:06.270 --> 01:51:06.280 align:start position:0%
their customers who are investors some
 
01:51:07.950 --> 01:51:07.960 align:start position:0%
of their customers are other
 
01:51:10.910 --> 01:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
intermediaries going down uh uh the
 
01:51:13.709 --> 01:51:13.719 align:start position:0%
chain this has been a common means for
 
01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
investors to hold their Securities for
 
01:51:19.350 --> 01:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
many many years there's nothing uh new
 
01:51:23.750 --> 01:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
here what has been new is that
 
01:51:27.350 --> 01:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
since the 1960s the infrastructure has
 
01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
evolved because there was a near
 
01:51:31.550 --> 01:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
breakdown in the Securities markets
 
01:51:34.470 --> 01:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
because of so-called paperwork crunch
 
01:51:36.310 --> 01:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
they couldn't keep up with the trade so
 
01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
now at the top the participants at for
 
01:51:42.030 --> 01:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
every trading day all the trades are
 
01:51:45.030 --> 01:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
netted out so that every participant
 
01:51:48.990 --> 01:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
either delivers or receives one amount
 
01:51:51.830 --> 01:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
for each security and either pays or
 
01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
receives payment of one amount for all
 
01:51:57.270 --> 01:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
the trades and this intermediated
 
01:51:59.709 --> 01:51:59.719 align:start position:0%
holding allows that in the operation of
 
01:52:02.750 --> 01:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
DTC which is evolved over the years from
 
01:52:04.990 --> 01:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
starting out as a as an arm of the New
 
01:52:08.229 --> 01:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
York uh Stock
 
01:52:08.239 --> 01:52:12.430 align:start position:0%
York uh Stock

01:52:12.430 --> 01:52:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:17.669 --> 01:52:17.679 align:start position:0%
so HP 427 is a proposal to amend article
 
01:52:21.069 --> 01:52:21.079 align:start position:0%
8 this is a solution in search of a
 
01:52:23.550 --> 01:52:23.560 align:start position:0%
problem it's an unwise fix for a
 
01:52:25.550 --> 01:52:25.560 align:start position:0%
non-existing problem that would only
 
01:52:27.950 --> 01:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
harm investors both
 
01:52:31.030 --> 01:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
individuals and businesses article 8
 
01:52:33.310 --> 01:52:33.320 align:start position:0%
deals with transactions and investment
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
Securities it promotes uniformity and
 
01:52:38.830 --> 01:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
efficiency and predictability across
 
01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:39.669 align:start position:0%
efficiency and predictability across

01:52:43.229 --> 01:52:43.239 align:start position:0%

01:52:46.069 --> 01:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
interest and let's set one thing State
 
01:52:49.310 --> 01:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
this security entitlement that Mr web
 
01:52:53.069 --> 01:52:53.079 align:start position:0%
has described
 
01:52:53.079 --> 01:52:54.709 align:start position:0%
has described
is

01:52:54.709 --> 01:52:54.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:52:59.189 --> 01:52:59.199 align:start position:0%
everything that investors customers of
 
01:53:02.470 --> 01:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh uh intermediaries had before these
 
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
1994 amendments the idea that it was
 
01:53:10.390 --> 01:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
created by them the term was created but
 
01:53:13.149 --> 01:53:13.159 align:start position:0%
the security tlement simply describes
 
01:53:15.550 --> 01:53:15.560 align:start position:0%
what it is that the investor gets a
 
01:53:17.589 --> 01:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
property right a proportionate property
 
01:53:19.750 --> 01:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
right and all of the Securities of a
 
01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:22.639 align:start position:0%
particular type with all other investors
 
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
who have accounts with that intermediary
 
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
and a bundle of Rights and
 
01:53:30.629 --> 01:53:30.639 align:start position:0%
duties against the intermediary which is
 
01:53:33.229 --> 01:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
something that was not spelled out in
 
01:53:36.030 --> 01:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
previous law there's also more
 
01:53:38.550 --> 01:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
protection for the property rights than
 
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
there was under the previous version of
 
01:53:47.350 --> 01:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
the article 8 of the uccc and I'm again
 
01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
prepared to explain in detail how that
 
01:53:51.870 --> 01:53:51.880 align:start position:0%
is but you're getting the idea this is
 
01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:53.470 align:start position:0%
is but you're getting the idea this is
complex

01:53:53.470 --> 01:53:53.480 align:start position:0%
complex
 
01:53:57.910 --> 01:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh and uh I I'll do what I can in the in
 
01:54:02.030 --> 01:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
the brief time I have uh an
 
01:54:05.589 --> 01:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
intermediary can only pledge these
 
01:54:07.510 --> 01:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
Securities if customers have an interest
 
01:54:09.229 --> 01:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
in them subject to very stringent
 
01:54:11.830 --> 01:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
requirements only with the consent of
 
01:54:15.589 --> 01:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
the customer nobody takes them customers
 
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
exercise their right over their property
 
01:54:20.430 --> 01:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
interest to transfer them these
 
01:54:22.030 --> 01:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
proportionate property interests these
 
01:54:24.750 --> 01:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
Pur pools of Securities have existed for
 
01:54:28.510 --> 01:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
a long long time long before the uccc
 
01:54:31.950 --> 01:54:31.960 align:start position:0%
even uh which began work in the 40s and
 
01:54:36.350 --> 01:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
first promulgated in the 19 uh uh
 
01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
50s so the proposal is to take 8511
 
01:54:44.149 --> 01:54:44.159 align:start position:0%
which starts out with the Baseline rule
 
01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
is a customer has priority over a
 
01:54:49.629 --> 01:54:49.639 align:start position:0%
secured creditor of the intermediary
 
01:54:51.669 --> 01:54:51.679 align:start position:0%
that's exhibit B you can see
 
01:54:51.679 --> 01:54:54.030 align:start position:0%
that's exhibit B you can see
intermediary

01:54:54.030 --> 01:54:54.040 align:start position:0%
intermediary
 
01:54:58.030 --> 01:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
borrow uh and that was something added
 
01:55:01.589 --> 01:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
in the 1994 amendments it did not exist
 
01:55:01.599 --> 01:55:03.069 align:start position:0%
in the 1994 amendments it did not exist
before

01:55:03.069 --> 01:55:03.079 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:55:05.830 --> 01:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
then then there are two exceptions one
 
01:55:08.430 --> 01:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
is if there's a loan to the
 
01:55:11.990 --> 01:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
intermediary that's where the lender
 
01:55:14.109 --> 01:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
takes control that is the power over the
 
01:55:17.310 --> 01:55:17.320 align:start position:0%
asset actually essentially takes it
 
01:55:20.350 --> 01:55:20.360 align:start position:0%
away uh and the other is a loan to a
 
01:55:22.990 --> 01:55:23.000 align:start position:0%
Clearing Corporation like the deposit R
 
01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:23.910 align:start position:0%
Clearing Corporation like the deposit R
Trust

01:55:23.910 --> 01:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
Trust
 
01:55:27.229 --> 01:55:27.239 align:start position:0%
Company the DTC and its affili
 
01:55:29.910 --> 01:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
Affiliates have billions of dollars in
 
01:55:33.030 --> 01:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
backup lines of credit that would be
 
01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
jeopardized or eliminated if if these
 
01:55:37.950 --> 01:55:37.960 align:start position:0%
were to pass this this these lines of
 
01:55:40.510 --> 01:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
credit back up the settlement process if
 
01:55:43.109 --> 01:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
some intermediary fails to make sure
 
01:55:45.750 --> 01:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
every gets performed in time and it also
 
01:55:48.310 --> 01:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
provides substantial protection against
 
01:55:53.550 --> 01:55:53.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:56.550 --> 01:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
now the suggestion was
 
01:56:00.069 --> 01:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
that the 1994 amendments added these
 
01:56:02.270 --> 01:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
priorities well they added those
 
01:56:04.430 --> 01:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
Provisions all right but there are
 
01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:06.719 align:start position:0%
corresponding Provisions which provide
 
01:56:10.149 --> 01:56:10.159 align:start position:0%
additional protection for the uh uh
 
01:56:12.510 --> 01:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
investors consider first a bank that
 
01:56:15.189 --> 01:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
borrows Banks normally don't use
 
01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
customer Securities to borrow only
 
01:56:19.550 --> 01:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
Brokers are allowed to do that and that
 
01:56:23.430 --> 01:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
to a very very limited uh extent
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh in no Bank insolvency I'm ever aware
 
01:56:28.350 --> 01:56:28.360 align:start position:0%
of has any customer lost where the bank
 
01:56:32.790 --> 01:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
was the custodian it's simply a nonissue
 
01:56:34.750 --> 01:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
although Banks do sometimes borrow with
 
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
Securities a secured lender this is
 
01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
asset based in the Securities
 
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
Market they have to be sure they're
 
01:56:43.950 --> 01:56:43.960 align:start position:0%
first and to tell them they might be
 
01:56:46.830 --> 01:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
subordinate down the line in insolvency
 
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
to a customer which is the only time the
 
01:56:55.030 --> 01:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
only time collateral matters is not much
 
01:56:57.669 --> 01:56:57.679 align:start position:0%
soless uh but take where most of us have
 
01:57:00.189 --> 01:57:00.199 align:start position:0%
our Securities with broker dealers
 
01:57:03.390 --> 01:57:03.400 align:start position:0%
registered with the SEC members of the
 
01:57:04.950 --> 01:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
Securities investor Protection
 
01:57:07.069 --> 01:57:07.079 align:start position:0%
Corporation which provides certain
 
01:57:10.430 --> 01:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
Protections in the event the broker is
 
01:57:11.470 --> 01:57:11.480 align:start position:0%
in an
 
01:57:14.510 --> 01:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
insolvency uh
 
01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
proceeding what's the priority there
 
01:57:20.669 --> 01:57:20.679 align:start position:0%
well the priority is that secured
 
01:57:24.149 --> 01:57:24.159 align:start position:0%
creditors have the priority
 
01:57:27.149 --> 01:57:27.159 align:start position:0%
the UCC doesn't apply CPA the Securities
 
01:57:29.550 --> 01:57:29.560 align:start position:0%
investor protection act provides that
 
01:57:32.830 --> 01:57:32.840 align:start position:0%
priority for these broker
 
01:57:34.709 --> 01:57:34.719 align:start position:0%
dealers there are some other problems
 
01:57:37.149 --> 01:57:37.159 align:start position:0%
that will be caused I'll mention however
 
01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
but this certainly wasn't anything that
 
01:57:41.350 --> 01:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
was brought about by the 1994 amendments
 
01:57:45.350 --> 01:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
why is that priority there it's there to
 
01:57:49.229 --> 01:57:49.239 align:start position:0%
benefit the investors the customers of
 
01:57:55.069 --> 01:57:55.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:57.870 --> 01:57:57.880 align:start position:0%
in exhibit two you can see the loan to
 
01:57:57.880 --> 01:57:59.149 align:start position:0%
in exhibit two you can see the loan to
the

01:57:59.149 --> 01:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:57:59.159 --> 01:58:02.390 align:start position:0%
the
intermediary

01:58:02.390 --> 01:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:05.390 --> 01:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
uh customers often want to borrow from
 
01:58:07.350 --> 01:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
their broker these are often called
 
01:58:10.830 --> 01:58:10.840 align:start position:0%
margin loans now the proponents have
 
01:58:13.189 --> 01:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
suggested elsewhere that oh that has
 
01:58:15.149 --> 01:58:15.159 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with this these priority
 
01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
rules are loans to the intermediary not
 
01:58:21.790 --> 01:58:21.800 align:start position:0%
to the customer well a broker dealer is
 
01:58:24.589 --> 01:58:24.599 align:start position:0%
not like the old Scrooge McDuck sitting
 
01:58:27.390 --> 01:58:27.400 align:start position:0%
in a room full of coins and bills with
 
01:58:30.069 --> 01:58:30.079 align:start position:0%
money deciding what to do broker dealers
 
01:58:34.709 --> 01:58:34.719 align:start position:0%
have to fund their loans they borrow at
 
01:58:36.950 --> 01:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
favorable rates which allows them to
 
01:58:40.669 --> 01:58:40.679 align:start position:0%
loan at favorable rates to their
 
01:58:43.950 --> 01:58:43.960 align:start position:0%
customers that's the only reason we have
 
01:58:43.960 --> 01:58:44.870 align:start position:0%
customers that's the only reason we have
that

01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:58:47.550 --> 01:58:47.560 align:start position:0%
priority uh other than the fact it's
 
01:58:50.550 --> 01:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
been the the priority that existed even
 
01:58:53.109 --> 01:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
before sipa in the
 
01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
1970s uh going back at least to the
 
01:58:58.709 --> 01:58:58.719 align:start position:0%
1930s when the Securities Acts were
 
01:59:01.669 --> 01:59:01.679 align:start position:0%
enacted and changes the bankruptcy
 
01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
law were made so this priority has
 
01:59:06.750 --> 01:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
always been
 
01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
there the idea that until 1994 has
 
01:59:15.310 --> 01:59:15.320 align:start position:0%
indicated for 400 years I don't know
 
01:59:17.669 --> 01:59:17.679 align:start position:0%
where that number came from but I've
 
01:59:19.310 --> 01:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
only been researching in this area for
 
01:59:22.950 --> 01:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
about 52 years maybe 53
 
01:59:26.229 --> 01:59:26.239 align:start position:0%
but the idea that somehow before then
 
01:59:29.270 --> 01:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
there was some rock solid interest in a
 
01:59:33.870 --> 01:59:33.880 align:start position:0%
specific security is just
 
01:59:37.069 --> 01:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
ridiculous that hasn't been the way
 
01:59:39.790 --> 01:59:39.800 align:start position:0%
intermediaries held customer
 
01:59:43.310 --> 01:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
accounts forever that I know of well
 
01:59:45.149 --> 01:59:45.159 align:start position:0%
maybe they used to actually have custody
 
01:59:47.390 --> 01:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
of those things like a safe deposit box
 
01:59:51.470 --> 01:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
G but certainly not in the modern era uh
 
01:59:53.109 --> 01:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
the only time a customer would have a
 
01:59:55.830 --> 01:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
right in a specific security is if it's
 
01:59:57.669 --> 01:59:57.679 align:start position:0%
actually in the name of the security
 
01:59:59.629 --> 01:59:59.639 align:start position:0%
written on the
 
02:00:02.669 --> 02:00:02.679 align:start position:0%
certificate usually that happens when
 
02:00:05.270 --> 02:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
the broker dealer fails in the few times
 
02:00:06.910 --> 02:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
they have and they were getting ready to
 
02:00:08.510 --> 02:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
mail it out to the customer but it's
 
02:00:11.310 --> 02:00:11.320 align:start position:0%
still in the mail room or still in the
 
02:00:14.310 --> 02:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
desk so the idea that somehow before
 
02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
1994 or going way back you had some
 
02:00:25.830 --> 02:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:28.310 --> 02:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
wrong I mean the reference to the New
 
02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:29.109 align:start position:0%
wrong I mean the reference to the New
York

02:00:29.109 --> 02:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
York
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
fed letter the idea that someone's
 
02:00:34.709 --> 02:00:34.719 align:start position:0%
hiding that well nobody's going to hide
 
02:00:37.629 --> 02:00:37.639 align:start position:0%
something that's harmless I mean it's
 
02:00:40.669 --> 02:00:40.679 align:start position:0%
it's essentially laughable all that said
 
02:00:44.069 --> 02:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
was in answer to a question
 
02:00:47.189 --> 02:00:47.199 align:start position:0%
does an investor a customer have a
 
02:00:51.270 --> 02:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
property right in any specific security
 
02:00:53.830 --> 02:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
well the deposit trust company has
 
02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
warehouses some of which are in uh New
 
02:00:59.430 --> 02:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
Jersey which was mentioned in one of the
 
02:01:02.950 --> 02:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
earlier uh uh uh hearings certificates
 
02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
are everywhere customer names are not uh
 
02:01:09.390 --> 02:01:09.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh on those and of course the answer
 
02:01:12.069 --> 02:01:12.079 align:start position:0%
was no they have a proportionate
 
02:01:14.550 --> 02:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
property interest in the Securities of
 
02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
that type not in any particular security
 
02:01:21.310 --> 02:01:21.320 align:start position:0%
all the customers would share not only
 
02:01:24.910 --> 02:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
that not only that for broker
 
02:01:27.470 --> 02:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
dealers if I've got a security interest
 
02:01:29.550 --> 02:01:29.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm a customer if I've got a
 
02:01:32.069 --> 02:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
security entitlement to ABC
 
02:01:34.550 --> 02:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
shares and the chair has a security
 
02:01:39.510 --> 02:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
entitlement to XYZ shares and the broker
 
02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:41.430 align:start position:0%
entitlement to XYZ shares and the broker
fails

02:01:41.430 --> 02:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
fails
 
02:01:44.709 --> 02:01:44.719 align:start position:0%
and there are plenty of ABC shares but
 
02:01:47.069 --> 02:01:47.079 align:start position:0%
the XYZ Shares are
 
02:01:50.550 --> 02:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
gone is the chair out of look through
 
02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
the pure foru that there's a shortfall
 
02:01:55.229 --> 02:01:55.239 align:start position:0%
here and not there no the chair is not
 
02:01:57.589 --> 02:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
out of look because under the Securities
 
02:02:01.390 --> 02:02:01.400 align:start position:0%
investor Protection Corporation all of
 
02:02:04.149 --> 02:02:04.159 align:start position:0%
the customers of the intermediate the
 
02:02:06.310 --> 02:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
failed broker
 
02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
dealer share in the entire group of all
 
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
types of
 
02:02:14.030 --> 02:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
Securities and they take their net
 
02:02:16.589 --> 02:02:16.599 align:start position:0%
Equity the value they're supposed to
 
02:02:18.750 --> 02:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
have in their account less the amount
 
02:02:22.990 --> 02:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
they've borrowed from the broker
 
02:02:24.189 --> 02:02:24.199 align:start position:0%
and that's their
 
02:02:26.950 --> 02:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
claim and they have that claim to all of
 
02:02:30.310 --> 02:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
the Securities not just to the ones so
 
02:02:31.669 --> 02:02:31.679 align:start position:0%
even if
 
02:02:35.149 --> 02:02:35.159 align:start position:0%
the private law
 
02:02:37.669 --> 02:02:37.679 align:start position:0%
UCC provides that you have a property
 
02:02:39.270 --> 02:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
interest in specific things that would
 
02:02:42.229 --> 02:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
apply in a bank insolvency or for a
 
02:02:44.350 --> 02:02:44.360 align:start position:0%
Clearing Corporation but for a broker
 
02:02:48.510 --> 02:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
dealer under sipa all the customers
 
02:02:52.270 --> 02:02:52.280 align:start position:0%
share this ensures that customers have a
 
02:02:57.109 --> 02:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
much much much lower chance of a big
 
02:03:02.069 --> 02:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
loss and of course under CPA uh cpic
 
02:03:04.189 --> 02:03:04.199 align:start position:0%
provides protection for investors and
 
02:03:05.830 --> 02:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
broker dealers for the
 
02:03:09.790 --> 02:03:09.800 align:start position:0%
retail uh investors up to
 
02:03:13.270 --> 02:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
$500,000 in loss now that's not 500,000
 
02:03:16.390 --> 02:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
insecurities that's loss if I've got
 
02:03:19.270 --> 02:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
five million insecurities in the account
 
02:03:23.669 --> 02:03:23.679 align:start position:0%
and there's a highly unusual loss of 10%
 
02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
of the customer Securities are
 
02:03:28.910 --> 02:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
gone well I'm still fully protected
 
02:03:30.550 --> 02:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
because my short fall is
 
02:03:32.550 --> 02:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
$500,000 that's
 
02:03:36.030 --> 02:03:36.040 align:start position:0%
loss uh I'm happy to provide data and we
 
02:03:37.589 --> 02:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
could get into this in the subcommittee
 
02:03:40.790 --> 02:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
meeting on the experience of cpic the
 
02:03:44.109 --> 02:03:44.119 align:start position:0%
claim that it's underfunded and and uh
 
02:03:45.990 --> 02:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't meet its obligations is
 
02:03:48.430 --> 02:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
unfounded and I think we can explain why
 
02:03:50.629 --> 02:03:50.639 align:start position:0%
losses have been relatively minimal
 
02:03:52.629 --> 02:03:52.639 align:start position:0%
there have been relatively very very few
 
02:03:56.310 --> 02:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
broker dealer uh insolvencies
 
02:03:59.109 --> 02:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
finally I should mention on these
 
02:04:02.990 --> 02:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
Protections in exhibits B and
 
02:04:06.390 --> 02:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
C when a broker
 
02:04:09.270 --> 02:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
loans when a broker borrows from A
 
02:04:12.549 --> 02:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
lender and uses customer Securities
 
02:04:15.629 --> 02:04:15.639 align:start position:0%
which are securities it's allowed to use
 
02:04:17.629 --> 02:04:17.639 align:start position:0%
because customers have
 
02:04:19.350 --> 02:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
consented there are a couple of
 
02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:20.430 align:start position:0%
consented there are a couple of
important

02:04:20.430 --> 02:04:20.440 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:04:22.669 --> 02:04:22.679 align:start position:0%
restrictions one
 
02:04:26.069 --> 02:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
is the borrowings by the broker for
 
02:04:26.079 --> 02:04:28.189 align:start position:0%
is the borrowings by the broker for
customer

02:04:28.189 --> 02:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
customer
 
02:04:31.549 --> 02:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
Securities cannot exceed the amount that
 
02:04:34.270 --> 02:04:34.280 align:start position:0%
the broker has loaned to its
 
02:04:37.549 --> 02:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
customers so they always offset so the
 
02:04:39.950 --> 02:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
customers could never lose more from the
 
02:04:42.549 --> 02:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
bank's borrowings than the customers as
 
02:04:45.709 --> 02:04:45.719 align:start position:0%
a group uh would lose based on what they
 
02:04:48.149 --> 02:04:48.159 align:start position:0%
actually owe because the bank can't
 
02:04:50.109 --> 02:04:50.119 align:start position:0%
borrow more than the customers
 
02:04:52.350 --> 02:04:52.360 align:start position:0%
owe secondly
 
02:04:54.990 --> 02:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
as an exhibit see there's a reserve
 
02:04:58.910 --> 02:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
account when a bank borrows using these
 
02:05:01.870 --> 02:05:01.880 align:start position:0%
Securities the customers agreed not all
 
02:05:04.189 --> 02:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
of the customers only a fraction can be
 
02:05:08.790 --> 02:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
used by the broker when the broker
 
02:05:12.629 --> 02:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
borrows using that collateral it has to
 
02:05:15.229 --> 02:05:15.239 align:start position:0%
take what it borrows and put it in a
 
02:05:17.709 --> 02:05:17.719 align:start position:0%
reserve bank
 
02:05:22.149 --> 02:05:22.159 align:start position:0%
account now it can offset that in effect
 
02:05:24.870 --> 02:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
take it out of the account the amount it
 
02:05:26.830 --> 02:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
has loaned to the
 
02:05:29.669 --> 02:05:29.679 align:start position:0%
customer so it's borrowed 100 it's
 
02:05:32.229 --> 02:05:32.239 align:start position:0%
loaned 100 it doesn't have to post
 
02:05:35.270 --> 02:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
anything but if it borrows
 
02:05:38.510 --> 02:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
120 and has only loaned 100 to the
 
02:05:41.830 --> 02:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
customer it has to put 20 in cash
 
02:05:44.549 --> 02:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
equivalence to the reserve account well
 
02:05:46.229 --> 02:05:46.239 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't make much sense to borrow
 
02:05:48.750 --> 02:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
at Market rates and then somehow have to
 
02:05:50.109 --> 02:05:50.119 align:start position:0%
invest it in a
 
02:05:52.870 --> 02:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
sterile uh Reserve
 
02:05:55.750 --> 02:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
account what this ensures is that the
 
02:05:57.950 --> 02:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
borrowings by the
 
02:06:01.430 --> 02:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
brokers in effect must be used for the
 
02:06:04.350 --> 02:06:04.360 align:start position:0%
benefit of the customers to fund these
 
02:06:07.589 --> 02:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:11.910 --> 02:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
loans well in some the system works
 
02:06:14.589 --> 02:06:14.599 align:start position:0%
well uh investors are protected there's
 
02:06:17.669 --> 02:06:17.679 align:start position:0%
simply no need for these amendments they
 
02:06:20.430 --> 02:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't serve any useful purpose they
 
02:06:22.470 --> 02:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
could only disadvantage both investors
 
02:06:26.270 --> 02:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
and the markets I will say that if New
 
02:06:28.629 --> 02:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire passed these
 
02:06:31.669 --> 02:06:31.679 align:start position:0%
amendments in my view I'm not the Bank
 
02:06:35.510 --> 02:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
lobby but I've been involved in credit
 
02:06:37.750 --> 02:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
for my entire professional career and
 
02:06:37.760 --> 02:06:39.069 align:start position:0%
for my entire professional career and
even

02:06:39.069 --> 02:06:39.079 align:start position:0%
even
 
02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
before I think it highly unlikely that
 
02:06:46.430 --> 02:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
there would be loans to
 
02:06:50.229 --> 02:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
Banks located in New Hampshire except at
 
02:06:53.470 --> 02:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
a much higher cost if they were were
 
02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
made for
 
02:06:58.629 --> 02:06:58.639 align:start position:0%
Brokers uh even though cpit Prov cpic
 
02:07:02.390 --> 02:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
Pro CPA provides that secured creditors
 
02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:06.830 align:start position:0%
Pro CPA provides that secured creditors
have

02:07:06.830 --> 02:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:09.149 --> 02:07:09.159 align:start position:0%
priority I would predict substantial
 
02:07:11.229 --> 02:07:11.239 align:start position:0%
litigation and risk for banks that they
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
would Bank lenders they would see if
 
02:07:17.709 --> 02:07:17.719 align:start position:0%
these passed in state and much less if
 
02:07:21.229 --> 02:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
if they started passing in more Estates
 
02:07:22.310 --> 02:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
because because there would be
 
02:07:25.189 --> 02:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
litigation why well we've never had this
 
02:07:27.990 --> 02:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
big disparity assuming this amendment
 
02:07:29.910 --> 02:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
were to pass we would never have had
 
02:07:32.910 --> 02:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
this big disparity between the rules for
 
02:07:35.589 --> 02:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
the insolvency rule under
 
02:07:39.270 --> 02:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
CPA and the private law rules so I can
 
02:07:42.310 --> 02:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
imagine folks you know trying to argue
 
02:07:45.589 --> 02:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
oh well the private law overrides we now
 
02:07:47.030 --> 02:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
have to change it in accordance with
 
02:07:52.069 --> 02:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
these new amendments to the uccc so uh I
 
02:07:55.470 --> 02:07:55.480 align:start position:0%
can't go into detail now but I'm happy
 
02:07:57.589 --> 02:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions or provide any
 
02:07:57.599 --> 02:07:59.669 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions or provide any
additional

02:07:59.669 --> 02:07:59.679 align:start position:0%
additional
 
02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
detail I I think my professor Persona
 
02:08:06.310 --> 02:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
got away from me but this truly is an
 
02:08:08.589 --> 02:08:08.599 align:start position:0%
educational opportunity because this is
 
02:08:11.069 --> 02:08:11.079 align:start position:0%
a complex subject but an important one
 
02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:12.719 align:start position:0%
so any questions you have I would be
 
02:08:19.109 --> 02:08:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:21.189 --> 02:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
subcommittee representative Walsh has a
 
02:08:21.199 --> 02:08:24.549 align:start position:0%
subcommittee representative Walsh has a
question

02:08:24.549 --> 02:08:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:26.549 --> 02:08:26.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'll be brief and
 
02:08:28.510 --> 02:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question pardon
 
02:08:31.990 --> 02:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
my you know lack of financial prowess in
 
02:08:34.390 --> 02:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
all this I realize it's very deep and
 
02:08:37.069 --> 02:08:37.079 align:start position:0%
you somewhat touched upon this but we
 
02:08:41.149 --> 02:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
are Commerce and consumer affairs so if
 
02:08:45.589 --> 02:08:45.599 align:start position:0%
the proposed legislation protects a
 
02:08:48.910 --> 02:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
consumer and just if you've already got
 
02:08:52.390 --> 02:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
a wall with this sippa wouldn't this
 
02:08:54.669 --> 02:08:54.679 align:start position:0%
just make that wall a little bit thicker
 
02:08:56.750 --> 02:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
I guess I don't understand what the
 
02:09:00.030 --> 02:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
major objection is if you could just
 
02:09:02.709 --> 02:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
simplify for my for my tiny mind a
 
02:09:05.990 --> 02:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
little bit better the the objection is
 
02:09:09.069 --> 02:09:09.079 align:start position:0%
the ability to get for my broker to get
 
02:09:11.709 --> 02:09:11.719 align:start position:0%
credit is a big Advantage for me if I
 
02:09:13.589 --> 02:09:13.599 align:start position:0%
want to make
 
02:09:18.830 --> 02:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:22.069 --> 02:09:22.079 align:start position:0%
pledge only where consumer consumers and
 
02:09:24.709 --> 02:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
investors have margin accounts they've
 
02:09:27.910 --> 02:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
agreed that they can borrow and they've
 
02:09:30.549 --> 02:09:30.559 align:start position:0%
agreed that the broker can use their
 
02:09:33.109 --> 02:09:33.119 align:start position:0%
Securities only a portion of them only a
 
02:09:36.709 --> 02:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
portion of them as collateral and to
 
02:09:38.669 --> 02:09:38.679 align:start position:0%
tell me my broker now is going to pay
 
02:09:43.830 --> 02:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
more for credit is not going to help me
 
02:09:45.870 --> 02:09:45.880 align:start position:0%
plus as I explained through the customer
 
02:09:49.589 --> 02:09:49.599 align:start position:0%
protection rule uh uh of the
 
02:09:53.589 --> 02:09:53.599 align:start position:0%
SEC both prongs of it consumers are
 
02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
protected when their assets are pledged
 
02:10:03.229 --> 02:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
it's not just a naked pledge so that I
 
02:10:08.510 --> 02:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
think is the answer second this has been
 
02:10:12.149 --> 02:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
the lay of the land for decades and
 
02:10:16.229 --> 02:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
decades it has not caused a problem
 
02:10:18.589 --> 02:10:18.599 align:start position:0%
there is no risk caused by that the the
 
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:26.830 --> 02:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
that didn't involve article 8 in any way
 
02:10:29.470 --> 02:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
all the retail investors were
 
02:10:33.430 --> 02:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
protected the only reason some
 
02:10:35.750 --> 02:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
institutional investors waited five
 
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
years is something they now recognize
 
02:10:40.910 --> 02:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
and they're much more careful but they
 
02:10:43.510 --> 02:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
had entered into so many transactions of
 
02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:44.549 align:start position:0%
had entered into so many transactions of
such

02:10:44.549 --> 02:10:44.559 align:start position:0%
such
 
02:10:47.189 --> 02:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
complexity and almost everyone involved
 
02:10:49.750 --> 02:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
lawsuits of valuing
 
02:10:52.750 --> 02:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
collateral that the complexity of their
 
02:10:55.990 --> 02:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
transactions took that long to
 
02:10:59.870 --> 02:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
litigate uh in any event they might have
 
02:11:02.589 --> 02:11:02.599 align:start position:0%
lost more if it didn't take so long they
 
02:11:06.510 --> 02:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
might not have but I I think they know
 
02:11:08.510 --> 02:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
what they're doing but I I hope that's
 
02:11:12.390 --> 02:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
an answer just making it more costly for
 
02:11:18.069 --> 02:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
firms to borrow uh is not any help to uh
 
02:11:26.830 --> 02:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:26.840 --> 02:11:29.629 align:start position:0%
 
hey

02:11:29.629 --> 02:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:32.270 --> 02:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
represent thank you for your expertise
 
02:11:34.830 --> 02:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
and for taking my question so can this
 
02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
is just agree disagree and then we could
 
02:11:40.390 --> 02:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
get into it at a subsequent time but do
 
02:11:43.310 --> 02:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
you agree or disagree with the the
 
02:11:45.950 --> 02:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
provision that would disallow a
 
02:11:48.149 --> 02:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
programmable medium of
 
02:11:52.669 --> 02:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
exchange um essentially prohibiting a
 
02:11:57.310 --> 02:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
cbdc um as stated in the bill agree
 
02:11:59.510 --> 02:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
disagree with that
 
02:12:02.510 --> 02:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
provision I agree with its purpose I
 
02:12:05.629 --> 02:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
think it needs some drafting but I agree
 
02:12:09.229 --> 02:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
with the stated purpose to exclude the
 
02:12:12.030 --> 02:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
cbdcs if that's if that's responsible
 
02:12:15.390 --> 02:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
thank you responsive okay good great
 
02:12:20.030 --> 02:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much we'll see you soon
 
02:12:23.470 --> 02:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
enough uh uh as always happens if they
 
02:12:25.830 --> 02:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
wait long enough another card will
 
02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:27.709 align:start position:0%
wait long enough another card will
appear

02:12:27.709 --> 02:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
appear
 
02:12:30.069 --> 02:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
n from the business and industry
 
02:12:33.589 --> 02:12:33.599 align:start position:0%
Association in opposition to the Bill
 
02:12:36.270 --> 02:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I will take up
 
02:12:37.629 --> 02:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
hopefully less than a minute of your
 
02:12:39.830 --> 02:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
time n Grace the business and industry
 
02:12:41.870 --> 02:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
Association I won't repeat anything that
 
02:12:44.390 --> 02:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
was already said um I just want to note
 
02:12:48.109 --> 02:12:48.119 align:start position:0%
our opposition to uh State changes to
 
02:12:51.510 --> 02:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
the UCC we think are more appropriate uh
 
02:12:54.510 --> 02:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
venue is to go to the UCC panel and get
 
02:12:56.189 --> 02:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
them to make changes and bring that back
 
02:12:58.870 --> 02:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
to the legislature the point of the UCC
 
02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
of course is to provide uniform
 
02:13:04.270 --> 02:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
regulations for businesses across uh as
 
02:13:06.830 --> 02:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
much of the United States as possible
 
02:13:08.790 --> 02:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
that ensures that for a small state like
 
02:13:10.830 --> 02:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
us we have a competitive Advantage
 
02:13:14.270 --> 02:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
because we know what the regulations are
 
02:13:18.189 --> 02:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
and businesses know what to expect um so
 
02:13:20.510 --> 02:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
on this issue and any other one we would
 
02:13:22.589 --> 02:13:22.599 align:start position:0%
object to change changes at the state
 
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
level happy to take any questions if
 
02:13:25.709 --> 02:13:25.719 align:start position:0%
there are
 
02:13:28.030 --> 02:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
any fair enough thank you very much
 
02:13:30.189 --> 02:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
thank you and with that I will close the
 
02:13:31.910 --> 02:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:40.870 align:start position:0%
hearing on
427

02:13:40.870 --> 02:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:43.189 --> 02:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
and if you want to you have a hand out
 
02:13:44.549 --> 02:13:44.559 align:start position:0%
just pass it
 
02:13:46.910 --> 02:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
out the used to say the bankers
 
02:13:53.830 --> 02:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:56.270 --> 02:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
and with that you certainly will be
 
02:13:58.750 --> 02:13:58.760 align:start position:0%

bill cut to the

several businesses in the state for this
 
02:15:10.470 --> 02:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
type of legislations to assist them and
 
02:15:12.790 --> 02:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have Tom go into details
 
02:15:15.709 --> 02:15:15.719 align:start position:0%
behind that so I would say um yes it was
 
02:15:17.270 --> 02:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
a request of our office but at the
 
02:15:19.790 --> 02:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
request of people who file business uh
 
02:15:24.990 --> 02:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:28.549 --> 02:15:28.559 align:start position:0%
office uh thank you and good morning um
 
02:15:30.549 --> 02:15:30.559 align:start position:0%
the uh the bill that we have before you
 
02:15:33.709 --> 02:15:33.719 align:start position:0%
today uh is attempt to address two
 
02:15:35.589 --> 02:15:35.599 align:start position:0%
specific problems issues that we're
 
02:15:37.069 --> 02:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
we're facing here with the buiness
 
02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
registry that are not for they're not
 
02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
unique to New Hampshire um the first is
 
02:15:44.350 --> 02:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
company hijacking situations where um
 
02:15:45.870 --> 02:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
someone will go in and file an annual
 
02:15:47.549 --> 02:15:47.559 align:start position:0%
report changing the names of the
 
02:15:49.229 --> 02:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
business owners the business officers
 
02:15:52.510 --> 02:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
and directors um to uh make it appear as
 
02:15:54.310 --> 02:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
though they are in charge and therefore
 
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
they go to the bank the bank takes a
 
02:15:57.229 --> 02:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
look at our records and see oh this
 
02:15:58.589 --> 02:15:58.599 align:start position:0%
person is the president or they're not
 
02:16:00.990 --> 02:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
manager of that LLC and we use that
 
02:16:03.830 --> 02:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
public filing as a means to um take
 
02:16:06.069 --> 02:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
owners to uh to gain control of either
 
02:16:07.870 --> 02:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
business accounts or to um apply for
 
02:16:10.350 --> 02:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
loans uh we had a situation with a
 
02:16:14.229 --> 02:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
business who had a um uh who get in was
 
02:16:16.270 --> 02:16:16.280 align:start position:0%
filed um put that entity changing the
 
02:16:18.430 --> 02:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
name of the officers the individual
 
02:16:21.629 --> 02:16:21.639 align:start position:0%
involved um uh applied for for a uh a
 
02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
car loan purchased a truck and uh the uh
 
02:16:25.750 --> 02:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
the business only found out that they
 
02:16:26.990 --> 02:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
owned this truck when they got the
 
02:16:29.470 --> 02:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
payment book in the mail 30 days later
 
02:16:31.189 --> 02:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
um what we're trying to do is when when
 
02:16:34.349 --> 02:16:34.359 align:start position:0%
a business um it becomes aware that a an
 
02:16:36.509 --> 02:16:36.519 align:start position:0%
authorized filing has been submitted to
 
02:16:38.309 --> 02:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
give us the tools to be able to verify
 
02:16:40.469 --> 02:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
that that that record was indeed
 
02:16:42.429 --> 02:16:42.439 align:start position:0%
authorized and to be able to remove it
 
02:16:43.950 --> 02:16:43.960 align:start position:0%
from the public record as soon as
 
02:16:46.030 --> 02:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
possible if we receive a a sworn a
 
02:16:48.389 --> 02:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
statement from that from that business
 
02:16:50.030 --> 02:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
um the second issue we're dealing with
 
02:16:51.190 --> 02:16:51.200 align:start position:0%
which is another one that's becoming
 
02:16:53.349 --> 02:16:53.359 align:start position:0%
more frequent is what we call synthetic
 
02:16:55.589 --> 02:16:55.599 align:start position:0%
entities businesses that are set up to
 
02:16:57.429 --> 02:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
make look at they appear as though they
 
02:16:59.389 --> 02:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
are a legitimate business or an existing
 
02:17:01.750 --> 02:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
business by establishing a similar name
 
02:17:03.230 --> 02:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
using that same business as street
 
02:17:05.549 --> 02:17:05.559 align:start position:0%
address and so forth but in reality that
 
02:17:07.589 --> 02:17:07.599 align:start position:0%
business um is a separate legal any that
 
02:17:10.750 --> 02:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist um and as a result of that
 
02:17:12.750 --> 02:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
um are trying to basically trade on the
 
02:17:15.429 --> 02:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
on the on the on the existing businesses
 
02:17:17.270 --> 02:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
attributes uh it's you know locasion it
 
02:17:18.950 --> 02:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
may fool other folks into thinking that
 
02:17:20.629 --> 02:17:20.639 align:start position:0%
they are actually for example sending a
 
02:17:23.469 --> 02:17:23.479 align:start position:0%
check or or obtaining an order from a
 
02:17:25.429 --> 02:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
legitimate business but in reality that
 
02:17:27.429 --> 02:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
again that business is not a a
 
02:17:29.349 --> 02:17:29.359 align:start position:0%
legitimate entity um we've had a couple
 
02:17:30.870 --> 02:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
of situations here recently in New
 
02:17:33.870 --> 02:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um representative lose Bay who
 
02:17:36.070 --> 02:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
was our who kind of put as the primary
 
02:17:37.469 --> 02:17:37.479 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill here had a situation
 
02:17:39.429 --> 02:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
with a constituent in Dover who owned a
 
02:17:41.469 --> 02:17:41.479 align:start position:0%
restaurant and then a business was
 
02:17:44.309 --> 02:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
established um with a very similar name
 
02:17:46.910 --> 02:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
um using that same business address um
 
02:17:48.509 --> 02:17:48.519 align:start position:0%
they became aware of the of the issue
 
02:17:51.070 --> 02:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
when um they received in in their mail
 
02:17:52.629 --> 02:17:52.639 align:start position:0%
uh bank statement from chape bank
 
02:17:53.870 --> 02:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
showing that a bank account had been
 
02:17:55.910 --> 02:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
opened up in that name and then
 
02:17:57.950 --> 02:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
subsequently started to receive uh debit
 
02:17:59.830 --> 02:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
cards and other other fact that that
 
02:18:01.349 --> 02:18:01.359 align:start position:0%
they were someone was trading under that
 
02:18:04.709 --> 02:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
under that name using their address um
 
02:18:07.349 --> 02:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
the uh the folks filed a filed a uh a
 
02:18:09.070 --> 02:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
report with the uh the the police
 
02:18:12.030 --> 02:18:12.040 align:start position:0%
department it's potential situation with
 
02:18:13.750 --> 02:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
business entity theft but in reality you
 
02:18:15.270 --> 02:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
see there's not a lot that law
 
02:18:17.429 --> 02:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement can do in these situations
 
02:18:19.669 --> 02:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
we were able to trace the transactions
 
02:18:22.509 --> 02:18:22.519 align:start position:0%
based on the uh they these entities were
 
02:18:24.150 --> 02:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
filed electronically they were created
 
02:18:26.270 --> 02:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
using our using you know our website to
 
02:18:28.629 --> 02:18:28.639 align:start position:0%
go ahead and and um complete analy
 
02:18:30.950 --> 02:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
formation submit it to us make payment
 
02:18:32.629 --> 02:18:32.639 align:start position:0%
and and receive authorization that the
 
02:18:35.230 --> 02:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
filing had been completed um we trace it
 
02:18:38.349 --> 02:18:38.359 align:start position:0%
back to a to a um IP address in in in
 
02:18:42.070 --> 02:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
Brooklyn New York um and found over a
 
02:18:43.709 --> 02:18:43.719 align:start position:0%
series of time um seven or eight
 
02:18:45.150 --> 02:18:45.160 align:start position:0%
entities that were created with this
 
02:18:47.990 --> 02:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
very similar similar format um for
 
02:18:50.950 --> 02:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
existing businesses around the state um
 
02:18:52.389 --> 02:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
right now we don't have the tools to
 
02:18:54.629 --> 02:18:54.639 align:start position:0%
really address this say in terms of the
 
02:18:56.070 --> 02:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
Authority or Powers available to the
 
02:18:58.110 --> 02:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State um other than the
 
02:18:59.830 --> 02:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
Securities regulation group we're not an
 
02:19:01.790 --> 02:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement office with respect to
 
02:19:04.110 --> 02:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
corporations um the business Corporation
 
02:19:06.389 --> 02:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
act says that basically if it if it if
 
02:19:08.990 --> 02:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
it's if it uh if it's complete and if
 
02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
they permit the correct um you know
 
02:19:12.870 --> 02:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
filing fee and we can index it that
 
02:19:15.230 --> 02:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
we're required to take it and it has no
 
02:19:16.910 --> 02:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
um determination whether that that
 
02:19:19.110 --> 02:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
filing is legal or or illegal or whether
 
02:19:21.469 --> 02:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
it's authorized or unauthorized what we
 
02:19:23.230 --> 02:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
like to do is have the the ability to
 
02:19:25.870 --> 02:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
remove those types of filings um um from
 
02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
our from our records as H said that
 
02:19:29.870 --> 02:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
people look to the business registry to
 
02:19:31.910 --> 02:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
our to our website to validate the
 
02:19:33.669 --> 02:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
businesses that are are existing and
 
02:19:34.950 --> 02:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
that the information that they hope they
 
02:19:37.230 --> 02:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
can rely on is being accurate so we want
 
02:19:38.790 --> 02:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
to be able to have basically have a way
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
for us to be able to remove those those
 
02:19:42.309 --> 02:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
synthetic entities when we become aware
 
02:19:44.309 --> 02:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
of them but also with benefit of
 
02:19:46.230 --> 02:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
Technology um we're getting ready this
 
02:19:48.429 --> 02:19:48.439 align:start position:0%
year to shoot an RSP to replace our
 
02:19:50.070 --> 02:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
existing system and we know that using
 
02:19:52.429 --> 02:19:52.439 align:start position:0%
technology we can find ways to address
 
02:19:54.870 --> 02:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
the issue where people are unable to
 
02:19:56.830 --> 02:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
successfully know using the anonymity of
 
02:19:59.110 --> 02:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
the internet be able to um pretend to be
 
02:20:00.590 --> 02:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
somebody else and to trans file
 
02:20:02.309 --> 02:20:02.319 align:start position:0%
transactions with us and create entities
 
02:20:05.270 --> 02:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
that'll be used for nefarious purposes
 
02:20:06.950 --> 02:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
um the language you have here was
 
02:20:08.790 --> 02:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
substantially taken from um a
 
02:20:10.750 --> 02:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
Connecticut bill um our colleague I work
 
02:20:12.349 --> 02:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
closely with the colleagues from the
 
02:20:14.230 --> 02:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
corporation of Visions from around New
 
02:20:16.270 --> 02:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
England um and this was a language that
 
02:20:18.590 --> 02:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
they successfully passed in the uh state
 
02:20:21.710 --> 02:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
of Connecticut uh came effective January
 
02:20:25.150 --> 02:20:25.160 align:start position:0%
1st of this year um I'd be happy to take
 
02:20:26.429 --> 02:20:26.439 align:start position:0%
you through the bill if if you would
 
02:20:27.590 --> 02:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
like me to do that or we can wait till
 
02:20:29.309 --> 02:20:29.319 align:start position:0%
we do that in sub commmittee but yeah
 
02:20:31.270 --> 02:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
we'll do that committee yeah um so
 
02:20:32.349 --> 02:20:32.359 align:start position:0%
basically that's that's that's the
 
02:20:33.510 --> 02:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
intention of the bill that's what we're
 
02:20:35.469 --> 02:20:35.479 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish here and be happy
 
02:20:36.830 --> 02:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions that you might
 
02:20:38.870 --> 02:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
have about the bill or about these
 
02:20:40.670 --> 02:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
individual um situations that have
 
02:20:42.070 --> 02:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
occurred that we're trying to trying to
 
02:20:44.510 --> 02:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
withdraw address representative Sal has
 
02:20:46.750 --> 02:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
a question thank you chair for taking my
 
02:20:49.790 --> 02:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
question my question is when we form the
 
02:20:52.630 --> 02:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
company we give all kind of information
 
02:20:55.469 --> 02:20:55.479 align:start position:0%
to the Secretary of State and you guys
 
02:20:59.349 --> 02:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
verify the data and then give us a uh
 
02:21:01.469 --> 02:21:01.479 align:start position:0%
authorization to work for any
 
02:21:03.510 --> 02:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
businessman we have a good standing
 
02:21:06.349 --> 02:21:06.359 align:start position:0%
certificate which you guys provide so
 
02:21:08.670 --> 02:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
during that process do you not validate
 
02:21:08.680 --> 02:21:10.429 align:start position:0%
during that process do you not validate
these

02:21:10.429 --> 02:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:21:12.910 --> 02:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
things thank you that that is correct we
 
02:21:15.790 --> 02:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
do not um folks do not have to present
 
02:21:17.550 --> 02:21:17.560 align:start position:0%
identification to us when they complete
 
02:21:18.870 --> 02:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
a form and to file it with us whether
 
02:21:21.670 --> 02:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
they do it online or in person um so
 
02:21:23.870 --> 02:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
yeah currently there is no validation
 
02:21:25.750 --> 02:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
that's the when the business
 
02:21:28.469 --> 02:21:28.479 align:start position:0%
corporations were previously statutes
 
02:21:30.469 --> 02:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
were created obviously the the um prior
 
02:21:32.870 --> 02:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
to the 1970s when you were to form a
 
02:21:34.670 --> 02:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
business file anything with us the
 
02:21:36.910 --> 02:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
signatures had to be notorized and
 
02:21:38.790 --> 02:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
notarization came off of these forms
 
02:21:40.230 --> 02:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
back in the 80s when we started to
 
02:21:41.670 --> 02:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
computerize wanted to make it simpler
 
02:21:43.469 --> 02:21:43.479 align:start position:0%
and easier for folks to be able to
 
02:21:45.510 --> 02:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
complete electronic transactions and so
 
02:21:47.830 --> 02:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
with that the the ability the duty to
 
02:21:50.110 --> 02:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
verify who that individual was um was
 
02:21:51.750 --> 02:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
removed from the statute So currently we
 
02:21:54.990 --> 02:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:58.349 --> 02:21:58.359 align:start position:0%
are representative baros thank you just
 
02:21:59.870 --> 02:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
a quick question thanks for taking my
 
02:22:01.990 --> 02:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
question do you know how prevalent this
 
02:22:04.349 --> 02:22:04.359 align:start position:0%
is I mean this is really identity fraud
 
02:22:06.270 --> 02:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
do you know how prevalent it is in New
 
02:22:09.750 --> 02:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um the the item the situations
 
02:22:11.429 --> 02:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
which been reported to us so far have
 
02:22:13.429 --> 02:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
been I'd say probably I'm fully aware of
 
02:22:15.110 --> 02:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
probably it's happened a couple dozen
 
02:22:17.230 --> 02:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
times here in the last two
 
02:22:21.630 --> 02:22:21.640 align:start position:0%
years so um is someone who has some
 
02:22:23.950 --> 02:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
corporations registered and and a
 
02:22:27.190 --> 02:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
nonprofit too um I know that the front
 
02:22:30.270 --> 02:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
in the front end I have to have a login
 
02:22:33.710 --> 02:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
to be able to get in to go and change
 
02:22:36.230 --> 02:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
that so did some people somehow were
 
02:22:39.469 --> 02:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
able to get that person's initial loog
 
02:22:42.349 --> 02:22:42.359 align:start position:0%
what their login information is or can
 
02:22:44.309 --> 02:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
somebody can crash the system and get
 
02:22:46.830 --> 02:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
get in there and then start changing the
 
02:22:46.840 --> 02:22:47.630 align:start position:0%
get in there and then start changing the
the

02:22:47.630 --> 02:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:22:49.710 --> 02:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
membership the logins are tied
 
02:22:51.309 --> 02:22:51.319 align:start position:0%
specifically to a individual user
 
02:22:52.790 --> 02:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
account they're not tied to the business
 
02:22:54.630 --> 02:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
entities that they may be filing against
 
02:22:56.510 --> 02:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
so anyone could create
 
02:22:59.750 --> 02:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
an a quick start account um and then
 
02:23:02.070 --> 02:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
file documents against any other other
 
02:23:04.030 --> 02:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
other entity types right one of the
 
02:23:05.429 --> 02:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
things that we're envisioning in our in
 
02:23:07.870 --> 02:23:07.880 align:start position:0%
our our next system is that if a user
 
02:23:09.150 --> 02:23:09.160 align:start position:0%
just like yourself personally if you
 
02:23:11.270 --> 02:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
want to lock down your your credit file
 
02:23:12.309 --> 02:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
means that you can do that with the
 
02:23:14.950 --> 02:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
credit bureaus when someone forms an LLC
 
02:23:16.230 --> 02:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
with us if they wanted to lock down
 
02:23:17.750 --> 02:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
their record provide them with unique
 
02:23:19.510 --> 02:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
pin they they have to present each time
 
02:23:21.429 --> 02:23:21.439 align:start position:0%
they follow a document that we provide a
 
02:23:23.309 --> 02:23:23.319 align:start position:0%
way that we could the annual I'm
 
02:23:25.030 --> 02:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
thinking in terms of the I have to do it
 
02:23:27.429 --> 02:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
annually you know correct come January 1
 
02:23:29.630 --> 02:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
I got my you know notifications used to
 
02:23:31.750 --> 02:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
be the little card but now we get get
 
02:23:34.670 --> 02:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
the email notifications and I duly log
 
02:23:38.590 --> 02:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
in and I and but I never thought realize
 
02:23:40.870 --> 02:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
that that anybody else could log in and
 
02:23:42.590 --> 02:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
then get access
 
02:23:45.550 --> 02:23:45.560 align:start position:0%
to the my the corporate entity that I'm
 
02:23:48.190 --> 02:23:48.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to be representing other words
 
02:23:51.670 --> 02:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
is it is not TI when I when I create
 
02:23:54.910 --> 02:23:54.920 align:start position:0%
that account it doesn't say I'm the only
 
02:23:58.190 --> 02:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
person who can then change the uh the
 
02:24:02.510 --> 02:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
board membership it does not oh that's
 
02:24:05.349 --> 02:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
a you got to fix
 
02:24:08.070 --> 02:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
that that's a little
 
02:24:10.469 --> 02:24:10.479 align:start position:0%
scary indicated the fact that said that
 
02:24:14.750 --> 02:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
the the also the uh um fraud is not been
 
02:24:16.670 --> 02:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
a dramatic problem as they said the vast
 
02:24:18.070 --> 02:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
majority of our our businesses are
 
02:24:19.469 --> 02:24:19.479 align:start position:0%
legitimate they they they attempt to
 
02:24:21.910 --> 02:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
file prop most folks in fact when they
 
02:24:23.870 --> 02:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
register file their their inter report
 
02:24:25.830 --> 02:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
if there's been no changes they're not
 
02:24:27.710 --> 02:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
required to to log in only if they want
 
02:24:29.110 --> 02:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
to make changes do they have to actually
 
02:24:31.990 --> 02:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
log in past year but you every year I
 
02:24:35.710 --> 02:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
got to log in to pay my my fee um yes I
 
02:24:37.469 --> 02:24:37.479 align:start position:0%
said if you if you have if you have any
 
02:24:38.710 --> 02:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
information that you need to change
 
02:24:40.349 --> 02:24:40.359 align:start position:0%
otherwise if you if you have no changes
 
02:24:43.389 --> 02:24:43.399 align:start position:0%
to make you can simply um provide your
 
02:24:45.630 --> 02:24:45.640 align:start position:0%
credit card what what I'm saying is is
 
02:24:48.429 --> 02:24:48.439 align:start position:0%
that that that my you have my
 
02:24:50.469 --> 02:24:50.479 align:start position:0%
identification because I'm that personal
 
02:24:54.070 --> 02:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
log in wouldn't you make sense to that I
 
02:24:57.510 --> 02:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
be limited to access to be able to
 
02:24:59.790 --> 02:24:59.800 align:start position:0%
change any of the corporations to the
 
02:25:03.150 --> 02:25:03.160 align:start position:0%
ones that I am officially registered to
 
02:25:05.190 --> 02:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
I said that's that's one one scenario
 
02:25:06.670 --> 02:25:06.680 align:start position:0%
that we're envisioning we could provided
 
02:25:09.190 --> 02:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
with with our our next system it make my
 
02:25:11.309 --> 02:25:11.319 align:start position:0%
life easier too because if I just log in
 
02:25:14.230 --> 02:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
and then pulls up my list then I can by
 
02:25:16.630 --> 02:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
a Bing b boom and take care of all of
 
02:25:20.550 --> 02:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
them that I have rather than rather than
 
02:25:24.030 --> 02:25:24.040 align:start position:0%
you know I unfortunately have several
 
02:25:27.070 --> 02:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
logins well me to your point being that
 
02:25:28.790 --> 02:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
there is that is certainly that that's
 
02:25:30.429 --> 02:25:30.439 align:start position:0%
that's one approach the thing is often
 
02:25:33.230 --> 02:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
time we find too is that um an attorney
 
02:25:34.830 --> 02:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
or a Service Company like Legal Zoom
 
02:25:36.870 --> 02:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
will create your B your business for you
 
02:25:38.790 --> 02:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
then after the first year you may or may
 
02:25:40.150 --> 02:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
not still have them as your registered
 
02:25:42.870 --> 02:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
agent um you may want them to do your
 
02:25:45.910 --> 02:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
compliance for you you may not um the if
 
02:25:47.429 --> 02:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
if you're doing a transaction with your
 
02:25:49.230 --> 02:25:49.240 align:start position:0%
attorney and your the per legal needs to
 
02:25:52.030 --> 02:25:52.040 align:start position:0%
go in and file an a M that sort of stuff
 
02:25:53.910 --> 02:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
there in the end there were users who
 
02:25:55.870 --> 02:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
were who would have a valid reason to go
 
02:25:57.230 --> 02:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
in and file documents against that
 
02:26:00.030 --> 02:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
entity so the login doesn't prevent
 
02:26:03.190 --> 02:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
others um from doing so but we said we
 
02:26:04.910 --> 02:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
could provate a model where you could
 
02:26:07.030 --> 02:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
you could control access to that well at
 
02:26:09.389 --> 02:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
least nothing else is that that I get
 
02:26:11.510 --> 02:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
notification that somebody else logged
 
02:26:12.870 --> 02:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
into that
 
02:26:15.389 --> 02:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
account logged in made a change and they
 
02:26:17.630 --> 02:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
say did were you the one who did this I
 
02:26:19.309 --> 02:26:19.319 align:start position:0%
mean Google does it to me all the time
 
02:26:21.349 --> 02:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
every time I read do a computer or
 
02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
something like that it it sends me a
 
02:26:25.190 --> 02:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
notice and say by the way some you know
 
02:26:26.910 --> 02:26:26.920 align:start position:0%
we just noticed that you had a new
 
02:26:28.710 --> 02:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
person just a new person logged into
 
02:26:31.309 --> 02:26:31.319 align:start position:0%
your account yes sir our system does do
 
02:26:33.110 --> 02:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
that that that for if you someone
 
02:26:34.950 --> 02:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
someone files that that that an report
 
02:26:37.590 --> 02:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
filing on your entity if you provided us
 
02:26:39.230 --> 02:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
with a we call a business notification
 
02:26:41.349 --> 02:26:41.359 align:start position:0%
email that email is notified that a
 
02:26:43.429 --> 02:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
filing has filed against that business
 
02:26:45.440 --> 02:26:45.450 align:start position:0%
okay feel a little
 
02:26:45.450 --> 02:26:46.990 align:start position:0%
okay feel a little
[Laughter]

02:26:46.990 --> 02:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:26:49.230 --> 02:26:49.240 align:start position:0%
better okay we'll take it up in
 
02:26:51.190 --> 02:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee oh we do have a question
 
02:26:54.750 --> 02:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
yes representa Pell so um I'm looking at
 
02:26:57.110 --> 02:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
enables the Secretary of State to verify
 
02:26:58.630 --> 02:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
and prevent fraudulent business
 
02:27:01.030 --> 02:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
formations are you now saying that you
 
02:27:03.389 --> 02:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
want to require the Secretary of State
 
02:27:05.910 --> 02:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
to take these um verification they are
 
02:27:08.190 --> 02:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
the secretary state that's who they are
 
02:27:09.990 --> 02:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
right but are you go is this a
 
02:27:12.990 --> 02:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
requirement now going
 
02:27:14.870 --> 02:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
forward I would just say this is
 
02:27:17.670 --> 02:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
enabling and and not for every single
 
02:27:19.190 --> 02:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
transaction that comes through our
 
02:27:21.309 --> 02:27:21.319 align:start position:0%
department we're not going they don't
 
02:27:22.870 --> 02:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
they don't have the same relationship
 
02:27:24.670 --> 02:27:24.680 align:start position:0%
with the Attorney General's office that
 
02:27:27.070 --> 02:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
most of our departments have so they're
 
02:27:29.469 --> 02:27:29.479 align:start position:0%
they do everything by Statute so the
 
02:27:31.710 --> 02:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
statute needs to Clearly say they have
 
02:27:34.950 --> 02:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
the right to take misinformation down
 
02:27:37.269 --> 02:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
okay okay whereas most departments would
 
02:27:39.150 --> 02:27:39.160 align:start position:0%
contact the AG's office and the ag
 
02:27:42.429 --> 02:27:42.439 align:start position:0%
office could so that's why the um Bill
 
02:27:46.030 --> 02:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
States on page two in line 15 and 23
 
02:27:48.590 --> 02:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
they may verify data or may take the
 
02:27:50.550 --> 02:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
following measures and are not requ Reed
 
02:27:53.710 --> 02:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
to to do that correct May versus sh
 
02:27:56.190 --> 02:27:56.200 align:start position:0%
correct yes and and I will say there is
 
02:27:58.269 --> 02:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
a process currently in law but it's a
 
02:28:00.269 --> 02:28:00.279 align:start position:0%
very lengthy process where letters have
 
02:28:02.670 --> 02:28:02.680 align:start position:0%
to be mailed to the address we have to
 
02:28:06.150 --> 02:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
wait for a return um letter to come to
 
02:28:10.230 --> 02:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
us from the post office and 60 days Tom
 
02:28:11.830 --> 02:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
can go into more in the subcommittee
 
02:28:13.990 --> 02:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
hearing but I got Pony Express
 
02:28:16.190 --> 02:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
delivering mail to me in ring
 
02:28:19.950 --> 02:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
so okay great thank you very much all
 
02:28:22.389 --> 02:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
right we will close the public
 
02:28:26.070 --> 02:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
hearing oh NCH I'm sorry sorry sorry
 
02:28:28.349 --> 02:28:28.359 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry okay reopen the public
 
02:28:35.110 --> 02:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:38.429 --> 02:28:38.439 align:start position:0%
concerns yes Mr chair uh n GRA with Bia
 
02:28:42.469 --> 02:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
again um I can put my comments in a
 
02:28:44.590 --> 02:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
letter and email that or an email and
 
02:28:45.870 --> 02:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
send that out to the committee this
 
02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon if that would be easier and
 
02:28:50.190 --> 02:28:50.200 align:start position:0%
you'll show up to the subcommittee yes
 
02:28:51.630 --> 02:28:51.640 align:start position:0%
and that's I think at this point what
 
02:28:52.950 --> 02:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
we're asking for because we have a
 
02:28:54.990 --> 02:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
number of questions with the language of
 
02:28:56.750 --> 02:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
this bill uh we certainly don't object
 
02:28:59.190 --> 02:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
to the point let's take care of the Bad
 
02:29:01.910 --> 02:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
actors but at the same time um just
 
02:29:03.230 --> 02:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
based on how it's drafted we have a
 
02:29:05.670 --> 02:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
number of questions you got two weeks to
 
02:29:08.269 --> 02:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
work with Tom and get it figured out I
 
02:29:10.429 --> 02:29:10.439 align:start position:0%
got it I'll give my people the deadline
 
02:29:12.870 --> 02:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you okay now
 
02:29:15.030 --> 02:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
I'll close the public
 
02:29:15.040 --> 02:29:16.670 align:start position:0%
I'll close the public
hearing

02:29:16.670 --> 02:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:29:21.790 --> 02:29:21.800 align:start position:0%
406 and so what are we we're half an
 
02:29:25.389 --> 02:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
hour behind schedule okay so um let's
 
02:29:49.030 --> 02:29:49.040 align:start position:0%

03:39:13.550 --> 03:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr
 
03:39:16.630 --> 03:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
chair thank the committee MERS for
 
03:39:19.870 --> 03:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
taking my bill under advisement for the
 
03:39:22.229 --> 03:39:22.239 align:start position:0%
record I think I represent the largest
 
03:39:24.830 --> 03:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
florial in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:39:26.550 --> 03:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
it's it consists of the towns of Hollis
 
03:39:28.990 --> 03:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
Brookline Mason and Greenville no
 
03:39:31.229 --> 03:39:31.239 align:start position:0%
there's been there's more it's almost
 
03:39:33.389 --> 03:39:33.399 align:start position:0%
it's almost the same size of our Senator
 
03:39:35.950 --> 03:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
except it your Senator includes ringe
 
03:39:38.110 --> 03:39:38.120 align:start position:0%
and part of nashille so it's a big
 
03:39:41.950 --> 03:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
District yes um I'm presenting uh House
 
03:39:43.229 --> 03:39:43.239 align:start position:0%
Bill uh
 
03:39:49.269 --> 03:39:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:52.189 --> 03:39:52.199 align:start position:0%
conversation act like the mic is is my
 
03:39:54.830 --> 03:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
friend in your mouth yes
 
03:39:57.189 --> 03:39:57.199 align:start position:0%
no so you'll remember a number of years
 
03:39:59.750 --> 03:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
ago we spoke about insurance companies
 
03:40:01.790 --> 03:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh requiring healthc care providers to
 
03:40:04.070 --> 03:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
have additional training and this is
 
03:40:06.429 --> 03:40:06.439 align:start position:0%
training over and above what their uh
 
03:40:10.550 --> 03:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
colleges and um um their what would be
 
03:40:13.150 --> 03:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
internships it was board certified was
 
03:40:15.550 --> 03:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
the the magic word they are through the
 
03:40:18.389 --> 03:40:18.399 align:start position:0%
oplc be board certified right and the
 
03:40:21.790 --> 03:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
oplc also gives them their licenses so
 
03:40:25.030 --> 03:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
what happened was um I had a dentist
 
03:40:27.990 --> 03:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
that I had through an Anthem policy of
 
03:40:28.000 --> 03:40:29.389 align:start position:0%
that I had through an Anthem policy of
Medicare

03:40:29.389 --> 03:40:29.399 align:start position:0%
Medicare
 
03:40:32.110 --> 03:40:32.120 align:start position:0%
Advantage and that insurance company
 
03:40:36.790 --> 03:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
told my dentist that um he can't be
 
03:40:39.269 --> 03:40:39.279 align:start position:0%
certified with them until he has his
 
03:40:45.710 --> 03:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:47.990 --> 03:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
so in other words the teeth of that
 
03:40:50.030 --> 03:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
group is different than all of ours I
 
03:40:53.790 --> 03:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
guess I have no idea but um he refused
 
03:40:55.710 --> 03:40:55.720 align:start position:0%
because he had four
 
03:40:57.710 --> 03:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
locations so the cost would have been
 
03:40:57.720 --> 03:40:58.550 align:start position:0%
locations so the cost would have been
very

03:40:58.550 --> 03:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
very
 
03:41:00.870 --> 03:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
prohibitive and I know Mr chairman how
 
03:41:03.110 --> 03:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
much you hate putting costs back to the
 
03:41:04.349 --> 03:41:04.359 align:start position:0%
insurance companies because the
 
03:41:06.550 --> 03:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
insurance companies always hit the
 
03:41:10.189 --> 03:41:10.199 align:start position:0%
insured with it makes sense that's by
 
03:41:14.110 --> 03:41:14.120 align:start position:0%
law under Obamacare okay however when
 
03:41:15.670 --> 03:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
they want something and it's not
 
03:41:17.349 --> 03:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
required for the certification or the
 
03:41:19.990 --> 03:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
licensing or the approval of the healthc
 
03:41:21.910 --> 03:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
care provider I thought it' be
 
03:41:23.469 --> 03:41:23.479 align:start position:0%
reasonable that they pay for it and
 
03:41:25.910 --> 03:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
spread the cost of that requirement over
 
03:41:29.229 --> 03:41:29.239 align:start position:0%
the entire country instead of maybe the
 
03:41:31.070 --> 03:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
people in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:41:33.550 --> 03:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
because if they didn't get reimbursed
 
03:41:35.590 --> 03:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
and did do the program that cost would
 
03:41:40.389 --> 03:41:40.399 align:start position:0%
be bored by the the the patient or um if
 
03:41:43.429 --> 03:41:43.439 align:start position:0%
they um they didn't do it they would
 
03:41:45.269 --> 03:41:45.279 align:start position:0%
have to go to a different dentist doctor
 
03:41:48.750 --> 03:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
or whatever healthc care provider so it
 
03:41:51.990 --> 03:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
really put the the consumer in a in a
 
03:41:55.429 --> 03:41:55.439 align:start position:0%
conundrum you can not go to and go to
 
03:41:57.349 --> 03:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
different doctor dentist who have got a
 
03:42:01.469 --> 03:42:01.479 align:start position:0%
lot of faith in or you can get a
 
03:42:03.870 --> 03:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
different insurance company I guess or
 
03:42:05.950 --> 03:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
you can pay for the insurance in the
 
03:42:08.030 --> 03:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
with the dentist doctor that you have
 
03:42:10.870 --> 03:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
faith in so I thought that was wrong
 
03:42:13.429 --> 03:42:13.439 align:start position:0%
because ultimately is it's the insurance
 
03:42:16.030 --> 03:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
company that's making these requests or
 
03:42:18.309 --> 03:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
demands on the healthc care provider and
 
03:42:21.550 --> 03:42:21.560 align:start position:0%
I feel that they should pay for it now a
 
03:42:24.030 --> 03:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
couple things was is when when I first
 
03:42:26.269 --> 03:42:26.279 align:start position:0%
approached this with you Mr chairman I
 
03:42:29.110 --> 03:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't find where in law I could put
 
03:42:33.389 --> 03:42:33.399 align:start position:0%
this but thank goodness for the O OS
 
03:42:35.269 --> 03:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
they found this Managed Care provision
 
03:42:39.149 --> 03:42:39.159 align:start position:0%
which is what most hmos are and it fit
 
03:42:41.469 --> 03:42:41.479 align:start position:0%
right in there
 
03:42:44.429 --> 03:42:44.439 align:start position:0%
perfectly so I also want to uh talk
 
03:42:47.189 --> 03:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
about the fiscal note here which when I
 
03:42:49.550 --> 03:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
read it I was like going did they really
 
03:42:53.950 --> 03:42:53.960 align:start position:0%
write this because they talk about first
 
03:42:57.149 --> 03:42:57.159 align:start position:0%
of all they avoid the uh oplc as the uh
 
03:43:00.670 --> 03:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
licensing of healthc care providers and
 
03:43:02.630 --> 03:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
it's almost like they're putting the
 
03:43:05.349 --> 03:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
demand on the insurance companies and
 
03:43:06.710 --> 03:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
it's the actually the other way around
 
03:43:07.990 --> 03:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
is the insurance companies put the
 
03:43:10.309 --> 03:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
demands on the healthcare provider and
 
03:43:11.990 --> 03:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
they have no licensing provision they
 
03:43:14.389 --> 03:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
have the certification provision as as
 
03:43:17.309 --> 03:43:17.319 align:start position:0%
far as being the approved healthc care
 
03:43:19.710 --> 03:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
provider but they have nothing to do
 
03:43:21.630 --> 03:43:21.640 align:start position:0%
with the state approval as it relates to
 
03:43:21.640 --> 03:43:22.389 align:start position:0%
with the state approval as it relates to
their

03:43:22.389 --> 03:43:22.399 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:43:25.269 --> 03:43:25.279 align:start position:0%
licensing so I was thinking well they
 
03:43:27.590 --> 03:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
didn't do a lot of research on that one
 
03:43:28.710 --> 03:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
because I talked to a number of
 
03:43:31.550 --> 03:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
Physicians even remember Joe
 
03:43:35.110 --> 03:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
Hannah yeah he he was just downstairs at
 
03:43:38.990 --> 03:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
a marijuana uh not a
 
03:43:41.910 --> 03:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
surprise and I asked him and he
 
03:43:43.830 --> 03:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
confirmed that the licensing is D done
 
03:43:46.670 --> 03:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
by the certified body in the state and
 
03:43:48.950 --> 03:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
really the insurance company is just and
 
03:43:52.269 --> 03:43:52.279 align:start position:0%
and again again I'm I'm using a little
 
03:43:54.910 --> 03:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
um stretch here but I think if they can
 
03:43:56.990 --> 03:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
approve the price of the service you'll
 
03:43:58.750 --> 03:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
get approved unless you have some type
 
03:44:02.030 --> 03:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
of bad history but like malpractice and
 
03:44:05.910 --> 03:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
things like that so with that I'm I I I
 
03:44:08.830 --> 03:44:08.840 align:start position:0%
will gladly accept your hurdles thrown
 
03:44:08.840 --> 03:44:10.469 align:start position:0%
will gladly accept your hurdles thrown
at

03:44:10.469 --> 03:44:10.479 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:44:13.670 --> 03:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
me represent Spears has a
 
03:44:16.790 --> 03:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
question the example that you use was
 
03:44:21.630 --> 03:44:21.640 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage yes mhm uh I don't
 
03:44:23.469 --> 03:44:23.479 align:start position:0%
think we have that much control over
 
03:44:23.479 --> 03:44:24.670 align:start position:0%
think we have that much control over
Medicare

03:44:24.670 --> 03:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
Medicare
 
03:44:27.149 --> 03:44:27.159 align:start position:0%
Advantage I mean we can't it's not like
 
03:44:29.830 --> 03:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
we can legislate against those guys do
 
03:44:32.590 --> 03:44:32.600 align:start position:0%
you have any example of an insurance
 
03:44:34.269 --> 03:44:34.279 align:start position:0%
company within the state that's under
 
03:44:36.710 --> 03:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
the control of the state well my policy
 
03:44:38.149 --> 03:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your question my
 
03:44:40.750 --> 03:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
policy happened to be through the the
 
03:44:42.990 --> 03:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
plan and I and I didn't send um I don't
 
03:44:45.149 --> 03:44:45.159 align:start position:0%
think a a complaint to them maybe I did
 
03:44:47.830 --> 03:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure in typical fashion I
 
03:44:48.990 --> 03:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
probably didn't hear anything from
 
03:44:54.389 --> 03:44:54.399 align:start position:0%
Anthem but um the um the reality is if
 
03:44:56.229 --> 03:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
they have to comply with the state law
 
03:44:57.630 --> 03:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
because they're licensed in the state of
 
03:45:00.990 --> 03:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so um and I know I know
 
03:45:02.070 --> 03:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
what you're saying it's because I have a
 
03:45:04.269 --> 03:45:04.279 align:start position:0%
background in insurance too but if the
 
03:45:08.269 --> 03:45:08.279 align:start position:0%
policy is paid for by Medicare then I
 
03:45:10.229 --> 03:45:10.239 align:start position:0%
think it's a little different than the
 
03:45:12.550 --> 03:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
the the the the laws within the state in
 
03:45:16.990 --> 03:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:20.229 --> 03:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:25.910 --> 03:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
420j is uh as far as I know that is the
 
03:45:25.920 --> 03:45:27.550 align:start position:0%
420j is uh as far as I know that is the
small

03:45:27.550 --> 03:45:27.560 align:start position:0%
small
 
03:45:32.510 --> 03:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
employer fully insured it does not
 
03:45:37.349 --> 03:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
include um Medicare supplemental it's
 
03:45:42.070 --> 03:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
420j is our Managed Care statute so it
 
03:45:45.030 --> 03:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
only technically as far as I know but we
 
03:45:46.750 --> 03:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
we have some people from well when you
 
03:45:48.750 --> 03:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
put it might know better than I do but
 
03:45:50.830 --> 03:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
when you put it into to a
 
03:45:52.710 --> 03:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee which hopefully won't be
 
03:45:54.389 --> 03:45:54.399 align:start position:0%
next week because I won't be here but
 
03:45:56.590 --> 03:45:56.600 align:start position:0%
I'll gladly it will have to be two weeks
 
03:45:57.990 --> 03:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
from now that' be wonderful I'll be more
 
03:45:59.750 --> 03:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
than happy to do whatever research is on
 
03:46:01.389 --> 03:46:01.399 align:start position:0%
that and you bring up a good point
 
03:46:03.429 --> 03:46:03.439 align:start position:0%
representative I I I know I have
 
03:46:08.550 --> 03:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
contacted uh was it CPM uh CMS yes on
 
03:46:10.550 --> 03:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
other other issues I'm not sure if it
 
03:46:13.269 --> 03:46:13.279 align:start position:0%
dealt with Anthem or not but I'm glad
 
03:46:14.670 --> 03:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
that it's being recorded forever and
 
03:46:14.680 --> 03:46:17.030 align:start position:0%
that it's being recorded forever and
ever

03:46:17.030 --> 03:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:20.750 --> 03:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
forever representative am Mr chair thank
 
03:46:23.269 --> 03:46:23.279 align:start position:0%
you representative for your testimony um
 
03:46:24.830 --> 03:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to wrap my head around the
 
03:46:27.550 --> 03:46:27.560 align:start position:0%
concept of this bill it sounds like this
 
03:46:29.990 --> 03:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
could be considered an unfunded mandate
 
03:46:32.349 --> 03:46:32.359 align:start position:0%
from the insurance companies onto the
 
03:46:35.070 --> 03:46:35.080 align:start position:0%
providers is that a correct loose
 
03:46:37.550 --> 03:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
understanding of it high level yeah I
 
03:46:39.229 --> 03:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I I I didn't
 
03:46:41.110 --> 03:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
really think about that but yeah I guess
 
03:46:43.349 --> 03:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
if if they want to it's a pay for play
 
03:46:45.229 --> 03:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
right if you if you pay then you
 
03:46:47.269 --> 03:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
continue doing business with I would
 
03:46:50.349 --> 03:46:50.359 align:start position:0%
imagine the largest insurer of the state
 
03:46:52.110 --> 03:46:52.120 align:start position:0%
so yeah it would be pay or play or it
 
03:46:55.229 --> 03:46:55.239 align:start position:0%
would be uh unfunded
 
03:46:57.309 --> 03:46:57.319 align:start position:0%
yep representative
 
03:47:00.229 --> 03:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
Bros thank you for taking my question I
 
03:47:01.309 --> 03:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
I first of all I want to make sure I
 
03:47:03.670 --> 03:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
understood you you seem to be saying
 
03:47:06.590 --> 03:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
that credentialing uh these Insurance
 
03:47:08.429 --> 03:47:08.439 align:start position:0%
these insurance companies is a quick
 
03:47:10.870 --> 03:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
thing is that is that what you implied
 
03:47:13.110 --> 03:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
no I'm just saying is they're asking for
 
03:47:15.870 --> 03:47:15.880 align:start position:0%
training of these the physicians in this
 
03:47:18.070 --> 03:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
case a dentist that isn't part of the
 
03:47:20.229 --> 03:47:20.239 align:start position:0%
certification to become a dentist or a
 
03:47:22.389 --> 03:47:22.399 align:start position:0%
doctor in the state of New Hampshire and
 
03:47:24.189 --> 03:47:24.199 align:start position:0%
they want the the professional to pay
 
03:47:26.429 --> 03:47:26.439 align:start position:0%
for it and I'm just saying is if they
 
03:47:28.389 --> 03:47:28.399 align:start position:0%
want it that if the insurance companies
 
03:47:30.510 --> 03:47:30.520 align:start position:0%
want this type of training from the
 
03:47:32.229 --> 03:47:32.239 align:start position:0%
doctor that's not required for the
 
03:47:37.510 --> 03:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:40.269 --> 03:47:40.279 align:start position:0%
thanks wasn't there a question over
 
03:47:43.469 --> 03:47:43.479 align:start position:0%
here so uh we do have other people going
 
03:47:46.550 --> 03:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
to come in but um in
 
03:47:50.429 --> 03:47:50.439 align:start position:0%
my I guess my my little experience
 
03:47:55.950 --> 03:47:55.960 align:start position:0%
here this what this was SE was about
 
03:47:58.950 --> 03:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
was a insurance
 
03:47:58.960 --> 03:48:01.910 align:start position:0%
was a insurance
company

03:48:01.910 --> 03:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
company
 
03:48:06.269 --> 03:48:06.279 align:start position:0%
um had had uh maybe rejected someone to
 
03:48:07.670 --> 03:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
be in their
 
03:48:11.070 --> 03:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
network uh and
 
03:48:15.269 --> 03:48:15.279 align:start position:0%
um because the
 
03:48:19.510 --> 03:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
insurance company required had certain
 
03:48:23.149 --> 03:48:23.159 align:start position:0%
requirements and it says uh
 
03:48:26.550 --> 03:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
solely okay said solely because of their
 
03:48:28.149 --> 03:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
meet the health carers credential
 
03:48:28.159 --> 03:48:30.590 align:start position:0%
meet the health carers credential
verification

03:48:30.590 --> 03:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
verification
 
03:48:32.830 --> 03:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
standards what you were describing as a
 
03:48:34.990 --> 03:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
training course not really a ver you
 
03:48:37.309 --> 03:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
know a certification but this was go
 
03:48:39.830 --> 03:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
back to where I was saying being board
 
03:48:42.389 --> 03:48:42.399 align:start position:0%
certified and this is about getting in
 
03:48:45.830 --> 03:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
the network Okay so so I want you to
 
03:48:49.030 --> 03:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
first know is that not everybody every
 
03:48:51.590 --> 03:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
healthc care provider can get into a
 
03:48:55.870 --> 03:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
network okay correct y that they the the
 
03:48:57.910 --> 03:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
healthc care provider the the insurance
 
03:48:59.110 --> 03:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
company can
 
03:49:01.830 --> 03:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
decide who how many people or whether
 
03:49:03.990 --> 03:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
they have enough people in their Network
 
03:49:08.950 --> 03:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
and therefore met the uh Network
 
03:49:11.149 --> 03:49:11.159 align:start position:0%
standard so they that they had were had
 
03:49:13.990 --> 03:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
enough people in the network can I
 
03:49:16.830 --> 03:49:16.840 align:start position:0%
respond to that Mr chairman sure most of
 
03:49:19.149 --> 03:49:19.159 align:start position:0%
the time in talking to other you know
 
03:49:21.790 --> 03:49:21.800 align:start position:0%
Health Care Professionals the basis is
 
03:49:24.469 --> 03:49:24.479 align:start position:0%
on money in other words we will do the
 
03:49:26.429 --> 03:49:26.439 align:start position:0%
business we'll cover the insurance at x
 
03:49:28.790 --> 03:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
amount of dollars and that covers you
 
03:49:30.229 --> 03:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
know what the insurance companies want
 
03:49:33.750 --> 03:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
to pay so and in this case too the
 
03:49:36.309 --> 03:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
example that I gave you was not really
 
03:49:38.349 --> 03:49:38.359 align:start position:0%
an issue on training it was their social
 
03:49:41.469 --> 03:49:41.479 align:start position:0%
score their social Equity score on you
 
03:49:44.070 --> 03:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
know their ESG score we got we have that
 
03:49:47.349 --> 03:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
as a separate Bill talk about so in this
 
03:49:50.309 --> 03:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
case this case the issue because you
 
03:49:52.469 --> 03:49:52.479 align:start position:0%
were talking about money and and you're
 
03:49:55.189 --> 03:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely right it is about money uh we
 
03:49:56.750 --> 03:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
have uh we have in this committee we
 
03:49:59.189 --> 03:49:59.199 align:start position:0%
have the ambulance issue oh God and the
 
03:50:01.469 --> 03:50:01.479 align:start position:0%
ambulance issue is that the ambulance
 
03:50:04.349 --> 03:50:04.359 align:start position:0%
providers refuse to sign a contract
 
03:50:05.950 --> 03:50:05.960 align:start position:0%
because they want to back bill they want
 
03:50:07.429 --> 03:50:07.439 align:start position:0%
to get all their money they don't want
 
03:50:09.590 --> 03:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
to take that lower amount that that's
 
03:50:12.910 --> 03:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
agreed upon so it is true that an
 
03:50:14.870 --> 03:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
insurance company says okay it's all
 
03:50:16.469 --> 03:50:16.479 align:start position:0%
about the money you say this is what we
 
03:50:18.870 --> 03:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
want you to do and you have to decide
 
03:50:21.030 --> 03:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
whether you're willing to accept that or
 
03:50:23.149 --> 03:50:23.159 align:start position:0%
you decide that you don't want to be a
 
03:50:24.870 --> 03:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
provider for them right which I've
 
03:50:26.309 --> 03:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
always heard that was the reason why
 
03:50:26.319 --> 03:50:27.229 align:start position:0%
always heard that was the reason why
most

03:50:27.229 --> 03:50:27.239 align:start position:0%
most
 
03:50:31.070 --> 03:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
dentists didn't do too much
 
03:50:34.510 --> 03:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
uh your network but most denst it's all
 
03:50:37.149 --> 03:50:37.159 align:start position:0%
about Delta dentle correct yeah okay but
 
03:50:39.950 --> 03:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
in this case the fact that you dropped
 
03:50:43.950 --> 03:50:43.960 align:start position:0%
in this sentence into that statute it's
 
03:50:46.630 --> 03:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
a little it it's it does it doesn't
 
03:50:49.469 --> 03:50:49.479 align:start position:0%
really flow normally it's not really
 
03:50:52.349 --> 03:50:52.359 align:start position:0%
they're like two different subjects um
 
03:50:55.429 --> 03:50:55.439 align:start position:0%
in terms of paying
 
03:50:58.189 --> 03:50:58.199 align:start position:0%
for those certification paying for what
 
03:51:00.110 --> 03:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
no that's there's no reason why an
 
03:51:02.070 --> 03:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
insurance company would pay
 
03:51:04.710 --> 03:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
for standards or certifications or
 
03:51:06.670 --> 03:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
justifications the issue would be
 
03:51:11.149 --> 03:51:11.159 align:start position:0%
normally you would say is that that you
 
03:51:13.349 --> 03:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
that they didn't offer you a contract
 
03:51:17.070 --> 03:51:17.080 align:start position:0%
they didn't offer do business with him
 
03:51:20.110 --> 03:51:20.120 align:start position:0%
because U of his
 
03:51:24.110 --> 03:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
credentialing but CR but taking having
 
03:51:27.149 --> 03:51:27.159 align:start position:0%
this uh back this course and having his
 
03:51:30.349 --> 03:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
employees take that course that
 
03:51:33.870 --> 03:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't it's not credentialing anyways
 
03:51:37.110 --> 03:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
okay well so what I do want to say is
 
03:51:38.550 --> 03:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
because I always like to take this as an
 
03:51:41.030 --> 03:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to educate people about
 
03:51:44.590 --> 03:51:44.600 align:start position:0%
premiums about premiums so premiums
 
03:51:46.990 --> 03:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
thanks to Obamacare or Affordable Care
 
03:51:52.309 --> 03:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
Act premiums are are the they're are
 
03:51:55.030 --> 03:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely governed by what the
 
03:51:57.429 --> 03:51:57.439 align:start position:0%
insurance company pays
 
03:52:02.950 --> 03:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
out so if if a pay a provider
 
03:52:06.030 --> 03:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
anything that goes into the basis which
 
03:52:07.790 --> 03:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
they do a three-year ruling average
 
03:52:09.510 --> 03:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
correct and that will determine the
 
03:52:11.710 --> 03:52:11.720 align:start position:0%
premium and if there if there are less
 
03:52:13.950 --> 03:52:13.960 align:start position:0%
claims then there's a refund given to
 
03:52:16.110 --> 03:52:16.120 align:start position:0%
the insur no that's that's old news
 
03:52:18.830 --> 03:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
there's no refunds anymore I got one
 
03:52:20.389 --> 03:52:20.399 align:start position:0%
right now we're talking about how they
 
03:52:22.309 --> 03:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
how they set the premiums now what would
 
03:52:25.030 --> 03:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
be interested is is to say is oh no this
 
03:52:28.189 --> 03:52:28.199 align:start position:0%
should be an obligation of the of the
 
03:52:30.870 --> 03:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
remaining 10% which is what the manag
 
03:52:33.309 --> 03:52:33.319 align:start position:0%
care company has for their profit you
 
03:52:34.990 --> 03:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
know profits and marketing and
 
03:52:37.269 --> 03:52:37.279 align:start position:0%
advertising and okay and and paying for
 
03:52:39.229 --> 03:52:39.239 align:start position:0%
their employees and the salaries for
 
03:52:43.910 --> 03:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
their CEOs but which it this it I have
 
03:52:46.070 --> 03:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
no idea what this would go but I just
 
03:52:47.870 --> 03:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to say is this is totally
 
03:52:50.710 --> 03:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
disjointed in where it's located in the
 
03:52:53.030 --> 03:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
statute um I stand corrected because we
 
03:52:55.469 --> 03:52:55.479 align:start position:0%
Rely Upon Our faithful OS people to do
 
03:52:57.429 --> 03:52:57.439 align:start position:0%
it I think they found looked and they
 
03:52:58.590 --> 03:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
thought it would be a good place to put
 
03:53:00.550 --> 03:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
it nice place to put it let me also add
 
03:53:03.469 --> 03:53:03.479 align:start position:0%
too to the comment that you had
 
03:53:06.670 --> 03:53:06.680 align:start position:0%
um businesses don't like to tell other
 
03:53:08.469 --> 03:53:08.479 align:start position:0%
businesses how to run their
 
03:53:11.630 --> 03:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
business in other words um let's use an
 
03:53:13.149 --> 03:53:13.159 align:start position:0%
example of say the insurance company
 
03:53:14.590 --> 03:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
said that they had to be trained on a
 
03:53:17.830 --> 03:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
certain type of Medical Care before they
 
03:53:19.870 --> 03:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
could be approved well then they find
 
03:53:21.590 --> 03:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
out that the medical care that they're
 
03:53:24.349 --> 03:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
telling them to learn about and do
 
03:53:26.630 --> 03:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
causes more harm than
 
03:53:29.990 --> 03:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
good the defense the doctor could have
 
03:53:31.790 --> 03:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
was well the insurance company told us
 
03:53:33.990 --> 03:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
to do it and they wouldn't certify us
 
03:53:35.550 --> 03:53:35.560 align:start position:0%
until they did it in other words there's
 
03:53:38.269 --> 03:53:38.279 align:start position:0%
some liability that when someone tells
 
03:53:40.510 --> 03:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
somebody to do something is inherent
 
03:53:42.550 --> 03:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
liability I've never heard of that
 
03:53:44.110 --> 03:53:44.120 align:start position:0%
before that an insurance company would
 
03:53:46.830 --> 03:53:46.840 align:start position:0%
tell somebody what to do that well I
 
03:53:50.189 --> 03:53:50.199 align:start position:0%
just cited you one no this is this
 
03:53:54.670 --> 03:53:54.680 align:start position:0%
is this is I Mr chair can I just would
 
03:53:54.680 --> 03:53:55.790 align:start position:0%
is this is I Mr chair can I just would
you

03:53:55.790 --> 03:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:53:58.030 --> 03:53:58.040 align:start position:0%
believe okay let's say they tell
 
03:53:59.870 --> 03:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
somebody they have to have some certain
 
03:54:02.750 --> 03:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
kind of training I don't see it as being
 
03:54:06.030 --> 03:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
um a potential harm to a to a patient
 
03:54:08.229 --> 03:54:08.239 align:start position:0%
because they have to have hospital
 
03:54:11.309 --> 03:54:11.319 align:start position:0%
privileges to do certain things they're
 
03:54:12.990 --> 03:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
not going to just be allowed to do
 
03:54:15.070 --> 03:54:15.080 align:start position:0%
whatever you know what ever they have to
 
03:54:17.790 --> 03:54:17.800 align:start position:0%
be privileged to do it and that's goes
 
03:54:19.070 --> 03:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
through their credential L from the
 
03:54:20.870 --> 03:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
hospital side correct there's no doubt
 
03:54:22.630 --> 03:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
about it but but they they all also
 
03:54:24.670 --> 03:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
suggest another drug but they will
 
03:54:26.630 --> 03:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
suggest it if you're on a prescription
 
03:54:28.229 --> 03:54:28.239 align:start position:0%
but they won't demand it because they
 
03:54:31.710 --> 03:54:31.720 align:start position:0%
don't know the entire patient history so
 
03:54:34.110 --> 03:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying is yeah but the the the
 
03:54:35.750 --> 03:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
the the healthc care provider has to
 
03:54:38.510 --> 03:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
have some latitude but this the example
 
03:54:40.189 --> 03:54:40.199 align:start position:0%
that I gave where they told them that
 
03:54:41.710 --> 03:54:41.720 align:start position:0%
they needed this training which had no
 
03:54:43.149 --> 03:54:43.159 align:start position:0%
bearing on the service they were
 
03:54:46.830 --> 03:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
providing um had you know the doctor or
 
03:54:48.189 --> 03:54:48.199 align:start position:0%
the healthcare provider would have to
 
03:54:50.070 --> 03:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
have the burden of paying for four
 
03:54:52.630 --> 03:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
offices to get that training someone's
 
03:54:54.269 --> 03:54:54.279 align:start position:0%
got to pay for that but I was responding
 
03:54:55.590 --> 03:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
to you're saying that it could be
 
03:54:57.830 --> 03:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
dangerous to the patient and and I don't
 
03:55:00.309 --> 03:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
see that at
 
03:55:03.830 --> 03:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
all thank you oh well we have more
 
03:55:07.389 --> 03:55:07.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:10.710 --> 03:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
Teresa so I think uh uh thank thank you
 
03:55:12.990 --> 03:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
chairman for letting me ask the question
 
03:55:15.870 --> 03:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
and thanks for taking a question
 
03:55:19.309 --> 03:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
so I guess based on we had most of the
 
03:55:22.510 --> 03:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
times uh the insurance company and the
 
03:55:24.469 --> 03:55:24.479 align:start position:0%
provider when they don't agree on free
 
03:55:26.630 --> 03:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
structure that's the reason they reject
 
03:55:28.750 --> 03:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
now do you based on what you have
 
03:55:32.389 --> 03:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
presented have you seen a lot of uh
 
03:55:35.670 --> 03:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
instances where the insurance companies
 
03:55:38.790 --> 03:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
talks about uh some training or
 
03:55:40.750 --> 03:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
processes to be followed besides the
 
03:55:43.030 --> 03:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
licensing requirement by the state and
 
03:55:47.790 --> 03:55:47.800 align:start position:0%
based on that there turning down the
 
03:55:50.229 --> 03:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
provider I'm just understand that what
 
03:55:53.189 --> 03:55:53.199 align:start position:0%
actually prompted you to bring this well
 
03:55:55.429 --> 03:55:55.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um well I've
 
03:55:56.950 --> 03:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
had firsthand experience in this one
 
03:55:58.910 --> 03:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
instance where they were asking for what
 
03:56:01.710 --> 03:56:01.720 align:start position:0%
I felt was ridiculous training uh
 
03:56:04.469 --> 03:56:04.479 align:start position:0%
because like I said the Chairman's teeth
 
03:56:05.950 --> 03:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
and my teeth are all made by the same
 
03:56:07.229 --> 03:56:07.239 align:start position:0%
material and we should probably have the
 
03:56:09.030 --> 03:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
same number although probably lost a few
 
03:56:11.790 --> 03:56:11.800 align:start position:0%
myself but um it it really had no
 
03:56:14.349 --> 03:56:14.359 align:start position:0%
bearing on the services to be provided
 
03:56:15.870 --> 03:56:15.880 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to make sure that it didn't
 
03:56:18.110 --> 03:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
happen to anybody else and better yet is
 
03:56:20.950 --> 03:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to do something um for
 
03:56:23.950 --> 03:56:23.960 align:start position:0%
the health care provider that wouldn't
 
03:56:27.429 --> 03:56:27.439 align:start position:0%
be in the normal scope of things um then
 
03:56:29.510 --> 03:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be shouldn't be asked or if
 
03:56:31.870 --> 03:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
they want it they should pay for it
 
03:56:34.830 --> 03:56:34.840 align:start position:0%
follow the question you mean I follow
 
03:56:37.429 --> 03:56:37.439 align:start position:0%
up so I mean that's one instance my
 
03:56:40.070 --> 03:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
question was more like have you seen
 
03:56:43.030 --> 03:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
many instances of this and can you be
 
03:56:44.950 --> 03:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
more specific what kind of training
 
03:56:47.590 --> 03:56:47.600 align:start position:0%
meanings uh they ask and they reject
 
03:56:50.349 --> 03:56:50.359 align:start position:0%
based on that Provider Services well the
 
03:56:52.269 --> 03:56:52.279 align:start position:0%
only time you'll hear about it is when
 
03:56:54.830 --> 03:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
the doctor is denied what would you call
 
03:56:57.469 --> 03:56:57.479 align:start position:0%
it the refus refuse certification or
 
03:57:00.269 --> 03:57:00.279 align:start position:0%
whatever okay so in my case because of
 
03:57:03.309 --> 03:57:03.319 align:start position:0%
my background too um they shared it with
 
03:57:06.429 --> 03:57:06.439 align:start position:0%
me and they shared me why and uh I I
 
03:57:08.269 --> 03:57:08.279 align:start position:0%
thought that was unacceptable now my
 
03:57:10.750 --> 03:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
primary care physician is part of the St
 
03:57:13.429 --> 03:57:13.439 align:start position:0%
Joseph's system and right now St
 
03:57:15.910 --> 03:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
Joseph's battle with Anthem and they're
 
03:57:18.189 --> 03:57:18.199 align:start position:0%
not willing to pay them but I don't know
 
03:57:19.990 --> 03:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
the specific details of that but I do
 
03:57:22.910 --> 03:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
know that they had three times they went
 
03:57:25.710 --> 03:57:25.720 align:start position:0%
to get uh adjustments to their pay scale
 
03:57:27.189 --> 03:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
and they've been denied but other
 
03:57:29.910 --> 03:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals were only denied after twice
 
03:57:32.349 --> 03:57:32.359 align:start position:0%
so yeah there's only so much you can get
 
03:57:34.030 --> 03:57:34.040 align:start position:0%
from these healthc Care Professionals
 
03:57:35.950 --> 03:57:35.960 align:start position:0%
because you don't want to get they don't
 
03:57:37.990 --> 03:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
want to share the the problems in the
 
03:57:40.149 --> 03:57:40.159 align:start position:0%
back room but in this case they did and
 
03:57:42.269 --> 03:57:42.279 align:start position:0%
I thought it was totally unacceptable
 
03:57:44.550 --> 03:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
that that's my healthcare provider had
 
03:57:46.309 --> 03:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
to take that special training which had
 
03:57:49.070 --> 03:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
no bearing on my teeth okay and have to
 
03:57:50.550 --> 03:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
pay for it
 
03:57:52.990 --> 03:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
themselves okay represent
 
03:57:57.630 --> 03:57:57.640 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair um the training
 
03:57:59.429 --> 03:57:59.439 align:start position:0%
that you referred to that your dentist
 
03:58:02.469 --> 03:58:02.479 align:start position:0%
was being told he had to uh provide for
 
03:58:05.429 --> 03:58:05.439 align:start position:0%
his employees uh that wouldn't actually
 
03:58:08.750 --> 03:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
be a certification but it would be a
 
03:58:12.830 --> 03:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
program um under the language uh in your
 
03:58:14.910 --> 03:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
bill wouldn't that be correct that's
 
03:58:16.269 --> 03:58:16.279 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to get yeah but the
 
03:58:17.790 --> 03:58:17.800 align:start position:0%
chairman tells me it's not in the right
 
03:58:19.389 --> 03:58:19.399 align:start position:0%
place so in the sub when the
 
03:58:20.950 --> 03:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meets I'll try to find the
 
03:58:22.429 --> 03:58:22.439 align:start position:0%
right place and we'll make that change
 
03:58:25.790 --> 03:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
but yes it would be a program it would a
 
03:58:28.710 --> 03:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
training program sure yeah thank you
 
03:58:31.229 --> 03:58:31.239 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much it's always
 
03:58:32.830 --> 03:58:32.840 align:start position:0%
great to see you Mr chairman always a
 
03:58:34.309 --> 03:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
pleasure to seeing you
 
03:58:36.469 --> 03:58:36.479 align:start position:0%
jack okay the chair will calling
 
03:58:38.590 --> 03:58:38.600 align:start position:0%
Michelle Heen from the the Hampshire
 
03:58:41.630 --> 03:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
insurance department who takes no
 
03:58:59.309 --> 03:58:59.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:00.830 --> 03:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon for the record my name is
 
03:59:02.269 --> 03:59:02.279 align:start position:0%
Michelle Heaton I'm the director of Life
 
03:59:03.550 --> 03:59:03.560 align:start position:0%
and Health at the New Hampshire
 
03:59:06.870 --> 03:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
insurance department um we take no
 
03:59:08.309 --> 03:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
position on this bill but we just like
 
03:59:11.070 --> 03:59:11.080 align:start position:0%
to um highlight some of the concerns I
 
03:59:13.110 --> 03:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
think you guys have already touched on a
 
03:59:15.910 --> 03:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
lot of the issues but um the concern we
 
03:59:18.389 --> 03:59:18.399 align:start position:0%
see is with the broad language in which
 
03:59:20.830 --> 03:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
this is written um when you say any
 
03:59:22.990 --> 03:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
additional program or certification that
 
03:59:25.590 --> 03:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
is very Broad and I think could have a
 
03:59:27.750 --> 03:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
lot of unintended consequences that
 
03:59:30.429 --> 03:59:30.439 align:start position:0%
could be all different kinds of program
 
03:59:32.990 --> 03:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
and certifications that are required um
 
03:59:36.510 --> 03:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
across the healthc care system so um
 
03:59:40.189 --> 03:59:40.199 align:start position:0%
generally um our Managed Care laws do
 
03:59:43.830 --> 03:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
not set some very loose parameters about
 
03:59:46.030 --> 03:59:46.040 align:start position:0%
what needs to be in the credentialing
 
03:59:48.870 --> 03:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
process like the the provider needs to
 
03:59:50.349 --> 03:59:50.359 align:start position:0%
be licensed and there's certain on
 
03:59:51.830 --> 03:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
consumer protections that need to go in
 
03:59:54.070 --> 03:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
the contract but other than that usually
 
03:59:56.590 --> 03:59:56.600 align:start position:0%
carriers um it is their prerogative who
 
03:59:58.389 --> 03:59:58.399 align:start position:0%
they want to contract with and have part
 
04:00:00.830 --> 04:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
of their Network so that's why in doing
 
04:00:03.670 --> 04:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
our fiscal note um given the broad
 
04:00:06.229 --> 04:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
language we have um it's hard to
 
04:00:08.590 --> 04:00:08.600 align:start position:0%
quantify what type of ramifications this
 
04:00:10.469 --> 04:00:10.479 align:start position:0%
would have but it would likely increase
 
04:00:12.070 --> 04:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
premiums because there would be
 
04:00:13.349 --> 04:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
additional costs that carriers would
 
04:00:14.750 --> 04:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
have to absorb an additional
 
04:00:16.590 --> 04:00:16.600 align:start position:0%
administrative burden so I'm happy to
 
04:00:18.229 --> 04:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
04:00:22.269 --> 04:00:22.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:25.149 --> 04:00:25.159 align:start position:0%
spear in the small group and large group
 
04:00:27.670 --> 04:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
fully insured Market which is what we
 
04:00:30.429 --> 04:00:30.439 align:start position:0%
usually handle not
 
04:00:32.750 --> 04:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
Medicare in that group have you ever
 
04:00:36.030 --> 04:00:36.040 align:start position:0%
seen a complaint of this kind in the
 
04:00:39.070 --> 04:00:39.080 align:start position:0%
group that we actually can issue laws
 
04:00:42.830 --> 04:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
about no I mean we routinely get um
 
04:00:44.510 --> 04:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
inquiries and complaint about
 
04:00:46.510 --> 04:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
credentialing generally but never about
 
04:00:48.870 --> 04:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
having to take any specific type of
 
04:00:52.590 --> 04:00:52.600 align:start position:0%
course or training as a barrier to
 
04:00:54.710 --> 04:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
credentialing just a follow on on that
 
04:00:57.630 --> 04:00:57.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:01.149 --> 04:01:01.159 align:start position:0%
inquire would is there any place in our
 
04:01:03.189 --> 04:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
laws and of course I don't know them all
 
04:01:06.870 --> 04:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
but in your case you probably
 
04:01:11.070 --> 04:01:11.080 align:start position:0%
do uh where we would be able to control
 
04:01:13.710 --> 04:01:13.720 align:start position:0%
Medicare in this in this particular case
 
04:01:16.149 --> 04:01:16.159 align:start position:0%
no no so we would have nothing to do
 
04:01:17.750 --> 04:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
with this anyway yeah if we're talking
 
04:01:20.189 --> 04:01:20.199 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage um market and the
 
04:01:21.990 --> 04:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
products that were um previously being
 
04:01:23.590 --> 04:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
reference we have no regulatory
 
04:01:26.229 --> 04:01:26.239 align:start position:0%
authority over that whatsoever um and I
 
04:01:28.630 --> 04:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
know there's mention of oplc oplc sets
 
04:01:31.149 --> 04:01:31.159 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements so I don't know
 
04:01:33.189 --> 04:01:33.199 align:start position:0%
that if it's not a licensing requirement
 
04:01:34.189 --> 04:01:34.199 align:start position:0%
I don't know that that would be an
 
04:01:35.790 --> 04:01:35.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate place and again I'm not sure
 
04:01:37.590 --> 04:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
who is going to be responsible for
 
04:01:39.550 --> 04:01:39.560 align:start position:0%
paying for this if it's if it's a
 
04:01:41.550 --> 04:01:41.560 align:start position:0%
carrier requirement it would make sense
 
04:01:44.910 --> 04:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
for it to be an insurance I I guess but
 
04:01:48.550 --> 04:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
um we would suggest having um a
 
04:01:51.309 --> 04:01:51.319 align:start position:0%
much clearly def much more clearly
 
04:01:54.269 --> 04:01:54.279 align:start position:0%
defined um definition as to what exactly
 
04:01:56.110 --> 04:01:56.120 align:start position:0%
what types of programs or certifications
 
04:02:00.590 --> 04:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
we're talking about and that again would
 
04:02:03.510 --> 04:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
um inhibit the carrier's ability to
 
04:02:05.309 --> 04:02:05.319 align:start position:0%
contract with whoever they please which
 
04:02:09.349 --> 04:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
is um kind of a key portion of
 
04:02:17.950 --> 04:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:21.750 --> 04:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
sheos no she was just giving information
 
04:02:23.990 --> 04:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
04:02:29.990 --> 04:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
info okay so Sabrina you're the
 
04:02:34.510 --> 04:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:36.550 --> 04:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
opposition but I do want to know from
 
04:02:38.469 --> 04:02:38.479 align:start position:0%
Paula how long this law has been on the
 
04:02:40.389 --> 04:02:40.399 align:start position:0%
books this
 
04:02:42.309 --> 04:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
original because we both been around
 
04:02:43.630 --> 04:02:43.640 align:start position:0%
long enough we must this must have
 
04:02:45.550 --> 04:02:45.560 align:start position:0%
happened happened under our watch I just
 
04:02:48.469 --> 04:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
don't remember it uh thank you chairman
 
04:02:50.030 --> 04:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
hunt my name is Sabrina Dunlap I'm
 
04:02:51.229 --> 04:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
director of government relations for
 
04:02:53.990 --> 04:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
Anthem I'll be brief um I will say when
 
04:02:55.309 --> 04:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
we first saw this bill we were sort of
 
04:02:56.950 --> 04:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
befuddled and confused about what it was
 
04:02:59.269 --> 04:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
trying to get at I repeat the concerns
 
04:03:01.910 --> 04:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
the insurance department already flagged
 
04:03:04.229 --> 04:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
um I do just want to note since I think
 
04:03:06.189 --> 04:03:06.199 align:start position:0%
anthem's name was invoked in sort of a
 
04:03:09.269 --> 04:03:09.279 align:start position:0%
disparaging way that um representative
 
04:03:10.910 --> 04:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
planning and did reach out to me in
 
04:03:13.870 --> 04:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
December of 2022 about this issue
 
04:03:16.149 --> 04:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
involved a third-party administrator who
 
04:03:18.269 --> 04:03:18.279 align:start position:0%
I I think Anthem must use in the
 
04:03:20.110 --> 04:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage space which is way
 
04:03:21.550 --> 04:03:21.560 align:start position:0%
outside of my realm because it is a
 
04:03:23.990 --> 04:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
federal program nonetheless I wanted to
 
04:03:26.070 --> 04:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
be helpful and so I reached out to this
 
04:03:27.830 --> 04:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
third party administrator who's not
 
04:03:30.349 --> 04:03:30.359 align:start position:0%
Anthem and I inquired about a compliance
 
04:03:32.670 --> 04:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
program that they had they told me it
 
04:03:35.710 --> 04:03:35.720 align:start position:0%
was required by federal law and they
 
04:03:37.349 --> 04:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
said we're obligated to Downstream the
 
04:03:39.229 --> 04:03:39.239 align:start position:0%
requirements for cultural and linguistic
 
04:03:41.670 --> 04:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
competency training to our staff and by
 
04:03:44.229 --> 04:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
extension our contracted providers under
 
04:03:46.389 --> 04:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
a certain federal code the material
 
04:03:48.269 --> 04:03:48.279 align:start position:0%
includes communication tips and best
 
04:03:50.229 --> 04:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
practices for servicing a diverse
 
04:03:51.990 --> 04:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
membership based on race ethnicity
 
04:03:54.830 --> 04:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
religion sex gender Etc so this was
 
04:03:56.870 --> 04:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
something this third-party non- Anthem
 
04:03:59.149 --> 04:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
entity was doing as they were required
 
04:04:02.469 --> 04:04:02.479 align:start position:0%
to by CMS I provided that information to
 
04:04:04.630 --> 04:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
representative Flanigan on December 23rd
 
04:04:07.149 --> 04:04:07.159 align:start position:0%
2022 so I just wanted to clarify that we
 
04:04:10.189 --> 04:04:10.199 align:start position:0%
had had that conversation um so I'm
 
04:04:11.950 --> 04:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions um and thank
 
04:04:16.950 --> 04:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:19.429 --> 04:04:19.439 align:start position:0%
okay you really want really quick really
 
04:04:23.110 --> 04:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
quick how do you keep notes about stuff
 
04:04:26.309 --> 04:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
like that and how are you able to find
 
04:04:29.030 --> 04:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
it thank you for the question because it
 
04:04:30.750 --> 04:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
can be helpful to pull up receipts when
 
04:04:34.269 --> 04:04:34.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:38.269 --> 04:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
you okay we close the public hearing
 
04:04:40.030 --> 04:04:40.040 align:start position:0%
this bill will go to
 
04:04:45.630 --> 04:04:45.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:48.149 --> 04:04:48.159 align:start position:0%
you uh pay attention to the calendar and
 
04:04:51.030 --> 04:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
A or B you will get notice
 
04:04:54.349 --> 04:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
from the staff when we we do it so
 
04:04:58.550 --> 04:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:03.790 --> 04:05:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:06.710 --> 04:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
okay mov right ahead
 
04:05:10.030 --> 04:05:10.040 align:start position:0%
let's take up house build
 
04:05:12.990 --> 04:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
241 and this one we have a lot more
 
04:05:15.910 --> 04:05:15.920 align:start position:0%

representing multiple
 
04:06:34.910 --> 04:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
stakeholders um working together even
 
04:06:36.950 --> 04:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
though some of us behind me May oppose
 
04:06:39.030 --> 04:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
me we've always work together and
 
04:06:41.349 --> 04:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can come to a solution on
 
04:06:43.710 --> 04:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
what's a difficult problem my name name
 
04:06:46.830 --> 04:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
is Dave Nagel I represent the town of
 
04:06:49.469 --> 04:06:49.479 align:start position:0%
gilmington um Guilford and a little bit
 
04:06:52.510 --> 04:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
of Laconia um that's not why I'm here
 
04:06:54.309 --> 04:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
I'm here because I'm a doctor I've
 
04:06:56.590 --> 04:06:56.600 align:start position:0%
worked with um people with complex
 
04:06:59.309 --> 04:06:59.319 align:start position:0%
disability my entire career pain is one
 
04:07:01.189 --> 04:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
of those disabilities I've been involved
 
04:07:02.990 --> 04:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
in Pain Care policy in this state for
 
04:07:07.790 --> 04:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
over 30 years um and I also advocated
 
04:07:09.510 --> 04:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
for people with pain for pretty much
 
04:07:12.750 --> 04:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
that entire time this is my book some of
 
04:07:14.349 --> 04:07:14.359 align:start position:0%
which will'll be talking talking about I
 
04:07:16.229 --> 04:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
was honored this book was a catharsis
 
04:07:17.830 --> 04:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
because I was angry about how we deal
 
04:07:19.670 --> 04:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
with the issue of pain in this country
 
04:07:21.189 --> 04:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
it was never meant to be anything more
 
04:07:23.830 --> 04:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
than that I was told that this was a
 
04:07:25.990 --> 04:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
Bible for people in pain so we published
 
04:07:27.750 --> 04:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
it and this book is now sold all over
 
04:07:30.349 --> 04:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
the world there are chapters on here
 
04:07:31.710 --> 04:07:31.720 align:start position:0%
that on issues that we will be
 
04:07:33.790 --> 04:07:33.800 align:start position:0%
discussing today
 
04:07:36.750 --> 04:07:36.760 align:start position:0%
um I also um want to say that I
 
04:07:39.469 --> 04:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
represent the 66 million Americans who
 
04:07:42.229 --> 04:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
suffer from chronic pain the 1.5 million
 
04:07:44.910 --> 04:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
in hospice and paliative care every year
 
04:07:47.030 --> 04:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
the 50 million who will have a surgery
 
04:07:49.030 --> 04:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
every year and the unknown tens of
 
04:07:51.389 --> 04:07:51.399 align:start position:0%
millions um who will have a moderate to
 
04:07:53.910 --> 04:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
severe pain from an acute injury one of
 
04:07:56.070 --> 04:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
the groups that I do not represent
 
04:07:58.070 --> 04:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
directly but I'm very proud of are the
 
04:08:00.550 --> 04:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
veterans of our country the incidence of
 
04:08:03.189 --> 04:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
chronic pain and and uh combat veterans
 
04:08:03.199 --> 04:08:04.030 align:start position:0%
chronic pain and and uh combat veterans
is

04:08:04.030 --> 04:08:04.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:08:07.269 --> 04:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
60% you would you need to know that the
 
04:08:09.590 --> 04:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
VA actually provides all the services
 
04:08:11.630 --> 04:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to be talking today in a
 
04:08:13.910 --> 04:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
comprehensive integrative way the
 
04:08:15.950 --> 04:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense does the same
 
04:08:17.269 --> 04:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
thing if you get injured on the
 
04:08:19.229 --> 04:08:19.239 align:start position:0%
battlefield you will get Battlefield
 
04:08:20.830 --> 04:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
acupuncture which is something that you
 
04:08:24.429 --> 04:08:24.439 align:start position:0%
need to know about so in some if you
 
04:08:26.910 --> 04:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
were in the we also found out in our
 
04:08:28.750 --> 04:08:28.760 align:start position:0%
work with my other integrative Pain Care
 
04:08:31.109 --> 04:08:31.119 align:start position:0%
committee that um hospice provides all
 
04:08:32.750 --> 04:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
these services but paliative care
 
04:08:35.670 --> 04:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
patients cannot get them so if you are
 
04:08:38.030 --> 04:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
near death or you were in combat or
 
04:08:39.750 --> 04:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
you're a veteran you can get access to
 
04:08:41.229 --> 04:08:41.239 align:start position:0%
these services that we'll be talking
 
04:08:43.469 --> 04:08:43.479 align:start position:0%
about today but if you're anybody else
 
04:08:44.469 --> 04:08:44.479 align:start position:0%
you have
 
04:08:47.750 --> 04:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
limitations um one of uh I also did you
 
04:08:50.429 --> 04:08:50.439 align:start position:0%
talk about the fiscal note the the note
 
04:08:52.990 --> 04:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
that was in it was we haven't talked
 
04:08:54.910 --> 04:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
about anything about this just the
 
04:08:57.550 --> 04:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that I saw is inaccurate um
 
04:08:59.950 --> 04:08:59.960 align:start position:0%
it it actually refers to last year's
 
04:09:02.870 --> 04:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
bill or two years ago's bill so um we
 
04:09:06.109 --> 04:09:06.119 align:start position:0%
can talk about that later um one of my
 
04:09:09.550 --> 04:09:09.560 align:start position:0%
other roles is I got asked to develop a
 
04:09:13.429 --> 04:09:13.439 align:start position:0%
pain care policy for the NFL and um that
 
04:09:15.149 --> 04:09:15.159 align:start position:0%
was a fun thing nobody had ever done
 
04:09:17.710 --> 04:09:17.720 align:start position:0%
that before for elite athletes and I was
 
04:09:20.630 --> 04:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
excited to do it this is what we came up
 
04:09:23.630 --> 04:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
with but um as the process of doing that
 
04:09:25.590 --> 04:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
I interviewed hundreds of professional
 
04:09:27.670 --> 04:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
athletes and the one thing that's true
 
04:09:29.590 --> 04:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
about every professional athlete is at
 
04:09:32.229 --> 04:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
some point they retire when they retire
 
04:09:33.710 --> 04:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
they have to live with what they've done
 
04:09:35.229 --> 04:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
to their body through the time that they
 
04:09:37.389 --> 04:09:37.399 align:start position:0%
were an athlete so one of the players
 
04:09:40.550 --> 04:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
that I worked with um who was kind of
 
04:09:42.550 --> 04:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
symbolic um he was a gentleman that
 
04:09:45.750 --> 04:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
played in the NF for 17 years was lucky
 
04:09:47.990 --> 04:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
enough in his 17th year to win a Super
 
04:09:53.229 --> 04:09:53.239 align:start position:0%
Bowl um had 17 surgeries one per year um
 
04:09:55.550 --> 04:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
and had chronic pain but while he was a
 
04:09:58.189 --> 04:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
player he was able to access a variety
 
04:10:00.469 --> 04:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
of therapies that were talking about
 
04:10:02.710 --> 04:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
specifically Chiropractic acupuncture
 
04:10:04.990 --> 04:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
massage mindfulness things like that
 
04:10:07.149 --> 04:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
that are pretty standard basic therapies
 
04:10:09.830 --> 04:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
for pain and he was able to utilize all
 
04:10:11.670 --> 04:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
these therapies and restorative I mean
 
04:10:13.309 --> 04:10:13.319 align:start position:0%
they all exercise which is really
 
04:10:15.269 --> 04:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
important he was able to utilize all
 
04:10:17.070 --> 04:10:17.080 align:start position:0%
these things and control his pain
 
04:10:19.950 --> 04:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
despite 17 years of being you know an
 
04:10:21.830 --> 04:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
athlete in a pretty rugous
 
04:10:24.429 --> 04:10:24.439 align:start position:0%
sport what he told me was that the oh
 
04:10:26.469 --> 04:10:26.479 align:start position:0%
God what he told me was that the minute
 
04:10:28.910 --> 04:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
that he retired and went to the private
 
04:10:31.349 --> 04:10:31.359 align:start position:0%
sector he didn't have access to any of
 
04:10:34.189 --> 04:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
that stuff and the soon as that happened
 
04:10:36.830 --> 04:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
at least not in a meaningful way and the
 
04:10:38.550 --> 04:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
minute that happened all of the sudden
 
04:10:40.830 --> 04:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
is he's got a peace meal everything
 
04:10:43.630 --> 04:10:43.640 align:start position:0%
together he was not like an elite player
 
04:10:45.149 --> 04:10:45.159 align:start position:0%
he was not a bubble player he was
 
04:10:46.510 --> 04:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere in between he made a good
 
04:10:49.229 --> 04:10:49.239 align:start position:0%
amount of money but not you know a lot
 
04:10:50.990 --> 04:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
and so all of a sudden he has to figure
 
04:10:52.550 --> 04:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
out how he's going to pay for this or
 
04:10:54.030 --> 04:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
not and what he told me and what we
 
04:10:55.670 --> 04:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
found out from interviewing athlete
 
04:10:57.750 --> 04:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
after athlete after athlete is that they
 
04:10:59.510 --> 04:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
frequently turn to the bar room to deal
 
04:11:02.309 --> 04:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
with their pain alcoholism is very
 
04:11:04.269 --> 04:11:04.279 align:start position:0%
common in retired athletes and that's
 
04:11:07.790 --> 04:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
what he did um the new rage is cannabis
 
04:11:09.870 --> 04:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
and I know cannabis is the you know the
 
04:11:12.109 --> 04:11:12.119 align:start position:0%
next best thing for everybody which is
 
04:11:15.269 --> 04:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
totally another story but anyways a lot
 
04:11:17.030 --> 04:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
of athletes now are using cannabis for
 
04:11:19.670 --> 04:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
that purpose which is not necessarily a
 
04:11:21.950 --> 04:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
good thing when we think we have much
 
04:11:24.590 --> 04:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
better ways to deal with this problem
 
04:11:27.510 --> 04:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
this problem doesn't just exist in
 
04:11:29.750 --> 04:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
professional sports it also exists in
 
04:11:31.149 --> 04:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
the community and that's what we're
 
04:11:35.030 --> 04:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
talking about today um to address this
 
04:11:37.870 --> 04:11:37.880 align:start position:0%
lack of access there's a couple studies
 
04:11:40.149 --> 04:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
that have been done under great taxpayer
 
04:11:41.990 --> 04:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
expense that have all come to the same
 
04:11:44.630 --> 04:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation this is you have to read
 
04:11:45.710 --> 04:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
this by tomorrow but this is the
 
04:11:49.550 --> 04:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
national pain strategy from what 2014 or
 
04:11:53.429 --> 04:11:53.439 align:start position:0%
something 16 yeah um Cindy's a genius
 
04:11:55.469 --> 04:11:55.479 align:start position:0%
back there she'll talk to you later um
 
04:11:58.710 --> 04:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
the first CDC report on um opioid
 
04:12:01.309 --> 04:12:01.319 align:start position:0%
prescribing from
 
04:12:03.710 --> 04:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
2016 um this is a report from the
 
04:12:05.309 --> 04:12:05.319 align:start position:0%
international Olympic Committee looking
 
04:12:08.910 --> 04:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
at the same issue um um Miss Steinberg
 
04:12:10.469 --> 04:12:10.479 align:start position:0%
will be talking to you later was one of
 
04:12:12.030 --> 04:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
the authors of the Health and Human
 
04:12:14.030 --> 04:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
Services best practice practices on pain
 
04:12:16.429 --> 04:12:16.439 align:start position:0%
management report released in
 
04:12:19.870 --> 04:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
2019 and then the CDC report on opioid
 
04:12:21.429 --> 04:12:21.439 align:start position:0%
prescribing in
 
04:12:23.910 --> 04:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
20122 what all these things have in
 
04:12:25.990 --> 04:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
common is one thing they say number one
 
04:12:27.910 --> 04:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
we do a rotten job of managing pain in
 
04:12:29.670 --> 04:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
this country number two what we do it's
 
04:12:32.109 --> 04:12:32.119 align:start position:0%
not cost effective at all and number
 
04:12:34.750 --> 04:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
three it we must provide access to a
 
04:12:37.030 --> 04:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
number of these therapies alternative
 
04:12:39.070 --> 04:12:39.080 align:start position:0%
therapies or whatever and that is the
 
04:12:41.109 --> 04:12:41.119 align:start position:0%
conclusion from all these studies at the
 
04:12:44.550 --> 04:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
federal level so it's important
 
04:12:47.590 --> 04:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
um if the VA can do it and the dod can
 
04:12:49.590 --> 04:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
do it the question then becomes how can
 
04:12:52.630 --> 04:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
we do it and the NFL can do it too
 
04:12:55.030 --> 04:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
although they make more money than we do
 
04:12:56.750 --> 04:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
um the purpose of this bill was
 
04:12:59.670 --> 04:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
basically to resolve this issue um when
 
04:13:01.149 --> 04:13:01.159 align:start position:0%
you look through the bill there's three
 
04:13:03.389 --> 04:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
parts to the bill the first part is a
 
04:13:05.269 --> 04:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
preamble and I would ask that you read
 
04:13:08.910 --> 04:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
that um it basically gives why this bill
 
04:13:12.950 --> 04:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
is important um we are harming people
 
04:13:14.750 --> 04:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
with with our failure to treat people in
 
04:13:16.790 --> 04:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
pain we have a suicide watch that we
 
04:13:19.630 --> 04:13:19.640 align:start position:0%
maintain it's become significantly worse
 
04:13:21.710 --> 04:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
since the opioid crisis because now
 
04:13:24.109 --> 04:13:24.119 align:start position:0%
patients can't get access to opioids so
 
04:13:25.870 --> 04:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
they have to go to other things and
 
04:13:27.710 --> 04:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
everybody's saying you need this you
 
04:13:29.950 --> 04:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
need that you need this Chiropractic
 
04:13:31.830 --> 04:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
acupuncture massage whatever but then we
 
04:13:33.710 --> 04:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
don't provide it in any meaningful way
 
04:13:34.950 --> 04:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
so all of the sudden they're left in
 
04:13:37.109 --> 04:13:37.119 align:start position:0%
limbo and they go to the streets to get
 
04:13:39.389 --> 04:13:39.399 align:start position:0%
their pain managed and that's not very
 
04:13:42.830 --> 04:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
often a good thing um the second part of
 
04:13:45.550 --> 04:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
the Bill lists a series of interventions
 
04:13:47.389 --> 04:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
and this is the most fun part of this
 
04:13:48.830 --> 04:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
bill for me because we work with the
 
04:13:50.830 --> 04:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
insurers to come up with this
 
04:13:53.590 --> 04:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
list one of the conclusions that we made
 
04:13:56.109 --> 04:13:56.119 align:start position:0%
is that any any service to be provided
 
04:13:58.149 --> 04:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
needed to be provided by a licensed
 
04:14:01.590 --> 04:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
provider using reasonable evidence base
 
04:14:03.670 --> 04:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
so there is decent evidence base on
 
04:14:05.750 --> 04:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
acupuncture the medical acupuncture
 
04:14:10.269 --> 04:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
prati um evidence project lists
 
04:14:14.349 --> 04:14:14.359 align:start position:0%
117 um um medical indications for
 
04:14:17.030 --> 04:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
acupuncture that have evidence um the
 
04:14:19.149 --> 04:14:19.159 align:start position:0%
second part is chiropractic Amy
 
04:14:21.149 --> 04:14:21.159 align:start position:0%
Goldstein from the alliance to advance
 
04:14:22.510 --> 04:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
comprehensive integrative pain
 
04:14:24.189 --> 04:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
management delivered a report to our
 
04:14:25.950 --> 04:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
integrative Pain Care Committee in which
 
04:14:29.590 --> 04:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
she outlined um the Chiropractic is
 
04:14:31.670 --> 04:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
actually the most coste effective way of
 
04:14:34.109 --> 04:14:34.119 align:start position:0%
dealing with acute back pain guess who's
 
04:14:36.790 --> 04:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
the least effective cost effective spine
 
04:14:39.590 --> 04:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
surgeon guess to where most patients go
 
04:14:41.670 --> 04:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
spine surgeon makes absolutely no sense
 
04:14:43.269 --> 04:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
but that is what happens in prac
 
04:14:46.269 --> 04:14:46.279 align:start position:0%
practice um and then the third thing is
 
04:14:48.950 --> 04:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
that it's in section five of each of the
 
04:14:50.550 --> 04:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
there's two different Parts Group and
 
04:14:52.269 --> 04:14:52.279 align:start position:0%
accidental insurance they're basically
 
04:14:55.429 --> 04:14:55.439 align:start position:0%
the same thing but Roman numeral 5 I
 
04:14:57.149 --> 04:14:57.159 align:start position:0%
think is really poorly worded I'd be
 
04:14:59.070 --> 04:14:59.080 align:start position:0%
happy to work with you on it um I've
 
04:15:00.710 --> 04:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
never been very comfortable but the
 
04:15:03.910 --> 04:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
point of that is this I'm very concerned
 
04:15:05.750 --> 04:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
about the way we use evidence base and
 
04:15:08.229 --> 04:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
defining what we're going to pay for so
 
04:15:11.030 --> 04:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
for example um the the bar is very
 
04:15:12.670 --> 04:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
different for an alternative therapy
 
04:15:15.269 --> 04:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
than is for a quote allopathic therapy
 
04:15:17.910 --> 04:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
for example there is virtually no
 
04:15:20.149 --> 04:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
evidence to support the use of pedical
 
04:15:23.269 --> 04:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
screw fixation and spine surgery for
 
04:15:26.109 --> 04:15:26.119 align:start position:0%
anything the morbidity after that
 
04:15:29.389 --> 04:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
procedure is tragic the outcomes are not
 
04:15:31.149 --> 04:15:31.159 align:start position:0%
tremendously good it doesn't mean that
 
04:15:33.389 --> 04:15:33.399 align:start position:0%
nobody does well but the surgery is done
 
04:15:35.550 --> 04:15:35.560 align:start position:0%
way too often Without Really sufficient
 
04:15:37.349 --> 04:15:37.359 align:start position:0%
indications and that the alome data
 
04:15:40.830 --> 04:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
stinks but we pay for that at the same
 
04:15:43.030 --> 04:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
point we have really good evidence to
 
04:15:45.149 --> 04:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
support Chiropractic for acut to back
 
04:15:47.590 --> 04:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
pain cognitive behavioral therapy is a
 
04:15:49.590 --> 04:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
psychological therapy which really
 
04:15:52.229 --> 04:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
should be doing in almost everybody with
 
04:15:54.149 --> 04:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
you know evolving chronic pain to
 
04:15:56.550 --> 04:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
chronic pain and we have good evidence
 
04:15:58.670 --> 04:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
for those but we don't pay for them and
 
04:16:01.030 --> 04:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
I want to give you one example I am an
 
04:16:03.389 --> 04:16:03.399 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist I basically retired from
 
04:16:04.910 --> 04:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
that the minute I helped create the
 
04:16:08.109 --> 04:16:08.119 align:start position:0%
medical acupuncture Practice Act and I
 
04:16:11.750 --> 04:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
we allowed non-physicians to do it um I
 
04:16:13.550 --> 04:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
have one patient I've treated for 30
 
04:16:15.710 --> 04:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
years on a monthly basis her cumulative
 
04:16:17.750 --> 04:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
bill over 30 years is less than the cost
 
04:16:20.510 --> 04:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
of one spine surgery and that's making
 
04:16:22.550 --> 04:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
the Assumption your medical care stops
 
04:16:26.469 --> 04:16:26.479 align:start position:0%
after that spine surgery it continues so
 
04:16:29.149 --> 04:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
I wanted to create language that would
 
04:16:30.870 --> 04:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
mandate I'm sorry about using the word
 
04:16:32.910 --> 04:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
mandate a Level Playing Field in how we
 
04:16:35.269 --> 04:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
apply evidence base I know that's a
 
04:16:39.510 --> 04:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
dirty word but I said it um anyways I
 
04:16:41.630 --> 04:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
think that's almost everything I just
 
04:16:45.469 --> 04:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
want to conclude with one one thing
 
04:16:47.229 --> 04:16:47.239 align:start position:0%
anybody here was a
 
04:16:50.990 --> 04:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
parent anybody ever spanked their kid I
 
04:16:52.670 --> 04:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
always had a oh yeah you're not going to
 
04:16:55.990 --> 04:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
admit it publicly I know so um I I had a
 
04:16:58.790 --> 04:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
three strike rule with my kids you know
 
04:17:01.109 --> 04:17:01.119 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're admonished once if
 
04:17:02.510 --> 04:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
you don't do it you're admonished a
 
04:17:04.469 --> 04:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
little louder the third time is a quick
 
04:17:07.429 --> 04:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
smack on the butt right we've been here
 
04:17:09.950 --> 04:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
a lot to talk about this issue and I you
 
04:17:11.590 --> 04:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
know not to say anything negative about
 
04:17:13.750 --> 04:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
my insurance friends but it's time that
 
04:17:15.550 --> 04:17:15.560 align:start position:0%
we really need to start acting on
 
04:17:17.990 --> 04:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
creating cost-effective integrative care
 
04:17:20.070 --> 04:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
and we're not doing it and this is an
 
04:17:22.030 --> 04:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity it's a template to do it
 
04:17:23.750 --> 04:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
that I want to work with you on and so
 
04:17:25.950 --> 04:17:25.960 align:start position:0%
if this is a third strike and a Pat in
 
04:17:29.590 --> 04:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
the butt that's fine with me um and one
 
04:17:32.030 --> 04:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
last thing so I sorry always one last
 
04:17:33.950 --> 04:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
thing last year I brought you a bill on
 
04:17:35.870 --> 04:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
prior authorization reform that we all
 
04:17:38.469 --> 04:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
worked on together right we had a
 
04:17:41.910 --> 04:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
wonderful time um and and it was a great
 
04:17:43.990 --> 04:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
experience and and the best part about
 
04:17:47.590 --> 04:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
it is when we sat down um our bill when
 
04:17:50.990 --> 04:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
taken in uh with Federal legislation the
 
04:17:52.670 --> 04:17:52.680 align:start position:0%
Congressional budget office which I know
 
04:17:54.349 --> 04:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
is never wrong said that we would save
 
04:17:58.109 --> 04:17:58.119 align:start position:0%
$15 billion per year in terms of health
 
04:18:01.590 --> 04:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
care cost by doing that I think I'm
 
04:18:03.790 --> 04:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
pretty sure and and my friend back there
 
04:18:05.750 --> 04:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
will will give you more data on this
 
04:18:07.790 --> 04:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
that we will save money doing this and
 
04:18:10.349 --> 04:18:10.359 align:start position:0%
we will also have less morbidity maybe
 
04:18:14.750 --> 04:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
less mortality at the same time any
 
04:18:18.109 --> 04:18:18.119 align:start position:0%
questions okay representative
 
04:18:21.309 --> 04:18:21.319 align:start position:0%
s thank you for coming in taking my
 
04:18:24.429 --> 04:18:24.439 align:start position:0%
question uh I'm just curious I mean I
 
04:18:26.349 --> 04:18:26.359 align:start position:0%
didn't I don't think it would be in here
 
04:18:27.950 --> 04:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
but you cite a lot of things and how
 
04:18:30.510 --> 04:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
this would be all cost effective but is
 
04:18:33.429 --> 04:18:33.439 align:start position:0%
there is there good estimates like you
 
04:18:36.349 --> 04:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
know because it
 
04:18:40.030 --> 04:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
might and be clear like even if costs go
 
04:18:41.189 --> 04:18:41.199 align:start position:0%
up doesn't doesn't mean we shouldn't
 
04:18:43.710 --> 04:18:43.720 align:start position:0%
cover something but it it certainly is
 
04:18:46.269 --> 04:18:46.279 align:start position:0%
possible that cost overall could go up
 
04:18:48.510 --> 04:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
if suddenly people are getting a massive
 
04:18:49.750 --> 04:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
amount of something that they couldn't
 
04:18:51.189 --> 04:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
get before doesn't mean they shouldn't
 
04:18:52.630 --> 04:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
get it and maybe we should expand that
 
04:18:54.750 --> 04:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
but I'm just kind of curious if we're
 
04:18:57.109 --> 04:18:57.119 align:start position:0%
spending a million dollars a year on
 
04:19:00.510 --> 04:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
treating chronic pain and and we open up
 
04:19:01.790 --> 04:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
these things does that million dollars
 
04:19:03.630 --> 04:19:03.640 align:start position:0%
go to 900,000 or does it now double
 
04:19:05.750 --> 04:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
because double the patients are getting
 
04:19:07.349 --> 04:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
care I think you get my point or my
 
04:19:09.109 --> 04:19:09.119 align:start position:0%
question yeah no it's an awesome
 
04:19:11.630 --> 04:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
question um I think there's a number of
 
04:19:14.389 --> 04:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
different ways to answer that um you
 
04:19:16.429 --> 04:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
know the last number that was given at
 
04:19:18.510 --> 04:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
the cost of chronic pain per year was
 
04:19:21.630 --> 04:19:21.640 align:start position:0%
from about probably 15 years ago was
 
04:19:24.309 --> 04:19:24.319 align:start position:0%
$650 billion dollars a year chronic pain
 
04:19:26.309 --> 04:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
cost this country so it's not a trivial
 
04:19:28.389 --> 04:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
number and it's really important that we
 
04:19:30.429 --> 04:19:30.439 align:start position:0%
become substantially more efficient with
 
04:19:33.229 --> 04:19:33.239 align:start position:0%
that when we designed this bill the
 
04:19:35.189 --> 04:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
reason why we limit it to 12 was because
 
04:19:37.070 --> 04:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
of that like if you go to the VA and you
 
04:19:39.550 --> 04:19:39.560 align:start position:0%
get treated they don't limit it to 12
 
04:19:41.790 --> 04:19:41.800 align:start position:0%
you know you get what you need and you
 
04:19:44.510 --> 04:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
know it's obviously a different setting
 
04:19:46.710 --> 04:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
than than you know the medical world is
 
04:19:49.910 --> 04:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
but but that is why we limited it to 12
 
04:19:51.830 --> 04:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
the third thing is there's a challenge
 
04:19:54.469 --> 04:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
that I've delivered to my friends back
 
04:19:57.990 --> 04:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
there on several times I go you know we
 
04:20:00.349 --> 04:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
have a uh an epidemic of pills and
 
04:20:03.229 --> 04:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
procedures that are very expensive I'm
 
04:20:05.710 --> 04:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
an Interventional spine specialist God
 
04:20:07.389 --> 04:20:07.399 align:start position:0%
only knows what that means but it means
 
04:20:09.389 --> 04:20:09.399 align:start position:0%
I use long needles to put into people's
 
04:20:10.750 --> 04:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
spines to deliver
 
04:20:13.189 --> 04:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
cortisone um I've never sat down and
 
04:20:14.510 --> 04:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
figured out how many different
 
04:20:17.790 --> 04:20:17.800 align:start position:0%
procedures we do um but they're all very
 
04:20:19.710 --> 04:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
expensive and what's they all share in
 
04:20:21.469 --> 04:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
common is there's no evidence to support
 
04:20:25.229 --> 04:20:25.239 align:start position:0%
any of them and so but we pay for that
 
04:20:27.990 --> 04:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
and then surgeries I already gave you an
 
04:20:30.189 --> 04:20:30.199 align:start position:0%
example of of a surgery that we know
 
04:20:32.590 --> 04:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't work in fact the only surgical
 
04:20:34.790 --> 04:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
intervention for pain that we have any
 
04:20:37.630 --> 04:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
clear evidence that it works without
 
04:20:39.590 --> 04:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
some of the oncology things that we do
 
04:20:43.349 --> 04:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
is um um s uh just
 
04:20:46.389 --> 04:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
um uh disc decompression for herniated
 
04:20:50.109 --> 04:20:50.119 align:start position:0%
disc that has good medium to short-term
 
04:20:52.870 --> 04:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
outcome data but after two to four years
 
04:20:54.429 --> 04:20:54.439 align:start position:0%
you're kind of back where you were it's
 
04:20:56.309 --> 04:20:56.319 align:start position:0%
not a cure in other words
 
04:20:59.189 --> 04:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
so my belief is and and this is the way
 
04:21:01.830 --> 04:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
we do everything in in medicine or we
 
04:21:03.910 --> 04:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
should be doing is we start superficial
 
04:21:05.750 --> 04:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
and inexpensive and if that's not
 
04:21:08.510 --> 04:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
working we migrate up to these other
 
04:21:10.349 --> 04:21:10.359 align:start position:0%
things and but the problem is if you
 
04:21:12.590 --> 04:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
don't pay for these things first you
 
04:21:14.429 --> 04:21:14.439 align:start position:0%
accelerate the migration to the
 
04:21:17.349 --> 04:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
expensive stuff so to some extent the
 
04:21:19.229 --> 04:21:19.239 align:start position:0%
cost savings are theoretical but I will
 
04:21:21.030 --> 04:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
tell you we I'm sorry to bring somebody
 
04:21:22.750 --> 04:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
from the VA to talk about it because a
 
04:21:24.309 --> 04:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
couple years ago we did and they did
 
04:21:25.950 --> 04:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
find that this is a lot cheaper for them
 
04:21:28.070 --> 04:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
to do it this way and patient
 
04:21:31.389 --> 04:21:31.399 align:start position:0%
satisfactions dramatically
 
04:21:33.630 --> 04:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
better repres
 
04:21:36.550 --> 04:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
buros thank you for taking my question
 
04:21:39.389 --> 04:21:39.399 align:start position:0%
um do you have um data on the efficacy
 
04:21:42.830 --> 04:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
of all of the all of the um
 
04:21:45.590 --> 04:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
methodologies that you have in the bill
 
04:21:48.309 --> 04:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
um I can get there's yes there's a
 
04:21:50.790 --> 04:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
wealth of it to be honest it's in all
 
04:21:54.630 --> 04:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
the okay in in in the um footnotes of
 
04:21:56.469 --> 04:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
all of these things here but we can get
 
04:21:59.950 --> 04:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
that to you um Cindy Cindy's back there
 
04:22:02.590 --> 04:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
Amy they're my two best friends Amy
 
04:22:05.630 --> 04:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
Goldstein uh if you want um she gave us
 
04:22:08.149 --> 04:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
a wonderful presentation Amy runs the
 
04:22:10.030 --> 04:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
alliance to advance comprehensive inte
 
04:22:13.670 --> 04:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
creative pain management which is a
 
04:22:17.389 --> 04:22:17.399 align:start position:0%
92 stake there's 92 types of stakeholder
 
04:22:20.149 --> 04:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
groups that look at this um to try to
 
04:22:22.229 --> 04:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
deal with the issue that we're dealing
 
04:22:24.710 --> 04:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
with now and she gave us a presentation
 
04:22:26.189 --> 04:22:26.199 align:start position:0%
that has a lot of that data that's where
 
04:22:27.750 --> 04:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
we got the data about the
 
04:22:30.189 --> 04:22:30.199 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic um the acupuncture evidence
 
04:22:32.389 --> 04:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
project I can give you the um the link
 
04:22:36.550 --> 04:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
for that um massage is a little bit more
 
04:22:38.590 --> 04:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
tenuous in terms of getting the data for
 
04:22:40.070 --> 04:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have some psych
 
04:22:41.670 --> 04:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
folks talking to you later that can
 
04:22:43.189 --> 04:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
probably give you that data better than
 
04:22:46.189 --> 04:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
I can but it's also in here thank you so
 
04:22:48.469 --> 04:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
if if you want I I can give you all
 
04:22:51.189 --> 04:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
these references I don't you sure I just
 
04:22:52.950 --> 04:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to know that you've looked at all
 
04:22:54.670 --> 04:22:54.680 align:start position:0%
of these yeah yeah yeah okay there's
 
04:22:56.269 --> 04:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
only two people in the world that have
 
04:22:58.149 --> 04:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
read these entire things and they're
 
04:23:00.030 --> 04:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
both in this room so I won't be one of
 
04:23:01.990 --> 04:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
them but thank you
 
04:23:03.990 --> 04:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:23:06.790 --> 04:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
representative Nel for your testimony um
 
04:23:08.030 --> 04:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to understand the bill
 
04:23:09.550 --> 04:23:09.560 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a simple explanation for
 
04:23:11.750 --> 04:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
this I'm trying to find the limiting
 
04:23:13.510 --> 04:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
factor on the mandate so we're trying to
 
04:23:16.269 --> 04:23:16.279 align:start position:0%
mandate these modalities what's the
 
04:23:18.590 --> 04:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
limiting factor and when I when I see
 
04:23:22.469 --> 04:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
page two line one that section there I
 
04:23:25.149 --> 04:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
see including but not limited
 
04:23:28.149 --> 04:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
to uh in all three of those sections and
 
04:23:30.790 --> 04:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
in the first one says and or other
 
04:23:32.469 --> 04:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
meditation training support groups and
 
04:23:34.910 --> 04:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
pain education so how what's the
 
04:23:37.550 --> 04:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
limiting factor on what what is being
 
04:23:40.429 --> 04:23:40.439 align:start position:0%
mandated good question
 
04:23:43.229 --> 04:23:43.239 align:start position:0%
um I think we I was actually I knew you
 
04:23:45.750 --> 04:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
were going to ask that question and I
 
04:23:47.510 --> 04:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
actually looked at that this morning and
 
04:23:49.790 --> 04:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
I think that we need to work on that a
 
04:23:51.670 --> 04:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
because there needs to be some limits to
 
04:23:55.189 --> 04:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
that I you know first of all our goal
 
04:23:56.950 --> 04:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
when we WR wrote these things up was
 
04:23:58.950 --> 04:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
that it had to be provided by a licensed
 
04:24:00.950 --> 04:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
provider some of these things here are
 
04:24:04.710 --> 04:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
not so um like for example you know if
 
04:24:06.590 --> 04:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
it's something that a psychologist uses
 
04:24:08.750 --> 04:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
as part of their training then that's
 
04:24:10.349 --> 04:24:10.359 align:start position:0%
what we would want to include in that
 
04:24:13.189 --> 04:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
for example they use mindfulness use
 
04:24:15.229 --> 04:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
cognitive behavioral therapy those these
 
04:24:17.189 --> 04:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
are all tools they use meditation they
 
04:24:19.349 --> 04:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
use but I think we need to specify in
 
04:24:21.590 --> 04:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
that section that it be provided by a
 
04:24:23.550 --> 04:24:23.560 align:start position:0%
licensed provider in this case it'll be
 
04:24:23.560 --> 04:24:24.510 align:start position:0%
licensed provider in this case it'll be
a

04:24:24.510 --> 04:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:24:27.630 --> 04:24:27.640 align:start position:0%
psychologist does that help yes thank
 
04:24:30.550 --> 04:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
you yeah thank you for pointing that out
 
04:24:32.030 --> 04:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
because I was looking at this morning
 
04:24:33.630 --> 04:24:33.640 align:start position:0%
and I totally agree with you that needs
 
04:24:36.070 --> 04:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
to be firmed
 
04:24:40.830 --> 04:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
up r s thank you chair for taking my
 
04:24:44.469 --> 04:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
question um my question is like we are
 
04:24:46.189 --> 04:24:46.199 align:start position:0%
giving the 12 visits we are basically
 
04:24:48.590 --> 04:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
thinking about in the bill how the
 
04:24:51.309 --> 04:24:51.319 align:start position:0%
patient might get used to it and then
 
04:24:53.510 --> 04:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
they need more how we are going to
 
04:24:56.030 --> 04:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
control that because it is becoming a
 
04:24:58.149 --> 04:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
factor with the medical professional as
 
04:25:00.990 --> 04:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
well as the patient how they push it and
 
04:25:03.510 --> 04:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
how they how the doctors uses it because
 
04:25:05.710 --> 04:25:05.720 align:start position:0%
there will be a lot of la la land where
 
04:25:09.070 --> 04:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
it can go in a different
 
04:25:11.349 --> 04:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
directions I will not argue that that's
 
04:25:14.109 --> 04:25:14.119 align:start position:0%
a challenge my goal in pain management
 
04:25:15.790 --> 04:25:15.800 align:start position:0%
is to give a patient the skills they
 
04:25:18.149 --> 04:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
need to manage their pain on their own
 
04:25:20.510 --> 04:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
which we really don't do a very good job
 
04:25:22.389 --> 04:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
on so that would imply that there's a
 
04:25:25.030 --> 04:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
finite amount of therapy what that the
 
04:25:27.269 --> 04:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
problem is is that what does that mean
 
04:25:30.229 --> 04:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
we use a patient centered approach um
 
04:25:32.469 --> 04:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
like I had one guy come in and after one
 
04:25:34.710 --> 04:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
visit he knew how to manage his pain you
 
04:25:36.550 --> 04:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
know and he's going to have pain forever
 
04:25:38.990 --> 04:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
and he with one visit we were done I was
 
04:25:41.790 --> 04:25:41.800 align:start position:0%
like wow you know for other patients
 
04:25:45.469 --> 04:25:45.479 align:start position:0%
it's 13 years you know and and it's it's
 
04:25:48.149 --> 04:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
an adaptation process that people vary
 
04:25:50.510 --> 04:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
in so whatever we do needs to be
 
04:25:52.510 --> 04:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
adaptive but I do get there needs to be
 
04:25:55.710 --> 04:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
limits at some point
 
04:25:58.710 --> 04:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
um I I should give this example but I I
 
04:26:00.510 --> 04:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
had a patient with spinal cord injury
 
04:26:01.990 --> 04:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
that's got chronic pain and obviously
 
04:26:03.670 --> 04:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
being quadriplegic is kind of a tough
 
04:26:07.870 --> 04:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
thing to adapt to um took her 13 years
 
04:26:09.710 --> 04:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
to realize this was the rest the way the
 
04:26:12.910 --> 04:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
rest of her life was going to be um
 
04:26:14.990 --> 04:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
and then it becomes difficult do I not
 
04:26:18.349 --> 04:26:18.359 align:start position:0%
treat your pain in a self-managed
 
04:26:20.670 --> 04:26:20.680 align:start position:0%
approach for 12 years because I've put
 
04:26:23.550 --> 04:26:23.560 align:start position:0%
an arbitrary limit on one that's where
 
04:26:27.030 --> 04:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
it gets hard my world is I I always work
 
04:26:28.870 --> 04:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
with patients and I stay with them I
 
04:26:30.710 --> 04:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
don't like to abandon patients and
 
04:26:32.349 --> 04:26:32.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunately taking this job I
 
04:26:35.309 --> 04:26:35.319 align:start position:0%
functionally did but um um I like this
 
04:26:37.070 --> 04:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
job too but
 
04:26:39.710 --> 04:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
um it's a challenge and I think you know
 
04:26:41.590 --> 04:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
we've talked about a work group to sit
 
04:26:43.109 --> 04:26:43.119 align:start position:0%
down and that's an issue that we have to
 
04:26:45.070 --> 04:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
come to some conclusion about but I just
 
04:26:46.630 --> 04:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
don't like abandoning people just
 
04:26:48.830 --> 04:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
because they don't follow a timeline
 
04:26:52.510 --> 04:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:55.349 --> 04:26:55.359 align:start position:0%
help okay oh representative Sullivan
 
04:26:57.990 --> 04:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
again yeah um thanks for my second
 
04:27:00.750 --> 04:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
question um so you you just said to him
 
04:27:02.429 --> 04:27:02.439 align:start position:0%
and you said it earlier that we don't do
 
04:27:05.389 --> 04:27:05.399 align:start position:0%
a a good job in teaching patients how to
 
04:27:06.870 --> 04:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
manage their pain and managing pain in
 
04:27:10.149 --> 04:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
general I'm just curious what is the
 
04:27:12.189 --> 04:27:12.199 align:start position:0%
definition of a good job like is there a
 
04:27:13.590 --> 04:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
country that does it a culture that's
 
04:27:14.710 --> 04:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
done it is there something we've done
 
04:27:16.990 --> 04:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
historical that we've forgotten like is
 
04:27:18.189 --> 04:27:18.199 align:start position:0%
like how do you define it seems a bit
 
04:27:20.309 --> 04:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
nebulous I'm glad you asked that that's
 
04:27:24.269 --> 04:27:24.279 align:start position:0%
a really great question so um the nicest
 
04:27:26.590 --> 04:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not I don't do acupuncture
 
04:27:29.030 --> 04:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
anymore for the most part but the best
 
04:27:30.630 --> 04:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
part about it is I got to look at
 
04:27:33.469 --> 04:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
Eastern cultures ways of doing things
 
04:27:35.670 --> 04:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
and in in American culture we tend to be
 
04:27:38.750 --> 04:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
very myopic so we will look at pill here
 
04:27:41.109 --> 04:27:41.119 align:start position:0%
surgery there therapy here it's not
 
04:27:43.469 --> 04:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
integrated and that's just the way we do
 
04:27:45.950 --> 04:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
things and I'm not totally sure why but
 
04:27:48.389 --> 04:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
that is it's it's very linear you know
 
04:27:49.950 --> 04:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
we're in Asian cultures things are a
 
04:27:51.830 --> 04:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
little bit more circular so we look at
 
04:27:54.309 --> 04:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
Asian medicine as acupuncture well
 
04:27:57.429 --> 04:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
that's not true what what what Eastern
 
04:28:00.750 --> 04:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
medicine is is a combination of uh a
 
04:28:03.109 --> 04:28:03.119 align:start position:0%
restorative thing like an a martial art
 
04:28:05.510 --> 04:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
for example a mindfulness thing like
 
04:28:08.550 --> 04:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
meditation or like Tai Chi chiong or
 
04:28:10.590 --> 04:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
they're movement things but they're also
 
04:28:14.030 --> 04:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
meditation or mindfulness things herbal
 
04:28:16.590 --> 04:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
things as a medication and then needles
 
04:28:18.990 --> 04:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
as an AC as acupuncture so they use all
 
04:28:21.950 --> 04:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
four things together and what we find is
 
04:28:24.950 --> 04:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
that when you use Eastern models of in
 
04:28:27.070 --> 04:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
an integrative way like that is that
 
04:28:30.910 --> 04:28:30.920 align:start position:0%
people adapt a lot more quickly and and
 
04:28:33.870 --> 04:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
and come to um a self-realization that
 
04:28:36.469 --> 04:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
this is where things are at um a lot
 
04:28:38.590 --> 04:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
quicker one of the bigger problems that
 
04:28:41.389 --> 04:28:41.399 align:start position:0%
we have this country I think is that um
 
04:28:43.630 --> 04:28:43.640 align:start position:0%
it's all PR are like in in healthcare
 
04:28:46.429 --> 04:28:46.439 align:start position:0%
we're watch every drug commercial on TV
 
04:28:48.429 --> 04:28:48.439 align:start position:0%
you take this drug and you're cured I
 
04:28:50.750 --> 04:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
listen to seven hours of testimony on
 
04:28:53.109 --> 04:28:53.119 align:start position:0%
cannabis yesterday and had to scratch my
 
04:28:54.550 --> 04:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
head oh yeah cannabis is a cure for
 
04:28:56.189 --> 04:28:56.199 align:start position:0%
everything I mean that's the way we look
 
04:28:57.830 --> 04:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
at things and it's just not the right
 
04:28:59.670 --> 04:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
way to look at things we we promise
 
04:29:02.269 --> 04:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
something we can't deliver so the minute
 
04:29:04.309 --> 04:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
we stop doing that and we say this is
 
04:29:06.269 --> 04:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
where you are let's work on from here
 
04:29:07.429 --> 04:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
and then people will go through an
 
04:29:10.349 --> 04:29:10.359 align:start position:0%
adaptation process that's variable from
 
04:29:12.149 --> 04:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
Patient to Patient in terms of how time
 
04:29:14.990 --> 04:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
that like I mean some patients I I'm
 
04:29:16.790 --> 04:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
with for like a couple weeks and they're
 
04:29:19.229 --> 04:29:19.239 align:start position:0%
F I already said that but like and then
 
04:29:21.710 --> 04:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
other patients it's takes a lot longer
 
04:29:23.349 --> 04:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
there are patients here that can share
 
04:29:24.950 --> 04:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
their stories with you a lot better than
 
04:29:30.790 --> 04:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:33.189 --> 04:29:33.199 align:start position:0%
um represent a
 
04:29:37.149 --> 04:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
POS thank you Mr chair would you believe
 
04:29:41.590 --> 04:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
about in 2018 I had been through a car
 
04:29:45.429 --> 04:29:45.439 align:start position:0%
accident um in 2013 and I went to four
 
04:29:47.870 --> 04:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
different surgeons and they all wanted
 
04:29:50.309 --> 04:29:50.319 align:start position:0%
to do an operation and I was always
 
04:29:53.070 --> 04:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
nervous about it and held it back and
 
04:29:56.109 --> 04:29:56.119 align:start position:0%
the last surgeon I saw they told me if I
 
04:29:58.510 --> 04:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
had a slip and fall or another car
 
04:30:03.429 --> 04:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
accident I would be permanently a par
 
04:30:07.510 --> 04:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
paraplegic and I was going down to the
 
04:30:10.670 --> 04:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
bank to pick up a check and I heard a
 
04:30:14.229 --> 04:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
gentleman speaking on on uh NPR talking
 
04:30:18.070 --> 04:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
about pain I bought that book oh my God
 
04:30:21.870 --> 04:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
I went to that doctor and uh I think I
 
04:30:27.469 --> 04:30:27.479 align:start position:0%
had one or two years of a just a few um
 
04:30:29.510 --> 04:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
injections and I have never had a
 
04:30:31.670 --> 04:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
problem since so I thank you very much
 
04:30:35.790 --> 04:30:35.800 align:start position:0%
you changed my life wow really you
 
04:30:38.030 --> 04:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
didn't know I staged this did
 
04:30:42.189 --> 04:30:42.199 align:start position:0%
you didn't wow um thank you for just
 
04:30:44.269 --> 04:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
sharing that with me would you believe
 
04:30:46.670 --> 04:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
that I have two degenerative knees of
 
04:30:49.030 --> 04:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
biceps tendon rupture herniated disc in
 
04:30:50.830 --> 04:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
my neck and carpal tunel on both hands
 
04:30:54.389 --> 04:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
and I put 4,500 miles on my bike last
 
04:30:56.349 --> 04:30:56.359 align:start position:0%
year and I've never had surgery for any
 
04:31:00.149 --> 04:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
of it because I use non I don't even
 
04:31:03.070 --> 04:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
take pills for my stuff so I mean I try
 
04:31:05.550 --> 04:31:05.560 align:start position:0%
to practice what I preach and I think it
 
04:31:07.750 --> 04:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
and I don't cost the system anything by
 
04:31:07.760 --> 04:31:08.710 align:start position:0%
and I don't cost the system anything by
doing

04:31:08.710 --> 04:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
doing
 
04:31:11.429 --> 04:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
that except my wife cuz she's nervous
 
04:31:14.030 --> 04:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
cuz I don't wear helmet on my bike but
 
04:31:17.429 --> 04:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
anyways representative Gibbs let me yeah
 
04:31:20.309 --> 04:31:20.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um please excuse my
 
04:31:23.510 --> 04:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
lack of medical knowledge but um I'm not
 
04:31:26.510 --> 04:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
sure um what you mean by teaching people
 
04:31:30.389 --> 04:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
to manage their pain um does that mean
 
04:31:32.429 --> 04:31:32.439 align:start position:0%
that you're teaching them essentially to
 
04:31:34.429 --> 04:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
accept that they'll be in pain for the
 
04:31:36.149 --> 04:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
rest of their lives and how to deal with
 
04:31:38.469 --> 04:31:38.479 align:start position:0%
it or is it finding a way to actually
 
04:31:41.389 --> 04:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
stop the pain that is an awesome
 
04:31:41.399 --> 04:31:42.510 align:start position:0%
stop the pain that is an awesome
question

04:31:42.510 --> 04:31:42.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:31:45.309 --> 04:31:45.319 align:start position:0%
so when we wrote the NFL guide that's
 
04:31:47.830 --> 04:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
the entire first section is to teach
 
04:31:52.030 --> 04:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
people about how to manage their pain um
 
04:31:54.109 --> 04:31:54.119 align:start position:0%
no I mean it's a patient everything's
 
04:31:56.109 --> 04:31:56.119 align:start position:0%
patient centered there's some patients I
 
04:31:57.710 --> 04:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
have that elimination eliminating their
 
04:32:01.469 --> 04:32:01.479 align:start position:0%
pain is is reasonable goal um and and
 
04:32:03.309 --> 04:32:03.319 align:start position:0%
you know when you meet people on day one
 
04:32:05.030 --> 04:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
you don't necessarily know who they're
 
04:32:07.710 --> 04:32:07.720 align:start position:0%
going to be um assuming you've seen them
 
04:32:09.670 --> 04:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
on day one but in other patients you
 
04:32:12.149 --> 04:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
know this is going to be an issue what
 
04:32:14.429 --> 04:32:14.439 align:start position:0%
um I can't get rid of your pain but
 
04:32:15.990 --> 04:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
let's make goals as to what's a
 
04:32:18.349 --> 04:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
reasonable outcome and you always focus
 
04:32:20.389 --> 04:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
on function what do you want to do that
 
04:32:22.429 --> 04:32:22.439 align:start position:0%
you can't do and how do we help you get
 
04:32:25.550 --> 04:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
to do that um
 
04:32:28.030 --> 04:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
so again it's everything's got to be
 
04:32:29.630 --> 04:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
patient centered and to be honest that
 
04:32:31.910 --> 04:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
is the flaw with the system is we kind
 
04:32:34.590 --> 04:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
of force everybody into a funnel rather
 
04:32:36.510 --> 04:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
than allowing us to take everybody as an
 
04:32:37.910 --> 04:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
individual and treat them as an
 
04:32:39.429 --> 04:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
individual so the answer to your
 
04:32:42.870 --> 04:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
question is very individual does that
 
04:32:45.429 --> 04:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
help and and you can this is on
 
04:32:47.389 --> 04:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
available online actually it's called
 
04:32:49.189 --> 04:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
the Gilbertson guide if you Google that
 
04:32:50.670 --> 04:32:50.680 align:start position:0%
it'll come
 
04:32:53.790 --> 04:32:53.800 align:start position:0%
up okay so
 
04:32:56.630 --> 04:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
here's how I see
 
04:33:01.389 --> 04:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
this okay Dad and uh and I would say
 
04:33:03.550 --> 04:33:03.560 align:start position:0%
that probably truthfully because I've
 
04:33:08.189 --> 04:33:08.199 align:start position:0%
been doing Insurance a long
 
04:33:08.199 --> 04:33:09.910 align:start position:0%
been doing Insurance a long
time

04:33:09.910 --> 04:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:33:13.070 --> 04:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
and in terms of
 
04:33:16.990 --> 04:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
my experience you this is um it's an
 
04:33:19.910 --> 04:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
issue that really is longterm you know
 
04:33:22.189 --> 04:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
it's the pain is not necessarily going
 
04:33:25.349 --> 04:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
to go away right away but I think what's
 
04:33:28.470 --> 04:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
interesting about this legislation is it
 
04:33:31.830 --> 04:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
is a classic uh cart before the horse or
 
04:33:34.709 --> 04:33:34.719 align:start position:0%
should I say is is a more like uh the
 
04:33:36.230 --> 04:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
chicken of the
 
04:33:41.949 --> 04:33:41.959 align:start position:0%
egg I think the problem is that our
 
04:33:44.269 --> 04:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
Medical Care system and someone has P
 
04:33:47.230 --> 04:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
back pain they go to their primary care
 
04:33:49.750 --> 04:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
physician and the primary care physician
 
04:33:53.230 --> 04:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
refers them to the physical you know the
 
04:33:56.070 --> 04:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
the phys the Doctor Who and that doctor
 
04:33:58.070 --> 04:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
say okay let's let you know have you in
 
04:33:59.949 --> 04:33:59.959 align:start position:0%
the physical therapy let's try to do
 
04:34:02.910 --> 04:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
this and stuff that doctor will never
 
04:34:05.269 --> 04:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
mention the word
 
04:34:05.279 --> 04:34:06.869 align:start position:0%
mention the word
Chiropractic

04:34:06.869 --> 04:34:06.879 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic
 
04:34:09.349 --> 04:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
never okay they have a thing about I
 
04:34:10.830 --> 04:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
will disagree with you but keep going
 
04:34:12.551 --> 04:34:12.561 align:start position:0%
they well maybe you are different but
 
04:34:14.470 --> 04:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
I'm just telling you that most
 
04:34:17.949 --> 04:34:17.959 align:start position:0%
doctors think chiropractors are are
 
04:34:20.709 --> 04:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
practice is
 
04:34:23.709 --> 04:34:23.719 align:start position:0%
sketchy okay I personally believe this
 
04:34:26.510 --> 04:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
all right and what they want to do yeah
 
04:34:27.750 --> 04:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to send you off to the
 
04:34:30.510 --> 04:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
surgeon right because they because you
 
04:34:32.269 --> 04:34:32.279 align:start position:0%
got this back problem and surgery is the
 
04:34:34.310 --> 04:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
right way to go right but as we know
 
04:34:36.910 --> 04:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
surgery is the most expensive way to go
 
04:34:40.269 --> 04:34:40.279 align:start position:0%
yep okay so what we're going to say when
 
04:34:43.590 --> 04:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
we take this this project on here is
 
04:34:45.590 --> 04:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
that we're going
 
04:34:49.109 --> 04:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
to we can't tell doctors what to do with
 
04:34:50.990 --> 04:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
because that that's the whole point of
 
04:34:53.269 --> 04:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
healthcare system is that they do know
 
04:34:56.990 --> 04:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
better and that we're Supply but I'm
 
04:34:58.990 --> 04:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
going to refer to a certain section in
 
04:35:03.269 --> 04:35:03.279 align:start position:0%
your bill here in page two Roman numeral
 
04:35:07.390 --> 04:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
five and I assume it's the same again on
 
04:35:09.390 --> 04:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
on the two sections so point out for
 
04:35:11.269 --> 04:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
everybody for Education this is two
 
04:35:13.869 --> 04:35:13.879 align:start position:0%
different statutes so you see on page
 
04:35:15.470 --> 04:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
one it starts with
 
04:35:15.480 --> 04:35:17.310 align:start position:0%
one it starts with
415

04:35:17.310 --> 04:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
415
 
04:35:20.949 --> 04:35:20.959 align:start position:0%
6bb and then the same thing all over
 
04:35:24.830 --> 04:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
again on page three where it said 415
 
04:35:27.551 --> 04:35:27.561 align:start position:0%
1888 so these are the two different uh
 
04:35:29.551 --> 04:35:29.561 align:start position:0%
health insurance statutes we have in the
 
04:35:32.470 --> 04:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
state okay one is for the individual the
 
04:35:35.029 --> 04:35:35.039 align:start position:0%
other one is for the small group um I
 
04:35:37.709 --> 04:35:37.719 align:start position:0%
would say this is where I saw the word
 
04:35:40.470 --> 04:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
yoga yeah it was still there you we need
 
04:35:41.830 --> 04:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
to take that out you didn't delete you
 
04:35:43.349 --> 04:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
deleted it from the first section but
 
04:35:44.470 --> 04:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
you didn't delete it from the section
 
04:35:45.670 --> 04:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
you're right we need to get rid of it
 
04:35:47.429 --> 04:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
let just that covers up our conversation
 
04:35:49.269 --> 04:35:49.279 align:start position:0%
we had this morning yeah that was a fun
 
04:35:51.070 --> 04:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
conversation but here's what I want to
 
04:35:53.869 --> 04:35:53.879 align:start position:0%
focus in on okay and this no it said no
 
04:35:56.109 --> 04:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
insurance how established util
 
04:35:56.119 --> 04:35:57.830 align:start position:0%
insurance how established util
utilization

04:35:57.830 --> 04:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
utilization
 
04:36:04.269 --> 04:36:04.279 align:start position:0%
controls including prior Ops or step
 
04:36:07.789 --> 04:36:07.799 align:start position:0%
therapy this is really important to me
 
04:36:11.310 --> 04:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
and that is if someone has a back pain
 
04:36:11.320 --> 04:36:12.910 align:start position:0%
and that is if someone has a back pain
problem

04:36:12.910 --> 04:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:36:15.990 --> 04:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
we can't tell that doctor the doctor to
 
04:36:19.869 --> 04:36:19.879 align:start position:0%
say don't send them to the surgeon don't
 
04:36:22.310 --> 04:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
send that page to the
 
04:36:25.390 --> 04:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
church only the insurance companies
 
04:36:28.109 --> 04:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
might say when it comes to the prior
 
04:36:32.390 --> 04:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
off have they been to a chiropractic yet
 
04:36:34.670 --> 04:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
now this is a revolutionary
 
04:36:37.750 --> 04:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
idea right because we've never thought
 
04:36:41.070 --> 04:36:41.080 align:start position:0%
of it that is saying to have we're now
 
04:36:43.429 --> 04:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
saying is because we all think hmos are
 
04:36:45.990 --> 04:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
evil right curse of the world okay
 
04:36:49.029 --> 04:36:49.039 align:start position:0%
because they manage us okay but reality
 
04:36:51.990 --> 04:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
is the whole phrase well I'm not sure
 
04:36:54.189 --> 04:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
what if this is the step the therapy I'm
 
04:36:55.470 --> 04:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
thinking of I think they're different
 
04:36:57.230 --> 04:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
but keep going but I think was this is
 
04:36:59.750 --> 04:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
drug step therapy yeah but I'm thinking
 
04:37:02.269 --> 04:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
is is that we want we take we what we
 
04:37:03.990 --> 04:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
want to do is think in terms of what
 
04:37:07.670 --> 04:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
steps should be taken first before you
 
04:37:10.629 --> 04:37:10.639 align:start position:0%
go to that surgeon why because the
 
04:37:12.830 --> 04:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
surgeon is the most most expensive thing
 
04:37:15.510 --> 04:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
you can do and that's the one thing
 
04:37:17.310 --> 04:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
manag care companies are great at is to
 
04:37:19.390 --> 04:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
try to get us to do the cheap one
 
04:37:22.629 --> 04:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
first right that's done under the prior
 
04:37:25.551 --> 04:37:25.561 align:start position:0%
off so I I'm going to ask you to think
 
04:37:28.310 --> 04:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
about this yeah is ADD will rethink
 
04:37:31.150 --> 04:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
about how we're doing this and that is
 
04:37:33.189 --> 04:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
that I know your bill is set up is is
 
04:37:34.510 --> 04:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
that that the insurance company is
 
04:37:37.189 --> 04:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
supposed to set up what they're
 
04:37:41.109 --> 04:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
offering okay but at the end of the day
 
04:37:41.119 --> 04:37:41.990 align:start position:0%
offering okay but at the end of the day
what

04:37:41.990 --> 04:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:37:44.551 --> 04:37:44.561 align:start position:0%
when we say what they're offering we
 
04:37:47.470 --> 04:37:47.480 align:start position:0%
need to be say to them is they can start
 
04:37:50.750 --> 04:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
off with those things that are the least
 
04:37:55.349 --> 04:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
invasive and and uh and and maybe less
 
04:37:57.990 --> 04:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
expensive and then move up to those
 
04:38:01.390 --> 04:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
higher more expensive things okay so I'm
 
04:38:03.230 --> 04:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
just want to let you know that I I
 
04:38:05.230 --> 04:38:05.240 align:start position:0%
really have a problem with those those
 
04:38:07.830 --> 04:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
limitations because I'm thinking that's
 
04:38:10.310 --> 04:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
where the answer is so I agree with
 
04:38:12.070 --> 04:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
everything you have said
 
04:38:14.230 --> 04:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
totally um I don't the only thing I
 
04:38:15.551 --> 04:38:15.561 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily agree with I think
 
04:38:17.349 --> 04:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
doctors and chiropractors get along a
 
04:38:18.709 --> 04:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
lot better than they used to but
 
04:38:20.429 --> 04:38:20.439 align:start position:0%
certainly when I started out everything
 
04:38:22.910 --> 04:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
you just said was true um my I'm
 
04:38:25.510 --> 04:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
numbering my friends but my I don't know
 
04:38:27.590 --> 04:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
we do have you but he's my fifth best
 
04:38:30.709 --> 04:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
friend that there so um what I'm not
 
04:38:32.189 --> 04:38:32.199 align:start position:0%
going to be your best friend your number
 
04:38:35.470 --> 04:38:35.480 align:start position:0%
six I'm sorry we I'm sorry the list is
 
04:38:38.109 --> 04:38:38.119 align:start position:0%
taken but actually representative post
 
04:38:40.830 --> 04:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
went ahead of you but um right so
 
04:38:43.390 --> 04:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
because he's Cent I mean you basically
 
04:38:45.390 --> 04:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
gave me a segue to recommend my book I
 
04:38:47.029 --> 04:38:47.039 align:start position:0%
mean that's basically what I talked
 
04:38:49.189 --> 04:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
about in the book is that fiscally
 
04:38:52.109 --> 04:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
doctors are are totally irresponsible
 
04:38:54.310 --> 04:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
and prior authorization does have a lot
 
04:38:56.869 --> 04:38:56.879 align:start position:0%
of value because of that
 
04:38:59.269 --> 04:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
irresponsibility and you know I with my
 
04:39:01.470 --> 04:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
prior off bill when I testified last
 
04:39:03.629 --> 04:39:03.639 align:start position:0%
year I said very specifically that a lot
 
04:39:05.470 --> 04:39:05.480 align:start position:0%
of doctors won't like what I'm about to
 
04:39:07.510 --> 04:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
say but I think they're a necessary evil
 
04:39:10.629 --> 04:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
because of the way we do things um you
 
04:39:13.070 --> 04:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
know with that you gave me an I hope
 
04:39:15.150 --> 04:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
you're not exciting me um for no good
 
04:39:16.990 --> 04:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
reason but like the concept of us
 
04:39:19.269 --> 04:39:19.279 align:start position:0%
working together that paragraph stinks
 
04:39:20.830 --> 04:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
it really needs a lot I just want you to
 
04:39:23.189 --> 04:39:23.199 align:start position:0%
say that that's where I'm we're going to
 
04:39:24.869 --> 04:39:24.879 align:start position:0%
run if we're going to run on the concept
 
04:39:28.070 --> 04:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
is that we know that the number one
 
04:39:30.230 --> 04:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
problem is is everybody's going to that
 
04:39:32.990 --> 04:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
expensive surgeon right out the top and
 
04:39:35.830 --> 04:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
then with bad results then then then
 
04:39:37.189 --> 04:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
they finally come back and look at these
 
04:39:38.670 --> 04:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
the cheaper ones they could have worked
 
04:39:41.788 --> 04:39:41.798 align:start position:0%
out right and not as as intrusive toally
 
04:39:44.550 --> 04:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
might have so the problem is we now have
 
04:39:46.708 --> 04:39:46.718 align:start position:0%
a conflict between what the our Health
 
04:39:49.708 --> 04:39:49.718 align:start position:0%
Care system is designed to work in terms
 
04:39:51.910 --> 04:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
of getting our positions and now we're
 
04:39:53.190 --> 04:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
now we're giving a whole new
 
04:39:55.190 --> 04:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility to insurance companies so
 
04:39:56.708 --> 04:39:56.718 align:start position:0%
I'm not even sure they're too excited
 
04:39:59.430 --> 04:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
about this idea okay so I would say is
 
04:40:01.590 --> 04:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
we have to kind of work this is going to
 
04:40:05.230 --> 04:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
take an art form to get this to a place
 
04:40:07.990 --> 04:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
Y where everyone feels comfortable with
 
04:40:10.150 --> 04:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to set up here with
 
04:40:12.470 --> 04:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
the goal that is is going to be the
 
04:40:14.990 --> 04:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
least e you know the the least expensive
 
04:40:18.670 --> 04:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
way to get that pain cured uh so knowing
 
04:40:20.830 --> 04:40:20.840 align:start position:0%
full well that the surgeon and some
 
04:40:24.510 --> 04:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
people will say is they'll say I God I'm
 
04:40:26.788 --> 04:40:26.798 align:start position:0%
so upset they forc me to do all these
 
04:40:28.270 --> 04:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
other things instead of going to the
 
04:40:29.948 --> 04:40:29.958 align:start position:0%
surgeon and I knew that I just want to
 
04:40:31.150 --> 04:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
go to that surgeon right out of the
 
04:40:33.910 --> 04:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
block okay that will be our number one
 
04:40:37.190 --> 04:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
problem okay so having said that um I
 
04:40:38.628 --> 04:40:38.638 align:start position:0%
know that we we have a lot of people who
 
04:40:41.310 --> 04:40:41.320 align:start position:0%
are going to want to speak yes okay and
 
04:40:43.030 --> 04:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
so what I want to urge everyone to say
 
04:40:46.150 --> 04:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
is is that we get it we understand what
 
04:40:49.310 --> 04:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
we're doing here right we we get and how
 
04:40:51.910 --> 04:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
we want to get to so let's try to be
 
04:40:53.310 --> 04:40:53.320 align:start position:0%
aware that that's where we're going to
 
04:40:55.430 --> 04:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
go and let's not you know blavor too
 
04:40:57.868 --> 04:40:57.878 align:start position:0%
much because I think we all really get
 
04:40:59.510 --> 04:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
that each one of these different
 
04:41:02.948 --> 04:41:02.958 align:start position:0%
practices do does something very helpful
 
04:41:05.550 --> 04:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
and is less expensive than what is
 
04:41:07.590 --> 04:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
occurring now in this country which is
 
04:41:09.350 --> 04:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
the surgeon you know if you had said
 
04:41:11.030 --> 04:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
that be when we started I wouldn't said
 
04:41:13.150 --> 04:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
it word you would have I would you said
 
04:41:16.230 --> 04:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
everything I wanted to say perfect good
 
04:41:19.868 --> 04:41:19.878 align:start position:0%
job thank you very much thank you okay
 
04:41:22.150 --> 04:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
so we'll start out with Roberta
 
04:41:25.230 --> 04:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
blades uh pain uh pain patience and
 
04:41:48.750 --> 04:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:48.760 --> 04:41:51.030 align:start position:0%
 
all

04:41:51.030 --> 04:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:53.590 --> 04:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
right I've just had the flu for two
 
04:41:55.750 --> 04:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
weeks but I've had antibiotics I just
 
04:41:58.590 --> 04:41:58.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to get anyone El I I've had
 
04:42:02.030 --> 04:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
my flu shots and my co shots so I'm I'm
 
04:42:03.948 --> 04:42:03.958 align:start position:0%
okay not
 
04:42:07.670 --> 04:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
worried um good afternoon for the record
 
04:42:10.750 --> 04:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
my name is Roberta blades and I live in
 
04:42:12.030 --> 04:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
conquer New
 
04:42:13.948 --> 04:42:13.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I
 
04:42:18.470 --> 04:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
have been living with chronic pain um at
 
04:42:23.270 --> 04:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
least since 2016 when I had a major um
 
04:42:26.430 --> 04:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
move that was wrong and I was in
 
04:42:29.310 --> 04:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
screeching pain went by ambulance to the
 
04:42:32.350 --> 04:42:32.360 align:start position:0%
hospital stayed there 4 days was treated
 
04:42:34.910 --> 04:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
with opioids was
 
04:42:38.150 --> 04:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
discharged with fewer opioids than I
 
04:42:42.190 --> 04:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
needed to manage um went home could not
 
04:42:46.470 --> 04:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
walk and I had VNA services for at least
 
04:42:49.310 --> 04:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
6 months to teach me how to walk again I
 
04:42:52.590 --> 04:42:52.600 align:start position:0%
had to use opioids to move so I took
 
04:42:55.430 --> 04:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
them in the morning when the VNA came so
 
04:42:59.110 --> 04:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
I could move and build up my endurance
 
04:43:02.708 --> 04:43:02.718 align:start position:0%
and strength again um
 
04:43:07.150 --> 04:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm not on any strong opioids
 
04:43:09.430 --> 04:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
now I do take a variety of medications
 
04:43:11.830 --> 04:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
for chronic pain
 
04:43:16.550 --> 04:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
um the biggest change in my life was in
 
04:43:20.788 --> 04:43:20.798 align:start position:0%
2017 um when one of my medical doctors
 
04:43:24.590 --> 04:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
who was giving me epidurals in my spine
 
04:43:27.470 --> 04:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
to help with the pain he's in the room
 
04:43:31.310 --> 04:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
you might know him um Dr Nagel um he
 
04:43:33.390 --> 04:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
said to me I said there's got to be
 
04:43:35.910 --> 04:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
something more than
 
04:43:38.868 --> 04:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
invasive injections surgeries which I
 
04:43:41.948 --> 04:43:41.958 align:start position:0%
never had for this I've had for things
 
04:43:45.550 --> 04:43:45.560 align:start position:0%
um there has to be more and he said to
 
04:43:49.350 --> 04:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
me look up us pain
 
04:43:52.628 --> 04:43:52.638 align:start position:0%
foundation.org and then he introduced me
 
04:43:55.350 --> 04:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
to Cindy Steinberg who's in the room who
 
04:43:58.150 --> 04:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
you'll meet who is one of their um
 
04:44:01.948 --> 04:44:01.958 align:start position:0%
advocacy people um and she became a
 
04:44:04.230 --> 04:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
mentor of sorts I went to her support
 
04:44:06.948 --> 04:44:06.958 align:start position:0%
group in Arlington
 
04:44:10.310 --> 04:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
Mass and I made the track because she
 
04:44:11.628 --> 04:44:11.638 align:start position:0%
was amazing
 
04:44:13.070 --> 04:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
and taught me so
 
04:44:13.080 --> 04:44:14.750 align:start position:0%
and taught me so
much

04:44:14.750 --> 04:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:44:18.030 --> 04:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
um and now shortly after I went through
 
04:44:20.590 --> 04:44:20.600 align:start position:0%
the training and now I lead support
 
04:44:23.750 --> 04:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
groups for the US pain Foundation as
 
04:44:27.070 --> 04:44:27.080 align:start position:0%
well and the one I run is for people
 
04:44:28.868 --> 04:44:28.878 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire but I get a lot of
 
04:44:31.030 --> 04:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
people from other states as well and
 
04:44:35.310 --> 04:44:35.320 align:start position:0%
it's Zoom opened my world Zoom meant
 
04:44:36.750 --> 04:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
that I could run these support groups
 
04:44:40.390 --> 04:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
from home and zoom would would allow
 
04:44:43.190 --> 04:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
people to test give testimony here if
 
04:44:45.150 --> 04:44:45.160 align:start position:0%
you allowed it like other states I just
 
04:44:48.590 --> 04:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
like to mention that it is a real open
 
04:44:51.990 --> 04:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
door for people like me but I um I'm in
 
04:44:53.750 --> 04:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of pain because I also couldn't
 
04:44:58.190 --> 04:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
take my medicines to drive and I'm very
 
04:45:01.628 --> 04:45:01.638 align:start position:0%
I'm very strict with myself I'm I don't
 
04:45:04.190 --> 04:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
drink because my medications don't allow
 
04:45:09.150 --> 04:45:09.160 align:start position:0%
me to and I'm not a one who enjoys
 
04:45:12.990 --> 04:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
feeling lost or as you know out of
 
04:45:16.190 --> 04:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
control that's not me um I wanted to get
 
04:45:18.830 --> 04:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
better and I have learned through so
 
04:45:20.430 --> 04:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
much through US pain Foundation it's
 
04:45:23.628 --> 04:45:23.638 align:start position:0%
more than just support groups but in
 
04:45:25.510 --> 04:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
running these groups I'd like to share
 
04:45:28.750 --> 04:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
some of the things that I've learned
 
04:45:31.190 --> 04:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
um I've learned more
 
04:45:34.590 --> 04:45:34.600 align:start position:0%
acronyms more cases for chronic pain
 
04:45:36.830 --> 04:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
people introduce themselves and say I
 
04:45:39.948 --> 04:45:39.958 align:start position:0%
have CRPS I have fibromyalgia I have
 
04:45:42.030 --> 04:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
this I have that and they'll many of us
 
04:45:43.670 --> 04:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
have more than one
 
04:45:43.680 --> 04:45:45.230 align:start position:0%
have more than one
condition

04:45:45.230 --> 04:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
condition
 
04:45:49.110 --> 04:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
and CRPS chronic regional pain syndrome
 
04:45:52.830 --> 04:45:52.840 align:start position:0%
in many cases some of these patients had
 
04:45:55.830 --> 04:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
a bad ankle that they broke had surgery
 
04:45:58.750 --> 04:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
for it the surgeon somehow nicked a
 
04:46:01.628 --> 04:46:01.638 align:start position:0%
nerve or whatever and it sets off pain
 
04:46:04.110 --> 04:46:04.120 align:start position:0%
that radiates and goes to other parts of
 
04:46:06.788 --> 04:46:06.798 align:start position:0%
their body now I that's not a medical
 
04:46:09.628 --> 04:46:09.638 align:start position:0%
definition it's just mine but in other
 
04:46:12.750 --> 04:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
words some of these conditions
 
04:46:16.990 --> 04:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
um are also provoked by surgery and as
 
04:46:20.230 --> 04:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
you said surgery is the most expensive
 
04:46:23.190 --> 04:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps
 
04:46:26.868 --> 04:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
um the other thing about my support
 
04:46:26.878 --> 04:46:31.990 align:start position:0%
um the other thing about my support
groups

04:46:31.990 --> 04:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:35.868 --> 04:46:35.878 align:start position:0%
um suicides when I have heard so many
 
04:46:37.430 --> 04:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
people who were so desperate when
 
04:46:40.030 --> 04:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
opioids were taken away from them
 
04:46:41.350 --> 04:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
because they were man managing their
 
04:46:44.030 --> 04:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
pain they were not addicted in fact I
 
04:46:46.590 --> 04:46:46.600 align:start position:0%
get data from New Hampshire every month
 
04:46:49.750 --> 04:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
it says what's causing the
 
04:46:53.310 --> 04:46:53.320 align:start position:0%
deaths what were the substances illegal
 
04:46:56.510 --> 04:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
fenel from China from other countries is
 
04:47:00.150 --> 04:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
number one mixtures of drugs or somebody
 
04:47:02.390 --> 04:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
used somebody else's drugs but very
 
04:47:05.190 --> 04:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
rarely will you see a pain patient there
 
04:47:08.110 --> 04:47:08.120 align:start position:0%
because pain patients use it to make the
 
04:47:12.150 --> 04:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
pain go away and to offer that us pain
 
04:47:14.910 --> 04:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
Foundation has a great website they have
 
04:47:17.548 --> 04:47:17.558 align:start position:0%
a lot of people who volunteer like
 
04:47:20.510 --> 04:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
myself do not get paid and they know a
 
04:47:23.548 --> 04:47:23.558 align:start position:0%
lot there are pain management um
 
04:47:25.708 --> 04:47:25.718 align:start position:0%
Comprehensive Pain Services management
 
04:47:28.590 --> 04:47:28.600 align:start position:0%
plan we talked about in this bill um
 
04:47:30.390 --> 04:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
they don't have an identical thing but
 
04:47:33.910 --> 04:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
there are examples and there are people
 
04:47:37.030 --> 04:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
who could advise so that it's not like
 
04:47:39.910 --> 04:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
it's a desert and that you have to start
 
04:47:42.670 --> 04:47:42.680 align:start position:0%
from scratch when you look at this
 
04:47:47.750 --> 04:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
bill um Educational Services right there
 
04:47:51.430 --> 04:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
um phological pharmacological and
 
04:47:53.390 --> 04:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
non-pharmacological I want to point out
 
04:47:55.510 --> 04:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
something I'm just sharing some personal
 
04:47:57.830 --> 04:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
stories I hope you don't mind pain
 
04:48:01.470 --> 04:48:01.480 align:start position:0%
patches lioc cane pain patches they were
 
04:48:04.310 --> 04:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
5% and I got them on prescription it was
 
04:48:05.830 --> 04:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
so wonderful and all of a sudden they
 
04:48:09.430 --> 04:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
said we're going to make it 4% is over
 
04:48:12.548 --> 04:48:12.558 align:start position:0%
the counter now and 5% is only good for
 
04:48:15.190 --> 04:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
these two conditions and neither one I
 
04:48:17.190 --> 04:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
have a lot of conditions but neither one
 
04:48:20.030 --> 04:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
for that so I've been using 4% and it
 
04:48:21.868 --> 04:48:21.878 align:start position:0%
makes a difference I would love to get
 
04:48:26.830 --> 04:48:26.840 align:start position:0%
5% again and I would love to um have it
 
04:48:29.390 --> 04:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
covered by medical insurance I pay $2 a
 
04:48:32.670 --> 04:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
day out of pocket just for that and I do
 
04:48:36.310 --> 04:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
it um and it's only 4% so I'm just
 
04:48:39.868 --> 04:48:39.878 align:start position:0%
saying these ways of changing things um
 
04:48:41.910 --> 04:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
you talk about prior oth and step
 
04:48:44.430 --> 04:48:44.440 align:start position:0%
therapy I have a doctor who says he
 
04:48:47.670 --> 04:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
won't do prior oth if he's if the
 
04:48:49.948 --> 04:48:49.958 align:start position:0%
insurance company tells it him about it
 
04:48:52.350 --> 04:48:52.360 align:start position:0%
he's not doing it for that customer who
 
04:48:56.430 --> 04:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
might be me that patient um doctors have
 
04:48:59.510 --> 04:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
put through so many things and it's one
 
04:49:03.430 --> 04:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
more thing that they have to you know go
 
04:49:03.440 --> 04:49:05.910 align:start position:0%
more thing that they have to you know go
through

04:49:05.910 --> 04:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:49:09.230 --> 04:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
um mental health mindfulness meditation
 
04:49:11.750 --> 04:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
these are all offered by us pain
 
04:49:14.628 --> 04:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
foundation and
 
04:49:18.430 --> 04:49:18.440 align:start position:0%
um manual treatments massage therapy I
 
04:49:20.750 --> 04:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
mean you would probably all like massage
 
04:49:23.070 --> 04:49:23.080 align:start position:0%
therapy but I don't
 
04:49:26.430 --> 04:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
think um it will be taken advantage of
 
04:49:29.110 --> 04:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
we're we're limiting things to what 12
 
04:49:32.110 --> 04:49:32.120 align:start position:0%
episodes or 12
 
04:49:35.230 --> 04:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
um times that you can have this and I
 
04:49:38.030 --> 04:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
think it would help I get muscle spasms
 
04:49:39.830 --> 04:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
and sometimes you know I've eaten a
 
04:49:42.190 --> 04:49:42.200 align:start position:0%
dozen bananas to try and magnesium and
 
04:49:44.788 --> 04:49:44.798 align:start position:0%
this and that but wouldn't I love to
 
04:49:47.548 --> 04:49:47.558 align:start position:0%
have massage therapy um and have a real
 
04:49:50.990 --> 04:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
therapist one of my problems before I uh
 
04:49:54.430 --> 04:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
thought oh I can have acupuncture but
 
04:49:57.350 --> 04:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
the the people who were covered by my
 
04:50:00.310 --> 04:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
insurance were over an hour away and in
 
04:50:04.948 --> 04:50:04.958 align:start position:0%
my condition driving an hour is a lot um
 
04:50:06.670 --> 04:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
so all these
 
04:50:10.910 --> 04:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
things one more um I was given invasive
 
04:50:13.590 --> 04:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
treatment that was more expensive and I
 
04:50:16.430 --> 04:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
kept asking my doctor can I please have
 
04:50:19.830 --> 04:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
aquatic therapy I have heard so many
 
04:50:23.110 --> 04:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
good things about pool
 
04:50:25.788 --> 04:50:25.798 align:start position:0%
PT and I couldn't get it and I couldn't
 
04:50:27.948 --> 04:50:27.958 align:start position:0%
get it and then finally I said this
 
04:50:30.070 --> 04:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
other therapy is not helping me and it's
 
04:50:32.430 --> 04:50:32.440 align:start position:0%
expensive finally got pooled
 
04:50:35.430 --> 04:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
PT what happens when you go in a
 
04:50:39.230 --> 04:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
pool gravity's gone it's there but not
 
04:50:41.788 --> 04:50:41.798 align:start position:0%
as strong and the pull on your body you
 
04:50:45.590 --> 04:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
are moving lightly and the pain subsides
 
04:50:48.910 --> 04:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
and you can do exercises again coming
 
04:50:51.708 --> 04:50:51.718 align:start position:0%
out is hard because then all the gravity
 
04:50:54.990 --> 04:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
pulls you down but it's a definite
 
04:50:57.030 --> 04:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
remedy for people you can build up your
 
04:51:00.470 --> 04:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
muscles and get a little bit further in
 
04:51:03.150 --> 04:51:03.160 align:start position:0%
your own health um I'm currently doing
 
04:51:06.990 --> 04:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
Tai Chi online there are so many spinal
 
04:51:11.030 --> 04:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
cord injury um foundations that offer
 
04:51:14.310 --> 04:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
exercises online for upper body that are
 
04:51:17.390 --> 04:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
free so there are things that are in
 
04:51:20.070 --> 04:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
this bill that are also free and
 
04:51:22.708 --> 04:51:22.718 align:start position:0%
resources out there so I just wanted to
 
04:51:25.750 --> 04:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
share that because um I don't want you
 
04:51:27.628 --> 04:51:27.638 align:start position:0%
to be overwhelmed by the thought of the
 
04:51:30.270 --> 04:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
costs because there are people who do do
 
04:51:33.470 --> 04:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
it for free and could help um there are
 
04:51:36.868 --> 04:51:36.878 align:start position:0%
other states who have similar bills and
 
04:51:42.030 --> 04:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
it they're ongoing now um so
 
04:51:44.548 --> 04:51:44.558 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions and
 
04:51:46.868 --> 04:51:46.878 align:start position:0%

this bill and also um as a self
 
04:53:32.788 --> 04:53:32.798 align:start position:0%
representative as a licensed
 
04:53:34.868 --> 04:53:34.878 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist because education in the
 
04:53:38.350 --> 04:53:38.360 align:start position:0%
state is necessary there are still um
 
04:53:39.910 --> 04:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
many people who don't know the benefits
 
04:53:42.910 --> 04:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
of acupun puncture don't realize the
 
04:53:45.150 --> 04:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
scope of the practice what is necessary
 
04:53:47.390 --> 04:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
in the practice so what I've handed you
 
04:53:50.590 --> 04:53:50.600 align:start position:0%
is the position letter um from Nama and
 
04:53:52.910 --> 04:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to actually speak on are
 
04:53:55.670 --> 04:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
some very specific cases from my
 
04:53:58.270 --> 04:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
practice over the Last 5 Years um I came
 
04:54:00.788 --> 04:54:00.798 align:start position:0%
to acupuncture late in my life and it's
 
04:54:04.708 --> 04:54:04.718 align:start position:0%
been an incredible um Incredible Journey
 
04:54:07.310 --> 04:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
um listening to Dr Nagel's speak there
 
04:54:08.830 --> 04:54:08.840 align:start position:0%
was a couple of things that I didn't
 
04:54:10.070 --> 04:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
think I was going to speak on but I want
 
04:54:13.430 --> 04:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
to point out to you um first of all on
 
04:54:15.230 --> 04:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
the back of the packet that I sent out
 
04:54:17.390 --> 04:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
or is circulating around there's a
 
04:54:20.150 --> 04:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
resource there's a table um
 
04:54:21.590 --> 04:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan some of the
 
04:54:23.590 --> 04:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
questions that you
 
04:54:27.510 --> 04:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
had um one of the questions was um in
 
04:54:30.150 --> 04:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
comparing different modalities the r
 
04:54:32.948 --> 04:54:32.958 align:start position:0%
resource there there's a
 
04:54:37.270 --> 04:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
um citation to a bigger article if you
 
04:54:38.948 --> 04:54:38.958 align:start position:0%
were to take that home put it into the
 
04:54:40.390 --> 04:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
web you'd find the article with the
 
04:54:42.708 --> 04:54:42.718 align:start position:0%
tables I tried to print them but the
 
04:54:44.948 --> 04:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
font was so ridiculously tiny there was
 
04:54:46.788 --> 04:54:46.798 align:start position:0%
no way you would be able to see it but
 
04:54:48.670 --> 04:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
at home you would be able to and they're
 
04:54:50.868 --> 04:54:50.878 align:start position:0%
comparing different non-invasive
 
04:54:55.030 --> 04:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
modalities and what is effective and
 
04:54:57.910 --> 04:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
also in that packet
 
04:55:01.110 --> 04:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
is a chart that
 
04:55:03.350 --> 04:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
shows the usage of
 
04:55:05.990 --> 04:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
opioids across many different countries
 
04:55:07.830 --> 04:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
and you'll happen to notice that South
 
04:55:11.510 --> 04:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
Korea and Japan as the the least amount
 
04:55:13.350 --> 04:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
and those are two areas where
 
04:55:15.310 --> 04:55:15.320 align:start position:0%
traditional Asian medicine is the
 
04:55:18.310 --> 04:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
highest and acupuncture is used in also
 
04:55:20.868 --> 04:55:20.878 align:start position:0%
as Dr Nagel pointed out they use things
 
04:55:24.190 --> 04:55:24.200 align:start position:0%
like Chiang and taii and massage and
 
04:55:28.110 --> 04:55:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:30.628 --> 04:55:30.638 align:start position:0%
Medicine you also asked about the cost
 
04:55:35.150 --> 04:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
of things um and thinking about that and
 
04:55:37.030 --> 04:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
we not that I have a particular study to
 
04:55:39.070 --> 04:55:39.080 align:start position:0%
hand to you but as I go through
 
04:55:40.830 --> 04:55:40.840 align:start position:0%
different patients I can tell you the
 
04:55:44.470 --> 04:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
cost of those things and um just to
 
04:55:47.230 --> 04:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
think to start out to think about a
 
04:55:49.788 --> 04:55:49.798 align:start position:0%
patient's in pain they go to their
 
04:55:53.470 --> 04:55:53.480 align:start position:0%
PCP in that treatment maybe it lasted 15
 
04:55:54.868 --> 04:55:54.878 align:start position:0%
minutes maybe they're there for 30
 
04:55:56.830 --> 04:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
minutes they walk out and they're still
 
04:55:59.990 --> 04:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
in pain and when they get the bill
 
04:56:02.868 --> 04:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
several hundred to see that PCP and
 
04:56:06.230 --> 04:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
they're still in pain then they go to a
 
04:56:09.230 --> 04:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
pharmacy or they get referred to another
 
04:56:11.990 --> 04:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
practitioner they're still in pain and
 
04:56:14.670 --> 04:56:14.680 align:start position:0%
yet they've had multiple office visits
 
04:56:17.510 --> 04:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
$700 and nothing's happened
 
04:56:21.628 --> 04:56:21.638 align:start position:0%
yet so in Converse to that I see people
 
04:56:24.310 --> 04:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
they come in an acute pain or chronic
 
04:56:27.270 --> 04:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
pain um and within one visit I've
 
04:56:28.830 --> 04:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
knocked their pain
 
04:56:32.110 --> 04:56:32.120 align:start position:0%
down and my visits aren't several
 
04:56:35.110 --> 04:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
hundred and although it is true that
 
04:56:37.548 --> 04:56:37.558 align:start position:0%
acupuncture requires multiple visits in
 
04:56:39.070 --> 04:56:39.080 align:start position:0%
order to have long
 
04:56:41.750 --> 04:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
standing that that's different from
 
04:56:44.390 --> 04:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
Patient to Patient some patients come in
 
04:56:47.110 --> 04:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
once or twice the Pain's diminished
 
04:56:49.350 --> 04:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
they're back to work
 
04:56:53.628 --> 04:56:53.638 align:start position:0%
$160 pretty low cost other patients come
 
04:56:56.628 --> 04:56:56.638 align:start position:0%
in in a short sequence maybe twice a
 
04:57:00.070 --> 04:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
week um for a short period of time their
 
04:57:02.310 --> 04:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
Pain's knocked down they're back to
 
04:57:04.830 --> 04:57:04.840 align:start position:0%
work and it's still a lower cost than
 
04:57:06.510 --> 04:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
one or two visits with
 
04:57:09.030 --> 04:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
PCP so here's just a couple of examples
 
04:57:11.190 --> 04:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
so that you have some talking points
 
04:57:13.270 --> 04:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
when you're talking more knowledgeably
 
04:57:14.948 --> 04:57:14.958 align:start position:0%
about acupuncture in the
 
04:57:16.948 --> 04:57:16.958 align:start position:0%
future some of the patients that I'm
 
04:57:19.390 --> 04:57:19.400 align:start position:0%
currently seeing one to 38-year-old male
 
04:57:21.750 --> 04:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
he's a commercial pilot he was um
 
04:57:23.510 --> 04:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
serving in the armed
 
04:57:26.708 --> 04:57:26.718 align:start position:0%
forces in December he came up with
 
04:57:29.270 --> 04:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
radiating pain down his
 
04:57:32.190 --> 04:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
arm there was no possibility of taking
 
04:57:35.190 --> 04:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
certain prescriptions or his he would be
 
04:57:38.470 --> 04:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
grounded he had um gone to his PCP he
 
04:57:42.430 --> 04:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
was referred to PT PT was full wouldn't
 
04:57:44.310 --> 04:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
be able to get in for several months he
 
04:57:46.390 --> 04:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
went to massage therapist because of his
 
04:57:49.788 --> 04:57:49.798 align:start position:0%
muscle muscle structure um his massage
 
04:57:52.548 --> 04:57:52.558 align:start position:0%
therapist wasn't able to work with him
 
04:57:56.070 --> 04:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
and referred him to me and within one
 
04:57:59.510 --> 04:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
visit his pain was knocked down and some
 
04:58:01.310 --> 04:58:01.320 align:start position:0%
of the feeling that he had lost in his
 
04:58:05.110 --> 04:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
hand had started to return within seven
 
04:58:09.590 --> 04:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
visits between December and March all of
 
04:58:11.350 --> 04:58:11.360 align:start position:0%
the radi getting pain and his arm was
 
04:58:14.430 --> 04:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
gone his arm was his hand was restored
 
04:58:17.868 --> 04:58:17.878 align:start position:0%
to full function and it was 3 months
 
04:58:20.788 --> 04:58:20.798 align:start position:0%
after his initial visit with the PCP
 
04:58:22.270 --> 04:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
that he finally was able to get in for
 
04:58:25.670 --> 04:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
his scheduled MRI which they found disk
 
04:58:30.708 --> 04:58:30.718 align:start position:0%
damage in his spine and but in seven
 
04:58:32.990 --> 04:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
visits we were able to restore the
 
04:58:35.270 --> 04:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
function of his arm and the cost of that
 
04:58:35.280 --> 04:58:37.910 align:start position:0%
function of his arm and the cost of that
was

04:58:37.910 --> 04:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:40.830 --> 04:58:40.840 align:start position:0%
$680 I have a 73-year-old who's had
 
04:58:43.230 --> 04:58:43.240 align:start position:0%
cancer three different times massive
 
04:58:46.868 --> 04:58:46.878 align:start position:0%
cancer in her neck um when she came to
 
04:58:49.548 --> 04:58:49.558 align:start position:0%
me her skin was about the color of the
 
04:58:51.948 --> 04:58:51.958 align:start position:0%
papers in front of you she could barely
 
04:58:55.070 --> 04:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
turn her neck she had no saliva from the
 
04:58:56.788 --> 04:58:56.798 align:start position:0%
massive radiation in her
 
04:59:00.270 --> 04:59:00.280 align:start position:0%
neck um her oncologist referred her to M
 
04:59:02.070 --> 04:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
um to an
 
04:59:02.080 --> 04:59:03.750 align:start position:0%
um to an
acupuncturist

04:59:03.750 --> 04:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist
 
04:59:06.190 --> 04:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
and the first acupuncturist actually
 
04:59:08.628 --> 04:59:08.638 align:start position:0%
said I don't know how to help you and
 
04:59:11.628 --> 04:59:11.638 align:start position:0%
then she got my name came to me and
 
04:59:13.390 --> 04:59:13.400 align:start position:0%
we've been working and I said you know
 
04:59:14.708 --> 04:59:14.718 align:start position:0%
this is new for me but we're going to go
 
04:59:17.310 --> 04:59:17.320 align:start position:0%
for it I started to look at some
 
04:59:19.150 --> 04:59:19.160 align:start position:0%
evidence-based things that other people
 
04:59:22.628 --> 04:59:22.638 align:start position:0%
had done and we started to work within
 
04:59:25.070 --> 04:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
one session her saliva started to come
 
04:59:27.310 --> 04:59:27.320 align:start position:0%
back not fully but she had moisture in
 
04:59:27.320 --> 04:59:28.030 align:start position:0%
back not fully but she had moisture in
her

04:59:28.030 --> 04:59:28.040 align:start position:0%
her
 
04:59:30.670 --> 04:59:30.680 align:start position:0%
mouth and over the course of the time
 
04:59:32.670 --> 04:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
I've been working with her the radiating
 
04:59:35.670 --> 04:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
pain has diminished she's gotten the
 
04:59:38.350 --> 04:59:38.360 align:start position:0%
full color of her skin is back range of
 
04:59:40.788 --> 04:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
motion is back
 
04:59:43.070 --> 04:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
and she's one of the reasons she
 
04:59:44.430 --> 04:59:44.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't take some of the opioid
 
04:59:46.990 --> 04:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
medications is because they dry you out
 
04:59:48.670 --> 04:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
so even though they're good for pain
 
04:59:52.110 --> 04:59:52.120 align:start position:0%
that makes the saliva worse um I've been
 
04:59:56.350 --> 04:59:56.360 align:start position:0%
seeing her over the the first 12 visits
 
04:59:56.360 --> 04:59:58.510 align:start position:0%
seeing her over the the first 12 visits
um

04:59:58.510 --> 04:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:00.990 --> 05:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
was reducing that pain and getting her
 
05:00:04.868 --> 05:00:04.878 align:start position:0%
back to normal and um she has now been
 
05:00:07.750 --> 05:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
with me for 3 years on her own accord
 
05:00:10.310 --> 05:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
and all of these are out of pocket she
 
05:00:13.590 --> 05:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
did have another radiation kind of reset
 
05:00:16.030 --> 05:00:16.040 align:start position:0%
she had came back to visit with me again
 
05:00:17.510 --> 05:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
and over the course of the three years
 
05:00:20.070 --> 05:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
that she's been with me she's had just
 
05:00:23.750 --> 05:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
under $55,000 in a of pocket costs but
 
05:00:25.190 --> 05:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
it's the only therapy that's been able
 
05:00:28.190 --> 05:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
to restore her
 
05:00:32.150 --> 05:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
function um a 28-year-old contractor who
 
05:00:33.230 --> 05:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
works on
 
05:00:36.788 --> 05:00:36.798 align:start position:0%
roofs and he came to me with severe um
 
05:00:39.350 --> 05:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
upper back pain and although insurance
 
05:00:41.948 --> 05:00:41.958 align:start position:0%
does cover acute and lower back pain
 
05:00:44.470 --> 05:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
they don't cover it unless you've had it
 
05:00:46.390 --> 05:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
for about 12
 
05:00:49.350 --> 05:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
weeks they don't cover upper back pain
 
05:00:51.548 --> 05:00:51.558 align:start position:0%
it's only for lower back
 
05:00:56.350 --> 05:00:56.360 align:start position:0%
pain and he came and said I can't go on
 
05:00:58.310 --> 05:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
any kind of medications because I need
 
05:01:00.948 --> 05:01:00.958 align:start position:0%
to work and be on the roof and be safe
 
05:01:03.548 --> 05:01:03.558 align:start position:0%
I'm also afraid of addiction I don't
 
05:01:05.830 --> 05:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
want to use any cannabis for the same
 
05:01:08.390 --> 05:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
reason within one visit I had his pain
 
05:01:10.390 --> 05:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
knocked down
 
05:01:12.430 --> 05:01:12.440 align:start position:0%
and managed to we talked about his
 
05:01:14.230 --> 05:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
stress we talked about his
 
05:01:17.150 --> 05:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
sleep and in just three visits he was
 
05:01:20.070 --> 05:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
back to work total cost of
 
05:01:24.270 --> 05:01:24.280 align:start position:0%
$240 a 26-year-old who had his I'm sorry
 
05:01:25.990 --> 05:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
to interrupt yeah um just in the
 
05:01:27.868 --> 05:01:27.878 align:start position:0%
consideration of time we have a lot of
 
05:01:29.788 --> 05:01:29.798 align:start position:0%
people coming behind you if you could
 
05:01:31.868 --> 05:01:31.878 align:start position:0%
just uh give us your final thoughts
 
05:01:35.830 --> 05:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll just um summarize
 
05:01:38.628 --> 05:01:38.638 align:start position:0%
that acupuncture needs part of the bill
 
05:01:41.070 --> 05:01:41.080 align:start position:0%
is talking about the repetition of
 
05:01:44.510 --> 05:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
things and having it qualified and one
 
05:01:46.830 --> 05:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
is we need more than one visit it needs
 
05:01:49.310 --> 05:01:49.320 align:start position:0%
to be covered 12 visits might be enough
 
05:01:51.390 --> 05:01:51.400 align:start position:0%
it might not be enough the limiting
 
05:01:53.470 --> 05:01:53.480 align:start position:0%
factors of having a licensed acupuncture
 
05:01:55.830 --> 05:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
or licensed practitioner is
 
05:02:01.868 --> 05:02:01.878 align:start position:0%
necessary um and um having a multimodal
 
05:02:04.470 --> 05:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
approach so that patients are able to
 
05:02:06.670 --> 05:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
choose so if one thing isn't working
 
05:02:09.430 --> 05:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
they can come and try something else and
 
05:02:10.830 --> 05:02:10.840 align:start position:0%
I'll take any
 
05:02:12.948 --> 05:02:12.958 align:start position:0%
questions all right I'm temporary chair
 
05:02:14.948 --> 05:02:14.958 align:start position:0%
for a few minutes here um any questions
 
05:02:17.110 --> 05:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
from the
 
05:02:20.548 --> 05:02:20.558 align:start position:0%
committee okay I think we have a lot of
 
05:02:23.750 --> 05:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you questions during the
 
05:02:27.628 --> 05:02:27.638 align:start position:0%
subcommittee all right uh next
 
05:02:31.788 --> 05:02:31.798 align:start position:0%
up uh we'll call John Jour am I saying
 
05:02:35.070 --> 05:02:35.080 align:start position:0%

dour and you're from the New Hampshire
 
05:02:40.310 --> 05:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
Psychological Association

05:02:44.150 --> 05:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chairman members of
 
05:02:45.230 --> 05:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
05:02:46.788 --> 05:02:46.798 align:start position:0%
John dejoy I'm here representing the New
 
05:02:48.590 --> 05:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Psychological Association and
 
05:02:50.948 --> 05:02:50.958 align:start position:0%
we are in fact pleased to support this
 
05:02:52.628 --> 05:02:52.638 align:start position:0%
legislation uh the New Hampshire
 
05:02:55.310 --> 05:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
Psychological Association is the
 
05:02:57.030 --> 05:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
membership Organization for licensed
 
05:02:59.750 --> 05:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
psychologists in the state of New
 
05:03:03.788 --> 05:03:03.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm I am not an expert on this
 
05:03:05.548 --> 05:03:05.558 align:start position:0%
but Dr Walter unfortunately was unable
 
05:03:06.830 --> 05:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
to make it and asked me to submit
 
05:03:08.788 --> 05:03:08.798 align:start position:0%
testimony which I'm going to do I'm
 
05:03:10.390 --> 05:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
going to excerpt one of two pieces of
 
05:03:12.990 --> 05:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
her testimony and then I'll end my my
 
05:03:16.270 --> 05:03:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:20.990 --> 05:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
point uh Dr Walder points out the
 
05:03:23.510 --> 05:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
importance of this bill for pain
 
05:03:25.628 --> 05:03:25.638 align:start position:0%
management she also points out the
 
05:03:27.310 --> 05:03:27.320 align:start position:0%
importance of the multidisciplinary
 
05:03:28.910 --> 05:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
approach which is taken in this
 
05:03:31.270 --> 05:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
legislation in fact those of you from
 
05:03:33.750 --> 05:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
last session probably remember uh the
 
05:03:36.670 --> 05:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
primary care Behavioral Health bill this
 
05:03:38.708 --> 05:03:38.718 align:start position:0%
actually utilizes pieces of primary care
 
05:03:40.990 --> 05:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health to have Physicians and
 
05:03:42.548 --> 05:03:42.558 align:start position:0%
therapists working together and we think
 
05:03:47.150 --> 05:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
that's a a terrific approach to this she
 
05:03:49.990 --> 05:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
mentions three other types of treatment
 
05:03:51.430 --> 05:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
which I'll read them but I'm not going
 
05:03:55.070 --> 05:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
to explain them pain catastrophizing
 
05:03:57.990 --> 05:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
mental defeat and psychosocial factors
 
05:04:00.390 --> 05:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
that apparently are important
 
05:04:01.830 --> 05:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
considerations in the treatment of
 
05:04:04.310 --> 05:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
trauma and she's looking at pain
 
05:04:05.590 --> 05:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
management as
 
05:04:10.750 --> 05:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
trauma um she also offers to provide the
 
05:04:12.910 --> 05:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
psychological the American Psychological
 
05:04:14.628 --> 05:04:14.638 align:start position:0%
association's clinical practice guide
 
05:04:17.070 --> 05:04:17.080 align:start position:0%
for treating chronic pain conditions she
 
05:04:18.910 --> 05:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
gives her email in here if anyone would
 
05:04:20.788 --> 05:04:20.798 align:start position:0%
like a copy of that you can email her
 
05:04:22.590 --> 05:04:22.600 align:start position:0%
and she'll send you a digital
 
05:04:28.670 --> 05:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
copy um and with that I will conclude my
 
05:04:31.110 --> 05:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
remarks all right great uh questions

may have heard that we are a national
 
05:05:21.430 --> 05:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
patient organization we have about
 
05:05:23.948 --> 05:05:23.958 align:start position:0%
35,000 members around the country people
 
05:05:27.350 --> 05:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
living with chronic pain um from all
 
05:05:30.270 --> 05:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
different conditions as you've heard a
 
05:05:32.948 --> 05:05:32.958 align:start position:0%
myriad of conditions P pull the
 
05:05:35.430 --> 05:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
microphone right up to your there sure
 
05:05:37.470 --> 05:05:37.480 align:start position:0%
and there's a YouTube audience so smile
 
05:05:40.190 --> 05:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
for the camera there okay thank you
 
05:05:43.150 --> 05:05:43.160 align:start position:0%
so uh as you've heard people have pain
 
05:05:45.548 --> 05:05:45.558 align:start position:0%
from a a myriad of conditions and
 
05:05:48.708 --> 05:05:48.718 align:start position:0%
serious injuries in fact the CDC has
 
05:05:51.548 --> 05:05:51.558 align:start position:0%
said in New Hampshire alone there are
 
05:05:55.070 --> 05:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
225,000 people living with chronic pain
 
05:05:55.080 --> 05:05:55.910 align:start position:0%
225,000 people living with chronic pain
and

05:05:55.910 --> 05:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:05:59.070 --> 05:05:59.080 align:start position:0%
79,000 of those have high impact chronic
 
05:06:02.310 --> 05:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
pain that means pain that interferes
 
05:06:04.230 --> 05:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
with your ability to function on a daily
 
05:06:07.430 --> 05:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
basis these people are devastated by
 
05:06:09.868 --> 05:06:09.878 align:start position:0%
their pain they can't work they can't
 
05:06:11.350 --> 05:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
take care of their family they can't
 
05:06:13.510 --> 05:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
take care of their children um we're
 
05:06:16.670 --> 05:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
talking Relentless 24/7 pain and where
 
05:06:19.430 --> 05:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
many of you were talking about um the
 
05:06:21.628 --> 05:06:21.638 align:start position:0%
cost of some of these treatments think
 
05:06:23.910 --> 05:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
about the ability to possibly go back to
 
05:06:27.030 --> 05:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
work to not be on disability pain is the
 
05:06:30.110 --> 05:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
number one cause of disability in this
 
05:06:34.070 --> 05:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
country um and so it is a huge burden
 
05:06:36.628 --> 05:06:36.638 align:start position:0%
and huge problem now many people here
 
05:06:39.830 --> 05:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
have talked about uh different approach
 
05:06:42.430 --> 05:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
for treating pain and I wanted to tell
 
05:06:45.190 --> 05:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
you about a task force that I sat on
 
05:06:47.190 --> 05:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
where this idea of multimodal pain
 
05:06:50.150 --> 05:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
treatment comes from and it's kind of uh
 
05:06:53.470 --> 05:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
this bill which we strongly support
 
05:06:57.670 --> 05:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
really backs that report and that is as
 
05:06:59.510 --> 05:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
the Director of policy and advocacy for
 
05:07:02.270 --> 05:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
us pain Foundation I'm often going to
 
05:07:04.708 --> 05:07:04.718 align:start position:0%
Capitol Hill and when the opard crisis
 
05:07:08.430 --> 05:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
hit a lot of Congress people said to us
 
05:07:10.350 --> 05:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
well what's the problem why don't we
 
05:07:12.070 --> 05:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
just get rid of
 
05:07:16.430 --> 05:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
opioids and basically what we said was
 
05:07:20.030 --> 05:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
what else are people going to do because
 
05:07:23.470 --> 05:07:23.480 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been a new medication for
 
05:07:26.150 --> 05:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
pain to come to the market in more than
 
05:07:28.548 --> 05:07:28.558 align:start position:0%
a decade and so you've got
 
05:07:31.390 --> 05:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
over-the-counter and then you've got
 
05:07:34.708 --> 05:07:34.718 align:start position:0%
opioids and in between doctors often use
 
05:07:38.270 --> 05:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
things off label but there's a Dar of
 
05:07:42.788 --> 05:07:42.798 align:start position:0%
medications for for severe pain and so
 
05:07:46.070 --> 05:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
when when this C happen Congress said to
 
05:07:48.868 --> 05:07:48.878 align:start position:0%
us well in this opioid Bill and there
 
05:07:50.990 --> 05:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
was a big Federal opioid Bill kill
 
05:07:54.270 --> 05:07:54.280 align:start position:0%
carara we want to appoint an expert of
 
05:07:56.868 --> 05:07:56.878 align:start position:0%
pain management specialist to tell us
 
05:07:59.708 --> 05:07:59.718 align:start position:0%
what is the best way to manage pain now
 
05:08:00.670 --> 05:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
in this
 
05:08:03.150 --> 05:08:03.160 align:start position:0%
country and basically I was appointed to
 
05:08:05.430 --> 05:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
that was the only patient everyone else
 
05:08:07.548 --> 05:08:07.558 align:start position:0%
were pain doctors it was headed up by a
 
05:08:10.150 --> 05:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
pain physician from Stanford
 
05:08:14.190 --> 05:08:14.200 align:start position:0%
University and our conclusion was what
 
05:08:16.948 --> 05:08:16.958 align:start position:0%
you've been hearing in 2019 because it
 
05:08:19.390 --> 05:08:19.400 align:start position:0%
has become the standard of pain
 
05:08:23.470 --> 05:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
treatment now and that is we looked at
 
05:08:25.310 --> 05:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
all the possible treatments that fall
 
05:08:27.788 --> 05:08:27.798 align:start position:0%
into five categories
 
05:08:30.390 --> 05:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
medication complimentary treatments
 
05:08:33.110 --> 05:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
Interventional procedures restorative
 
05:08:35.910 --> 05:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
treatments like PT and OT and behavioral
 
05:08:37.510 --> 05:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
treatments like the psychologist who
 
05:08:41.350 --> 05:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
just spoke here and the conclusion was
 
05:08:44.070 --> 05:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
you need to develop a treatment plan for
 
05:08:46.310 --> 05:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
each person with pain because there's so
 
05:08:48.190 --> 05:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
many different reasons people have pain
 
05:08:51.708 --> 05:08:51.718 align:start position:0%
and so many different types of pain and
 
05:08:54.948 --> 05:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
draw the treatments from any of these
 
05:08:57.070 --> 05:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
and in each of those categories we
 
05:09:00.190 --> 05:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
listed all the different treatments
 
05:09:03.230 --> 05:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
possible and that in fact really has
 
05:09:06.910 --> 05:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
become the standard of care which is
 
05:09:09.070 --> 05:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
even when it comes to medication you
 
05:09:09.080 --> 05:09:09.910 align:start position:0%
even when it comes to medication you
still

05:09:09.910 --> 05:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
still
 
05:09:11.990 --> 05:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's not a Panacea it doesn't take away
 
05:09:14.430 --> 05:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
the pain there is no cure for chronic
 
05:09:17.110 --> 05:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
pain it is now known to be a disease of
 
05:09:18.868 --> 05:09:18.878 align:start position:0%
the nervous system and
 
05:09:21.708 --> 05:09:21.718 align:start position:0%
brain and the best way to manage it is
 
05:09:24.310 --> 05:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
combining these treatments as Dr Nagel
 
05:09:27.670 --> 05:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
has said and finding the rest the best
 
05:09:29.948 --> 05:09:29.958 align:start position:0%
combination and the way that works and I
 
05:09:32.230 --> 05:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
heard this representative ask well what
 
05:09:33.788 --> 05:09:33.798 align:start position:0%
what happens with that how how do you
 
05:09:37.628 --> 05:09:37.638 align:start position:0%
solve pain if each treatment takes down
 
05:09:40.590 --> 05:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
your pain another 10 or 15 % and you
 
05:09:44.548 --> 05:09:44.558 align:start position:0%
combine those the difference between
 
05:09:47.350 --> 05:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
having pain at a super high level and
 
05:09:49.270 --> 05:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
50% of that pain might mean the
 
05:09:50.990 --> 05:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
difference between being able to work or
 
05:09:54.868 --> 05:09:54.878 align:start position:0%
not being on disability or not and so
 
05:09:57.270 --> 05:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
that really is the best way to manage
 
05:09:59.590 --> 05:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
pain yes the psychologist who spoke the
 
05:10:02.390 --> 05:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
acupuncture who spoke Dr Nel who
 
05:10:06.190 --> 05:10:06.200 align:start position:0%
spoke those help people but not everyone
 
05:10:08.470 --> 05:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
some people are helped by acupuncture I
 
05:10:10.150 --> 05:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
happen to live with pain the way I
 
05:10:12.430 --> 05:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
manage it is I take a medication called
 
05:10:14.868 --> 05:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
emat tripoline I limit the amount of
 
05:10:17.350 --> 05:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
time I'm upright my back was crushed and
 
05:10:19.788 --> 05:10:19.798 align:start position:0%
a serious injury you saw me laying down
 
05:10:23.030 --> 05:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
I alternate all day and I do a water
 
05:10:26.070 --> 05:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
water-based exercise program and with
 
05:10:30.390 --> 05:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
those things together I've managed learn
 
05:10:32.350 --> 05:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
to manage my life and that's what we
 
05:10:34.788 --> 05:10:34.798 align:start position:0%
mean by self-management we don't mean oh
 
05:10:37.150 --> 05:10:37.160 align:start position:0%
somebody has severe a severe migraine
 
05:10:40.230 --> 05:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
just manage it yourself we
 
05:10:42.510 --> 05:10:42.520 align:start position:0%
combine these different treatments learn
 
05:10:46.390 --> 05:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
your own body and figure out how you can
 
05:10:48.830 --> 05:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
bring down the level of pain such that
 
05:10:51.070 --> 05:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
you can function and that's what we do
 
05:10:53.670 --> 05:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
at us pain Foundation we expose people
 
05:10:55.788 --> 05:10:55.798 align:start position:0%
in the support groups like you've heard
 
05:10:57.830 --> 05:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
Bobby she's a terrific support group
 
05:11:00.510 --> 05:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
leader and we teach them how to combine
 
05:11:02.788 --> 05:11:02.798 align:start position:0%
these treatments to bring their pain
 
05:11:06.590 --> 05:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
down to a reasonable level and so that's
 
05:11:09.548 --> 05:11:09.558 align:start position:0%
why when the opioid crisis hit and all
 
05:11:12.430 --> 05:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
these people were being forc tapered off
 
05:11:14.750 --> 05:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
of opioids there were 5 to8 million
 
05:11:19.470 --> 05:11:19.480 align:start position:0%
people using opioids the ni said in 2014
 
05:11:21.788 --> 05:11:21.798 align:start position:0%
before the the CDC guidelines came in
 
05:11:25.390 --> 05:11:25.400 align:start position:0%
place that that has been reduced over
 
05:11:27.670 --> 05:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
60% and so many of those people were
 
05:11:31.150 --> 05:11:31.160 align:start position:0%
forced off and we heard from Desperate
 
05:11:33.990 --> 05:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
patients who were doing well on them but
 
05:11:36.788 --> 05:11:36.798 align:start position:0%
can no longer get them and doctors won't
 
05:11:39.270 --> 05:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
prescribe and we're not going back there
 
05:11:42.548 --> 05:11:42.558 align:start position:0%
really we need new Solutions and so
 
05:11:45.510 --> 05:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
right now while we're waiting for some
 
05:11:47.788 --> 05:11:47.798 align:start position:0%
new medications in the pipeline and
 
05:11:50.270 --> 05:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
we're very optimistic that new medic
 
05:11:52.548 --> 05:11:52.558 align:start position:0%
non-addictive medications are in the
 
05:11:55.548 --> 05:11:55.558 align:start position:0%
pipeline and coming because I think for
 
05:11:57.910 --> 05:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
pretty severe pain you need some sort of
 
05:11:59.670 --> 05:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
medication in combination with other
 
05:12:02.628 --> 05:12:02.638 align:start position:0%
things but really the best way is to
 
05:12:04.628 --> 05:12:04.638 align:start position:0%
manage pain by combining different
 
05:12:07.390 --> 05:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
things that work for you and that you
 
05:12:09.310 --> 05:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
know your physician should help you with
 
05:12:10.948 --> 05:12:10.958 align:start position:0%
those different things I found somebody
 
05:12:12.750 --> 05:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
that helped me and I combine those
 
05:12:14.948 --> 05:12:14.958 align:start position:0%
different things to manage my pain same
 
05:12:17.270 --> 05:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
thing with Bobby she couldn't be here
 
05:12:19.670 --> 05:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
unless she had learned behavioral
 
05:12:22.110 --> 05:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
techniques and other techniques to help
 
05:12:23.590 --> 05:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
manage her pain in addition to
 
05:12:27.070 --> 05:12:27.080 align:start position:0%
medication that she uses and so that's
 
05:12:29.670 --> 05:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
how we teach people to be functional and
 
05:12:32.990 --> 05:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
so this bill which we strongly
 
05:12:35.628 --> 05:12:35.638 align:start position:0%
support would enable people to get
 
05:12:38.470 --> 05:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
access to therapies that they can't get
 
05:12:40.948 --> 05:12:40.958 align:start position:0%
access to now because they can't afford
 
05:12:46.310 --> 05:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
them and why not try these non-invasive
 
05:12:46.320 --> 05:12:47.830 align:start position:0%
them and why not try these non-invasive
nonrisky

05:12:47.830 --> 05:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
nonrisky
 
05:12:50.510 --> 05:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
procedures as we've talked about surgery
 
05:12:53.390 --> 05:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
is often optional an option for people
 
05:12:56.628 --> 05:12:56.638 align:start position:0%
and I've seen many surgeries go right
 
05:12:58.830 --> 05:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
and I've seen many surgeries go wrong
 
05:13:01.390 --> 05:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
I've been leading a support group for 24
 
05:13:04.948 --> 05:13:04.958 align:start position:0%
years I've seen patient many patients
 
05:13:07.470 --> 05:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
who've had multiple back surgeries and
 
05:13:10.628 --> 05:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
they're still in pain and then a lot of
 
05:13:13.910 --> 05:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
people are are really reluctant to go to
 
05:13:16.510 --> 05:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
pain clinics because pain clinics these
 
05:13:20.030 --> 05:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
days only do Interventional procedures
 
05:13:22.390 --> 05:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
they've stopped prescribing they don't
 
05:13:24.910 --> 05:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
offer these other options because they
 
05:13:26.270 --> 05:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
don't have the practitioners and they
 
05:13:28.830 --> 05:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
don't have the insurance coverage and so
 
05:13:31.310 --> 05:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
most people when they go to pain clinics
 
05:13:31.320 --> 05:13:32.190 align:start position:0%
most people when they go to pain clinics
get

05:13:32.190 --> 05:13:32.200 align:start position:0%
get
 
05:13:35.190 --> 05:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
injections like anything else they help
 
05:13:37.628 --> 05:13:37.638 align:start position:0%
a small percentage maybe 10 or 15% of
 
05:13:39.590 --> 05:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
the people and the other people they
 
05:13:43.548 --> 05:13:43.558 align:start position:0%
don't help and what we see is insurance
 
05:13:46.708 --> 05:13:46.718 align:start position:0%
companies readily agreeing to pay for
 
05:13:49.910 --> 05:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
nerve blocks epidural injections all
 
05:13:53.390 --> 05:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
kind trigger point injections because
 
05:13:55.830 --> 05:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
that's covered and doctors get a fair
 
05:13:58.470 --> 05:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
amount of money for for doing those so
 
05:14:02.110 --> 05:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
they're willing to do those but yet
 
05:14:04.670 --> 05:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
these other things aren't covered so our
 
05:14:07.110 --> 05:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
feeling is this is a reasonable approach
 
05:14:11.948 --> 05:14:11.958 align:start position:0%
we're saying 12 visits a year and of of
 
05:14:15.788 --> 05:14:15.798 align:start position:0%
these things and why not try these less
 
05:14:20.070 --> 05:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
invasive less costly less rkly
 
05:14:22.670 --> 05:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
procedures like acupuncture like
 
05:14:25.310 --> 05:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
behavioral treatment in combination you
 
05:14:27.830 --> 05:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
know with some other things so in the
 
05:14:30.628 --> 05:14:30.638 align:start position:0%
long run we think it's less costly I
 
05:14:33.868 --> 05:14:33.878 align:start position:0%
have to tell you in 24 years of seeing
 
05:14:35.590 --> 05:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
more than 600 people that have come to
 
05:14:38.110 --> 05:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
this little support group that I lead
 
05:14:41.628 --> 05:14:41.638 align:start position:0%
everyone has been on Years Journey to
 
05:14:44.270 --> 05:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
Find help with chronic pain I mean it
 
05:14:47.628 --> 05:14:47.638 align:start position:0%
took me five years I had so many tests
 
05:14:49.510 --> 05:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
and different procedures and nerve
 
05:14:52.390 --> 05:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
blocks and injections and ultimately
 
05:14:55.190 --> 05:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
what helped me was a doctor who said you
 
05:14:57.750 --> 05:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
know let's try this water-based therapy
 
05:15:00.708 --> 05:15:00.718 align:start position:0%
let's try this medication and let's
 
05:15:02.830 --> 05:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
let's try limiting the amount of time
 
05:15:04.788 --> 05:15:04.798 align:start position:0%
you're upright and learning what your
 
05:15:07.430 --> 05:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
body needs right people with chronic
 
05:15:10.430 --> 05:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
migraines can't handle a lot of lights
 
05:15:12.788 --> 05:15:12.798 align:start position:0%
or certain Medic or certain foods that
 
05:15:15.708 --> 05:15:15.718 align:start position:0%
trigger them in combination with
 
05:15:18.628 --> 05:15:18.638 align:start position:0%
migraine medications and avoiding those
 
05:15:21.548 --> 05:15:21.558 align:start position:0%
things they learn to manage their pain
 
05:15:23.350 --> 05:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
so this is not at all what I was going
 
05:15:25.830 --> 05:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
to talk about but I figured an answer to
 
05:15:27.910 --> 05:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of your questions that have been
 
05:15:30.310 --> 05:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
risen about how's the best way to manage
 
05:15:33.150 --> 05:15:33.160 align:start position:0%
pain why you know this is this going to
 
05:15:36.670 --> 05:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
be more costly I've tried to answer some
 
05:15:38.670 --> 05:15:38.680 align:start position:0%
some of those things with with this
 
05:15:38.680 --> 05:15:39.788 align:start position:0%
some of those things with with this
answer

05:15:39.788 --> 05:15:39.798 align:start position:0%
answer
 
05:15:43.910 --> 05:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
and um I think Dr Nagel is a really
 
05:15:46.510 --> 05:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
terrific pain physician he's told you
 
05:15:49.750 --> 05:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
the truth he does Interventional but he
 
05:15:52.590 --> 05:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
has you know used these treatments and
 
05:15:55.230 --> 05:15:55.240 align:start position:0%
they've they've helped people and you
 
05:15:57.190 --> 05:15:57.200 align:start position:0%
know I think he's done a really
 
05:16:01.110 --> 05:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
thoughtful job with this bill and so you
 
05:16:04.628 --> 05:16:04.638 align:start position:0%
know we strongly support his efforts
 
05:16:07.750 --> 05:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
with this bill so I'm happy to take any
 
05:16:11.310 --> 05:16:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:14.628 --> 05:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:14.638 --> 05:16:17.270 align:start position:0%
 
much

05:16:17.270 --> 05:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
much
 
05:16:21.230 --> 05:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
okay we've done the pro now we'll do in
 
05:16:23.590 --> 05:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
between Michelle
 
05:16:27.190 --> 05:16:27.200 align:start position:0%
heon the H depart Department which takes
 
05:16:33.030 --> 05:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:35.270 --> 05:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
bill thank you everyone for the record
 
05:16:36.830 --> 05:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
my name is Michelle heat I'm director of
 
05:16:38.150 --> 05:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
life and health with the New Hampshire
 
05:16:40.310 --> 05:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
insurance department and I have here Dr
 
05:16:43.030 --> 05:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
Jason AIS who is our director of Health
 
05:16:45.590 --> 05:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
economics um as representative hunt said
 
05:16:47.230 --> 05:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
we don't take a position on this bill
 
05:16:48.430 --> 05:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
there's just a couple things we wanted
 
05:16:51.030 --> 05:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
to point out um with respect to our
 
05:16:54.350 --> 05:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal note so this statute um aims to
 
05:16:55.470 --> 05:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
just so you know we have not seen the
 
05:16:59.470 --> 05:16:59.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal note Oh I thought it was on it's
 
05:17:02.470 --> 05:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
on on on the bill that got posted I
 
05:17:04.270 --> 05:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
think on what we have right now is all
 
05:17:04.280 --> 05:17:05.190 align:start position:0%
think on what we have right now is all
the

05:17:05.190 --> 05:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:17:09.270 --> 05:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
zeros oh well when I looked it up they
 
05:17:11.150 --> 05:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
may have just gotten posted you went
 
05:17:14.510 --> 05:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
online yeah is it online I believe so
 
05:17:16.750 --> 05:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
because I just pulled it up okay great
 
05:17:20.110 --> 05:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
but I can walk you through it so um give
 
05:17:22.110 --> 05:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
us the highlights it aims to amend two
 
05:17:25.590 --> 05:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
different statutes 4156 by adding a new
 
05:17:27.590 --> 05:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
um section in
 
05:17:31.030 --> 05:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
41518 so that's individual and group to
 
05:17:33.510 --> 05:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
the extent this creates new mandates for
 
05:17:36.510 --> 05:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
the individual and small group Market um
 
05:17:40.390 --> 05:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
those are benefits in addition to um ehb
 
05:17:41.670 --> 05:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
in some respects some of the stuff
 
05:17:43.230 --> 05:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned in this bill is already
 
05:17:45.310 --> 05:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
covered by insurance but I think there's
 
05:17:47.708 --> 05:17:47.718 align:start position:0%
some areas that are not and are not part
 
05:17:50.030 --> 05:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
of our Benchmark plan so to the extent
 
05:17:52.350 --> 05:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
it expands what we're already required
 
05:17:55.670 --> 05:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
to offer um it could be subject from to
 
05:17:58.030 --> 05:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
Def frail by the state and that's a cost
 
05:17:59.670 --> 05:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
that the state would have to take on
 
05:18:01.628 --> 05:18:01.638 align:start position:0%
it's indeterminable because we have no
 
05:18:04.230 --> 05:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
idea of estimating what that would be um
 
05:18:08.590 --> 05:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
we can do a mandate analysis but um that
 
05:18:10.350 --> 05:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
would would require you guys to direct
 
05:18:12.030 --> 05:18:12.040 align:start position:0%
us to do it and those typically cost a
 
05:18:14.190 --> 05:18:14.200 align:start position:0%
department between 20 and $40,000 to
 
05:18:17.110 --> 05:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
conduct a mandate analysis so we'
 
05:18:19.830 --> 05:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
encourage you to do that sparingly um
 
05:18:22.030 --> 05:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
another aspect of this bill is that
 
05:18:24.230 --> 05:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
there's a requirement that they file
 
05:18:27.430 --> 05:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
that um carers make certain filings with
 
05:18:30.350 --> 05:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
us and that we would approve um some of
 
05:18:33.910 --> 05:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
these filings as um clinical guidelines
 
05:18:37.510 --> 05:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
we do not have expertise um on staff to
 
05:18:41.070 --> 05:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
review any kind of um medical necessity
 
05:18:42.910 --> 05:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
type things or to weigh in on the
 
05:18:45.510 --> 05:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
medical appropriateness of any kind of
 
05:18:46.948 --> 05:18:46.958 align:start position:0%
clinical guidelines so that would be
 
05:18:48.230 --> 05:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
something that would be difficult for us
 
05:18:50.990 --> 05:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
to approve and we would need probably
 
05:18:53.670 --> 05:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
$250,000 in addition to our budget to
 
05:18:55.830 --> 05:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
Outsource this work to the appropriate
 
05:18:58.110 --> 05:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
um vendor have a medical director on
 
05:19:00.150 --> 05:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
staff right yeah we wouldn't be able to
 
05:19:02.110 --> 05:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
hire one but we can Outsource some of
 
05:19:03.590 --> 05:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
this work I don't think it's a full-time
 
05:19:05.830 --> 05:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
job but um we could get a vendor to do
 
05:19:07.868 --> 05:19:07.878 align:start position:0%
it um but it's going to cost money that
 
05:19:10.230 --> 05:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
is currently um not accounted for in our
 
05:19:11.830 --> 05:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
current budget so there is an added
 
05:19:13.628 --> 05:19:13.638 align:start position:0%
expense there so I think those are some
 
05:19:15.110 --> 05:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
of the highlights and Jason do you want
 
05:19:21.030 --> 05:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:23.230 --> 05:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
questions great thank
 
05:19:23.240 --> 05:19:27.230 align:start position:0%
questions great thank
you

05:19:27.230 --> 05:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:31.830 --> 05:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
okay okay now we have the dark throwers
 
05:19:34.430 --> 05:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
all right uh Andrew
 
05:19:43.150 --> 05:19:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:44.430 --> 05:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
I was going to say you were my favorite
 
05:19:46.390 --> 05:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
Senator but I see I have another senator
 
05:19:50.030 --> 05:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:54.750 --> 05:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
room I get two now well um Dr Nagel has
 
05:19:57.390 --> 05:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
a top 10 of friends so long as
 
05:20:00.350 --> 05:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh Senator Kev and I make your top five
 
05:20:02.510 --> 05:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
Senators we're good with that good
 
05:20:05.868 --> 05:20:05.878 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh my name is Ander Hosmer um
 
05:20:07.670 --> 05:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
today I sit before you representing
 
05:20:09.230 --> 05:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
Harvard Pilgrim
 
05:20:12.190 --> 05:20:12.200 align:start position:0%
Healthcare 32 which is New Hampshire's
 
05:20:15.190 --> 05:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
largest nonprofit insurer so I will try
 
05:20:17.070 --> 05:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
to keep my remarks brief knowing this is
 
05:20:18.670 --> 05:20:18.680 align:start position:0%
going to subcommittee and there's still
 
05:20:20.788 --> 05:20:20.798 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of work to do but I will
 
05:20:22.750 --> 05:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
say to all of you uh Mr chair our
 
05:20:24.788 --> 05:20:24.798 align:start position:0%
members Harvard Pilgrim strongly
 
05:20:26.868 --> 05:20:26.878 align:start position:0%
supports Pain Management
 
05:20:30.270 --> 05:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
Services um that are alternatives to
 
05:20:32.590 --> 05:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
opioids however uh we believe this bill
 
05:20:34.990 --> 05:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
is unnecessary because insurers already
 
05:20:36.868 --> 05:20:36.878 align:start position:0%
cover a wide range of pain management
 
05:20:39.430 --> 05:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
treatment options including most of the
 
05:20:41.628 --> 05:20:41.638 align:start position:0%
services listed in this
 
05:20:43.948 --> 05:20:43.958 align:start position:0%
bill we support a wide range of
 
05:20:45.390 --> 05:20:45.400 align:start position:0%
evidence-based treatments for pain
 
05:20:48.110 --> 05:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
management as alternatives to opioids
 
05:20:50.788 --> 05:20:50.798 align:start position:0%
Harvard Pilgrim uh in its robust array
 
05:20:52.830 --> 05:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
of programs covers things like physical
 
05:20:54.868 --> 05:20:54.878 align:start position:0%
therapy and occupational therapy
 
05:20:57.190 --> 05:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
chiropractic care and acupuncture
 
05:20:58.788 --> 05:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
behavioral health care including
 
05:21:00.750 --> 05:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
counseling and cognitive behavioral
 
05:21:03.510 --> 05:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
therapy while we do not cover meditation
 
05:21:05.628 --> 05:21:05.638 align:start position:0%
though through external providers
 
05:21:08.070 --> 05:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
mindfulness meditation resources are
 
05:21:09.948 --> 05:21:09.958 align:start position:0%
available on our website and accessible
 
05:21:12.230 --> 05:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
to the general public it's not just for
 
05:21:15.510 --> 05:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
our members the resources include essays
 
05:21:18.430 --> 05:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
about uses of mindfulness for managing
 
05:21:21.590 --> 05:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
chronic pain and recordings of guided
 
05:21:24.270 --> 05:21:24.280 align:start position:0%
medic uh meditations excuse
 
05:21:27.788 --> 05:21:27.798 align:start position:0%
me though sometimes portrayed as
 
05:21:30.270 --> 05:21:30.280 align:start position:0%
hardened of heart certainly listening to
 
05:21:32.628 --> 05:21:32.638 align:start position:0%
people testify today it's easy to feel a
 
05:21:34.150 --> 05:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
great deal of empathy for folks who are
 
05:21:36.708 --> 05:21:36.718 align:start position:0%
dealing with chronic pain and I will say
 
05:21:40.708 --> 05:21:40.718 align:start position:0%
to you that um as part of our mission is
 
05:21:42.230 --> 05:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
um at Harvard
 
05:21:44.670 --> 05:21:44.680 align:start position:0%
Pilgrim is that patients must receive
 
05:21:47.030 --> 05:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
the highest quality health care and
 
05:21:50.510 --> 05:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
improving outcomes all the time um I
 
05:21:52.948 --> 05:21:52.958 align:start position:0%
also let you know we also provide
 
05:21:54.548 --> 05:21:54.558 align:start position:0%
coverage from many FDA approved
 
05:21:56.390 --> 05:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
prescription non-opioid drug products
 
05:21:57.830 --> 05:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
that are effective pain management
 
05:22:00.230 --> 05:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
Alternatives and have a lesser potential
 
05:22:03.628 --> 05:22:03.638 align:start position:0%
for misuse than opioid drug products
 
05:22:06.270 --> 05:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
including uh topical analgesics and
 
05:22:08.948 --> 05:22:08.958 align:start position:0%
costero steroids excuse me Harvard
 
05:22:12.190 --> 05:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
Pilgrim already has an easily accessible
 
05:22:14.830 --> 05:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
member facing website specifically
 
05:22:17.310 --> 05:22:17.320 align:start position:0%
addressing pain management that links
 
05:22:18.990 --> 05:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
members directly to their specific
 
05:22:22.030 --> 05:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
benefits page so they can understand the
 
05:22:24.670 --> 05:22:24.680 align:start position:0%
coverage that they
 
05:22:26.948 --> 05:22:26.958 align:start position:0%
have also significant in this is
 
05:22:28.830 --> 05:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
insurers design plans that meet the
 
05:22:31.310 --> 05:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
needs of their membership while every
 
05:22:34.628 --> 05:22:34.638 align:start position:0%
plan may not cover each Pain Management
 
05:22:37.030 --> 05:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
Service there are a variety of plan
 
05:22:39.548 --> 05:22:39.558 align:start position:0%
types with varying benefit designs
 
05:22:41.590 --> 05:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
allowing members to choose a plan that
 
05:22:44.628 --> 05:22:44.638 align:start position:0%
best meets their needs this allows
 
05:22:46.150 --> 05:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
insurers to meet the needs of their
 
05:22:49.270 --> 05:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
membership while also keeping costs as
 
05:22:52.110 --> 05:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
affordable as
 
05:22:53.910 --> 05:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
possible while we appreciate
 
05:22:55.750 --> 05:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
Representatives Nagel representative
 
05:22:57.628 --> 05:22:57.638 align:start position:0%
Nagel's goal of increasing access in a
 
05:22:59.628 --> 05:22:59.638 align:start position:0%
cost- effective manner there will be an
 
05:23:02.470 --> 05:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
increased cost when any new benefit is
 
05:23:05.190 --> 05:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
required or mandated even if there is a
 
05:23:07.670 --> 05:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
low cost with this mandate one thing
 
05:23:09.430 --> 05:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
that we take into consideration is the
 
05:23:11.750 --> 05:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
cost of other mandate the state passes
 
05:23:14.110 --> 05:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
this session and add that cost to the
 
05:23:16.590 --> 05:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
mandates passed in previous years when
 
05:23:19.110 --> 05:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
considered in totality it all adds up to
 
05:23:21.470 --> 05:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
a significant cost to employers and
 
05:23:25.070 --> 05:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
consumers in this state I think finally
 
05:23:27.470 --> 05:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
as well we need to consider the ability
 
05:23:28.990 --> 05:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
of some of these provider types to
 
05:23:31.470 --> 05:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
submit claims for their services for
 
05:23:34.350 --> 05:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
example this mandate would require us to
 
05:23:34.360 --> 05:23:35.310 align:start position:0%
example this mandate would require us to
cover

05:23:35.310 --> 05:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
cover
 
05:23:37.670 --> 05:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
massage while massage therapists are
 
05:23:39.430 --> 05:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
licensed in New Hampshire and certainly
 
05:23:41.230 --> 05:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
do provide benefits to those with pain
 
05:23:43.948 --> 05:23:43.958 align:start position:0%
management in their pain management are
 
05:23:45.350 --> 05:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
they really in a position to submit
 
05:23:47.430 --> 05:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
claims for reimbursement through our
 
05:23:50.230 --> 05:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
operating system if not it'll be
 
05:23:52.230 --> 05:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
challenging for Harvard Pilgrim to build
 
05:23:54.548 --> 05:23:54.558 align:start position:0%
an adequate Network that satisfies some
 
05:23:56.628 --> 05:23:56.638 align:start position:0%
of these sole providers or smaller
 
05:24:00.270 --> 05:24:00.280 align:start position:0%
practices um with that I will conclude
 
05:24:01.788 --> 05:24:01.798 align:start position:0%
my testimony on behalf of Harvard
 
05:24:04.070 --> 05:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
Pilgrim healthare I'm happy to take any
 
05:24:06.990 --> 05:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:10.670 --> 05:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
have uh we just want your
 
05:24:12.830 --> 05:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
testimony I will provide it at some
 
05:24:13.910 --> 05:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
point here
 
05:24:17.868 --> 05:24:17.878 align:start position:0%
it's in turn absolutely any questions
 
05:24:20.868 --> 05:24:20.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you chair will
 
05:24:27.830 --> 05:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:30.190 --> 05:24:30.200 align:start position:0%
Anthem thank you chairman hunt members
 
05:24:31.350 --> 05:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Sabrina
 
05:24:32.590 --> 05:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
Dunlap I'm director of government
 
05:24:33.868 --> 05:24:33.878 align:start position:0%
relations for
 
05:24:37.150 --> 05:24:37.160 align:start position:0%
Anthem um and I just wanted to say we've
 
05:24:38.990 --> 05:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
been working on this bill or a version
 
05:24:40.070 --> 05:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
of this bill for many years I was
 
05:24:41.868 --> 05:24:41.878 align:start position:0%
talking to rep Nel about when did this
 
05:24:45.070 --> 05:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
first appear I think it was 21 or 22 um
 
05:24:46.990 --> 05:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
and I I think the bill has come a long
 
05:24:48.190 --> 05:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
way and certainly we've been part of
 
05:24:49.390 --> 05:24:49.400 align:start position:0%
work groups and had very good
 
05:24:51.788 --> 05:24:51.798 align:start position:0%
discussions about these issues um I
 
05:24:53.590 --> 05:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
think there's still problems with it
 
05:24:56.030 --> 05:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
I'll try to be brief I Echo much of what
 
05:24:58.830 --> 05:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
um Andrew already said but first off
 
05:25:00.230 --> 05:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
again we already cover many of the
 
05:25:02.070 --> 05:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
services listed here Chiropractic
 
05:25:05.270 --> 05:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
acupuncture act CBT and and others as
 
05:25:08.708 --> 05:25:08.718 align:start position:0%
well um and you know we want members to
 
05:25:11.030 --> 05:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
have access to these sort of alternative
 
05:25:13.270 --> 05:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
treatments I think there's only so much
 
05:25:14.990 --> 05:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
you can do as an insurance company and
 
05:25:17.030 --> 05:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
at some point it comes down to Providers
 
05:25:19.390 --> 05:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
and what are they pushing um there's a
 
05:25:21.230 --> 05:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
bunch of practical issues and one I
 
05:25:23.470 --> 05:25:23.480 align:start position:0%
would mention is network problems I know
 
05:25:25.750 --> 05:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
acupuncture is covered we do have
 
05:25:27.390 --> 05:25:27.400 align:start position:0%
challenges trying to get acupuncturist
 
05:25:30.190 --> 05:25:30.200 align:start position:0%
in network um we can't force them into
 
05:25:31.948 --> 05:25:31.958 align:start position:0%
our Network so that's just a practical
 
05:25:33.628 --> 05:25:33.638 align:start position:0%
problem I suspect would play out with
 
05:25:36.590 --> 05:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
others you know like massage therapists
 
05:25:39.708 --> 05:25:39.718 align:start position:0%
um again some of these services are not
 
05:25:41.628 --> 05:25:41.638 align:start position:0%
exactly Medical in nature like
 
05:25:43.548 --> 05:25:43.558 align:start position:0%
mindfulness um I know yoga is probably
 
05:25:44.788 --> 05:25:44.798 align:start position:0%
going to be taken out but how do you
 
05:25:47.430 --> 05:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
define these things um there's licensing
 
05:25:50.548 --> 05:25:50.558 align:start position:0%
issues there's the network problem um
 
05:25:51.750 --> 05:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
how do you Bill and code for these
 
05:25:53.150 --> 05:25:53.160 align:start position:0%
Services many of the services are
 
05:25:54.868 --> 05:25:54.878 align:start position:0%
self-directed by the member so I'm not
 
05:25:57.830 --> 05:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
sure how you account for that um there's
 
05:25:59.350 --> 05:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
some issues with the bill being too Brad
 
05:26:00.430 --> 05:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
I know some of those things have already
 
05:26:03.150 --> 05:26:03.160 align:start position:0%
been discussed um I would just flag the
 
05:26:05.788 --> 05:26:05.798 align:start position:0%
effective date I think is July 1st 2025
 
05:26:09.590 --> 05:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
which would be a challenge and and um
 
05:26:10.990 --> 05:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
and I'd also add this will only apply in
 
05:26:12.548 --> 05:26:12.558 align:start position:0%
the fully insured Market which I know we
 
05:26:14.590 --> 05:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
talk about a lot but you know it's more
 
05:26:16.270 --> 05:26:16.280 align:start position:0%
pressure on a small segment of the
 
05:26:18.270 --> 05:26:18.280 align:start position:0%
overall Insurance market and I think
 
05:26:19.708 --> 05:26:19.718 align:start position:0%
it's worth noting when people say like
 
05:26:21.230 --> 05:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
these things aren't covered it really
 
05:26:23.350 --> 05:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
depends on the type of plan somebody has
 
05:26:25.390 --> 05:26:25.400 align:start position:0%
um it varies widely by plan and
 
05:26:27.150 --> 05:26:27.160 align:start position:0%
certainly if somebody had a self-insured
 
05:26:29.190 --> 05:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
plan this bill would not change
 
05:26:30.470 --> 05:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
potentially would not change anything
 
05:26:33.390 --> 05:26:33.400 align:start position:0%
for them because it would not apply um
 
05:26:35.470 --> 05:26:35.480 align:start position:0%
so you know happy to continue the
 
05:26:38.070 --> 05:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
conversations and um try to be helpful
 
05:26:40.190 --> 05:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
in any way we can on this bill but I
 
05:26:43.110 --> 05:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
don't think insurance coverage is the
 
05:26:44.830 --> 05:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
problem and I don't think it's the
 
05:26:46.948 --> 05:26:46.958 align:start position:0%
solution um I think again this is
 
05:26:48.628 --> 05:26:48.638 align:start position:0%
probably more of like a provider
 
05:26:50.310 --> 05:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
education and sort of culture around how
 
05:26:52.350 --> 05:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
we treat pain so thank you for letting
 
05:26:56.230 --> 05:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:58.910 --> 05:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
questions right thank you thank you one
 
05:27:08.510 --> 05:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:10.390 --> 05:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and good afternoon
 
05:27:12.190 --> 05:27:12.200 align:start position:0%
members of the House Commerce Committee
 
05:27:14.310 --> 05:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Paula Rogers
 
05:27:16.590 --> 05:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm here on behalf of ahip America's
 
05:27:18.910 --> 05:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
health insurance plans which is trade
 
05:27:20.788 --> 05:27:20.798 align:start position:0%
Association of Health insurers and
 
05:27:22.430 --> 05:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
you've heard from a couple of members
 
05:27:23.788 --> 05:27:23.798 align:start position:0%
Anthem and
 
05:27:27.430 --> 05:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
Harvard um I was interested in
 
05:27:27.440 --> 05:27:28.910 align:start position:0%
Harvard um I was interested in
representative

05:27:28.910 --> 05:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:27:33.270 --> 05:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
Hunt's comment about perhaps some way
 
05:27:36.750 --> 05:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
to enclose what's going on here in a
 
05:27:40.070 --> 05:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
sort of cogent way that would deliver
 
05:27:42.708 --> 05:27:42.718 align:start position:0%
some results and so before the hearing
 
05:27:45.788 --> 05:27:45.798 align:start position:0%
because I've been involved years back on
 
05:27:48.390 --> 05:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
the very same issue with Dr Nagel I
 
05:27:51.350 --> 05:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
spoke with him and um I said you know I
 
05:27:52.628 --> 05:27:52.638 align:start position:0%
know there was a bill I looked at the
 
05:27:55.230 --> 05:27:55.240 align:start position:0%
legislative history from I think was two
 
05:27:56.990 --> 05:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
years ago it went to interim study and
 
05:27:58.910 --> 05:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
then now recommended for further
 
05:28:01.030 --> 05:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
legislation and the bill has made
 
05:28:03.590 --> 05:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
significant progress it was rather
 
05:28:06.548 --> 05:28:06.558 align:start position:0%
expansive and difficult to see how you
 
05:28:08.390 --> 05:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
could fit the framework of that b fill
 
05:28:11.270 --> 05:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
into a regulatory setting and I'm having
 
05:28:13.750 --> 05:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
sort of a continuing problem problem
 
05:28:17.070 --> 05:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
wondering what is going on that we can't
 
05:28:21.150 --> 05:28:21.160 align:start position:0%
do something so I I'm hoping I can leave
 
05:28:23.350 --> 05:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
copies maybe later this week but I
 
05:28:25.310 --> 05:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
Googled about and I found a journal of
 
05:28:27.830 --> 05:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
American Medical Association
 
05:28:30.310 --> 05:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
article very recently published I think
 
05:28:32.470 --> 05:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
it was October of this year but released
 
05:28:36.190 --> 05:28:36.200 align:start position:0%
for publication earlier in 24 and it has
 
05:28:39.150 --> 05:28:39.160 align:start position:0%
a survey of states that have been doing
 
05:28:41.750 --> 05:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
just what this committee is trying to do
 
05:28:44.190 --> 05:28:44.200 align:start position:0%
and there are only seven of them that
 
05:28:47.830 --> 05:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
they picked up and none of them has
 
05:28:52.430 --> 05:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
really reached a a place where they feel
 
05:28:53.868 --> 05:28:53.878 align:start position:0%
they've listened to everybody and
 
05:28:55.430 --> 05:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
they've come up with something that will
 
05:28:56.868 --> 05:28:56.878 align:start position:0%
make a difference or they're not
 
05:28:59.510 --> 05:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
confident enough that they have so when
 
05:29:02.750 --> 05:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
I was listening to Dr Nagel it suddenly
 
05:29:04.390 --> 05:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
occurred to me and then it was prompted
 
05:29:08.150 --> 05:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
by chairman Hunt's comment
 
05:29:09.390 --> 05:29:09.400 align:start position:0%
some of you were probably in a
 
05:29:12.150 --> 05:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
legislative setting when Integrated
 
05:29:14.230 --> 05:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
Primary Care was discussed that is
 
05:29:16.670 --> 05:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
weaving Behavioral Health Care into the
 
05:29:18.190 --> 05:29:18.200 align:start position:0%
primary care
 
05:29:21.750 --> 05:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
setting I heard statistics today and
 
05:29:23.548 --> 05:29:23.558 align:start position:0%
I've been Googling about it found the
 
05:29:25.788 --> 05:29:25.798 align:start position:0%
number of people that are are suffering
 
05:29:28.788 --> 05:29:28.798 align:start position:0%
with chronic pain looking for treatments
 
05:29:31.868 --> 05:29:31.878 align:start position:0%
and so if there are that many people why
 
05:29:33.708 --> 05:29:33.718 align:start position:0%
isn't there some
 
05:29:35.830 --> 05:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
interprofessional discussion going on
 
05:29:38.708 --> 05:29:38.718 align:start position:0%
amongst providers including Dr n
 
05:29:40.670 --> 05:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
including primary care
 
05:29:43.270 --> 05:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
physicians if a patient comes to you
 
05:29:44.788 --> 05:29:44.798 align:start position:0%
which is where most people go because
 
05:29:46.270 --> 05:29:46.280 align:start position:0%
they start with their primary care
 
05:29:49.110 --> 05:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
doctor and they have chronic pain yes
 
05:29:51.150 --> 05:29:51.160 align:start position:0%
you can see them but you need to already
 
05:29:53.470 --> 05:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
have in your mind as a professional with
 
05:29:56.150 --> 05:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
an integrated view of the world if this
 
05:29:59.190 --> 05:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
person has pain do I begin to tell him
 
05:30:02.070 --> 05:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
or her what the alternatives are and do
 
05:30:05.190 --> 05:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
I deal with in an integrated beh
 
05:30:07.628 --> 05:30:07.638 align:start position:0%
behavioral situation there's a care
 
05:30:07.638 --> 05:30:08.990 align:start position:0%
behavioral situation there's a care
manager

05:30:08.990 --> 05:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
manager
 
05:30:11.350 --> 05:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
there's the specialist there's the
 
05:30:15.110 --> 05:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
primary care provider that needs to
 
05:30:17.948 --> 05:30:17.958 align:start position:0%
Encompass this challenge because I was
 
05:30:20.270 --> 05:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
shocked when I saw the number of people
 
05:30:23.270 --> 05:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
that are chronically in discomfort so
 
05:30:26.070 --> 05:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
when I spoke with Dr Nagel I indicated
 
05:30:30.270 --> 05:30:30.280 align:start position:0%
that an ahip would be happy to continue
 
05:30:33.390 --> 05:30:33.400 align:start position:0%
in a conversation and I don't think
 
05:30:34.788 --> 05:30:34.798 align:start position:0%
people should sort of give up and throw
 
05:30:36.390 --> 05:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
up their hands there may be something
 
05:30:39.110 --> 05:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
that can be done that would sort of
 
05:30:43.070 --> 05:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
begin to formulate something to address
 
05:30:44.830 --> 05:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
the people that came here and testified
 
05:30:47.830 --> 05:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
who are struggling so I'd be happy to
 
05:30:49.310 --> 05:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
answer any questions but I I don't have
 
05:30:54.190 --> 05:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:58.070 --> 05:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
so so I I was thinking
 
05:31:02.350 --> 05:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
um that the the best way if we were to
 
05:31:07.230 --> 05:31:07.240 align:start position:0%
try to direct patients to go think about
 
05:31:11.510 --> 05:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
would be through co-pays and
 
05:31:14.628 --> 05:31:14.638 align:start position:0%
deductibles and and they show you know
 
05:31:17.788 --> 05:31:17.798 align:start position:0%
and with using those as a way for a
 
05:31:21.270 --> 05:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
patient to help them see that uh doing
 
05:31:23.628 --> 05:31:23.638 align:start position:0%
something alternate you know would be a
 
05:31:27.110 --> 05:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
better way to do that um rather than
 
05:31:29.788 --> 05:31:29.798 align:start position:0%
going directly to the
 
05:31:32.590 --> 05:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
surgeon exactly and so in a primary care
 
05:31:36.310 --> 05:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
setting with the sort of umbrella of
 
05:31:37.990 --> 05:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
understanding that this person presents
 
05:31:41.510 --> 05:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
with a discomfort and chronic pain pain
 
05:31:43.670 --> 05:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
what are my Alternatives out of primary
 
05:31:46.270 --> 05:31:46.280 align:start position:0%
care and have I sort of internalized
 
05:31:48.628 --> 05:31:48.638 align:start position:0%
that and can I Aid well we can't expect
 
05:31:51.110 --> 05:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
so much of the primary being being know
 
05:31:52.390 --> 05:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about co-pays and
 
05:31:55.270 --> 05:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
deductibles okay no but that that that
 
05:31:58.390 --> 05:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
they refer to the in terms the uh the
 
05:32:02.590 --> 05:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
insurance company um would then uh have
 
05:32:04.948 --> 05:32:04.958 align:start position:0%
some or maybe have something with the
 
05:32:06.948 --> 05:32:06.958 align:start position:0%
primary career's office or have
 
05:32:10.548 --> 05:32:10.558 align:start position:0%
something that some notication where
 
05:32:13.470 --> 05:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
they would get a list of how of how we
 
05:32:15.948 --> 05:32:15.958 align:start position:0%
want to direct them to think about doing
 
05:32:18.150 --> 05:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
these Alternatives before going to that
 
05:32:20.150 --> 05:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
surgeon I think that's the sort of
 
05:32:22.868 --> 05:32:22.878 align:start position:0%
discussion that we should engage in
 
05:32:25.390 --> 05:32:25.400 align:start position:0%
because we can be creative and creative
 
05:32:28.590 --> 05:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
using then those and and our carrots is
 
05:32:31.390 --> 05:32:31.400 align:start position:0%
the is the or or in this case it could
 
05:32:33.670 --> 05:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
be the hammer but that in terms of the
 
05:32:35.830 --> 05:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
deductibles and coopas is to get them to
 
05:32:39.590 --> 05:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
think you know one versus the other
 
05:32:42.230 --> 05:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
initially that's what I'm thinking thank
 
05:32:44.948 --> 05:32:44.958 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much whoops yes
 
05:32:49.070 --> 05:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
represent Gibbs thank you Mr chairman
 
05:32:53.270 --> 05:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
um if I understood correctly um you were
 
05:32:55.190 --> 05:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
talking about a large part of the
 
05:32:57.548 --> 05:32:57.558 align:start position:0%
problem being lack of coordination among
 
05:32:59.350 --> 05:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
providers did I understand that
 
05:33:01.510 --> 05:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
correctly I think there needs to be more
 
05:33:05.470 --> 05:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
inter professional discussion about pain
 
05:33:08.310 --> 05:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
because I I was shocked when I heard the
 
05:33:11.270 --> 05:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
statistics so primary care physicians
 
05:33:13.110 --> 05:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
must encounter it
 
05:33:16.310 --> 05:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
frequently um followup for the question
 
05:33:19.310 --> 05:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
may inquire thank you uh do you have any
 
05:33:21.470 --> 05:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
suggestions as to how that coordination
 
05:33:23.948 --> 05:33:23.958 align:start position:0%
could be done well I think that's a
 
05:33:25.470 --> 05:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
question that should go back to the
 
05:33:28.350 --> 05:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
professionals because if it's a
 
05:33:32.230 --> 05:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
challenge for caregiving then just like
 
05:33:34.750 --> 05:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health which what four five
 
05:33:37.788 --> 05:33:37.798 align:start position:0%
six years ago the federal government
 
05:33:39.708 --> 05:33:39.718 align:start position:0%
developed a healthc care model for an
 
05:33:41.548 --> 05:33:41.558 align:start position:0%
integrated practice for behavioral
 
05:33:43.750 --> 05:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
health problems which have a similar
 
05:33:46.070 --> 05:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
kind of in fact there there's Behavioral
 
05:33:47.830 --> 05:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
Health counseling that's helpful for
 
05:33:49.868 --> 05:33:49.878 align:start position:0%
pain management but it's a it's sort of
 
05:33:52.390 --> 05:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
a more nebulous thing you're treating
 
05:33:55.230 --> 05:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
and there are an array of opportunities
 
05:33:58.030 --> 05:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
to have a positive effect well then
 
05:34:00.948 --> 05:34:00.958 align:start position:0%
inter professionally that ought to be
 
05:34:03.948 --> 05:34:03.958 align:start position:0%
more that the primary care practice
 
05:34:05.628 --> 05:34:05.638 align:start position:0%
ought to be more comfortable with
 
05:34:07.948 --> 05:34:07.958 align:start position:0%
understanding the array of things and of
 
05:34:10.230 --> 05:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
course it comes up then the insurance
 
05:34:12.390 --> 05:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
coverage sometimes is a difficult thing
 
05:34:14.548 --> 05:34:14.558 align:start position:0%
and that's a coordination issue with a
 
05:34:16.868 --> 05:34:16.878 align:start position:0%
office manager so I don't I don't have
 
05:34:19.070 --> 05:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
the answers I just know something's
 
05:34:21.430 --> 05:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
missing thank
 
05:34:26.270 --> 05:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
you so thank you Paul okay thank you so
 
05:34:28.310 --> 05:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
represent we do have one more Bill we
 
05:34:29.910 --> 05:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
got to get through here but this will be
 
05:34:33.110 --> 05:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
really quick okay um so the only reason
 
05:34:36.110 --> 05:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
I'm here is to solve that problem you
 
05:34:38.390 --> 05:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
have to speak to the oh yeah yeah sorry
 
05:34:40.230 --> 05:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
is to solve that problem there and
 
05:34:42.150 --> 05:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
there's a number of moving pieces that
 
05:34:44.190 --> 05:34:44.200 align:start position:0%
are ongoing right now to look at how do
 
05:34:47.070 --> 05:34:47.080 align:start position:0%
we coordinate all of our resources
 
05:34:48.628 --> 05:34:48.638 align:start position:0%
within the state so that we work
 
05:34:50.948 --> 05:34:50.958 align:start position:0%
together as a team rather than as silos
 
05:34:53.030 --> 05:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
because Silo isation is a huge problem
 
05:34:55.548 --> 05:34:55.558 align:start position:0%
in the state so we are looking at that
 
05:34:58.670 --> 05:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
in about four or five different ways so
 
05:35:00.310 --> 05:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
don't wor we're working on it we we'll
 
05:35:05.470 --> 05:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:08.230 --> 05:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
you okay having no more cards I will
 
05:35:10.990 --> 05:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:15.030 --> 05:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
hearing and we have one more Bill left
 
05:35:18.470 --> 05:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
the sponsors left the house so have the
 
05:35:21.030 --> 05:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
insurance department who she she told me
 
05:35:22.708 --> 05:35:22.718 align:start position:0%
that you guys requested her to put this
 
05:35:25.788 --> 05:35:25.798 align:start position:0%
bill in yeah okay
 
05:35:28.390 --> 05:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
so what I'll do is I will read her
 
05:35:30.830 --> 05:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
testimony in so it's officially in on
 
05:35:34.350 --> 05:35:34.360 align:start position:0%
YouTube and then and then uh and then
 
05:35:36.030 --> 05:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
you guys can make your
 
05:35:41.150 --> 05:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
presentation um so so uh uh this bill
 
05:35:42.548 --> 05:35:42.558 align:start position:0%
the request of the insurance department
 
05:35:44.390 --> 05:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
was to strengthen New Hampshire's
 
05:35:46.470 --> 05:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
program for collecting and de
 
05:35:48.670 --> 05:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
identifying health insurance claims data
 
05:35:51.390 --> 05:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
from all payers New Hampshire was one of
 
05:35:53.590 --> 05:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
the first states to establish on an all
 
05:35:55.510 --> 05:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
payers claim database known in other
 
05:35:56.990 --> 05:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
states as
 
05:36:00.628 --> 05:36:00.638 align:start position:0%
apcd but known in New Hampshire as chis
 
05:36:02.590 --> 05:36:02.600 align:start position:0%
comprehensive healthare information
 
05:36:06.510 --> 05:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
system the chis has been essentially to
 
05:36:08.230 --> 05:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
essential to the state's efforts to make
 
05:36:10.310 --> 05:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
healthc care costs and spending more
 
05:36:12.868 --> 05:36:12.878 align:start position:0%
transparent and to support
 
05:36:16.110 --> 05:36:16.120 align:start position:0%
evidence-based policy making under
 
05:36:18.590 --> 05:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
Employee Retirement income Security Act
 
05:36:21.070 --> 05:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
Arisa states are limited authority to
 
05:36:23.310 --> 05:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
collect data from employer plans that
 
05:36:25.910 --> 05:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
are self-funded in order to address this
 
05:36:27.548 --> 05:36:27.558 align:start position:0%
limitation the Hampshire legislature
 
05:36:31.948 --> 05:36:31.958 align:start position:0%
created an opt-in program an RSA 420 G11
 
05:36:34.548 --> 05:36:34.558 align:start position:0%
Roman numi whereby self-funded employers
 
05:36:36.350 --> 05:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
can opt into providing their
 
05:36:40.868 --> 05:36:40.878 align:start position:0%
deidentified clim Nam data into the uh
 
05:36:42.548 --> 05:36:42.558 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Healthcare information
 
05:36:44.990 --> 05:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
system to strengthen the opt-in program
 
05:36:47.110 --> 05:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
this bill provides that any self-funded
 
05:36:50.590 --> 05:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
employer that opts out of the uh system
 
05:36:52.948 --> 05:36:52.958 align:start position:0%
will have to access their own claim data
 
05:36:54.788 --> 05:36:54.798 align:start position:0%
self-funded employers often use this
 
05:36:57.110 --> 05:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
data to improve their employee health
 
05:37:00.110 --> 05:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
benefit plans but sometimes run into
 
05:37:01.868 --> 05:37:01.878 align:start position:0%
problems that the Claims Administrator
 
05:37:05.310 --> 05:37:05.320 align:start position:0%
treats the claims data as proprietary
 
05:37:08.110 --> 05:37:08.120 align:start position:0%
and not available to that self-funded
 
05:37:11.110 --> 05:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
employer under this bill by opting into
 
05:37:14.110 --> 05:37:14.120 align:start position:0%
the uh tins Pro Chris progam a
 
05:37:15.990 --> 05:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
self-funded employer will no longer have
 
05:37:16.000 --> 05:37:21.110 align:start position:0%
self-funded employer will no longer have
this

05:37:21.110 --> 05:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:24.708 --> 05:37:24.718 align:start position:0%
problem represent excuse me your title
 
05:37:26.510 --> 05:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I trying to remember what your
 
05:37:28.470 --> 05:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
title was director of life and health
 
05:37:31.150 --> 05:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
director of Life yeah so well hello
 
05:37:33.110 --> 05:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
everyone again for the record my name is
 
05:37:34.590 --> 05:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
Michelle Heaton I'm the director of Life
 
05:37:35.590 --> 05:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
and Health at the New Hampshire
 
05:37:37.270 --> 05:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
insurance department and I have here
 
05:37:39.788 --> 05:37:39.798 align:start position:0%
with with me Dr jayon Asis who is our
 
05:37:42.910 --> 05:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
director of Health economics um this is
 
05:37:45.510 --> 05:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
a bill that we have asked representative
 
05:37:47.990 --> 05:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
spear to bring on our behalf and what
 
05:37:49.910 --> 05:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do with it is to
 
05:37:51.628 --> 05:37:51.638 align:start position:0%
strengthen the amount of data we're
 
05:37:55.548 --> 05:37:55.558 align:start position:0%
getting in our chiz system are all cleed
 
05:38:00.150 --> 05:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
all all paired claims database
 
05:38:05.390 --> 05:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
um under Arisa and federal law um we are
 
05:38:08.990 --> 05:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
not allowed to require self-funded plans
 
05:38:11.750 --> 05:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
to submit their data they have to opt in
 
05:38:13.270 --> 05:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
and that's been the law for some time
 
05:38:16.230 --> 05:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
now um after some federal cases came out
 
05:38:17.548 --> 05:38:17.558 align:start position:0%
so what we're trying to do with this
 
05:38:19.750 --> 05:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
amendment is to give an incentive to
 
05:38:22.948 --> 05:38:22.958 align:start position:0%
those self-funded plans to um opt in and
 
05:38:25.990 --> 05:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
give us their data and the incentive is
 
05:38:28.470 --> 05:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
that if you do opt into the system and
 
05:38:30.670 --> 05:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
agree to submit your data then we will
 
05:38:33.270 --> 05:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
give you um your essential cut of the
 
05:38:35.270 --> 05:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
data so that you can look at your own
 
05:38:37.708 --> 05:38:37.718 align:start position:0%
claims Administration so we think this
 
05:38:40.190 --> 05:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
um will'll be able to absorb any
 
05:38:40.200 --> 05:38:42.628 align:start position:0%
um will'll be able to absorb any
additional

05:38:42.628 --> 05:38:42.638 align:start position:0%
additional
 
05:38:46.110 --> 05:38:46.120 align:start position:0%
um administrative functions already in
 
05:38:47.910 --> 05:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
our current budget so we don't think
 
05:38:49.350 --> 05:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
there's going to be any kind of fiscal
 
05:38:52.510 --> 05:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
impact for it so and Dr Jason AES is the
 
05:38:54.350 --> 05:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
one who really works closely with the
 
05:38:58.070 --> 05:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:00.070 --> 05:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
questions so you're the new Tyler
 
05:39:03.910 --> 05:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
Brandon then yeah yeah as of three years
 
05:39:06.788 --> 05:39:06.798 align:start position:0%
ago I just wanted to point out um right
 
05:39:08.750 --> 05:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
now I think there's a misconception that
 
05:39:11.190 --> 05:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
the the chis only contains the fully
 
05:39:14.150 --> 05:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
insured data about 28% right now of the
 
05:39:17.390 --> 05:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
chis are self-insured members of the
 
05:39:20.150 --> 05:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
state and so it's a really high utility
 
05:39:22.590 --> 05:39:22.600 align:start position:0%
health information data set and by
 
05:39:24.350 --> 05:39:24.360 align:start position:0%
strengthening it this way and having
 
05:39:25.990 --> 05:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
greater representation of this
 
05:39:28.910 --> 05:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
self-insured Market um it only gets
 
05:39:31.070 --> 05:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
better and more utility for the for this
 
05:39:34.830 --> 05:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
committee and the citizens of the
 
05:39:37.670 --> 05:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
state just one more thing I want to add
 
05:39:39.468 --> 05:39:39.478 align:start position:0%
is that on this bill the effective date
 
05:39:42.070 --> 05:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
is 60 days after passage um and speaking
 
05:39:44.468 --> 05:39:44.478 align:start position:0%
with industry they would prefer for that
 
05:39:47.590 --> 05:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
to be January 1 we have no objection to
 
05:39:49.390 --> 05:39:49.400 align:start position:0%
that so if you want to make an amendment
 
05:39:52.910 --> 05:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:56.110 --> 05:39:56.120 align:start position:0%
us so I I think this is a good way of
 
05:39:58.230 --> 05:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill even though I think
 
05:40:00.230 --> 05:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
I know that behind the bill there was a
 
05:40:02.110 --> 05:40:02.120 align:start position:0%
different issue that was what this is
 
05:40:06.230 --> 05:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
about but I would say that one of the uh
 
05:40:08.590 --> 05:40:08.600 align:start position:0%
things that I know in the past when it
 
05:40:12.750 --> 05:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
came to um this data being released um
 
05:40:14.510 --> 05:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
and especially when we talk about a
 
05:40:17.230 --> 05:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
single employer and getting employer
 
05:40:19.110 --> 05:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
information so in this case you're
 
05:40:20.468 --> 05:40:20.478 align:start position:0%
saying the employer's not going to get
 
05:40:22.110 --> 05:40:22.120 align:start position:0%
it you're only you're going to get it or
 
05:40:23.548 --> 05:40:23.558 align:start position:0%
is the employer still going to get it no
 
05:40:26.150 --> 05:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
we would give um the employer at the end
 
05:40:28.150 --> 05:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
of their plan year we would give them
 
05:40:30.350 --> 05:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
their data back so we would be able to
 
05:40:31.910 --> 05:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
facilitate that for that which is what
 
05:40:34.110 --> 05:40:34.120 align:start position:0%
they were looking for um and I would
 
05:40:36.788 --> 05:40:36.798 align:start position:0%
just say you know I want to on tape that
 
05:40:39.670 --> 05:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
the uh one of the underlying issues why
 
05:40:44.110 --> 05:40:44.120 align:start position:0%
that was always considered um uncouth
 
05:40:46.510 --> 05:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
because um some employers could then
 
05:40:48.468 --> 05:40:48.478 align:start position:0%
figure out which employee was costing
 
05:40:51.190 --> 05:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
them all that money by looking at that
 
05:40:56.270 --> 05:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
data so uh that was always a uh a sore
 
05:40:58.110 --> 05:40:58.120 align:start position:0%
point that that we that why they were
 
05:41:00.628 --> 05:41:00.638 align:start position:0%
not being given the data is that it's
 
05:41:03.270 --> 05:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
that they don't want uh the employer to
 
05:41:04.590 --> 05:41:04.600 align:start position:0%
you know say well
 
05:41:06.708 --> 05:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
chief that I can't believe that employee
 
05:41:10.030 --> 05:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
cost us that much money
 
05:41:13.030 --> 05:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
but most employers with Risa have a stop
 
05:41:13.040 --> 05:41:14.590 align:start position:0%
but most employers with Risa have a stop
Gap

05:41:14.590 --> 05:41:14.600 align:start position:0%
Gap
 
05:41:17.430 --> 05:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
coverage and so you know they wouldn't
 
05:41:19.830 --> 05:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
know it until the the Gap coverage got
 
05:41:24.030 --> 05:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
kicked in but it is it is a problem of
 
05:41:27.590 --> 05:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
being a self-funded plan and having that
 
05:41:27.600 --> 05:41:29.788 align:start position:0%
being a self-funded plan and having that
claims

05:41:29.788 --> 05:41:29.798 align:start position:0%
claims
 
05:41:34.310 --> 05:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
data okay any questions yes representa
 
05:41:36.868 --> 05:41:36.878 align:start position:0%
sharesa thanks for taking a question uh
 
05:41:39.190 --> 05:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
so I I have a quick uh I just want to
 
05:41:41.948 --> 05:41:41.958 align:start position:0%
understand this by self-funded employer
 
05:41:44.510 --> 05:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
health benefit plan means people who buy
 
05:41:46.150 --> 05:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
their own insurance from Marketplace or
 
05:41:48.350 --> 05:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
is it something different no these are
 
05:41:51.788 --> 05:41:51.798 align:start position:0%
employers that um keep the risk with
 
05:41:53.868 --> 05:41:53.878 align:start position:0%
them so they agree to cover all health
 
05:41:56.390 --> 05:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
care costs for their employees so they
 
05:41:59.430 --> 05:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
don't purchase um Large Group Insurance
 
05:42:01.990 --> 05:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
products which is what we regulate they
 
05:42:03.590 --> 05:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
keep that risk for themselves and it's
 
05:42:05.628 --> 05:42:05.638 align:start position:0%
up to them to design and Implement those
 
05:42:08.270 --> 05:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
plans so the history is this is actually
 
05:42:10.270 --> 05:42:10.280 align:start position:0%
goes back to Gerald Ford when he was
 
05:42:13.030 --> 05:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
president he signed the legislation uh
 
05:42:16.310 --> 05:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
it's a federal plan and it was available
 
05:42:19.350 --> 05:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
to obviously to initially people would
 
05:42:21.190 --> 05:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
think it was only the employers who who
 
05:42:24.670 --> 05:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
had 200 or 300 employees um I've heard
 
05:42:27.190 --> 05:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
that it can get as low as 50 employees
 
05:42:30.468 --> 05:42:30.478 align:start position:0%
it can get fairly down there but the
 
05:42:32.708 --> 05:42:32.718 align:start position:0%
reason being is is that the employer is
 
05:42:36.390 --> 05:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
now taking on the risks of of having too
 
05:42:38.628 --> 05:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
many sick people in their plan and
 
05:42:41.070 --> 05:42:41.080 align:start position:0%
that's why they all you know that that
 
05:42:43.070 --> 05:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh what really open the gate floodgates
 
05:42:45.590 --> 05:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
is the stop Gap coverage that they would
 
05:42:48.548 --> 05:42:48.558 align:start position:0%
also uh purchase but for all tents and
 
05:42:50.430 --> 05:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
purposes this is something for a large
 
05:42:53.150 --> 05:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
employer who chooses not to have a fully
 
05:42:56.628 --> 05:42:56.638 align:start position:0%
insured plan uh you still use uh Signa
 
05:42:59.270 --> 05:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
and Anthem as your as you know in terms
 
05:43:01.230 --> 05:43:01.240 align:start position:0%
of the what the card that your employe
 
05:43:04.628 --> 05:43:04.638 align:start position:0%
will get uh but in the end of the day um
 
05:43:07.110 --> 05:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
they are exempt from all our state Reg
 
05:43:09.350 --> 05:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
regulations because they're really a
 
05:43:12.670 --> 05:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
license or if license we call it Loosely
 
05:43:15.868 --> 05:43:15.878 align:start position:0%
but their incorporation status is of
 
05:43:19.430 --> 05:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
that that plan is through is federal
 
05:43:21.910 --> 05:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
okay so let me understand if I correctly
 
05:43:24.708 --> 05:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
so these this plan is basically the
 
05:43:27.270 --> 05:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
employer emplo they don't go to
 
05:43:29.070 --> 05:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
insurance companies they use an
 
05:43:31.190 --> 05:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
insurance company to be their their
 
05:43:35.230 --> 05:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
billing and paperwork and processing and
 
05:43:37.548 --> 05:43:37.558 align:start position:0%
and and then paying out the bills
 
05:43:39.670 --> 05:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
they still hire a separate you know
 
05:43:43.110 --> 05:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
insurance company but it's not it's not
 
05:43:46.230 --> 05:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
regulated it's not the status is not
 
05:43:49.510 --> 05:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
under U uh let's say the the uh
 
05:43:53.190 --> 05:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act which is State based
 
05:43:55.548 --> 05:43:55.558 align:start position:0%
or the marketplace which is for
 
05:43:58.990 --> 05:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
individuals yeah okay in this case um
 
05:44:01.230 --> 05:44:01.240 align:start position:0%
this it's it's the it's it's just a
 
05:44:03.868 --> 05:44:03.878 align:start position:0%
whole another separate entity of of
 
05:44:06.150 --> 05:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
Regulation uh you would you would say
 
05:44:07.670 --> 05:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
that the federal government does not do
 
05:44:10.070 --> 05:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of regulating on on these rip
 
05:44:12.310 --> 05:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
plans and and we do hear complaints
 
05:44:14.548 --> 05:44:14.558 align:start position:0%
every once in a while but the most
 
05:44:17.270 --> 05:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
classic story you'll get is someone says
 
05:44:18.990 --> 05:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
well gee I thought New Hampshire passed
 
05:44:21.628 --> 05:44:21.638 align:start position:0%
that mandate and find out that well
 
05:44:23.350 --> 05:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
that's just because we passed it doesn't
 
05:44:25.590 --> 05:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
mean it it happened in with that
 
05:44:28.910 --> 05:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
employer um because that large employer
 
05:44:31.190 --> 05:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
and especially I mean really where the
 
05:44:32.510 --> 05:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
legislation really came out it was
 
05:44:35.310 --> 05:44:35.320 align:start position:0%
employers who were in multiple States
 
05:44:37.110 --> 05:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
yeah and so they didn't want to have a
 
05:44:39.230 --> 05:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
different plan for every state they want
 
05:44:41.830 --> 05:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
to have one plan for the whole
 
05:44:44.430 --> 05:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
company and and that's where the really
 
05:44:46.150 --> 05:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
the risk was supposed to be out of I
 
05:44:48.230 --> 05:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
think was really what was why it was
 
05:44:50.070 --> 05:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
created so was for large employers who
 
05:44:51.788 --> 05:44:51.798 align:start position:0%
were in multi-states so I'll try to get
 
05:44:53.548 --> 05:44:53.558 align:start position:0%
some more information I'll read about it
 
05:44:56.910 --> 05:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
but typically when employer takes a plan
 
05:44:59.670 --> 05:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
from a insurance company it submits all
 
05:45:01.230 --> 05:45:01.240 align:start position:0%
all his employees information to the
 
05:45:03.150 --> 05:45:03.160 align:start position:0%
insurance company that I have 10
 
05:45:05.030 --> 05:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
employees and this is the information of
 
05:45:07.030 --> 05:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
10 employees to the insurance company
 
05:45:10.150 --> 05:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:12.708 --> 05:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
that so you're you're say do you get
 
05:45:14.628 --> 05:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
your information of those 10 employees
 
05:45:17.070 --> 05:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
no usually when an employer purchases a
 
05:45:20.230 --> 05:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
insurance plan right then the insurance
 
05:45:23.708 --> 05:45:23.718 align:start position:0%
company asks them the information about
 
05:45:25.670 --> 05:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
as suppose they 10 employees they're ask
 
05:45:28.070 --> 05:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
information about those 10 employees you
 
05:45:29.708 --> 05:45:29.718 align:start position:0%
know all the you say ask information
 
05:45:30.910 --> 05:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
let's make sure we understand what
 
05:45:32.070 --> 05:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
you're talking about are you talking
 
05:45:34.868 --> 05:45:34.878 align:start position:0%
about medical underwriting no they ask
 
05:45:37.270 --> 05:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
about no everybody is insured all the
 
05:45:38.788 --> 05:45:38.798 align:start position:0%
correct all the employ because it's
 
05:45:41.230 --> 05:45:41.240 align:start position:0%
employer plan yes but the insurance
 
05:45:43.230 --> 05:45:43.240 align:start position:0%
company still gets the information name
 
05:45:45.510 --> 05:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
of the employee soci security number
 
05:45:46.868 --> 05:45:46.878 align:start position:0%
whatever all those information oh yes
 
05:45:49.110 --> 05:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
that's true so they they get so this are
 
05:45:50.310 --> 05:45:50.320 align:start position:0%
we talking the same thing or this is a
 
05:45:51.310 --> 05:45:51.320 align:start position:0%
different kind of plan we're talking
 
05:45:54.310 --> 05:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
about so again in terms of the what
 
05:45:56.150 --> 05:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
we're talking about in terms of you if
 
05:45:57.948 --> 05:45:57.958 align:start position:0%
you're asking me let's say what plan you
 
05:46:00.430 --> 05:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
have so how many employees do you have
 
05:46:02.270 --> 05:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
yes there 10 employees you have 10
 
05:46:03.590 --> 05:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
employees so you're going to be in the
 
05:46:05.628 --> 05:46:05.638 align:start position:0%
small group Market yeah you're not going
 
05:46:08.430 --> 05:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
to go to RIS plan r a plan the RIS a
 
05:46:09.628 --> 05:46:09.638 align:start position:0%
plan you're going to you're going to get
 
05:46:13.190 --> 05:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
the plan U not from a benefits manager
 
05:46:14.990 --> 05:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's a you know it's a
 
05:46:16.670 --> 05:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
different you're shopping in a different
 
05:46:18.510 --> 05:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
location so maybe like I'll get more
 
05:46:19.868 --> 05:46:19.878 align:start position:0%
information on this but what is the
 
05:46:21.110 --> 05:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
objective let me ask you the question
 
05:46:22.628 --> 05:46:22.638 align:start position:0%
last question what's the objective of
 
05:46:24.030 --> 05:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
this bill actually why do you want to
 
05:46:25.548 --> 05:46:25.558 align:start position:0%
get the claims
 
05:46:27.590 --> 05:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
data uh what's the objective of this
 
05:46:29.868 --> 05:46:29.878 align:start position:0%
bill well there was a federal law I
 
05:46:30.910 --> 05:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
think in
 
05:46:34.750 --> 05:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
2017 um that precluded self large
 
05:46:37.190 --> 05:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
self-funded plans from having this MIT
 
05:46:39.030 --> 05:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
into the claims data and as a
 
05:46:41.830 --> 05:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
consequence there's a lower amount of
 
05:46:43.868 --> 05:46:43.878 align:start position:0%
representativeness in the claims data
 
05:46:45.788 --> 05:46:45.798 align:start position:0%
from those plans which in New Hampshire
 
05:46:47.548 --> 05:46:47.558 align:start position:0%
I think is about
 
05:46:50.910 --> 05:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
54% of the commercial Market is
 
05:46:54.230 --> 05:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
self-funded we like 50 we do a good job
 
05:46:57.070 --> 05:46:57.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire getting um some of the
 
05:46:59.190 --> 05:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
self-funded data in there I I think
 
05:47:01.190 --> 05:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
largely because of the state employes
 
05:47:02.708 --> 05:47:02.718 align:start position:0%
plan and the corrections and maybe
 
05:47:05.270 --> 05:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
University system of New Hampshire but
 
05:47:06.868 --> 05:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
we still need to strengthen the
 
05:47:08.708 --> 05:47:08.718 align:start position:0%
representativeness of that large segment
 
05:47:10.270 --> 05:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
of the market and that's why I think
 
05:47:11.830 --> 05:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
this is this is
 
05:47:14.310 --> 05:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
important however having said that in
 
05:47:16.430 --> 05:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
terms of the part where I was asking
 
05:47:18.548 --> 05:47:18.558 align:start position:0%
talking about how does the employer at
 
05:47:21.150 --> 05:47:21.160 align:start position:0%
the end of the day get the same data
 
05:47:23.670 --> 05:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
okay because uh if you're in the regular
 
05:47:25.830 --> 05:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
small group Market no the employer
 
05:47:28.310 --> 05:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't get the data okay the state
 
05:47:32.270 --> 05:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
compiles it as as a as a mass database
 
05:47:34.510 --> 05:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
and really uses it to help you uh chop
 
05:47:36.510 --> 05:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
around and see what hospitals what
 
05:47:36.520 --> 05:47:37.350 align:start position:0%
around and see what hospitals what
doctors

05:47:37.350 --> 05:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
doctors
 
05:47:39.070 --> 05:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
you know are you know are you're using
 
05:47:43.430 --> 05:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
the best um you know uh you know costs
 
05:47:46.670 --> 05:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
for your employees the the larger
 
05:47:49.110 --> 05:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
employer who's in the Arisa they want to
 
05:47:51.868 --> 05:47:51.878 align:start position:0%
be able to shop their plan and they want
 
05:47:54.070 --> 05:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
to use different RIS you know benefit
 
05:47:56.750 --> 05:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
you know managers get different plans
 
05:47:58.948 --> 05:47:58.958 align:start position:0%
and the best way to shop it is to be
 
05:48:01.310 --> 05:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
able to take your medical history of
 
05:48:04.150 --> 05:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
your employees and take it to multiple
 
05:48:06.350 --> 05:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
plans so that's why that's the that's
 
05:48:08.868 --> 05:48:08.878 align:start position:0%
the second side of this legislation yeah
 
05:48:10.788 --> 05:48:10.798 align:start position:0%
they lack their claim insights on their
 
05:48:12.750 --> 05:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
claims experience so it would be you
 
05:48:14.510 --> 05:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
know as a fiduciary which a lot of
 
05:48:17.468 --> 05:48:17.478 align:start position:0%
self-insured large employers are that
 
05:48:19.548 --> 05:48:19.558 align:start position:0%
knowledge is probably high value for
 
05:48:21.670 --> 05:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
them and they don't always get it from
 
05:48:24.628 --> 05:48:24.638 align:start position:0%
the contractor the the insurer that they
 
05:48:26.948 --> 05:48:26.958 align:start position:0%
that they contract with is a TPA right
 
05:48:29.510 --> 05:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
as a note to understand that Enigma a
 
05:48:31.590 --> 05:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
little better in the claims data we
 
05:48:34.310 --> 05:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
classify those those insurers that that
 
05:48:38.708 --> 05:48:38.718 align:start position:0%
act as tpas as as either ASO or ASW
 
05:48:41.910 --> 05:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
which means administrative Services only
 
05:48:44.468 --> 05:48:44.478 align:start position:0%
or administrative services with some
 
05:48:46.990 --> 05:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
other kind of rudimentary functions so
 
05:48:48.788 --> 05:48:48.798 align:start position:0%
they just administer the benefits
 
05:48:50.310 --> 05:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
whereas the employer takes on the
 
05:48:53.310 --> 05:48:53.320 align:start position:0%
financial risk of the underlying health
 
05:48:54.670 --> 05:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
conditions of their
 
05:48:57.270 --> 05:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
Workforce Now some question was this one
 
05:49:00.270 --> 05:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
for the the municipal ones like like the
 
05:49:03.910 --> 05:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
primex and or was this for all arises we
 
05:49:06.270 --> 05:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
we don't have a clear awareness of who
 
05:49:08.590 --> 05:49:08.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't get their claims data from the
 
05:49:10.390 --> 05:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
contract my understanding was yeah that
 
05:49:13.310 --> 05:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
that this legislation was being driven
 
05:49:16.910 --> 05:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh by um when that does Municipal which
 
05:49:18.190 --> 05:49:18.200 align:start position:0%
is prime
 
05:49:22.750 --> 05:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:22.760 --> 05:49:24.708 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:49:24.708 --> 05:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:49:30.190 --> 05:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
okay yeah that's so for self-funded uh
 
05:49:32.708 --> 05:49:32.718 align:start position:0%
the companies in multiple States still
 
05:49:34.990 --> 05:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
we monitor it or how does it
 
05:49:37.548 --> 05:49:37.558 align:start position:0%
work it depends there are large group
 
05:49:39.270 --> 05:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
plans that may operate in multiple
 
05:49:45.230 --> 05:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
States um our chis is cus cus bace cus
 
05:49:47.390 --> 05:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
space yeah we have a lot yeah so it's um
 
05:49:50.548 --> 05:49:50.558 align:start position:0%
all plans CEST in New Hampshire we are
 
05:49:52.910 --> 05:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
already collecting that data for fully
 
05:49:55.310 --> 05:49:55.320 align:start position:0%
insured plans which it could include um
 
05:49:56.948 --> 05:49:56.958 align:start position:0%
a multi-state
 
05:50:00.708 --> 05:50:00.718 align:start position:0%
employer if it's a self-funded plan the
 
05:50:02.390 --> 05:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
only way we're getting that data is if
 
05:50:04.990 --> 05:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
they have opted into our system and are
 
05:50:07.628 --> 05:50:07.638 align:start position:0%
agreeing to voluntarily give us that
 
05:50:10.510 --> 05:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
data and this is Bill is aim to give
 
05:50:13.310 --> 05:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
them another incentive to opt in because
 
05:50:18.468 --> 05:50:18.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:18.478 --> 05:50:20.750 align:start position:0%
 
to

05:50:20.750 --> 05:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:50:22.948 --> 05:50:22.958 align:start position:0%
tins what what was it what were you
 
05:50:22.958 --> 05:50:24.468 align:start position:0%
tins what what was it what were you
calling

05:50:24.468 --> 05:50:24.478 align:start position:0%
calling
 
05:50:28.430 --> 05:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
this sorry yeah what you you you sound
 
05:50:30.150 --> 05:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
like you use the word chins or something
 
05:50:32.590 --> 05:50:32.600 align:start position:0%
chis chis yeah which chis that's the
 
05:50:34.708 --> 05:50:34.718 align:start position:0%
database that's the datab right that's
 
05:50:37.548 --> 05:50:37.558 align:start position:0%
the actual database I should know I was
 
05:50:40.830 --> 05:50:40.840 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of it what is it New
 
05:50:42.868 --> 05:50:42.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire make sure we put the New
 
05:50:44.708 --> 05:50:44.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because Massachusetts has a
 
05:50:47.310 --> 05:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
Chia and everybody has a different
 
05:50:48.868 --> 05:50:48.878 align:start position:0%
different variation New Hampshire chis
 
05:50:51.190 --> 05:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
is New Hampshire Comprehensive Health
 
05:50:53.910 --> 05:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
Information System right and I'd like to
 
05:50:55.670 --> 05:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
point out too it's not just the claims
 
05:50:57.590 --> 05:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
data that's part of the chis there's
 
05:51:00.270 --> 05:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
other types of data that are included in
 
05:51:02.910 --> 05:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
that and accordingly in our statute that
 
05:51:05.030 --> 05:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
this bill aims to amend but the goal was
 
05:51:07.628 --> 05:51:07.638 align:start position:0%
to to try to figure out how do because
 
05:51:09.030 --> 05:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
it said you say well how much does a
 
05:51:11.390 --> 05:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
procedure cost at a certain Hospital
 
05:51:13.190 --> 05:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
well you have different factors you have
 
05:51:14.670 --> 05:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
the doctor you have the hospital and
 
05:51:16.468 --> 05:51:16.478 align:start position:0%
then you have the the special the
 
05:51:18.430 --> 05:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist so was trying to
 
05:51:20.468 --> 05:51:20.478 align:start position:0%
collect all that data so we could really
 
05:51:23.548 --> 05:51:23.558 align:start position:0%
truly analyze what certain Hospital
 
05:51:25.868 --> 05:51:25.878 align:start position:0%
groups what what things were costing so
 
05:51:28.628 --> 05:51:28.638 align:start position:0%
that you can and and you can go online
 
05:51:31.750 --> 05:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
and see see choose choose which is the
 
05:51:33.548 --> 05:51:33.558 align:start position:0%
best hospital then we had the outcomes
 
05:51:36.310 --> 05:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
too we had we have the outcome report
 
05:51:38.230 --> 05:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
which which is uh which can be a little
 
05:51:39.868 --> 05:51:39.878 align:start position:0%
misleading because if a hospital doesn't
 
05:51:42.468 --> 05:51:42.478 align:start position:0%
do a procedure as often as someone else
 
05:51:44.310 --> 05:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
it's another different hospital and has
 
05:51:46.948 --> 05:51:46.958 align:start position:0%
one bad case it it could it could throw
 
05:51:51.868 --> 05:51:51.878 align:start position:0%
it into the bad outcome category but but
 
05:51:53.788 --> 05:51:53.798 align:start position:0%
uh but at least at least you get an idea
 
05:51:56.390 --> 05:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
of you know of of of what the hospitals
 
05:51:57.548 --> 05:51:57.558 align:start position:0%
are going to cost you what it's going to
 
05:52:00.990 --> 05:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:03.510 --> 05:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
procedure all right we set thank you
 
05:52:06.310 --> 05:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
very much close the public hearing and
 
05:52:07.750 --> 05:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
like I say the subcommittees for these
