question so
 
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh canon mountain in terms of just
 
00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 align:start position:0%
general business function is actually
 
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
doing very well
 
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh we we expect to close this year
 
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
actually up
 
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.230 align:start position:0%
actually up
uh

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
adding to the balance fund relative to
 
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
last year so
 
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
the in terms of revenue generation it's
 
00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
really doing very well we're maintaining
 
00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
a good
 
00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh income
 
00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
and we're controlling the costs as well
 
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.629 align:start position:0%
and we're controlling the costs as well
so

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
up to this point in time particularly
 
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
for this year we're actually very
 
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
pleased with the fact that we've been
 
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
continue to grow the account balance
 
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
so the revenue exped exceeds the costs
 
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.309 align:start position:0%
so the revenue exped exceeds the costs
by

00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
how much for this particular fiscal year
 
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
we estimate the revenue to exceed the
 
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
costs somewhere
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
in the half million dollar range
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
okay for this fiscal year
 
00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759 align:start position:0%

the pipe project right now is out to bid
 
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
of course pending approval
 
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
both here and yesterday at the governor
 
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
executive council meeting which we did
 
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.869 align:start position:0%
executive council meeting which we did
receive

00:08:08.869 --> 00:08:08.879 align:start position:0%
receive
 
00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
the boiler project is being looked at by
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
a couple of different vendors as we
 
00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
speak and the grip assembly project and
 
00:08:15.039 --> 00:08:16.309 align:start position:0%
speak and the grip assembly project and
installation

00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
installation
 
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
is actually a purchase that would go
 
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.469 align:start position:0%
is actually a purchase that would go
through

00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
das and doppelmeyer because this would
 
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
be a
 
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
sole source and a proprietary grip
 
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
assembly program is already aware and
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
has placed an order again pending
 
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.469 align:start position:0%
has placed an order again pending
approval

00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
so i mean you're looking at to be
 
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
completing this project
 
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
given that everything is goes well by
 
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.589 align:start position:0%
given that everything is goes well by
before

00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
a certain date or september november
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
late november is the goal for all three
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:55.519 align:start position:0%
so you already have what if we turn you
 
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
down and you've already gone to governor
 
00:08:59.590 --> 00:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
and council
 
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
that would be fairly unique from my own

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
quorum together uh at the catamount
 
00:09:14.949 --> 00:09:14.959 align:start position:0%

00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
safety issue there that it's right at
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%

repairs and and changing the assemblies
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
themselves but we do want to replace
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
