00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
very curious for me on this particular
 
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 align:start position:0%
bill because we're not spending any
 
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.050 align:start position:0%
bill because we're not spending any
money

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know why we ended up with this
 
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
one but hey good as any post does
 
00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
anybody have any comment to make on this
 
00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
starting out in a good good way here
 
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
well I would entertain entertain a
 
00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 align:start position:0%
motion to uh for ought to pass
 
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 align:start position:0%
Mary okay
 
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.410 align:start position:0%
Mary okay
second

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
what what's the distance oh
 
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
the gist of the bill is moving the
 
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
amount that a school board can accept
 
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
without a special meeting to twenty
 
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars from five thousand
 
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 align:start position:0%
Yeah by all means
 
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
I uh oh good morning I misunderstood a
 
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
question I thought you were asking the
 
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 align:start position:0%
public if they uh had any comments I'm
 
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
new this is for the board um I I would
 
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 align:start position:0%
just like to share the thought that uh I
 
00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 align:start position:0%
was actually talking to representative
 
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
hack and Phillips about it during the
 
00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 align:start position:0%
public hearing that
 
00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 align:start position:0%
it is good to keep up with inflation if
 
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
this build you know if this uh amount
 
00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
was decided you know 18 years ago
 
00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 align:start position:0%
obviously inflation happens but we
 
00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 align:start position:0%
looked up and uh you know the equivalent
 
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
of five thousand dollars about 18 years
 
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
ago in today's money would be about 7
 
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
500. so I would like to express concern
 
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
over the fact that the raised to 25 20
 
00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 align:start position:0%
000 is significantly higher than
 
00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
inflation and it actually kind of
 
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
changes the threshold in a very material
 
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
way I was wondering if maybe as a
 
00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
committee we should consider keeping it
 
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 align:start position:0%
closer to inflation
 
00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 align:start position:0%
amounts and I again
 
00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.909 align:start position:0%
amounts and I again
it's

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
uh I heard it
 
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 align:start position:0%
I heard it more as a a facilitation of
 
00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 align:start position:0%
donation rather than some kind of
 
00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 align:start position:0%
coupling of amounts of money that's how
 
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair yeah I think also to
 
00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:55.259 align:start position:0%
take into consideration is how things
 
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
have gotten more expensive regardless of
 
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
inflation and also that this is an
 
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 align:start position:0%
opportunity so certain schools are going
 
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
to be raising fairly significant amounts
 
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
of funds which they're just turning over
 
00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 align:start position:0%
to the school and I don't think it's
 
00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 align:start position:0%
unusual for them to raise more than the
 
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
7 500 that representative papovichi is
 
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 align:start position:0%
suggesting in terms of just inflation so
 
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
my point is that there are factors
 
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
beyond inflation just in terms of how
 
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
much things are costing and how some
 
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
school systems are pretty darn good at
 
00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 align:start position:0%
raising funds that they turn over to the
 
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 align:start position:0%
school and I see this as an
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
administrative way of making it easier
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
for the schools to accept that money
 
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
without having to go through a more uh
 
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
not necessarily rigorous but I forget
 
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 align:start position:0%
the word I want a demanding or onerous
 
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:53.409 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:53.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
school board for nine years and and I'm
 
00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
On The Board of Trustees and a lot of
 
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
times these this amount gets in the way
 
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
you know the five thousand I mean if
 
00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:04.979 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to give a donation to say
 
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.060 align:start position:0%
start a uh a scholarship fund it uh it
 
00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:10.919 align:start position:0%
tends to be very cumbersome because you
 
00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:12.419 align:start position:0%
have to have a public hearing for the
 
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
school board to you know if it's for the
 
00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:18.539 align:start position:0%
school to to uh you know accept that
 
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
money and of course it's appropriated by
 
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
them so I think this is a reasonable
 
00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
amount uh you know it's it's not it's
 
00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:28.259 align:start position:0%
it's going to be reviewed by the school
 
00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:29.270 align:start position:0%
it's going to be reviewed by the school
board

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
when they accept the money within the
 
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
school board meeting so I think this uh
 
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
this is a good idea thank you
 
00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
any other comment
 
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
well if the clerk would
 
00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:44.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:46.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and are you gonna

discussions on House Bill 468
 
00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:30.419 align:start position:0%
which is an appropriate appropriation
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
for an attorney to rewrite the
 
00:18:36.409 --> 00:18:36.419 align:start position:0%
Department of Education manual
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%

you got to fire up thank you thank you
 
00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I thought of a question that
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
I didn't think of yesterday at the
 
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.909 align:start position:0%
I didn't think of yesterday at the
hearing

00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:18:52.909 --> 00:18:52.919 align:start position:0%
but what you're talking about here is
 
00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
I'm actually amending at the education
 
00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:56.870 align:start position:0%
I'm actually amending at the education
law

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
so what are the what's how what's the
 
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
mechanics of doing that I mean this one
 
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
attorney is not going to change the laws
 
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
it's going to have to go through the
 
00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
whole process and House and Senate and
 
00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.770 align:start position:0%
whole process and House and Senate and
right

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:11.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
well whoever wants to respond to it I
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
don't know yesterday during the hearing
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
yesterday that's what it sounded like
 
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:20.700 align:start position:0%
you're going to hire this attorney for a
 
00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh it's good to be back in
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
this room where I sat in that chair more
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
than a few years ago uh when this when
 
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
this division also had taxation when
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
there was no Ways and Means Committee
 
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
and uh I remember the night Claremont 2
 
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
came down and realized my life's about
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
to change and it did and it sure did
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh I wanted to talk I'll talk to you
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
about the process of recodification not
 
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
that we have done it uh significantly in
 
00:20:00.289 --> 00:20:00.299 align:start position:0%
OLS uh but that does fall in our
 
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
bailiwick and Mickey has uh has uh some
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
background information that I have
 
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
prepared for the division
 
00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.210 align:start position:0%
prepared for the division
uh

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
recodification in my business with
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
talking with other legislative service
 
00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:20.039 align:start position:0%
directors yes we call ourselves the lsds
 
00:20:24.049 --> 00:20:24.059 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's a it's appropriate uh when
 
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
talking to my counterparts around the
 
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
country recodification is a real dirty
 
00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
word because it can be uh it can be a
 
00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:33.169 align:start position:0%
word because it can be uh it can be a
disaster

00:20:33.169 --> 00:20:33.179 align:start position:0%
disaster
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
it takes it's monumental
 
00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
uh I am not speaking against this I
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
think it needs to be done as well as in
 
00:20:42.049 --> 00:20:42.059 align:start position:0%
a lot of other agencies and that we've
 
00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
heard Rumblings
 
00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:45.140 align:start position:0%
from other agencies seeking
 
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
recodification of their statutes and
 
00:20:51.169 --> 00:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
recodification really is a cleanup uh
 
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
a little bit of history in the first 150
 
00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
years of the state we were recodifying
 
00:20:58.970 --> 00:20:58.980 align:start position:0%
all our state laws the entire entirety
 
00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
of the state laws about every 15 years
 
00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
we haven't done it since 1955 but in
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
1950 when we created the RSI rsas the
 
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
revised statutes annotated uh but at
 
00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
that time we only had about five volumes
 
00:21:18.169 --> 00:21:18.179 align:start position:0%
of laws total in 1947 we had two volumes
 
00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:19.740 align:start position:0%
I have them in my office on my bookshelf
 
00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:20.820 align:start position:0%
if you want to take a look at that
 
00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:24.419 align:start position:0%
sometime we now have 35 of these books
 
00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
these two are the education statutes
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
most this one is includes libraries
 
00:21:32.049 --> 00:21:32.059 align:start position:0%
where the where I have the the
 
00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
piece of paper there
 
00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
the education statutes are over 1500
 
00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.649 align:start position:0%
the education statutes are over 1500
pages

00:21:39.649 --> 00:21:39.659 align:start position:0%
pages
 
00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
the bill that would result from
 
00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
recodification will be at least 1500
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
pages so it's like nothing you have ever
 
00:21:46.559 --> 00:21:47.510 align:start position:0%
pages so it's like nothing you have ever
seen

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
seen
 
00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
again it's not I'm not speaking against
 
00:21:52.909 --> 00:21:52.919 align:start position:0%
this I think it needs to be done
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
but it's it's monumental
 
00:21:57.649 --> 00:21:57.659 align:start position:0%
I have included in the packet uh
 
00:22:00.409 --> 00:22:00.419 align:start position:0%
something from 1967 when the criminal
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
code was uh was recodified
 
00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
and uh it took about six years to
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
produce a recodification bill of the
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
criminal code consisting of 44 pages
 
00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
and that was a re and that required an
 
00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:17.820 align:start position:0%
appropriation of twenty thousand dollars
 
00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
in nineteen sixty seven dollars
 
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
for 44 pages
 
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
I have included here also and as the top
 
00:22:30.409 --> 00:22:30.419 align:start position:0%
page shows you my my responsibilities in
 
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
uh chapter 17A and that does include
 
00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
codification of that we don't actively
 
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
do that because we don't have the staff
 
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
but for instance we have a very large
 
00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:43.380 align:start position:0%
bill on oplc right now it's a 75 page
 
00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
bill for representative McGuire it's
 
00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a recodification uh not
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
entirely the entirety of those statutes
 
00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
but it was a major undertaking for us to
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
do here during the filing period uh and
 
00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
that's you'll be seeing that coming out
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
shortly uh I also include
 
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
in the Virginia code Commission Virginia
 
00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
has a very nicely laid out commission
 
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
defined with the authority to do to
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
undertake uh recodification
 
00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:19.860 align:start position:0%
and uh so I include that there again uh
 
00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:21.780 align:start position:0%
and they can do that with their staff
 
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
they have a lot more staff than than I
 
00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
do here here downstairs at the State
 
00:23:30.649 --> 00:23:30.659 align:start position:0%
House I also include at the end uh
 
00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
and I'll tell this story a little bit
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
that in Colorado
 
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh they were recodifying their oplc
 
00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.010 align:start position:0%
uh they were recodifying their oplc
statutes

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:41.870 align:start position:0%
statutes
and

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
had buy-in from everyone and everyone
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
they had everyone involved the
 
00:23:46.909 --> 00:23:46.919 align:start position:0%
practitioners the Attorney General's
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
office uh members of the bar association
 
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
the associations governed by by their
 
00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
their oplc statutes uh numerous people
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
buy in the the office of their office of
 
00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
legislative Services it's called the LLS
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
uh was the were the people that were
 
00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:05.940 align:start position:0%
carrying out what the commission
 
00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
requested again they have a much bigger
 
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
staff than than we do here
 
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:14.220 align:start position:0%
that took several years it was 1700 page
 
00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.070 align:start position:0%
that took several years it was 1700 page
Bill

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:24:18.649 --> 00:24:18.659 align:start position:0%
uh and uh and it required about 40 other
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
bills because
 
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly in these education statutes
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
there are things that should belong
 
00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:25.799 align:start position:0%
somewhere else so when you take those
 
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:27.780 align:start position:0%
things out and you they have to go
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and so that means a
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
separate bill needs to be created and so
 
00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
then Colorado that happened it uh and
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
just as an interesting note uh when it
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
came to the floor of the house there was
 
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
some uh things were moving too fast for
 
00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:45.980 align:start position:0%
a certain certain group and uh
 
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
the the uh the next bill up after that
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
1700 page Bill uh was controversial so
 
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:54.900 align:start position:0%
there was a motion when that bill was on
 
00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
the floor that the bill be read at
 
00:24:59.289 --> 00:24:59.299 align:start position:0%
length meaning 1700 pages had to be read
 
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
read by the clerk uh which is what in
 
00:25:04.909 --> 00:25:04.919 align:start position:0%
fact happened after some of the
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
shenanigans but uh so it was used as a
 
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
bit of a football
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
my bottom line is we need to have a Pros
 
00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
start if we're going to do this we need
 
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
to have a process so that we can
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
replicate it for other agencies and
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
departments moving forward it needs to
 
00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
be clear it needs to be comprehensive
 
00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:25.799 align:start position:0%
because anything less really will create
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
disaster and I've heard it from other
 
00:25:30.289 --> 00:25:30.299 align:start position:0%
States including Delaware in their
 
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
recodification of the criminal code
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
which was undertaken by the uh Supreme
 
00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.330 align:start position:0%
which was undertaken by the uh Supreme
Court

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
Court
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
and they they have the the Chief Justice
 
00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:39.900 align:start position:0%
hired a
 
00:25:42.409 --> 00:25:42.419 align:start position:0%
a law professor from an Ivy League
 
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
School here in New England and uh let's
 
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
just say it was
 
00:25:48.409 --> 00:25:48.419 align:start position:0%
it was a disaster because even the
 
00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
go ahead question Dan thank you
 
00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:25:59.810 --> 00:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
taking my questions
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
um just a couple of really quick
 
00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.630 align:start position:0%
um just a couple of really quick
questions

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:04.740 align:start position:0%
would it be fair to say that you know
 
00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:06.900 align:start position:0%
what is your opinion on the possibility
 
00:26:09.769 --> 00:26:09.779 align:start position:0%
of this recodification happened in the
 
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:11.700 align:start position:0%
terms proposed by this bill in two years
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
and for a budget of a hundred thousand
 
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
I I really don't know I don't think that
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
it can be done in necessarily two years
 
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
from what for my discussions with other
 
00:26:24.769 --> 00:26:24.779 align:start position:0%
states on major pieces of legislation uh
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
as far as the additional dollars I don't
 
00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
know because most most States uh that
 
00:26:33.529 --> 00:26:33.539 align:start position:0%
I've spoken to have large enough staffs
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
that where the commission is telling
 
00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:36.900 align:start position:0%
them what to do looks through and says
 
00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
okay these are not just renumber in this
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
fashion and then uh the staff can carry
 
00:26:45.049 --> 00:26:45.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
a friend of mine is my counterpart in
 
00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
California and we like to joke you know
 
00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
I've got I've got uh seven drafting
 
00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
attorneys he has 175. uh you know that's
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
so and so it's it's like the the mutton
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
Jeff in one corner in the opposite
 
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
corners of the country and we we uh we
 
00:27:06.409 --> 00:27:06.419 align:start position:0%
kind of entertain others when we get
 
00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
together at conferences because of the
 
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:10.140 align:start position:0%
differences between our two states but
 
00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
uh it just need
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
can it be done externally using
 
00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
additional help yes is it done that way
 
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:19.740 align:start position:0%
by the states yes but there needs to be
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
a strong
 
00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
Commission on oversight steering
 
00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:25.980 align:start position:0%
committee that that is there to uh to
 
00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
steer the direction thank you and if I a
 
00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up because that was my
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
second question
 
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
how would you suggest in your
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
professional experience that's the best
 
00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
way to go about achieving this goal
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
because I think you know the goal is
 
00:27:40.669 --> 00:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
definitely something we need to achieve
 
00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
but I'm really concerned that this won't
 
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
do it and you know how would we best
 
00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.330 align:start position:0%
do it and you know how would we best
proceed

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
proceed
 
00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:49.860 align:start position:0%
I'm more than willing to sit down with
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
the department and others but I think
 
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
there needs to be uh there needs to be
 
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
certainly the department at the table
 
00:27:57.529 --> 00:27:57.539 align:start position:0%
that need to be uh whether it be school
 
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
boards Association or others that that
 
00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:02.820 align:start position:0%
use the laws education laws on a regular
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
basis there needs to be someone from the
 
00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office which was
 
00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:08.460 align:start position:0%
noted yesterday I was had the hearing on
 
00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
in the in the background in my office uh
 
00:28:14.029 --> 00:28:14.039 align:start position:0%
there needs to be practitioners uh
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
lawyers that that work with in education
 
00:28:16.919 --> 00:28:19.190 align:start position:0%
lawyers that that work with in education
uh

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
there needs there needs to be a group
 
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
like as well as house members and
 
00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:24.900 align:start position:0%
Senators because that that's uh they're
 
00:28:27.289 --> 00:28:27.299 align:start position:0%
the ones that will likely say identify
 
00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:29.100 align:start position:0%
what is substantive or not because you
 
00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:30.900 align:start position:0%
don't that has to be clearly laid out
 
00:28:33.649 --> 00:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
and in the Colorado bill that authorized
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
that commission it talks about what the
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
commission can do and you don't want to
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
have substantive changes you don't want
 
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
to make those those major changes in in
 
00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
a recodification because that is a
 
00:28:48.529 --> 00:28:48.539 align:start position:0%
recipe for failure also so you want to
 
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
keep it really to renumbering clean up
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
uh get rid of things that are
 
00:28:56.049 --> 00:28:56.059 align:start position:0%
duplicative and uh
 
00:28:58.130 --> 00:28:58.140 align:start position:0%
renumberings don't get rid of the
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
conflicts don't rewrite the law just fix
 
00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
it correct okay correct thank you Mary
 
00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:07.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:08.940 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
um I used to work at the department of
 
00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
Ed and it
 
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
that was 2009 when I left and it was
 
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
confusing then and federal laws have
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
come federal laws have gone we've
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
adjusted educational laws to meet the
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
needs of those requirements there's some
 
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
urgency to this I think I can't imagine
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
what it must be like for the attorneys
 
00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:35.940 align:start position:0%
that have
 
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
I have to work with all of these laws
 
00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
would perhaps
 
00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:43.980 align:start position:0%
um instead of the law as written we
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
Define this as a commission
 
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
and we fund it
 
00:29:51.169 --> 00:29:51.179 align:start position:0%
um and specify
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
a timeline or what we're looking for so
 
00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't differ particularly from
 
00:29:59.510 --> 00:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
what is here but it would spell a kind
 
00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
of a process and it would fund what
 
00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
needs to happen and I don't know if the
 
00:30:06.769 --> 00:30:06.779 align:start position:0%
department thinks that's a good idea or
 
00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
you need to start moving in destruction
 
00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:20.700 align:start position:0%
if it's a physician in the analysis
 
00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:23.210 align:start position:0%
if it's a physician in the analysis
definitely

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:23.220 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
without some other steps that we need to
 
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.789 align:start position:0%
without some other steps that we need to
involve

00:30:25.789 --> 00:30:25.799 align:start position:0%
involve
 
00:30:27.409 --> 00:30:27.419 align:start position:0%
if we agree so as I testified yesterday
 
00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the appropriate answer
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
so I've never done this but what we have
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
right now is not working for the
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
department and for the field of
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
medication that we need to start in the
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
direction of improving whatever that
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
ends up being completely versatile so
 
00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:41.820 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
yeah my my thought is this is another
 
00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
one of those ones with we're looking at
 
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
the elephant here you know and and what
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
we've got is an ant uh so uh just for
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
the committee's benefit I I discusses
 
00:30:57.529 --> 00:30:57.539 align:start position:0%
with Mary all of these bills that have
 
00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
money in them it would be my intention
 
00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
state to retain them because we don't
 
00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:04.140 align:start position:0%
know what money we have to spend
 
00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
uh so my inclination on this one is to
 
00:31:10.909 --> 00:31:10.919 align:start position:0%
retain it and rewrite it
 
00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:13.799 align:start position:0%
to be something bigger because if we got
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
to have a big idea we have to have a
 
00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
bigger bill
 
00:31:18.769 --> 00:31:18.779 align:start position:0%
uh this is a good start
 
00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:20.700 align:start position:0%
but I think what you've highlighted
 
00:31:23.149 --> 00:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
would be a better approach to say let's
 
00:31:24.649 --> 00:31:24.659 align:start position:0%
organize how we're going to do this
 
00:31:27.769 --> 00:31:27.779 align:start position:0%
before we start doing it yes uh and I
 
00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
think that's what this bill could morph
 
00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
into was is The Game Plan
 
00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
of how to move forward and maybe some
 
00:31:36.889 --> 00:31:36.899 align:start position:0%
funding or you know maybe for the next
 
00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
fiscal year I don't know I'm just I'm
 
00:31:39.889 --> 00:31:39.899 align:start position:0%
not trying to write the bill I'm just
 
00:31:42.529 --> 00:31:42.539 align:start position:0%
saying I think if we need to work on
 
00:31:42.539 --> 00:31:44.389 align:start position:0%
saying I think if we need to work on
this

00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
um this will give us two years if we
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
retain it but not really but I mean it
 
00:31:50.649 --> 00:31:50.659 align:start position:0%
gives us a longer period of time
 
00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:52.860 align:start position:0%
otherwise we have to take action on it
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
by crossover so that that would be my my
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
thoughts here Mary I just I think it's
 
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's really important though that that
 
00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
we do put some money to it
 
00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:04.919 align:start position:0%
um and we do need to rewrite it and it's
 
00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
something that if we can plot out a
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
timeline I think that's really important
 
00:32:12.769 --> 00:32:12.779 align:start position:0%
because just my experiences way back in
 
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
2009 I can't imagine all the bills that
 
00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
have been passed since then and what
 
00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:19.740 align:start position:0%
it's like now so I think there's some or
 
00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
and if this must be across our our
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
government so um I think we have a big
 
00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
job of habits well as as was stated I
 
00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
think you said this could be a model of
 
00:32:33.529 --> 00:32:33.539 align:start position:0%
how to do it for other other departments
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
this is Monumental any of you ever seen
 
00:32:39.529 --> 00:32:39.539 align:start position:0%
a 1500 page bill before you know it's uh
 
00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's certainly nothing that we have done
 
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
or any of my predecessors or
 
00:32:46.909 --> 00:32:46.919 align:start position:0%
any our predecessors of being a former
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
legislator here uh has has done that
 
00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
that one in 1967 criminal code big code
 
00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
well important code clearly uh 44 Pages
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh I think agriculture was done not too
 
00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
terribly long ago maybe 20 years uh but
 
00:33:04.909 --> 00:33:04.919 align:start position:0%
certainly not the agricultural laws are
 
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:07.140 align:start position:0%
certainly not to the extent we have we
 
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:08.100 align:start position:0%
have here
 
00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.710 align:start position:0%
have here
yes

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:11.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for being
 
00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
here I'd like your opinion uh you went
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
through uh Committee of all you know the
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
stakeholders who should be at the table
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
uh involved in this can I get your
 
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:23.640 align:start position:0%
opinion on
 
00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
whether the stakeholders would be the
 
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:29.220 align:start position:0%
one who stakeholders who do the work or
 
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
if they're an advantage to having an
 
00:33:33.049 --> 00:33:33.059 align:start position:0%
outside agency come in to do the work
 
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
and present to the committee
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
um and act to be to be frank I'm I would
 
00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
lean towards an outside agency because
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
they don't have
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
um historical or background
 
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
knowledge which can be good but also
 
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
knowledge that gets in the way of what
 
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do that they're coming
 
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
in with just a clear lens without any
 
00:33:56.269 --> 00:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
you know side issues and to have an
 
00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
agency do the work which would take it
 
00:34:00.889 --> 00:34:00.899 align:start position:0%
off of your backs but then have that
 
00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
committee come in to say yes this is
 
00:34:03.889 --> 00:34:03.899 align:start position:0%
what's working and this is what's not
 
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
working so uh can you tell me whether
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
you you think an outside agency is a
 
00:34:10.129 --> 00:34:10.139 align:start position:0%
good idea or do you think it's this is
 
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
something that should be done totally
 
00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
in-house in in your your group thank you
 
00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:15.829 align:start position:0%
in-house in in your your group thank you
I

00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
I guess I would I would say yes the the
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
answer is an outside agency or most
 
00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:22.919 align:start position:0%
everywhere else it is would be the
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
department of my office legislative
 
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
Services would be the one to handle a
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
lot of this but as I've said we've I've
 
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
got seven attorneys and we're just
 
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
recovering from uh drafting all this
 
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
stuff right now and now we're in
 
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
amendments and uh you know people think
 
00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:39.300 align:start position:0%
that a lot of members think that we
 
00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
don't once we get through uh this
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
session that we have Summers off it
 
00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
takes us a good month as after the
 
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
adjournment to get the bills enrolled
 
00:34:54.649 --> 00:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
and sent up to the governor so uh
 
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
there's there's a month of work there
 
00:34:58.010 --> 00:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
that everyone's working on we do the
 
00:34:59.870 --> 00:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
publishing we're in charge of this book
 
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
getting these books and working with
 
00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
Thompson Reuters West and getting the
 
00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
laws of and getting the education
 
00:35:07.609 --> 00:35:07.619 align:start position:0%
volumes out and the Fish and Game
 
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
volumes out and and other books that we
 
00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:13.140 align:start position:0%
produce and we just got questions
 
00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:15.060 align:start position:0%
yesterday from the publisher what about
 
00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
all these contingencies that uh we have
 
00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:19.380 align:start position:0%
been included in the laws over the past
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
year should we take them out and so we
 
00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of things that we do uh
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
that that kind of behind the scenes and
 
00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
this is certainly one of them I'm
 
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
getting kind of inside baseball-ish on
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
on inside legislative work but uh
 
00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:37.140 align:start position:0%
yeah but they need that would be need to
 
00:35:41.329 --> 00:35:41.339 align:start position:0%
be an appropriation to hire someone or
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
to hire a a group I don't know uh
 
00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
that's something that would have that
 
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
needs to be considered but in my mind
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
the most important thing is getting
 
00:35:53.329 --> 00:35:53.339 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
that commission or working group
 
00:35:57.829 --> 00:35:57.839 align:start position:0%
steering committee with the stakeholders
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh set and the mission statement very
 
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.470 align:start position:0%
uh set and the mission statement very
clear

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
um when I worked
 
00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
at the department of Ed
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
I don't think a day went by when I
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
didn't have at least five conversations
 
00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
with the Attorney General's office and
 
00:36:20.329 --> 00:36:20.339 align:start position:0%
it is a matter of intent with our
 
00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
legislation so I don't argue with that I
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
think it would be a good idea to have
 
00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
somebody come in and do the work but I
 
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
think somehow someway the practitioners
 
00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:31.740 align:start position:0%
and the attorneys our attorney general's
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
office they've been engaged in this um I
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
just remember the number of lawsuits
 
00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:40.980 align:start position:0%
that we've had just
 
00:36:43.849 --> 00:36:43.859 align:start position:0%
setting a policy or just getting out a
 
00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
memo of a superintendent's
 
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
I would have to make sure that I ran it
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
by the Attorney General's office before
 
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
we sent it out to school districts just
 
00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
to make sure everything was as it should
 
00:36:58.130 --> 00:36:58.140 align:start position:0%
be and we're not getting anything in
 
00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
place that shouldn't be there we have to
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
be careful about those things and with
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
the laws now with the way they conflict
 
00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
with each other at times it's got to be
 
00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
extremely confusing but I just I I hope
 
00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:12.300 align:start position:0%
that we figure out some kind of a
 
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner process but I think we need
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
to engage these stakeholders and the
 
00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
people who have been working with some
 
00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:20.060 align:start position:0%
of these
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
laws that that they need to have some
 
00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
input into this too and representative
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
Heath uh from a practical point when you
 
00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:31.140 align:start position:0%
were finishing up at doe I was I I
 
00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
served for nine years in the Hudson
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
School Board eight of which is chair
 
00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
Lynn Ober was my vice chair for all all
 
00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:38.700 align:start position:0%
those years so Lynn and I go have a long
 
00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
history we've known each other uh
 
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
interesting a long a long time and in
 
00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:45.300 align:start position:0%
addition to being on the school board
 
00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
the Hudson's School Board I served on
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
the board for the academy for Science
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
and design as well as the private
 
00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
another private true private school so I
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
have I I the old the old big education
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
volumes we talked about I that thing was
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
dog-eared and had more Post-it notes
 
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
hanging out of it uh and highlighted
 
00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
highlights in it because I use that as a
 
00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:12.060 align:start position:0%
as a Bible and yeah it's not
 
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
that that didn't mean that I interpreted
 
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
things correctly or intent of the
 
00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:22.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman no no thank you
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
for being here and thank you for all the
 
00:38:25.609 --> 00:38:25.619 align:start position:0%
work you do at OLS it's amazing what you
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
can do with seven people well we have
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
more than seven people but those guys
 
00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
but I mean your main lines I appreciate
 
00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:33.540 align:start position:0%
that thank you it's I'll let them know
 
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
that it's very encouraging especially
 
00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:36.660 align:start position:0%
when you like you say you go to other
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
conferences and uh you get one of one of
 
00:38:40.849 --> 00:38:40.859 align:start position:0%
our big questions you really make a
 
00:38:42.349 --> 00:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a year I mean that's
 
00:38:44.569 --> 00:38:44.579 align:start position:0%
that's a big one but uh the question I
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
had would you add Sunset Provisions to
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
this process
 
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
well I I I we're talking about just
 
00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
restating the laws that are that are
 
00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
already in existence so I don't if he's
 
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
talking about a sunset of the
 
00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
commission's work if you will uh it it
 
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
would be nice to have some sort of
 
00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:10.740 align:start position:0%
deadline I guess but since we're going
 
00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
into pretty much unknown territory and
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
knowing in 67 it took six years and in
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
Colorado it took I think something
 
00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
similar to that five years six years for
 
00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
that big uh Omnibus Bill
 
00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
I I just don't know I know we do things
 
00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
different here and we tend to be more
 
00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
efficient here but uh its unknown
 
00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
territory as to how much time it
 
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
actually would take I think it would be
 
00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:36.060 align:start position:0%
a good thing to have some sort of date
 
00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:37.740 align:start position:0%
in there can always change it if it's
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
uh in uh
 
00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:47.220 align:start position:0%
roughly 2011. we we looked at this and
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh we I don't know where it came from
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
but we figured out it would take six
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
years to recodify the education law and
 
00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
uh with uh representative Balboni and at
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
the time he was chairman of education
 
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
and uh it uh we we found it I mean it
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
was a huge task I mean more than we can
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
handle because we're only you know
 
00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
you're only guaranteed
 
00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
you know two years and uh if it takes
 
00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
six years you you're not even going to
 
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
have con Continuum of uh people to work
 
00:40:18.109 --> 00:40:18.119 align:start position:0%
on this project that's right and you
 
00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
have to also recognize that every
 
00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:22.740 align:start position:0%
especially in education every session
 
00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
you're going to have changes to those
 
00:40:26.089 --> 00:40:26.099 align:start position:0%
laws so as you're rewriting those laws
 
00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
we're getting new laws put on the books
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
that have to be Clara put aside or or
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
implemented that you can't forget about
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
not to mention that as part of this
 
00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:37.020 align:start position:0%
process you have to have
 
00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:40.740 align:start position:0%
tables that refer back so what was you
 
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
know RSA 195 what XYZ now becomes
 
00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
rsa1234a and then and so you have to
 
00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:51.660 align:start position:0%
have that crosswalk of what law now what
 
00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
it was and what it is now and uh that's
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh think about that sort of spreadsheet
 
00:40:59.870 --> 00:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's one of the things we do
 
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
at OLS is every statute every every bill
 
00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
that affects each statute
 
00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
we have a we have a list it's uh and of
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
of Are We amending are we deleting are
 
00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.670 align:start position:0%
of Are We amending are we deleting are
we

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
doing whatever to that statute so that
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
we can look back to try to eliminate the
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
conflicts which come up every single
 
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
session uh as to which law should take
 
00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:24.780 align:start position:0%
precedence uh because we change we
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
change there are times we change the
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
same chapter of law the same section of
 
00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:32.220 align:start position:0%
law five times in a legislative session
 
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
so that so we create we create those
 
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
sort of Master tables uh and that's a
 
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
significant undertaking each legislative
 
00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
session but that's the sort of thing
 
00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
that would have to happen with a with a
 
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
recodification as well
 
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.030 align:start position:0%
recodification as well
well

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:41:49.849 --> 00:41:49.859 align:start position:0%
this is obviously grown to a bigger idea
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
and before we end on this discussion we
 
00:41:55.069 --> 00:41:55.079 align:start position:0%
we have to have a next step on who's
 
00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
going to do it
 
00:41:59.329 --> 00:41:59.339 align:start position:0%
uh so I don't know is the prime sponsor
 
00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
are you in the mood to
 
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:11.220 align:start position:0%
what stakeholders and all of that but
 
00:42:13.609 --> 00:42:13.619 align:start position:0%
but that's minor I mean that's but
 
00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
certainly uh you know I'm happy to work
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether it would be
 
00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
I don't know who's going to be that well
 
00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
I certainly certainly certainly with OLS
 
00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:25.490 align:start position:0%
I certainly certainly certainly with OLS
Department

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
Department
 
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
because the wheelbarrow you're going to
 
00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
dump is going in his Department
 
00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:31.980 align:start position:0%
so he if he has some input he won't be
 
00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
and and we're available all the time too
 
00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
so I'm not handing you the ball saying
 
00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
go no through the line but no one has
 
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
the counter on the market on a good idea
 
00:42:54.349 --> 00:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry you've got to come up to the
 
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:56.220 align:start position:0%
mic I forgot about this broadcast yeah
 
00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:57.170 align:start position:0%
mic I forgot about this broadcast yeah
yeah

00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:57.180 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:42:59.089 --> 00:42:59.099 align:start position:0%
all right well
 
00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
for the record then the prime sponsors
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
agreed to carry the ball and help with
 
00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
some revision of this bill to be a
 
00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
bigger idea uh and have more
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh substance and probably more money
 
00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:14.700 align:start position:0%
I would guess but that's
 
00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:15.950 align:start position:0%
I would guess but that's
okay

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
so I would need a motion to retain this
 
00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:24.050 align:start position:0%
so I would need a motion to retain this
primary

00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:26.220 align:start position:0%
well if the clerk would call the roller
 
00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:34.430 align:start position:0%
well if the clerk would call the roller
please

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
so we have a motion to retain
 
00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:39.020 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna
 
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
representative Petra
 
00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.770 align:start position:0%
representative Petra
yes

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
representative Bean
 
00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:47.660 align:start position:0%
representative of each memory yes
 
00:43:50.569 --> 00:43:50.579 align:start position:0%
representative buco
 
00:43:53.809 --> 00:43:53.819 align:start position:0%
representative Heath yes
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative Murray yes representative
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
haken Phillips yes and chairman Emerick
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
yes motion passes eight to zero okay
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
so we'll close the work session on HP
 
00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:10.980 align:start position:0%
468 and we'll now open the work session
 
00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
and this is the bill that pertains to
 
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
feminine hygiene products
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
so does anybody anybody happy yes Mary
 
00:44:30.119 --> 00:44:31.670 align:start position:0%
so does anybody anybody happy yes Mary
I'm

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:44:36.109 --> 00:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
I believe in the standards I'm not
 
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
familiar with the new standards for the
 
00:44:44.349 --> 00:44:44.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed but in former standards
 
00:44:47.329 --> 00:44:47.339 align:start position:0%
usually in school districts
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
um things like toilet tissue paper
 
00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.290 align:start position:0%
um things like toilet tissue paper
towels

00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:51.300 align:start position:0%
towels
 
00:44:53.809 --> 00:44:53.819 align:start position:0%
um those kinds of soap those kinds of
 
00:44:56.329 --> 00:44:56.339 align:start position:0%
things are just generally
 
00:44:59.150 --> 00:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
um purchased as part of the the school
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
maintenance and the things that they
 
00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
provide on a day-to-day basis and it
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
just seems like
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
to actually pull out one particular
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
thing and say that the state needs to
 
00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
pay for it
 
00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
I just think it's confusing and might we
 
00:45:18.309 --> 00:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
end up with um
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
numerous bills all of a sudden coming
 
00:45:22.609 --> 00:45:22.619 align:start position:0%
forward to us saying that the state
 
00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:24.300 align:start position:0%
needs to pay for
 
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
paper towels that are being used
 
00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:28.740 align:start position:0%
excessively or something so I just I had
 
00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
a little bit of concern about it and it
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
appears that um the current bill in its
 
00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:38.700 align:start position:0%
current form seems to be working
 
00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
um you know we have the school boards
 
00:45:41.809 --> 00:45:41.819 align:start position:0%
Association here so maybe they can
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
comment because I don't know I'm not out
 
00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:46.140 align:start position:0%
and about and I'm not hearing people say
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
things about it so I'm that would be a
 
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
question that I would ask but I just I I
 
00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
don't know why we would single this out
 
00:45:58.130 --> 00:45:58.140 align:start position:0%
foreign yes
 
00:45:59.630 --> 00:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
yes yeah I'd like to ask a further
 
00:46:00.589 --> 00:46:00.599 align:start position:0%
question from you know either
 
00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:02.460 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards or someone when
 
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
they have a chance why we need the thing
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
about school districts may take
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate action to preclude or
 
00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:09.300 align:start position:0%
prevent vandalism
 
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:10.609 align:start position:0%
prevent vandalism
Etc

00:46:10.609 --> 00:46:10.619 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't they do that anyway why do
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
we need to have a particular provision
 
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
to say yes you can do this when I would
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
expect given the nature of some of these
 
00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:22.980 align:start position:0%
incidents they would have they would do
 
00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
that anyway that just seems to be common
 
00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
sense and standard so I don't know why
 
00:46:29.329 --> 00:46:29.339 align:start position:0%
that needs to be specified in the bill
 
00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
so I'd be glad for response to that
 
00:46:40.089 --> 00:46:40.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you Mr chair uh and and to
 
00:46:46.569 --> 00:46:46.579 align:start position:0%
uh representative Murray's uh question
 
00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
uh the uh principal testified yesterday
 
00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
for Auburn Village School saying that uh
 
00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:00.180 align:start position:0%
she believes that the the law created
 
00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:01.990 align:start position:0%
she believes that the the law created
um

00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
constraints and requirements around the
 
00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
provision of these products
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
in a way in which it's costing them
 
00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:13.640 align:start position:0%
incremental money and that it's creating
 
00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
waste and
 
00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:17.450 align:start position:0%
waste and
um so

00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
um so so I I guess I would defer to her
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
um because she has an attorney that
 
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
helps them interpret the law and to
 
00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:28.740 align:start position:0%
figure out what's required to implement
 
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
the law and and I and given that I know
 
00:47:34.609 --> 00:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
her a bit I know that she wouldn't want
 
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
to you know over regulate herself to do
 
00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:41.180 align:start position:0%
that so I I can only assume that she's
 
00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
acting in a reasonable way based on the
 
00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:47.220 align:start position:0%
school's attorney guidance and to
 
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
representative Heath if I may Well
 
00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
I this bill did not intend to single out
 
00:47:59.170 --> 00:47:59.180 align:start position:0%
a particular product it intended to
 
00:48:02.569 --> 00:48:02.579 align:start position:0%
single out a particular legislative
 
00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
action that was taken in a prior term to
 
00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:07.569 align:start position:0%
action that was taken in a prior term to
add

00:48:07.569 --> 00:48:07.579 align:start position:0%
add
 
00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:11.700 align:start position:0%
this specific mandate with a total
 
00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:16.380 align:start position:0%
disregard to the 28-a issue and and so
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
my frustration with with this issue for
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
years now is is that uh as legislatures
 
00:48:26.569 --> 00:48:26.579 align:start position:0%
we tend to get we've been tending to get
 
00:48:29.809 --> 00:48:29.819 align:start position:0%
distracted by the the product and the
 
00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
and the need for the product and and
 
00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
somehow it keeps us from thinking about
 
00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
our 28a obligation and and this is
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
really me you know saying hey if we're
 
00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
it it's it's bad practice I think uh for
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
us to start chipping away at this
 
00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
constitutional prohibition of unfunded
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
mandates because if we get this
 
00:48:56.569 --> 00:48:56.579 align:start position:0%
precedent and we get this Habit in place
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
then what's next we'll continue down the
 
00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
road of adding unfunded mandates so so
 
00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
your concern is in the other direction
 
00:49:07.309 --> 00:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
that we'll start to fund things that
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
aren't mentioned in State Statute I'm
 
00:49:12.829 --> 00:49:12.839 align:start position:0%
more concerned about adding things to
 
00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:15.540 align:start position:0%
state state statute that are unfunded
 
00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:18.050 align:start position:0%
state state statute that are unfunded
mandates

00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman I just want to State
 
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
you know in regards to the earlier
 
00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
remarks about why are we singling this
 
00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:25.980 align:start position:0%
out that
 
00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:28.380 align:start position:0%
I think if the state creates obligations
 
00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
out of other governments the
 
00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution clearly says the state has
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
to pay for them if we don't like paying
 
00:49:37.609 --> 00:49:37.619 align:start position:0%
for them we shouldn't mandate that I'm I
 
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with the law is written but
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
what is the lowest bust the state also
 
00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:45.300 align:start position:0%
incurred that obligation to fund it fund
 
00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
it properly and it is our constitutional
 
00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
duty to do so so I do not have a concern
 
00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
you know I do not share the concern
 
00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:55.740 align:start position:0%
Express that this may lead to other
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
things that are not State mandates being
 
00:49:59.329 --> 00:49:59.339 align:start position:0%
required to be funded by the state
 
00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:01.380 align:start position:0%
because the basis for this very funding
 
00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
is very simple it's an unfunded mandate
 
00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
and we should fund it if some other
 
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
things are not a clear mandate for the
 
00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
state we don't have an obligation to
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
fund it we may choose to fund them or
 
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
not but it would not bear the same type
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
of obligation that I perceive here thank
 
00:50:15.359 --> 00:50:18.790 align:start position:0%
of obligation that I perceive here thank
you

00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I think just
 
00:50:23.569 --> 00:50:23.579 align:start position:0%
following along the lines of this you
 
00:50:26.089 --> 00:50:26.099 align:start position:0%
know stream of thought if we're
 
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
concerned about an unfunded mandate
 
00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:30.300 align:start position:0%
regarding to feminine products my
 
00:50:31.609 --> 00:50:31.619 align:start position:0%
question would be
 
00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:34.980 align:start position:0%
then are also the requirements to have
 
00:50:36.829 --> 00:50:36.839 align:start position:0%
toilet paper and paper towel also
 
00:50:38.569 --> 00:50:38.579 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandates and now we need to go
 
00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
back and start thinking about you know
 
00:50:43.849 --> 00:50:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't believe there's
 
00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:46.740 align:start position:0%
legislation that says you have to have
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
toilet paper and paper towels I don't
 
00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:48.970 align:start position:0%
toilet paper and paper towels I don't
know

00:50:48.970 --> 00:50:48.980 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
what that big book maybe there is I'm
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:55.740 align:start position:0%
I just think it's a good question to
 
00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
consider I mean these products are also
 
00:50:59.450 --> 00:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
used in the restroom and considered
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
required to use the restroom so why are
 
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
we singling out this specific product
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
when we're also paying for toilet paper
 
00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:09.300 align:start position:0%
and paper towel so I think if that's you
 
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
know the theory we're gonna go with we
 
00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
need to be intellectually consistent
 
00:51:14.809 --> 00:51:14.819 align:start position:0%
across the board well one of the one of
 
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
the conclusions is we can rescind the
 
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.609 align:start position:0%
the conclusions is we can rescind the
legislation

00:51:18.609 --> 00:51:18.619 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:21.660 align:start position:0%
and let the school districts do as they
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
might I mean that's that's an
 
00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:25.740 align:start position:0%
alternative down the road for sure
 
00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:29.220 align:start position:0%
do you want to make a comment uh only at
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
your invitation Mr chair it's your work
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
session uh I I would I would say that
 
00:51:38.329 --> 00:51:38.339 align:start position:0%
the uh the to the representative's point
 
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
the the the theory here is is a simple
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
one those other products that happen to
 
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
be in the bathroom are not mandated by
 
00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:50.940 align:start position:0%
state law if if you could find the
 
00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:52.980 align:start position:0%
Mandate in state law on those being
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
required then I think your concern would
 
00:52:00.109 --> 00:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
be validated uh as it turns out this is
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
the only product uh in the bathroom that
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
we're requiring as the state and that
 
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
triggers Our 28a obligation if we
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
mandate it we must pay for it and
 
00:52:14.329 --> 00:52:14.339 align:start position:0%
I you know and those other things are
 
00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
just great ideas to include the
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
provision of menstrual products and
 
00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:20.460 align:start position:0%
those products were being provided long
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
before the state stepped in uh it's 100
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
years the schools have been taking care
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
of the problem uh without a state
 
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
mandate so
 
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
um so it the state initiated contact on
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
this issue and when we initiated contact
 
00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:38.700 align:start position:0%
on this issue we incurred an obligation
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
to do our job
 
00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:42.829 align:start position:0%
to do our job
yeah

00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
thank you a couple things I just got a
 
00:52:47.089 --> 00:52:47.099 align:start position:0%
text about a large high school yesterday
 
00:52:49.309 --> 00:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
you said the cost is no big deal and the
 
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
current program is working just fine but
 
00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
that's not why I raised my hand but it's
 
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
a good it's a good point to consider
 
00:52:58.010 --> 00:52:58.020 align:start position:0%
that it seems schools are doing just
 
00:52:59.809 --> 00:52:59.819 align:start position:0%
fine right now
 
00:53:02.569 --> 00:53:02.579 align:start position:0%
um apropos the other we sort of fund the
 
00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
you know to a certain extent we are
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
funding toilet paper and paper towels
 
00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:07.980 align:start position:0%
and all that other stuff through the
 
00:53:10.609 --> 00:53:10.619 align:start position:0%
money that we give to the schools in our
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
you know adequacy but the state is
 
00:53:14.089 --> 00:53:14.099 align:start position:0%
providing funding for this I can see
 
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
this being singled out because that for
 
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
a lot of people believe it or not this
 
00:53:20.329 --> 00:53:20.339 align:start position:0%
is sort of a new idea and it's a little
 
00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
bit of an edgy idea it's only fairly
 
00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:24.900 align:start position:0%
recently that we're talking about this
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
um and I hate can I I just need to go
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
back to section five here about you know
 
00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:33.660 align:start position:0%
doing the damage before this bill before
 
00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:35.940 align:start position:0%
the bill that said that these products
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
needed to be provided
 
00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there were girls who were
 
00:53:41.329 --> 00:53:41.339 align:start position:0%
flushing pads down the toilet and
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
throwing them in the walls and all that
 
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
sort of stuff that is not a new problem
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
and schools have already been dealing
 
00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
with those issues janitorial issues and
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
cleaning issues
 
00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:52.140 align:start position:0%
as long as they're as long as this has
 
00:53:54.049 --> 00:53:54.059 align:start position:0%
been going on so again I'm just
 
00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:56.220 align:start position:0%
concerned about I don't think I don't
 
00:53:58.010 --> 00:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
know why this is necessary to me it
 
00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:01.140 align:start position:0%
confuses the issue I see both sides in
 
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
terms of the school funding these
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
products already and from what I've been
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
hearing it's just not a big deal for the
 
00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
schools to pick up the cost it's not an
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
onerous Demand on the schools so I don't
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
know if we really need to go down this
 
00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
path where I do see that there's value
 
00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
to it is that it brings it to the
 
00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:20.220 align:start position:0%
Forefront because this is a discussion
 
00:54:23.329 --> 00:54:23.339 align:start position:0%
that has been frankly taboo for many
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
many decades and girls did not go to
 
00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
school because they were embarrassed
 
00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
they didn't want to go to the guidance
 
00:54:31.490 --> 00:54:31.500 align:start position:0%
counselor this puts it within reach of
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
them so again I says I'm concerned I
 
00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
don't know why we need to tell that the
 
00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
schools can clean up when the kids have
 
00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
made a mess because they've been doing
 
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
that since kids have been making messes
 
00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:42.290 align:start position:0%
that since kids have been making messes
and

00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:42.300 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:44.569 --> 00:54:44.579 align:start position:0%
um we are funding all these products
 
00:54:46.849 --> 00:54:46.859 align:start position:0%
through what we do through education and
 
00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
it seems to me the schools are have been
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
taking up that cost for uh these
 
00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
feminine products with the new one
 
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
without too much of a concern if it's
 
00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
just a constitutional issue
 
00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
to me that's
 
00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:02.150 align:start position:0%
to me that's
um

00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:05.329 --> 00:55:05.339 align:start position:0%
maybe being too sensitive about I know
 
00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:07.740 align:start position:0%
how much the Constitution matters to you
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
and to me there's a little bit maybe of
 
00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
an oversensitivity in terms of how the
 
00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
original bill was written so
 
00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:17.630 align:start position:0%
original bill was written so
okay

00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just want wanted to
 
00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
the man that the reason why and I'm
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
gonna guess here but uh the reason why I
 
00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
consider the uh section five on taking
 
00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate action to preclude and
 
00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:36.780 align:start position:0%
prevent vandalism and theft product
 
00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:39.720 align:start position:0%
comes with State funding if we are gonna
 
00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:41.700 align:start position:0%
fund for this we have to you know
 
00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:43.980 align:start position:0%
clarify that when you receive those
 
00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
funds to provide those things you have
 
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
an obligation to make sure they are used
 
00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
appropriately I I would not think this
 
00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
would be necessary if we didn't fund and
 
00:55:56.809 --> 00:55:56.819 align:start position:0%
mandate this and in regards to this
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
being a minor you know uh Financial
 
00:56:03.290 --> 00:56:03.300 align:start position:0%
impact be that as it may it's still an
 
00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:05.220 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate and if it's a minor
 
00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
Financial impact on the school it will
 
00:56:08.569 --> 00:56:08.579 align:start position:0%
be a very minor impact on the state
 
00:56:11.809 --> 00:56:11.819 align:start position:0%
budget to do their job so I think the
 
00:56:14.089 --> 00:56:14.099 align:start position:0%
amount is commensurate with you know the
 
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
mandates so yeah indeed they are not
 
00:56:18.109 --> 00:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
either of them a huge deal but as a
 
00:56:20.089 --> 00:56:20.099 align:start position:0%
matter of principle unfunded mandates
 
00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:23.460 align:start position:0%
should not be allowed so thank you
 
00:56:26.329 --> 00:56:26.339 align:start position:0%
coming just a quick response and I'm
 
00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
afraid we might be going down a rabbit
 
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
hole here if you have a plugged toilet
 
00:56:31.549 --> 00:56:31.559 align:start position:0%
you don't know whether the pad is from
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
the pad the girl brought from home or
 
00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
whether it's a pet she got from school I
 
00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
mean the toilet is plugged and it needs
 
00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
to be fixed and I don't really see why
 
00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:41.700 align:start position:0%
it is germane to this bill
 
00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
okay the department of
 
00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
who was here from
 
00:56:50.089 --> 00:56:50.099 align:start position:0%
yes I'm not familiar with all the
 
00:56:56.349 --> 00:56:56.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:58.849 --> 00:56:58.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair my name is Barrett
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
Christine I'm the executive director of
 
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire school boards
 
00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
Association I don't know if I really
 
00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
have anything to add other than I'm just
 
00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
here listening to the conversation
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
um by way of background when the initial
 
00:57:09.359 --> 00:57:10.309 align:start position:0%
um by way of background when the initial
bill

00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
um uh was presented to the legislature I
 
00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:15.180 align:start position:0%
forget two or three sessions ago nhsba
 
00:57:17.450 --> 00:57:17.460 align:start position:0%
did not take a position on the bill
 
00:57:18.890 --> 00:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
um we were caught in sort of a rock and
 
00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:20.700 align:start position:0%
a hard place we wanted to be supportive
 
00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
of young women in our schools but we
 
00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:24.900 align:start position:0%
also shared representative Edwards
 
00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:26.220 align:start position:0%
concerns that it was going to be an
 
00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:28.980 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate a lot of the testimony
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
um was from that from school districts
 
00:57:34.370 --> 00:57:34.380 align:start position:0%
were saying we're already doing this we
 
00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
built it into our own local budget the
 
00:57:39.530 --> 00:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
concern about the impact of the bill
 
00:57:42.890 --> 00:57:42.900 align:start position:0%
crossed nhsba's desk The Following fall
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
when the Manchester School District was
 
00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:47.460 align:start position:0%
implementing it and the reports I got
 
00:57:49.309 --> 00:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
from Manchester school boards was that
 
00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
it cost them about a hundred and fifty
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to implement this in
 
00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:55.380 align:start position:0%
Manchester some of those were one-time
 
00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
costs they had to buy the dispensers
 
00:57:59.809 --> 00:57:59.819 align:start position:0%
that go on the wall or the door or
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
whatnot so the recurring costs for the
 
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
products the feminine hygiene products
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
themselves I don't know
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
um we did sign in support to uh uh the
 
00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:11.220 align:start position:0%
bill yesterday to representative Edwards
 
00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:12.780 align:start position:0%
Bill yesterday
 
00:58:14.569 --> 00:58:14.579 align:start position:0%
um simply because if there are school
 
00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
districts that were not doing this
 
00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:19.140 align:start position:0%
before we're not paying for it out of
 
00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
local funds but now we're being
 
00:58:23.329 --> 00:58:23.339 align:start position:0%
obligated to do so
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
um uh because of the state mandate
 
00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
whether from nhsba's position whether or
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
not that's one dollar or a hundred
 
00:58:30.650 --> 00:58:30.660 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per School District
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
it's a state obligation the state
 
00:58:36.049 --> 00:58:36.059 align:start position:0%
mandate the state should pay for it to
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
the other points about
 
00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:39.660 align:start position:0%
um paper towels and soap and toilet
 
00:58:41.809 --> 00:58:41.819 align:start position:0%
paper again there's nothing explicit in
 
00:58:44.089 --> 00:58:44.099 align:start position:0%
law that requires a school district have
 
00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
toilet paper but we know that there's
 
00:58:47.569 --> 00:58:47.579 align:start position:0%
been toilet paper in school since we've
 
00:58:49.250 --> 00:58:49.260 align:start position:0%
had Public Schools
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
um what that's paid from I don't that's
 
00:58:53.450 --> 00:58:53.460 align:start position:0%
a good question I don't I don't know if
 
00:58:54.890 --> 00:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
any I don't know the attic was the
 
00:58:58.010 --> 00:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
formula as well as I probably should I'm
 
00:58:59.450 --> 00:58:59.460 align:start position:0%
guessing a lot of that would be local
 
00:59:00.890 --> 00:59:00.900 align:start position:0%
money I don't think you're getting
 
00:59:03.650 --> 00:59:03.660 align:start position:0%
adequacy aid for paper towels and but so
 
00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
it's probably local money but regardless
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
of of of of of of the issue I'll sum up
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
um many districts were already doing
 
00:59:13.609 --> 00:59:13.619 align:start position:0%
this prior to the law to the extent that
 
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
there was a fiscal impact on districts
 
00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:17.700 align:start position:0%
that were not doing this as a result of
 
00:59:19.609 --> 00:59:19.619 align:start position:0%
this legislation and this mandate and
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
hsba would support funding funding the
 
00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
bill if you will
 
00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:26.450 align:start position:0%
bill if you will
questions

00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:26.460 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:27.710 align:start position:0%
questions
yes

00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:59:30.289 --> 00:59:30.299 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr uh
 
00:59:30.299 --> 00:59:31.549 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr uh
Christina

00:59:31.549 --> 00:59:31.559 align:start position:0%
Christina
 
00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:33.780 align:start position:0%
um for taking my question
 
00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:36.839 align:start position:0%
um are you aware what the cost is for
 
00:59:38.809 --> 00:59:38.819 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
in general I guess pick a district that
 
00:59:43.849 --> 00:59:43.859 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with for students who do
 
00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:46.020 align:start position:0%
miss school because of menstruation
 
00:59:47.569 --> 00:59:47.579 align:start position:0%
products not being affirmatively
 
00:59:49.609 --> 00:59:49.619 align:start position:0%
available and you know what what that
 
00:59:51.650 --> 00:59:51.660 align:start position:0%
long-term cost might be as opposed to
 
00:59:54.109 --> 00:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
the The Upfront cost of just providing
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
the product sure thank you very much for
 
00:59:58.010 --> 00:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
the question representative well there's
 
01:00:01.069 --> 01:00:01.079 align:start position:0%
um a non-tangible cost every time a
 
01:00:02.569 --> 01:00:02.579 align:start position:0%
student misses school whether or not
 
01:00:05.809 --> 01:00:05.819 align:start position:0%
that's a half a day one day or multiple
 
01:00:08.569 --> 01:00:08.579 align:start position:0%
days how that's measurable I I don't
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
know um to be clear I'm not an educator
 
01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
by trade I'm a lawyer by trade but we
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
have Educators that could probably talk
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
to for Johnny or this is not Johnny
 
01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
Sally misses three days of school my
 
01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:22.380 align:start position:0%
apologies if Sally misses three days of
 
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
school this may be the detrimental
 
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
impact on her education
 
01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:28.260 align:start position:0%
would you believe that I think it's
 
01:00:31.309 --> 01:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
probably more I believe that the cost
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
you know the tangible and intangible
 
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
costs may be more than just providing
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
the product it's certainly believable to
 
01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
your question representative
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
answering my question my concern is this
 
01:00:48.049 --> 01:00:48.059 align:start position:0%
um for years we put into place any kind
 
01:00:50.329 --> 01:00:50.339 align:start position:0%
of legislation
 
01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:52.740 align:start position:0%
um schools right now are fulfilling this
 
01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
if in fact
 
01:00:58.490 --> 01:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
we decide to go forward with the bill as
 
01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:03.180 align:start position:0%
is and the legislator legislature in
 
01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:06.140 align:start position:0%
future years choose not to fund this
 
01:01:08.809 --> 01:01:08.819 align:start position:0%
then what happens do school districts
 
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
just go back to not providing these
 
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
products for young women
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
um that's my big concern because we've
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
seen as we've heard time and time again
 
01:01:19.569 --> 01:01:19.579 align:start position:0%
that there are lots of laws on the books
 
01:01:22.849 --> 01:01:22.859 align:start position:0%
and one of the mechanisms to not really
 
01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
fulfilling that piece of legislation is
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
simply to say we don't have available
 
01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:28.980 align:start position:0%
funds to do it
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question
 
01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:31.910 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question
representative

01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:32.930 align:start position:0%
representative
um

01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:32.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:35.089 --> 01:01:35.099 align:start position:0%
every time the state walks back for many
 
01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
of the time any of its
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
um previous Financial Obligations the
 
01:01:40.849 --> 01:01:40.859 align:start position:0%
local school districts and the local
 
01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:42.900 align:start position:0%
taxpayers always pick up the dime New
 
01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Retirement Systems special
 
01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
education costs the list goes on and on
 
01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:49.140 align:start position:0%
and on the the legislature cut funding
 
01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:50.940 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire retirement system
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
local taxpayers are paying that
 
01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:55.740 align:start position:0%
difference now I presume that's if the
 
01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
law were taken off the books I would
 
01:01:58.370 --> 01:01:58.380 align:start position:0%
think that districts would probably
 
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
still be providing these these products
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
for for young girls thank you thank you
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman just a quick
 
01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
clarification right now we are in a
 
01:02:10.849 --> 01:02:10.859 align:start position:0%
situation where we have the law and we
 
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
don't have the funding and the
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
experience shows that every school does
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
provide the products they just do it on
 
01:02:19.490 --> 01:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
their own time I would not see any
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
reason any reason for a future School
 
01:02:23.569 --> 01:02:23.579 align:start position:0%
District to walk back from providing
 
01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
those products if we leave the law on
 
01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:26.700 align:start position:0%
the books but we don't appropriate
 
01:02:29.569 --> 01:02:29.579 align:start position:0%
correctly I would object to that but I
 
01:02:31.549 --> 01:02:31.559 align:start position:0%
do not think that if a legislature makes
 
01:02:33.890 --> 01:02:33.900 align:start position:0%
that decision however unwise I may think
 
01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
that decision may be that will change
 
01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
the impact it will change the
 
01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
availability of the product but it will
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
change it is that will hurt school
 
01:02:43.490 --> 01:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
districts will now have to deal with an
 
01:02:45.890 --> 01:02:45.900 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate so that's why I think
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
passing the bill is a good idea and that
 
01:02:50.930 --> 01:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
you know it should make things better I
 
01:02:53.329 --> 01:02:53.339 align:start position:0%
just don't really see this as creating
 
01:02:55.609 --> 01:02:55.619 align:start position:0%
an extra risk thank you
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh let's not forget
 
01:02:57.839 --> 01:02:58.970 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh let's not forget
that

01:02:58.970 --> 01:02:58.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
um one of the reasons that this bill was
 
01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:01.799 align:start position:0%
passed in the first place is that
 
01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
because there were school districts who
 
01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
were not providing appropriate products
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
they were not providing any products and
 
01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:10.430 align:start position:0%
they were not providing any products and
so

01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:13.010 --> 01:03:13.020 align:start position:0%
um to you know it was it was a this
 
01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
becomes a real problem where girls can't
 
01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
go to school but it's not true that
 
01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
schools were already doing this some
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
schools were doing this but not all and
 
01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:22.980 align:start position:0%
that was sort of the um the initial
 
01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
reason for why this bill needed to be
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
put out in the first place is to make
 
01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
sure that girls did have access to
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
quality products
 
01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.170 align:start position:0%
quality products
Joe

01:03:33.170 --> 01:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
Joe
 
01:03:35.809 --> 01:03:35.819 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair uh if you remember
 
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday we had uh testimony from the
 
01:03:40.130 --> 01:03:40.140 align:start position:0%
Auburn uh
 
01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
superintendent I believe his
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
superintendent uh that uh
 
01:03:49.549 --> 01:03:49.559 align:start position:0%
these these uh the reason that they just
 
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
they could uh cause a lawsuit you know
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
because of the 28-a issue but it was so
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:04.130 --> 01:04:04.140 align:start position:0%
okay well the interesting part about
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
this this is my seventh year in finance
 
01:04:08.569 --> 01:04:08.579 align:start position:0%
and it's the first year we had got this
 
01:04:11.329 --> 01:04:11.339 align:start position:0%
many initial bills so we don't know how
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
to act uh what I do know is we don't
 
01:04:17.089 --> 01:04:17.099 align:start position:0%
have a budget no we don't have a revenue
 
01:04:21.549 --> 01:04:21.559 align:start position:0%
number yet as I said earlier so my my
 
01:04:23.809 --> 01:04:23.819 align:start position:0%
recommendation is that we retain this
 
01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
until we can find out can we fund it
 
01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
because I don't know that I don't know
 
01:04:28.970 --> 01:04:28.980 align:start position:0%
right now whether we can or not we're
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
talking about about two million dollars
 
01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
I mean in the scheme of the five billion
 
01:04:35.030 --> 01:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
dollar budget it's not a big deal but in
 
01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
but in reality two million dollars is
 
01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:39.660 align:start position:0%
still not chump change
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh so I would enter I would entertain
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
um okay move by uh Joe do we have a
 
01:04:46.079 --> 01:04:48.230 align:start position:0%
um okay move by uh Joe do we have a
second

01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
what's up
 
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
okay Daniel we'll give you this this
 
01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:55.990 align:start position:0%
okay Daniel we'll give you this this
round

01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:00.770 --> 01:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
oh okay so um we do have a motion to
 
01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
retain and I'm gonna call the vote uh
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
representative Peter
 
01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:18.240 align:start position:0%

and chairman Emery yes yes uh the motion
 
01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
passes seven to one
 
01:05:41.690 --> 01:05:41.700 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll continue to work on this
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:50.089 --> 01:05:50.099 align:start position:0%
okay we'll close the hearing on 129 and
 
01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
we're going to open up a hearing on
 
01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
three bills because they're topically
 
01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
are in the down the same path
 
01:06:04.370 --> 01:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
and yes Mr chair I just have to excuse
 
01:06:09.289 --> 01:06:09.299 align:start position:0%
myself to introduce another bill and
 
01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:10.980 align:start position:0%
another committee and I apologize to the
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
committee that's all right it's that
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:15.839 --> 01:06:19.130 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
Nick you want to we do have Amy Clark
 
01:06:23.329 --> 01:06:23.339 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education here
 
01:06:25.549 --> 01:06:25.559 align:start position:0%
she'll be our school building Aid expert
 
01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
I think the division getting an overview
 
01:06:30.410 --> 01:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
presentation about the program as it
 
01:06:31.730 --> 01:06:31.740 align:start position:0%
currently is now would be a good start
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
and then we can start talking about
 
01:06:37.970 --> 01:06:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:41.089 --> 01:06:41.099 align:start position:0%
be good to know what we're talking about
 
01:06:41.099 --> 01:06:43.750 align:start position:0%
be good to know what we're talking about
welcome

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:47.809 --> 01:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
you're off okay good morning my name is

01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
Education I'm the administrator for the
 
01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
school safety and facility management
 
01:06:58.130 --> 01:06:58.140 align:start position:0%
Bureau uh I do have a presentation for
 
01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
and actually that one too can go behind
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
thanks Mickey
 
01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.190 align:start position:0%
thanks Mickey
foreign

01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
I think the first packet I'll wait until
 
01:07:15.049 --> 01:07:15.059 align:start position:0%
you have it to start talking but um the
 
01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
first packet will probably look familiar
 
01:07:18.829 --> 01:07:18.839 align:start position:0%
to you because I think that you were
 
01:07:21.289 --> 01:07:21.299 align:start position:0%
handed out something uh similar from
 
01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
um his handout was from my presentation
 
01:07:27.789 --> 01:07:27.799 align:start position:0%
to House Education
 
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
this presentation is almost identical
 
01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:34.980 align:start position:0%
but hearing some questions I added I I
 
01:07:36.829 --> 01:07:36.839 align:start position:0%
added a little bit more information here
 
01:07:38.450 --> 01:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
and there based on some questions that
 
01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
people had so
 
01:07:43.370 --> 01:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
you can ditch that one and and use this
 
01:07:45.289 --> 01:07:45.299 align:start position:0%
they really do look very similar same
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
okay so uh my the program uh you know
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
the packet that I'm talking about is
 
01:08:01.329 --> 01:08:01.339 align:start position:0%
this one it's 11 pages
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
and it just has a table of contents on
 
01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
it for you
 
01:08:09.970 --> 01:08:09.980 align:start position:0%
and if you do get them shuffled in your
 
01:08:12.829 --> 01:08:12.839 align:start position:0%
collection of information do you need
 
01:08:12.839 --> 01:08:14.809 align:start position:0%
collection of information do you need
another

01:08:14.809 --> 01:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
I apologize I would need two more
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
because we are talking about free bills
 
01:08:19.729 --> 01:08:19.739 align:start position:0%
so I would need two more sets of
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
handouts so I can put one in each folder
 
01:08:24.169 --> 01:08:24.179 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh so um if they do get shuffled about
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
um with yesterday's materials and these
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
just there is a revision date on the
 
01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
bottom because they they do look very
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
identical and I'll point out some of the
 
01:08:37.729 --> 01:08:37.739 align:start position:0%
changes along the way if if you care to
 
01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:40.380 align:start position:0%
know what they are uh so uh I'm just
 
01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
going to go through these
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
um and uh when I refer to page numbers
 
01:08:46.729 --> 01:08:46.739 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about the page number in the
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
top right corner all of the documents
 
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
are pulled from different sources and
 
01:08:52.490 --> 01:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
have their own page numbers because
 
01:08:54.169 --> 01:08:54.179 align:start position:0%
they're posted on our website but for
 
01:08:56.150 --> 01:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
this presentation there's 11 pages and
 
01:08:57.769 --> 01:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
that page number is in the top corner so
 
01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
I'll just start on page two well let me
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
flip page one my contact information is
 
01:09:06.289 --> 01:09:06.299 align:start position:0%
on page one if you do need to contact me
 
01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
there's my information there's uh who I
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
am and I'm happy building Aid is always
 
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
so much fun to talk about so feel free
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
to call me at any time uh page two is uh
 
01:09:23.809 --> 01:09:23.819 align:start position:0%
when somebody asks me to put the
 
01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
building aid program on one page I was
 
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
limited to one page this is the page
 
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
that it landed on there's a lot of
 
01:09:35.090 --> 01:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
information on this one page and so this
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
is for the most part what I'm going to
 
01:09:38.150 --> 01:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
talk to you about
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
kind of learning about the program a
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
little bit again more contact
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
information the laws RSA 19815 that is
 
01:09:48.349 --> 01:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
where you'll find building Aid the
 
01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
supporting education rules is under Ed
 
01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:52.450 align:start position:0%
supporting education rules is under Ed
321

01:09:52.450 --> 01:09:52.460 align:start position:0%
321
 
01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
essentially the basics which I think
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
probably you all know at this point but
 
01:09:58.430 --> 01:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
the basics are really building Aid is
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
state aid to Aid to help schools with
 
01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
large construction or reconstruction
 
01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:07.070 align:start position:0%
large construction or reconstruction
projects

01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about there's another
 
01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
fund called the public school
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund that's a school
 
01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
safety Grant those are like for smaller
 
01:10:17.209 --> 01:10:17.219 align:start position:0%
safety Grant projects when we are
 
01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
talking about building Aid we're really
 
01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
talking about multi-million dollar large
 
01:10:23.209 --> 01:10:23.219 align:start position:0%
construction projects or large
 
01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
renovation projects and sometimes it
 
01:10:26.930 --> 01:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
gets smaller if they're in addition but
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
they're still large projects
 
01:10:33.169 --> 01:10:33.179 align:start position:0%
uh building a grants the state share in
 
01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
law this is all what I'm going to talk
 
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
to you about is all in RSA 19815 is the
 
01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
range is between 30 and 60 percent
 
01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
there's a formula in 198 15 that
 
01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
essentially has two functions it is the
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
calculation is a function of median
 
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
family income and equalized valuation
 
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
per pupil
 
01:10:59.810 --> 01:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
some people have talked about the um the
 
01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
rates of median family income being a
 
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
little questionable about whether median
 
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
family income is appropriate or not I
 
01:11:10.010 --> 01:11:10.020 align:start position:0%
guess I just will point out that the um
 
01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
the formula is the ranking of those
 
01:11:15.790 --> 01:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
numbers so it doesn't necessarily matter
 
01:11:18.169 --> 01:11:18.179 align:start position:0%
specifically what the number is in the
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
formula it just matters where you rank
 
01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
in the state so every communities median
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
family income is ranked every
 
01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
community's media uh equalized valuation
 
01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
per pupil is ranked and the formula uses
 
01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
those rankings to place them in a
 
01:11:34.669 --> 01:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
category that ranges from 30 to 60
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
percent more affluent communities that
 
01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
the 30 percent end less affluent
 
01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
communities are at the 60 end I also
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
like to point out with this rate that it
 
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
is not a linear distribution the average
 
01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
rate in new uh for the communities in
 
01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is 38 percent so
 
01:11:56.290 --> 01:11:56.300 align:start position:0%
somebody finds themselves a 40 Community
 
01:11:58.910 --> 01:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
they they kind of feel
 
01:12:00.830 --> 01:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
um you know like they're they're not
 
01:12:02.570 --> 01:12:02.580 align:start position:0%
they feel like they should be much
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
higher rate but really they are above
 
01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
average more below average whichever way
 
01:12:09.410 --> 01:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
you want to look at it uh so the average
 
01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
rate is 38 currently
 
01:12:14.810 --> 01:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
that formula gets calculated
 
01:12:17.090 --> 01:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
um recalculated every year
 
01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
the funding source is uh in the
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
education trust fund that's where you'll
 
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
find building aim
 
01:12:26.930 --> 01:12:26.940 align:start position:0%
and I think when we talk about building
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
Aid it's really important to understand
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
the history of building Aid because
 
01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
um of what well we'll talk about a
 
01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
little later but there's um funds that
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
we're slowly paying off in the past so
 
01:12:40.010 --> 01:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand what the
 
01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
program used to look like because we're
 
01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
still paying for those projects so
 
01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:47.940 align:start position:0%
building Aid had been around since 1946
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
all the way to
 
01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:51.189 align:start position:0%
all the way to
um

01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:51.199 --> 01:12:52.910 align:start position:0%
um
2012.

01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
2012.
 
01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:55.140 align:start position:0%
um before we went into a moratorium the
 
01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
moratorium went into effect actually in
 
01:12:59.630 --> 01:12:59.640 align:start position:0%
2009 but the
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
um the law had been around I was a
 
01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
building Aid was funded between 1946 and
 
01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
2009 and in
 
01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
in 2009 the state went into a moratorium
 
01:13:17.149 --> 01:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
on building Aid and then in 2000 13 the
 
01:13:20.209 --> 01:13:20.219 align:start position:0%
laws significantly changed so there was
 
01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
a 10-year moratorium from 2009 to about
 
01:13:27.229 --> 01:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
2019 where no projects were funded but
 
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
the law changed in the middle of that so
 
01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
in 2013 the law changed uh in the old
 
01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:38.340 align:start position:0%
um structure so from 1946 to 2012 there
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
was in the law was a structure that paid
 
01:13:43.930 --> 01:13:43.940 align:start position:0%
the grants
 
01:13:47.810 --> 01:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
the a portion of the principle on the
 
01:13:49.970 --> 01:13:49.980 align:start position:0%
life of the Lo on the life of the bond
 
01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
that the schools had
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
so if it was a 20-year bond that
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
building a grant was granted out for 20
 
01:13:59.810 --> 01:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
years on the principle of that Bond if
 
01:14:01.729 --> 01:14:01.739 align:start position:0%
they were a 30 Community it would pay 30
 
01:14:03.709 --> 01:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
of the principal all the way throughout
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
in 2013 again it was during the
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
moratorium we weren't actually funding
 
01:14:10.850 --> 01:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
projects but in 2013 uh the law was
 
01:14:13.370 --> 01:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
changed to a different funding structure
 
01:14:16.970 --> 01:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
and that funding structure said that
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to Grant the school a sum of
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
money using that same formula in the end
 
01:14:24.910 --> 01:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
they received the same amount of money
 
01:14:27.709 --> 01:14:27.719 align:start position:0%
but we're going to pay 80 percent of
 
01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
that amount up front
 
01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
and then 20 upon completion so School
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
construction project might take three
 
01:14:37.729 --> 01:14:37.739 align:start position:0%
four years to finish then they would get
 
01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
eighty percent of it up front they'd
 
01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:40.620 align:start position:0%
finish the project submit all their
 
01:14:42.290 --> 01:14:42.300 align:start position:0%
receipts and invoices and go through a
 
01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
detailed review and then they would get
 
01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
their 20 remaining at the end
 
01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
so just just so I can grasp this so what
 
01:14:52.850 --> 01:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
we were doing before is we were paying
 
01:14:55.130 --> 01:14:55.140 align:start position:0%
it out over to 20-year life
 
01:14:58.130 --> 01:14:58.140 align:start position:0%
and we decided it was a better idea to
 
01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:01.140 align:start position:0%
pay 20 years worth of value in three to
 
01:15:01.970 --> 01:15:01.980 align:start position:0%
four years
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh correct I think the thought was at
 
01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
the time and I think probably still most
 
01:15:09.410 --> 01:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
would agree
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
um that the that that way the
 
01:15:14.330 --> 01:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
communities wouldn't have to take out uh
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
a large sum of money and have to pay
 
01:15:18.050 --> 01:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
interest on that that the that they
 
01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
could bond a less amount lesser amount
 
01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
and not have to pay interest over 20
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
years because they got there
 
01:15:28.250 --> 01:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
40 50 Grant up front
 
01:15:31.250 --> 01:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
but that got us where we are now the
 
01:15:33.169 --> 01:15:33.179 align:start position:0%
tear the paying out over the life of the
 
01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
bond we're still doing that well it's
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
the old funding structure but we haven't
 
01:15:41.209 --> 01:15:41.219 align:start position:0%
paid those off I I think I have a graph
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
that we'll go over in a little bit that
 
01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
might help clarify that
 
01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:47.410 align:start position:0%
might help clarify that
um

01:15:47.410 --> 01:15:47.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
strategically what we've done is we've
 
01:15:53.450 --> 01:15:53.460 align:start position:0%
uh shot our feet off
 
01:15:55.850 --> 01:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
so we can't do as much for as many
 
01:15:57.709 --> 01:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
schools as we used to
 
01:16:02.810 --> 01:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
I would uh I I would say that
 
01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:06.260 align:start position:0%
um funding a few schools so that
 
01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
eventually that tale will be paid off
 
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
right so I think at the time the
 
01:16:14.030 --> 01:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
legislature felt and probably many still
 
01:16:16.010 --> 01:16:16.020 align:start position:0%
do and I think I agree and I actually
 
01:16:19.010 --> 01:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
think schools agree that getting a
 
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
larger amount up front uh to fund their
 
01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
project is a much better savings to
 
01:16:26.450 --> 01:16:26.460 align:start position:0%
their Community because they don't have
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
to bear all that interest out it is
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
always unfortunate in the beginning of
 
01:16:33.770 --> 01:16:33.780 align:start position:0%
this structure because we're still
 
01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
paying off these old projects and it
 
01:16:38.209 --> 01:16:38.219 align:start position:0%
really is not pleasant to be the school
 
01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
that doesn't receive funding so I'm sure
 
01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
if you if when we run out of money all
 
01:16:45.169 --> 01:16:45.179 align:start position:0%
the schools on the bottom of the list
 
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
probably would prefer to have the
 
01:16:51.010 --> 01:16:51.020 align:start position:0%
funding structure the old way but
 
01:16:54.890 --> 01:16:54.900 align:start position:0%
eventually the tail will go away and
 
01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
eventually there will be a list of
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
projects and people will move up that
 
01:16:59.810 --> 01:16:59.820 align:start position:0%
list and then they would get funded I
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
mean that's the way the model is
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to work but they have to
 
01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:04.189 align:start position:0%
supposed to work but they have to
reapply

01:17:04.189 --> 01:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
reapply
 
01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
uh they don't necessarily have to
 
01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:08.820 align:start position:0%
reapply uh
 
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
we're probably jumping ahead but when
 
01:17:12.890 --> 01:17:12.900 align:start position:0%
the when an application comes in and
 
01:17:15.050 --> 01:17:15.060 align:start position:0%
they get ranked they can stay on that
 
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
ranked list as long as they have the
 
01:17:19.370 --> 01:17:19.380 align:start position:0%
support of their local community so if
 
01:17:21.229 --> 01:17:21.239 align:start position:0%
the state runs out of money and it's the
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
state's fault they don't get funded then
 
01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
they stay on the list if the community
 
01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't want the project then they get
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
bumped off the list I won't interrupt
 
01:17:31.130 --> 01:17:31.140 align:start position:0%
anymore please yeah no no that's why I
 
01:17:33.410 --> 01:17:33.420 align:start position:0%
love questions I just
 
01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
um so here's a quick example
 
01:17:38.810 --> 01:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
um on here the the numbers are right
 
01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
there but I just thought a very easy
 
01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
example would be just to say like
 
01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
comparing the old funding to the new
 
01:17:47.090 --> 01:17:47.100 align:start position:0%
funding and when I say new I mean from
 
01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
2013 that
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
um it's not new so much anymore but the
 
01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
uh let's say a school district takes out
 
01:17:58.250 --> 01:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
a 20-year bond for 40 million dollars
 
01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
and let's say uh so if you want to
 
01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
follow along on the example it's in the
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
middle of page two
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
so the example is a school district has
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
a 40 million dollar project they take
 
01:18:12.890 --> 01:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
out a 20-year bond for it in the old
 
01:18:15.229 --> 01:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
structure let's assume that there are 50
 
01:18:17.689 --> 01:18:17.699 align:start position:0%
even though I said 38 is the average
 
01:18:20.689 --> 01:18:20.699 align:start position:0%
rate we're all better with 50 as a
 
01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
number so let's assume that there are 50
 
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
community and they're getting 50 state
 
01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:28.980 align:start position:0%
aid and 50 percent uh coming with their
 
01:18:32.090 --> 01:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
local local funding so on a 40 million
 
01:18:35.570 --> 01:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
dollar School the state pays 20 million
 
01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
the local community pays 20 million
 
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
and that's the same under both
 
01:18:43.130 --> 01:18:43.140 align:start position:0%
structures the grant is still 20 million
 
01:18:45.649 --> 01:18:45.659 align:start position:0%
dollars in both structures in the old
 
01:18:49.010 --> 01:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
structure uh what would happen is over
 
01:18:51.169 --> 01:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
the life of 20 years they would get that
 
01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
20 million dollars 1 million each year
 
01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
and they would be done doesn't exactly
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
work that way because principles change
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
and so forth but in this General example
 
01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
they get one million dollars for 20
 
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
years and that's how they get their 20
 
01:19:09.050 --> 01:19:09.060 align:start position:0%
million dollars in the new structure
 
01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
the school district gets that 20 million
 
01:19:15.530 --> 01:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
dollars almost up front so and their 40
 
01:19:17.870 --> 01:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
million dollar project they're going to
 
01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:20.699 align:start position:0%
get a 20 million dollars of state aid
 
01:19:24.169 --> 01:19:24.179 align:start position:0%
they're going to get that 80 percent of
 
01:19:26.330 --> 01:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
that up front so they're going to get 16
 
01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
million dollars of state aid up front
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
and then once they complete the project
 
01:19:32.689 --> 01:19:32.699 align:start position:0%
they can get their remaining four
 
01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
million dollars uh so that's how that
 
01:19:36.649 --> 01:19:36.659 align:start position:0%
new structure works and you can imagine
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
for for a local community instead of
 
01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
taking out a 20-year Bond they only now
 
01:19:46.250 --> 01:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
are taking out uh uh 20-year Bond I'm
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
sorry for
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
a 40 million dollar Bond over 20 years a
 
01:19:52.729 --> 01:19:52.739 align:start position:0%
40 million dollar Bond now they're only
 
01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
taking out a
 
01:19:58.010 --> 01:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
24 million dollar Bond actually they'd
 
01:19:59.270 --> 01:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
probably be taking out a 20 million
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
dollar Bond and having a short-term
 
01:20:02.810 --> 01:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
construction loan for that piece that
 
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
they're waiting for the the remaining
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
state to come in so that's the big
 
01:20:09.530 --> 01:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
difference for schools instead of a 40
 
01:20:10.669 --> 01:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
million dollar Bond they're really
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
seeking a 20 million dollar bond out
 
01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:14.930 align:start position:0%
seeking a 20 million dollar bond out
uh

01:20:14.930 --> 01:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
so in 20 so now so another thing it's
 
01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
important to um no in 2013 the other big
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
change wasn't this funding structure but
 
01:20:28.970 --> 01:20:28.980 align:start position:0%
also there was a cap on building Aid so
 
01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
not only do you now have the brand new
 
01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
funding structure but in 2013 all of a
 
01:20:36.050 --> 01:20:36.060 align:start position:0%
sudden there was a cap on building AIDS
 
01:20:38.990 --> 01:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
so that is where that cap that you hear
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
people talking about in the bills that
 
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:42.719 align:start position:0%
you have in front of you is that 50
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
million dollar cat prior to 2013 that
 
01:20:47.890 --> 01:20:47.900 align:start position:0%
did not exist
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
how schools applied for building Aid is
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
that they would put an application I
 
01:20:55.490 --> 01:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that you are
 
01:20:57.649 --> 01:20:57.659 align:start position:0%
clearly listening to this piece it's
 
01:21:01.130 --> 01:21:01.140 align:start position:0%
very interesting schools applied for
 
01:21:03.410 --> 01:21:03.420 align:start position:0%
building Aid we collected the
 
01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
applications we tallied up that amount
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
we told the legislature this is the
 
01:21:12.290 --> 01:21:12.300 align:start position:0%
amount the schools need based on their
 
01:21:14.990 --> 01:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
rates the 30 60 rates and the
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
legislature funded that amount
 
01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
so from 1946 all the way to 2009 that
 
01:21:24.169 --> 01:21:24.179 align:start position:0%
was the structure a couple of years it
 
01:21:26.450 --> 01:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
was a shortfall we only got like 93
 
01:21:28.970 --> 01:21:28.980 align:start position:0%
percent of the amount and we prorated
 
01:21:32.209 --> 01:21:32.219 align:start position:0%
everybody down but for the most part
 
01:21:34.729 --> 01:21:34.739 align:start position:0%
um building Aid was fully funded and met
 
01:21:37.729 --> 01:21:37.739 align:start position:0%
the needs that the schools requested
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
in 2013
 
01:21:43.790 --> 01:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
um the cap was put on a 50 million
 
01:21:45.290 --> 01:21:45.300 align:start position:0%
dollars no more than 50 million dollars
 
01:21:47.570 --> 01:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
of building Aid and so we were still in
 
01:21:49.250 --> 01:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
a moratorium we finally come out of a
 
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
moratorium in 2000
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
20. I'll just say 2020 we came out of a
 
01:21:57.649 --> 01:21:57.659 align:start position:0%
moratorium and and
 
01:21:57.659 --> 01:21:58.250 align:start position:0%
moratorium and and
um

01:21:58.250 --> 01:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
with that cap amount now you can see
 
01:22:03.290 --> 01:22:03.300 align:start position:0%
that we have a cap we have to have some
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
kind of competitive structure like how
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
do we determine who gets this money now
 
01:22:09.290 --> 01:22:09.300 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
um capped and so that funding those I'm
 
01:22:15.050 --> 01:22:15.060 align:start position:0%
sorry the ranking criteria and how we
 
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
rank the projects is now listed in law
 
01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:19.450 align:start position:0%
rank the projects is now listed in law

01:22:19.450 --> 01:22:19.460 align:start position:0%

consolidation
 
01:22:29.390 --> 01:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
security all of that is now ranked in
 
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
law it states those criteria the ranking
 
01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
points are actually in rule but the
 
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
criteria are in in the law so that is
 
01:22:40.669 --> 01:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
how we determine who gets that 50
 
01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
million dollars before we didn't have to
 
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
do that because there was no cap now
 
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
that there's a cap that's how those are
 
01:22:47.630 --> 01:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
determined so then there's a list of
 
01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
projects that come out that are ranked
 
01:22:51.290 --> 01:22:51.300 align:start position:0%
by the department verified by the school
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
building authority published by the
 
01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education and then that
 
01:22:57.770 --> 01:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
that list is produced and then that
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
amount of funding just goes to the top
 
01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
school if they pass their local
 
01:23:05.330 --> 01:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
community wants to build the project the
 
01:23:07.370 --> 01:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
state will provide their share and it
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
moves down until people say yes or no
 
01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:10.850 align:start position:0%
moves down until people say yes or no
um

01:23:10.850 --> 01:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:13.669 --> 01:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
for example last biennium the rank one
 
01:23:16.669 --> 01:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
project did not pass I think it was
 
01:23:20.030 --> 01:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
ranked three and four I might be getting
 
01:23:22.189 --> 01:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
that mixed up but it wasn't the top
 
01:23:24.010 --> 01:23:24.020 align:start position:0%
ranked project it did move down the list
 
01:23:27.290 --> 01:23:27.300 align:start position:0%
until a local community passed a warrant
 
01:23:29.950 --> 01:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
article to accept those funds
 
01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh you did mention about how to stay on
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
that list you do stay on that list from
 
01:23:38.570 --> 01:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
by it's a biennium list because our
 
01:23:41.330 --> 01:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
funding comes as you know in two years
 
01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
so we're able to get let's say some
 
01:23:47.630 --> 01:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
amount of money in year one allocate it
 
01:23:49.850 --> 01:23:49.860 align:start position:0%
and some in year two and continue to
 
01:23:52.130 --> 01:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
allocate it and then the list somewhat
 
01:23:54.410 --> 01:23:54.420 align:start position:0%
starts over new people can apply to be
 
01:23:57.410 --> 01:23:57.420 align:start position:0%
on the list those people that um have
 
01:23:58.669 --> 01:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
support from their local communities
 
01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
meaning they passed a warrant article uh
 
01:24:03.470 --> 01:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
or got their District's legislative body
 
01:24:05.870 --> 01:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
approval in the city's cases then they
 
01:24:08.450 --> 01:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
move up you when we take new
 
01:24:10.970 --> 01:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
applications they stay in that ranked
 
01:24:13.370 --> 01:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
order those new applications can get
 
01:24:16.490 --> 01:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
bumped only if we receive projects with
 
01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
higher life safety concerns so they
 
01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:23.230 align:start position:0%
could bump some projects down
 
01:24:23.230 --> 01:24:23.510 align:start position:0%
could bump some projects down
[Music]

01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:25.070 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:27.890 --> 01:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
I think it's well I'll I'll mention that
 
01:24:30.410 --> 01:24:30.420 align:start position:0%
after Okay so this building Aid funding
 
01:24:34.130 --> 01:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
history this last piece on the bottom
 
01:24:38.450 --> 01:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
um is the kind of the history of
 
01:24:41.689 --> 01:24:41.699 align:start position:0%
um building Aid so you can see the the
 
01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
top green line is 1946 to 2009 that
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
represents about uh 63 years money was
 
01:24:50.990 --> 01:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
appropriated to meet demand again
 
01:24:53.149 --> 01:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
schools applied
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh and the state funded their portion
 
01:24:58.130 --> 01:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
the local community funded their portion
 
01:24:59.810 --> 01:24:59.820 align:start position:0%
and so forth
 
01:25:03.970 --> 01:25:03.980 align:start position:0%
in 2010 to 2019 that's that 10-year
 
01:25:07.850 --> 01:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
moratorium uh one project was funded in
 
01:25:11.090 --> 01:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
2018 the in-house Bill 2 they lifted the
 
01:25:12.830 --> 01:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
moratorium funded this one emergency
 
01:25:15.890 --> 01:25:15.900 align:start position:0%
project so technically in 2018 there
 
01:25:19.370 --> 01:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
wasn't a moratorium but for all intents
 
01:25:21.770 --> 01:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
purposes the 10-year moratorium but you
 
01:25:24.410 --> 01:25:24.420 align:start position:0%
will see like moving across in that
 
01:25:27.709 --> 01:25:27.719 align:start position:0%
table it um you'll see the number one
 
01:25:29.630 --> 01:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
there it just means that during that 10
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
years one project was funded the project
 
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
um cost was 3.6 million dollar project
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh the state's portion for that
 
01:25:40.910 --> 01:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
particular project was 2.2 million
 
01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:42.410 align:start position:0%
particular project was 2.2 million
dollars

01:25:42.410 --> 01:25:42.420 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:25:45.470 --> 01:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
um of the one project that was applied
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
one project was funded
 
01:25:52.370 --> 01:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
uh and then that last column is
 
01:25:54.169 --> 01:25:54.179 align:start position:0%
um the amount of building Aid that was
 
01:25:54.179 --> 01:25:56.090 align:start position:0%
um the amount of building Aid that was
appropriated

01:25:56.090 --> 01:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
01:25:58.729 --> 01:25:58.739 align:start position:0%
um plus the amount that was granted to
 
01:26:01.970 --> 01:26:01.980 align:start position:0%
new projects uh that column is going to
 
01:26:03.530 --> 01:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
make a little more sense when we talk
 
01:26:07.370 --> 01:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
about the tail a little bit but the 53
 
01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
million do you see where that says 53
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
million on that that sheet that's for
 
01:26:14.209 --> 01:26:14.219 align:start position:0%
the past projects those are for projects
 
01:26:16.610 --> 01:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
that were already built but we're paying
 
01:26:19.610 --> 01:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
on their bond amounts so that's the 53
 
01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
million for past projects 2.2 million
 
01:26:24.169 --> 01:26:24.179 align:start position:0%
dollars for the new project
 
01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
in the blue here is where we're out of
 
01:26:28.970 --> 01:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
the moratorium the moratorium no longer
 
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
exists in law so
 
01:26:34.010 --> 01:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
um that first year of the moratorium the
 
01:26:35.810 --> 01:26:35.820 align:start position:0%
first year out of the moratorium was the
 
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
biennium of 2021 five we received five
 
01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:40.750 align:start position:0%
biennium of 2021 five we received five
applications

01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
applications
 
01:26:43.610 --> 01:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
uh the total project cost for those five
 
01:26:46.250 --> 01:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
projects was 45 million dollars they
 
01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:48.179 align:start position:0%
were see if they were all funded they
 
01:26:50.209 --> 01:26:50.219 align:start position:0%
were seeking 17 million dollars of state
 
01:26:50.219 --> 01:26:51.169 align:start position:0%
were seeking 17 million dollars of state
aid

01:26:51.169 --> 01:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
aid
 
01:26:53.930 --> 01:26:53.940 align:start position:0%
three of them were funded two of them
 
01:26:56.570 --> 01:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
did not pass their warrant articles
 
01:27:00.050 --> 01:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
um so for that biennium 40 million
 
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
dollars was used to pay for past
 
01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:03.310 align:start position:0%
dollars was used to pay for past
projects

01:27:03.310 --> 01:27:03.320 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:27:06.770 --> 01:27:06.780 align:start position:0%
8.6 million dollars of the 17 million
 
01:27:09.050 --> 01:27:09.060 align:start position:0%
dollar request was funded
 
01:27:12.050 --> 01:27:12.060 align:start position:0%
um for those three projects uh
 
01:27:14.450 --> 01:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
I'll continue down the line but then
 
01:27:17.090 --> 01:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
um biennium we're in right now
 
01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
um we received 12 applications they were
 
01:27:25.550 --> 01:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
requesting 227 million dollars the total
 
01:27:28.129 --> 01:27:28.139 align:start position:0%
project cost was 227 million dollars
 
01:27:30.649 --> 01:27:30.659 align:start position:0%
they were requesting 140 million in
 
01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
state aid
 
01:27:34.729 --> 01:27:34.739 align:start position:0%
um we received enough Aid to fund two of
 
01:27:38.450 --> 01:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
those 12 and you can see the the past
 
01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
projects was 33 million dollars new
 
01:27:43.850 --> 01:27:43.860 align:start position:0%
projects was 30 million dollars
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
for the next biennium the one that you
 
01:27:48.770 --> 01:27:48.780 align:start position:0%
all are here for
 
01:27:51.709 --> 01:27:51.719 align:start position:0%
um the 70 we received 17 applications
 
01:27:53.810 --> 01:27:53.820 align:start position:0%
you have to apply a year in advance so
 
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
that's why we already know this number
 
01:27:58.850 --> 01:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
17 projects applied the total amount of
 
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
project costs for that was 564 million
 
01:28:06.110 --> 01:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
the state portion of that is 227 million
 
01:28:08.629 --> 01:28:08.639 align:start position:0%
and the number of applications funded of
 
01:28:10.129 --> 01:28:10.139 align:start position:0%
course is to be determined because we
 
01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
don't have a budget yet uh so assuming
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
past projects are funded we would be
 
01:28:19.610 --> 01:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
funding 26 million dollars for our past
 
01:28:22.010 --> 01:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
projects and
 
01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:22.669 align:start position:0%
projects and
um

01:28:22.669 --> 01:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
money for new projects which is to be
 
01:28:24.719 --> 01:28:26.570 align:start position:0%
money for new projects which is to be
determined

01:28:26.570 --> 01:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
determined
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
so that is my program on one page I
 
01:28:31.610 --> 01:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
won't talk that much on all the other
 
01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
pages but I will go through them quickly
 
01:28:35.159 --> 01:28:35.750 align:start position:0%
pages but I will go through them quickly
um

01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:38.090 --> 01:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
page three and Page four are just the
 
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
building Aid rates if you're interested
 
01:28:41.689 --> 01:28:41.699 align:start position:0%
in knowing what communities get what
 
01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
rates that's where that's at
 
01:28:47.689 --> 01:28:47.699 align:start position:0%
page five I believe you may have seen
 
01:28:50.270 --> 01:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
this so this is one of the sheets that
 
01:28:52.490 --> 01:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
was edited if you wanted to if you saw
 
01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
this sheet before I've added the totals
 
01:28:56.450 --> 01:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
I think there were questions about and
 
01:28:58.010 --> 01:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
how said there were questions for me
 
01:28:59.570 --> 01:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
about what the totals of these columns
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
were so that's really the only
 
01:29:03.229 --> 01:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
difference here is the totals are on the
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
bottom but this graph does tell quite a
 
01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
bit of a story
 
01:29:12.050 --> 01:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
um about building AIDS so I'll just walk
 
01:29:15.470 --> 01:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
through it real quickly the bar on the
 
01:29:17.649 --> 01:29:17.659 align:start position:0%
bottom the dark color bar the Bottom bar
 
01:29:21.169 --> 01:29:21.179 align:start position:0%
is our obligated payments to schools
 
01:29:24.050 --> 01:29:24.060 align:start position:0%
that's we're paying on those 20-year
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
bonds still in some cases was a 30-year
 
01:29:28.729 --> 01:29:28.739 align:start position:0%
a couple of 30-year bonds so we're
 
01:29:30.890 --> 01:29:30.900 align:start position:0%
paying a portion of that and you can see
 
01:29:32.930 --> 01:29:32.940 align:start position:0%
it gets smaller and smaller that's
 
01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
because we're continuing to pay off
 
01:29:36.890 --> 01:29:36.900 align:start position:0%
projects every year people fall off the
 
01:29:40.370 --> 01:29:40.380 align:start position:0%
list in 2041 we won't be paying any more
 
01:29:43.490 --> 01:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
of that old funding structure and
 
01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:44.270 align:start position:0%
of that old funding structure and
um

01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
the light blue bar is in 2010 uh the
 
01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:52.850 align:start position:0%
the light blue bar is in 2010 uh the
state

01:29:52.850 --> 01:29:52.860 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:53.810 align:start position:0%
state
um

01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:55.729 --> 01:29:55.739 align:start position:0%
couldn't meet I don't really know what
 
01:29:57.050 --> 01:29:57.060 align:start position:0%
the appropriate word was it wasn't
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
around in my position at the time but
 
01:30:03.290 --> 01:30:03.300 align:start position:0%
didn't meet their obligations to schools
 
01:30:06.530 --> 01:30:06.540 align:start position:0%
so they decided in 2010 to take out a
 
01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
bond in order to meet those obligations
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
to schools so the state has a bond
 
01:30:16.850 --> 01:30:16.860 align:start position:0%
from paying projects in 2010. so that
 
01:30:20.090 --> 01:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
blue portion is not payment to schools
 
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's the state's debt for paying a bond
 
01:30:26.750 --> 01:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
in 2010 that we took out to pay Our
 
01:30:28.850 --> 01:30:28.860 align:start position:0%
obligation to schools
 
01:30:30.890 --> 01:30:30.900 align:start position:0%
a lot of people are not pleased with
 
01:30:33.229 --> 01:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
that practice for the state to take out
 
01:30:36.410 --> 01:30:36.420 align:start position:0%
a bond to pay schools to pay on their
 
01:30:39.229 --> 01:30:39.239 align:start position:0%
bond so that is now prohibited in law
 
01:30:40.910 --> 01:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
just so you know we can't do that
 
01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:42.169 align:start position:0%
just so you know we can't do that
anymore

01:30:42.169 --> 01:30:42.179 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
01:30:46.430 --> 01:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
um but that is the payment on our the
 
01:30:49.370 --> 01:30:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:30:53.930 --> 01:30:53.940 align:start position:0%
past Mark it's a bar that's white with a
 
01:30:55.669 --> 01:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
little hash over it you can see it kind
 
01:30:59.629 --> 01:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
of jumps all around that is this that is
 
01:31:02.090 --> 01:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
this new projects that we've funded
 
01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
under the new new
 
01:31:09.950 --> 01:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
post 2013 or really post 2020
 
01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:10.729 align:start position:0%
post 2013 or really post 2020
um

01:31:10.729 --> 01:31:10.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism that 80 20. so that's
 
01:31:16.010 --> 01:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
why there's these little shots of money
 
01:31:19.669 --> 01:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
so in 2020 the moratorium was lifted we
 
01:31:22.490 --> 01:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
put 6.7 million dollars for building Aid
 
01:31:24.530 --> 01:31:24.540 align:start position:0%
then the F the second year of the
 
01:31:29.450 --> 01:31:29.460 align:start position:0%
biennium it was 1.9 million the in 2022
 
01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
30 million was given 2023 no money was
 
01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.189 align:start position:0%
30 million was given 2023 no money was
given

01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
given
 
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
um you you can see also on that graph
 
01:31:39.050 --> 01:31:39.060 align:start position:0%
that the graph goes up to 50 million
 
01:31:42.649 --> 01:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
dollars on the y-axis it goes up to 50
 
01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
million and that's because that's what
 
01:31:47.090 --> 01:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
our cap is so that's why I kind of
 
01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
depict it that's the ceiling that's in
 
01:31:51.890 --> 01:31:51.900 align:start position:0%
the law well you can see in 2022 we went
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
above that ceiling that's because in
 
01:31:56.930 --> 01:31:56.940 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 they lifted that cap just
 
01:31:58.669 --> 01:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
for that one year and then closed it
 
01:32:01.010 --> 01:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
again so
 
01:32:02.629 --> 01:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
um we're allowed to go over just for
 
01:32:05.149 --> 01:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
that one year and what really happened
 
01:32:09.290 --> 01:32:09.300 align:start position:0%
is just a very quick question you were
 
01:32:11.570 --> 01:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
saying that the number is zero for the
 
01:32:13.129 --> 01:32:13.139 align:start position:0%
new project for Appropriations for new
 
01:32:15.770 --> 01:32:15.780 align:start position:0%
projects for 23 is that the final number
 
01:32:17.629 --> 01:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
because we are still six months into the
 
01:32:19.010 --> 01:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
year I just want to make sure and yeah
 
01:32:21.470 --> 01:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
it's a final number this is but
 
01:32:24.110 --> 01:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
amount Grant this is amount appropriated
 
01:32:26.930 --> 01:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
got it which in general does granted but
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so the appropriation was zero and
 
01:32:31.850 --> 01:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
really what happened in my opinion what
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
happened was that there were two stacks
 
01:32:38.570 --> 01:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
meeting about 50 million dollars and let
 
01:32:40.189 --> 01:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
maybe last minute conversations were
 
01:32:41.930 --> 01:32:41.940 align:start position:0%
just like we'll just front load this
 
01:32:44.209 --> 01:32:44.219 align:start position:0%
we'll take year two money and put it in
 
01:32:45.410 --> 01:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
year one
 
01:32:48.830 --> 01:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
um if you add up
 
01:32:50.930 --> 01:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
um well I'll just leave it at that I
 
01:32:52.610 --> 01:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
think that that money from year two was
 
01:32:54.530 --> 01:32:54.540 align:start position:0%
just shifted to year one so that's the
 
01:32:56.689 --> 01:32:56.699 align:start position:0%
current biennium we're in right now and
 
01:32:58.850 --> 01:32:58.860 align:start position:0%
as you can see we don't know what the
 
01:33:01.729 --> 01:33:01.739 align:start position:0%
future holds for 24.25
 
01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
um so there's nothing there at this
 
01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:04.550 align:start position:0%
um so there's nothing there at this
point

01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:33:07.250 --> 01:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
um those numbers are also in this chart
 
01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
here you can see the fiscal year you can
 
01:33:11.930 --> 01:33:11.940 align:start position:0%
see the obligated um I'll just take you
 
01:33:13.790 --> 01:33:13.800 align:start position:0%
through the columns here the that second
 
01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
column is that those past payments to
 
01:33:18.410 --> 01:33:18.420 align:start position:0%
schools that we all want their their
 
01:33:21.229 --> 01:33:21.239 align:start position:0%
past project payments then you can see
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
our building Aid Bond payment that's the
 
01:33:25.790 --> 01:33:25.800 align:start position:0%
state Bond payment you can see it ends
 
01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
in 2030. we took it out we started
 
01:33:30.410 --> 01:33:30.420 align:start position:0%
paying out in 2010 2030 so it was a
 
01:33:32.870 --> 01:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
20-year Bond
 
01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:34.129 align:start position:0%
20-year Bond
um

01:33:34.129 --> 01:33:34.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:37.010 --> 01:33:37.020 align:start position:0%
the total obligations just we call that
 
01:33:39.530 --> 01:33:39.540 align:start position:0%
our obligations is our past project
 
01:33:41.689 --> 01:33:41.699 align:start position:0%
payments plus our state Bond it doesn't
 
01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
feel like there's any way to get around
 
01:33:45.530 --> 01:33:45.540 align:start position:0%
those past obligations so that's the
 
01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
total there and then the law states the
 
01:33:50.510 --> 01:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
cap that
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
um the legislature can't appropriate any
 
01:33:55.189 --> 01:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
more money than 50 million dollars less
 
01:33:58.970 --> 01:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
our obligations uh therefore when
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
schools ask me how much building Aid are
 
01:34:03.229 --> 01:34:03.239 align:start position:0%
we going to get this year the number
 
01:34:07.370 --> 01:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
ranges from zero to 22.6 million dollars
 
01:34:09.649 --> 01:34:09.659 align:start position:0%
for for new projects that's the 50
 
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
million dollars less our obligations
 
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
but because we're a biennium list what I
 
01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
really like to tell schools is the
 
01:34:20.149 --> 01:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
bigger picture is what we're going to
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
get in the biennium so that last column
 
01:34:29.290 --> 01:34:29.300 align:start position:0%
um is just the total for the biennium so
 
01:34:32.570 --> 01:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
48.7 is the the
 
01:34:36.890 --> 01:34:36.900 align:start position:0%
fiscal 24 plus fiscal 25. so
 
01:34:40.189 --> 01:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
that 48.7 I'll just leave it with this
 
01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
that 48.7 if school said if building Aid
 
01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
is fully funded with the current law how
 
01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
much is the State Department of
 
01:34:52.669 --> 01:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
Education going to have to Grant out to
 
01:34:55.070 --> 01:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
for new construction projects and I
 
01:34:57.229 --> 01:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
would tell them 48.7 million dollars
 
01:34:59.810 --> 01:34:59.820 align:start position:0%
that's assuming 50 million gets
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
appropriated in year one 50 million is
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
appropriated into year two that's 100
 
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
million they're always surprised that I
 
01:35:07.490 --> 01:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
don't say 100 million but it's because
 
01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
we have our past obligations that we
 
01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:11.340 align:start position:0%
make payments and the remaining amount
 
01:35:14.450 --> 01:35:14.460 align:start position:0%
is 48.7 of that 100 million in the
 
01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:16.370 align:start position:0%
is 48.7 of that 100 million in the
biennium

01:35:16.370 --> 01:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
so let's see can I ask of course share
 
01:35:22.970 --> 01:35:22.980 align:start position:0%
why did why did the 50 million dollar
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
cap appear I I don't know I don't know
 
01:35:29.450 --> 01:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
um I do have a handout on what
 
01:35:29.460 --> 01:35:30.410 align:start position:0%
um I do have a handout on what
um

01:35:30.410 --> 01:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:32.629 --> 01:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
on what might be in a I won't say
 
01:35:34.970 --> 01:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
appropriate number but a number
 
01:35:36.890 --> 01:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
um but I don't know what why that 50
 
01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
million was determined at the time at
 
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
the time we were paying more than 50
 
01:35:42.110 --> 01:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
million dollars the
 
01:35:46.189 --> 01:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
um we were granting about 60 I think in
 
01:35:49.669 --> 01:35:49.679 align:start position:0%
the highest um highest years maybe high
 
01:35:51.709 --> 01:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
50s low 60s
 
01:35:53.629 --> 01:35:53.639 align:start position:0%
so there's no does anybody have any
 
01:35:57.470 --> 01:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
logic about why the cap was put on it I
 
01:36:00.229 --> 01:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
am right oh okay that I think that was
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:16.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:18.709 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:36:18.709 --> 01:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:18.719 --> 01:36:21.830 align:start position:0%
um
right

01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
yes a quick question just so I can
 
01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
understand because we're there's always
 
01:36:27.470 --> 01:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
the talk about paying off the tail I
 
01:36:29.149 --> 01:36:29.159 align:start position:0%
understand the obligated payments of the
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
schools goes across a bazillion
 
01:36:31.970 --> 01:36:31.980 align:start position:0%
different schools in the state and
 
01:36:34.129 --> 01:36:34.139 align:start position:0%
that's very complicated uh the building
 
01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
Aid bond that we have is that something
 
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
that we could pay off is is that a one
 
01:36:40.669 --> 01:36:40.679 align:start position:0%
thing that could be paid off or is that
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
as convoluted as the payments to the
 
01:36:44.450 --> 01:36:44.460 align:start position:0%
schools unfortunately I don't know the
 
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
answer to that that like that question
 
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
would be a good question for the State
 
01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
Treasury that money actually just goes
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
right to the state treasury I'm not
 
01:36:52.490 --> 01:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
familiar with their bond but they I'm
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
sure would be able to tell you the
 
01:36:57.649 --> 01:36:57.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:01.370 --> 01:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
uh thank you oh just just a second uh to
 
01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
answer that question I believe that was
 
01:37:04.370 --> 01:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
answered yesterday and I believe that's
 
01:37:07.370 --> 01:37:07.380 align:start position:0%
a there's a number of bonds out there
 
01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:08.810 align:start position:0%
a there's a number of bonds out there
that

01:37:08.810 --> 01:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:11.149 --> 01:37:11.159 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's a number and be very
 
01:37:15.110 --> 01:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
complicated to pay the uh bonds off
 
01:37:17.689 --> 01:37:17.699 align:start position:0%
just further clarify
 
01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
um I did Finance bonds when I was the
 
01:37:21.410 --> 01:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
town finance director through the bond
 
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
bank and those bonds cannot be paid
 
01:37:25.610 --> 01:37:25.620 align:start position:0%
ahead of time this the structure is set
 
01:37:27.470 --> 01:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
and the investors will not accept early
 
01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:30.300 align:start position:0%
payments I do not have knowledge over I
 
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
think that answer was referring though
 
01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
just to the obligated payment to schools
 
01:37:36.229 --> 01:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
which are mostly through the Bond Bank I
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
think we do have to follow up with the
 
01:37:39.770 --> 01:37:39.780 align:start position:0%
treasurer to inquire how our building
 
01:37:42.410 --> 01:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
and bond building a point statements
 
01:37:44.209 --> 01:37:44.219 align:start position:0%
that are structured that would may be a
 
01:37:45.709 --> 01:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
different answer
 
01:37:48.050 --> 01:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
I've seen the bar I have the only
 
01:37:49.610 --> 01:37:49.620 align:start position:0%
information is that I've seen the bond
 
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
schedule and to me the schedule looks
 
01:37:53.689 --> 01:37:53.699 align:start position:0%
like it's one Bond but they would be it
 
01:37:56.450 --> 01:37:56.460 align:start position:0%
could be a series of them so
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
um but on the school's end which I know
 
01:38:02.090 --> 01:38:02.100 align:start position:0%
was not your question but on the but the
 
01:38:04.250 --> 01:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
obligated payments to schools are
 
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
multiple bonds and I do know from
 
01:38:07.310 --> 01:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
conversation for the municipal Bond Bank
 
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
that those cannot be paid off early but
 
01:38:12.590 --> 01:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
the treasury might be able to better
 
01:38:16.610 --> 01:38:16.620 align:start position:0%
inform you about those um the state Bond
 
01:38:20.990 --> 01:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
so let's see then moving along page six
 
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.570 align:start position:0%
so let's see then moving along page six
seven

01:38:23.570 --> 01:38:23.580 align:start position:0%
seven
 
01:38:27.169 --> 01:38:27.179 align:start position:0%
and eight is the fiscal these are the
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
applications that we received for fiscal
 
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
24 fiscal 25 funding these are the new
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
projects that want to construct and
 
01:38:36.830 --> 01:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
applied for state aid those are in
 
01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
ranked order
 
01:38:41.570 --> 01:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
um I I want to make one
 
01:38:43.550 --> 01:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
um somebody asked to really I went back
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
and listened to to you all yesterday and
 
01:38:47.450 --> 01:38:47.460 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that I was not able to attend
 
01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:48.590 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that I was not able to attend
but

01:38:48.590 --> 01:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:38:50.450 --> 01:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
um one I I just want to make one
 
01:38:54.050 --> 01:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
important clarification the the last
 
01:38:57.770 --> 01:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
column is simply well the last three
 
01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
columns are numbers right the first one
 
01:39:02.450 --> 01:39:02.460 align:start position:0%
is estimated project cost this is taken
 
01:39:04.629 --> 01:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
right from the applicants application
 
01:39:07.790 --> 01:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
the the school building Aid rate is
 
01:39:10.669 --> 01:39:10.679 align:start position:0%
their rate based on their municipality
 
01:39:14.209 --> 01:39:14.219 align:start position:0%
the estimated building Aid is simply
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
those two numbers multiplied together
 
01:39:19.729 --> 01:39:19.739 align:start position:0%
that's it what has not happened at this
 
01:39:22.430 --> 01:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
time yet is that we have not gone
 
01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
through these applications to determine
 
01:39:27.649 --> 01:39:27.659 align:start position:0%
what's eligible and what is not that's a
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's a long process
 
01:39:31.610 --> 01:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
um so somebody was asking the question
 
01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:33.229 align:start position:0%
um so somebody was asking the question
about

01:39:33.229 --> 01:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:39:35.629 --> 01:39:35.639 align:start position:0%
um project four versus project five
 
01:39:38.450 --> 01:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
Concord versus Litchfield and was making
 
01:39:41.470 --> 01:39:41.480 align:start position:0%
comparisons between those two schools
 
01:39:44.689 --> 01:39:44.699 align:start position:0%
schools can apply for building Aid and
 
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
put much more in their application that
 
01:39:50.689 --> 01:39:50.699 align:start position:0%
is not eligible for billing Aid so just
 
01:39:53.530 --> 01:39:53.540 align:start position:0%
because that number let's just take
 
01:39:58.370 --> 01:39:58.380 align:start position:0%
conquered for example is to 176 million
 
01:40:00.770 --> 01:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
dollar project times 40 percent is
 
01:40:03.410 --> 01:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
seeking 70 million dollars in Aid that
 
01:40:05.629 --> 01:40:05.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that they qualify or are
 
01:40:08.270 --> 01:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
eligible for that amount of Aid and and
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
Concord school district is aware of that
 
01:40:11.629 --> 01:40:11.639 align:start position:0%
and I know um
 
01:40:13.629 --> 01:40:13.639 align:start position:0%
um Jack Dunn is behind me so he could
 
01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
confer or confirm cooperate uh my that
 
01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
story but anyway so I just want to say
 
01:40:22.250 --> 01:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
that the schools this is their total
 
01:40:23.689 --> 01:40:23.699 align:start position:0%
project and they're going to want as
 
01:40:25.790 --> 01:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
much as eligible as not but we do
 
01:40:28.729 --> 01:40:28.739 align:start position:0%
building a does cap costs
 
01:40:32.209 --> 01:40:32.219 align:start position:0%
um per square foot building it also caps
 
01:40:36.050 --> 01:40:36.060 align:start position:0%
um square foot per pupil and schools
 
01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
oftentimes bring more programs I know
 
01:40:41.570 --> 01:40:41.580 align:start position:0%
some schools have larger music programs
 
01:40:43.129 --> 01:40:43.139 align:start position:0%
or certain things might be really
 
01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
important to their District but that
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily mean that the state
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
pays for them so just keep in mind that
 
01:40:53.450 --> 01:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
this this is a raw calculation it's
 
01:40:55.490 --> 01:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
noted as a little footnote at the bottom
 
01:40:59.090 --> 01:40:59.100 align:start position:0%
uh of this but in eventually we'll have
 
01:41:01.010 --> 01:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
better numbers for these schools and
 
01:41:07.810 --> 01:41:07.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:16.490 --> 01:41:16.500 align:start position:0%
that's correct um so for example I don't
 
01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
know of any schools but a school is more
 
01:41:20.510 --> 01:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
you know a community may want to have a
 
01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:21.719 align:start position:0%
strong swimming program and put a
 
01:41:23.330 --> 01:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
swimming pool in the state's not going
 
01:41:26.330 --> 01:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
to pay for a swimming pool but um you
 
01:41:27.229 --> 01:41:27.239 align:start position:0%
know they're going to put their total
 
01:41:28.490 --> 01:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
project in and we're going to go through
 
01:41:30.169 --> 01:41:30.179 align:start position:0%
it and state what's eligible and what's
 
01:41:30.179 --> 01:41:31.010 align:start position:0%
it and state what's eligible and what's
not

01:41:31.010 --> 01:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:41:33.890 --> 01:41:33.900 align:start position:0%
um the the big key to remember is that
 
01:41:36.590 --> 01:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
there is a large portion
 
01:41:41.870 --> 01:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
um of space the states square foot per
 
01:41:45.290 --> 01:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
pupil is much smaller than what schools
 
01:41:47.689 --> 01:41:47.699 align:start position:0%
are building across the board this is in
 
01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
any one school schools are building
 
01:41:54.169 --> 01:41:54.179 align:start position:0%
about 170 to 200 square feet per pupil
 
01:41:57.250 --> 01:41:57.260 align:start position:0%
and the average square footage is about
 
01:42:00.830 --> 01:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
140 square feet uh per pupil so just a
 
01:42:03.709 --> 01:42:03.719 align:start position:0%
heads up this is the max most of these
 
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
schools won't be reaching their Max
 
01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:07.010 align:start position:0%
schools won't be reaching their Max
um

01:42:07.010 --> 01:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:09.770 --> 01:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
just for note taking purposes could you
 
01:42:12.169 --> 01:42:12.179 align:start position:0%
remind me what is the state square foot
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
limit and what is the average
 
01:42:15.169 --> 01:42:15.179 align:start position:0%
construction because I want to make sure
 
01:42:17.570 --> 01:42:17.580 align:start position:0%
I catch that sure um
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
say with the average construction costs
 
01:42:23.390 --> 01:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
are because they are cheaper footage
 
01:42:24.830 --> 01:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
um the square footage I'd say the
 
01:42:27.109 --> 01:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
average is 140 square feet per pupil
 
01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:29.820 align:start position:0%
however it varies
 
01:42:32.510 --> 01:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
um because the law has
 
01:42:34.189 --> 01:42:34.199 align:start position:0%
um three sets of square foot Elementary
 
01:42:36.530 --> 01:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
Middle High and then they also have
 
01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:38.330 align:start position:0%
Middle High and then they also have
smaller

01:42:38.330 --> 01:42:38.340 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
um if you're less than 250 students in
 
01:42:42.830 --> 01:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
your school you qualify for more square
 
01:42:44.510 --> 01:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
feet per pupil because you imagine a gym
 
01:42:46.790 --> 01:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
cafeteria those sizes don't change so
 
01:42:47.990 --> 01:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
there are actually six numbers in the
 
01:42:50.990 --> 01:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
law but the average is about 140.
 
01:42:53.390 --> 01:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
and that compares with what's currently
 
01:42:56.570 --> 01:42:56.580 align:start position:0%
built you know what's currently built
 
01:42:58.310 --> 01:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
when we take and look at our last
 
01:42:59.810 --> 01:42:59.820 align:start position:0%
handful we don't have a lot of data
 
01:43:01.010 --> 01:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
because we haven't been building a lot
 
01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
of schools but when we look at our past
 
01:43:05.629 --> 01:43:05.639 align:start position:0%
handful of projects we're looking at
 
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
anywhere from like
 
01:43:11.629 --> 01:43:11.639 align:start position:0%
170 to about 200 square feet per pupil
 
01:43:13.250 --> 01:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah
 
01:43:16.850 --> 01:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
and I'd say most schools are um are
 
01:43:18.770 --> 01:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
really providing
 
01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
um much more intensive special education
 
01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:23.290 align:start position:0%
um much more intensive special education
services

01:43:23.290 --> 01:43:23.300 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:43:26.209 --> 01:43:26.219 align:start position:0%
that are really difficult to get into
 
01:43:28.010 --> 01:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
that square footage I I would say that
 
01:43:29.810 --> 01:43:29.820 align:start position:0%
the special education spaces in schools
 
01:43:32.510 --> 01:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
is much larger than what those Square
 
01:43:34.609 --> 01:43:34.619 align:start position:0%
foots would allow that's usually what's
 
01:43:36.950 --> 01:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
driving that maker spaces breakout
 
01:43:39.229 --> 01:43:39.239 align:start position:0%
spaces collaboration spaces things like
 
01:43:39.239 --> 01:43:40.189 align:start position:0%
spaces collaboration spaces things like
that

01:43:40.189 --> 01:43:40.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
they're not big grandiose atriums and um
 
01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
and things like that so
 
01:43:49.970 --> 01:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
um page 9 10 and 11 and
 
01:43:53.149 --> 01:43:53.159 align:start position:0%
um I have you on the home stretch here
 
01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
um page 9 10 and 11
 
01:43:59.870 --> 01:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
um if you have the old packet there was
 
01:44:03.649 --> 01:44:03.659 align:start position:0%
an um an error in there I thought I was
 
01:44:07.729 --> 01:44:07.739 align:start position:0%
saving time by just hiding fiscal 23
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
payments in fiscal 24 which was fine
 
01:44:13.070 --> 01:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
except that it messed up my total
 
01:44:15.290 --> 01:44:15.300 align:start position:0%
remaining payments column we've paid
 
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
those payments so you don't really need
 
01:44:19.070 --> 01:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
to follow that just know that this is
 
01:44:21.770 --> 01:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
the updated worksheet
 
01:44:24.830 --> 01:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
um and that total pay remaining payments
 
01:44:28.250 --> 01:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
column includes fiscal 23 payments on
 
01:44:29.629 --> 01:44:29.639 align:start position:0%
your last sheet so this one should be
 
01:44:32.330 --> 01:44:32.340 align:start position:0%
corrected this one is corrected and this
 
01:44:35.090 --> 01:44:35.100 align:start position:0%
is simply those tail payments we talked
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
about so and 20 this is all the past
 
01:44:39.590 --> 01:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
project payments so if you're wondering
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
what school districts are getting
 
01:44:43.790 --> 01:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
building aid for past projects this is a
 
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
list of those projects uh in order by
 
01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
School District
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
is almost the conclusion of my
 
01:44:54.239 --> 01:44:55.729 align:start position:0%
is almost the conclusion of my
presentation

01:44:55.729 --> 01:44:55.739 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
01:44:59.090 --> 01:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
um I I have one other sheet for you this
 
01:45:00.410 --> 01:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
is separate
 
01:45:03.050 --> 01:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
um from because you're the finance group
 
01:45:04.970 --> 01:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
I thought I would throw a few more
 
01:45:06.770 --> 01:45:06.780 align:start position:0%
numbers at you
 
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
um uh representative Emrick that's
 
01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
already asked about that 50 million
 
01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
dollars where does that come from I
 
01:45:12.709 --> 01:45:12.719 align:start position:0%
think yesterday I don't know if it was
 
01:45:14.270 --> 01:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
you as well to ask somebody's like oh
 
01:45:15.470 --> 01:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
there's people just picking these
 
01:45:17.870 --> 01:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
numbers out of the sky I I don't know
 
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
where those numbers come from but if
 
01:45:22.910 --> 01:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
somebody asked me to write on a napkin
 
01:45:24.770 --> 01:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
and do a calculation I'd love to do a
 
01:45:26.510 --> 01:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
big study I don't have any money for a
 
01:45:28.189 --> 01:45:28.199 align:start position:0%
big study so I have my napkin
 
01:45:31.550 --> 01:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
calculation and to me it's all just
 
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
numbers so I'll take you through what I
 
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
think is the amount schools will spend
 
01:45:38.810 --> 01:45:38.820 align:start position:0%
how much the state shared local share
 
01:45:40.850 --> 01:45:40.860 align:start position:0%
that's really all up to the state right
 
01:45:43.189 --> 01:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
I'm just stating this is what I think
 
01:45:46.510 --> 01:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
schools are um spending for regular
 
01:45:48.669 --> 01:45:48.679 align:start position:0%
what's in the law
 
01:45:52.430 --> 01:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
for costs so in the state we have
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
roughly these numbers are rounded for
 
01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
this this is not precise but 450 schools
 
01:46:00.310 --> 01:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire Public Schools
 
01:46:03.530 --> 01:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
165 000 students K through 12 students
 
01:46:06.109 --> 01:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't include the preschool students
 
01:46:09.109 --> 01:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
because building Aid is just for K-12 by
 
01:46:11.090 --> 01:46:11.100 align:start position:0%
the way so that's another square footage
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
that somebody could be putting preschool
 
01:46:14.689 --> 01:46:14.699 align:start position:0%
rooms in their building and we would
 
01:46:16.430 --> 01:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
actually prorate those spaces out
 
01:46:18.109 --> 01:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
because building AIDS specifically in
 
01:46:23.209 --> 01:46:23.219 align:start position:0%
the law says it's K-12 spaces uh 165 000
 
01:46:26.090 --> 01:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
students is our roughly our current
 
01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:27.550 align:start position:0%
students is our roughly our current
enrollment

01:46:27.550 --> 01:46:27.560 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
01:46:31.010 --> 01:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
200 uh 23 million square feet this isn't
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
the actual amount of square feet by the
 
01:46:36.109 --> 01:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
way this is the square footage based on
 
01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
what the law allows us to build so
 
01:46:41.450 --> 01:46:41.460 align:start position:0%
that's that 140 square feet per student
 
01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
times 165
 
01:46:46.729 --> 01:46:46.739 align:start position:0%
000 students so some might say this is
 
01:46:52.129 --> 01:46:52.139 align:start position:0%
the the state's share of square footage
 
01:46:54.350 --> 01:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
um uh average 140 square feet per
 
01:46:57.290 --> 01:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
student that's based on law
 
01:46:59.750 --> 01:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
um and then the average cost of a
 
01:47:02.629 --> 01:47:02.639 align:start position:0%
project is somewhere about 550 a square
 
01:47:06.530 --> 01:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
foot this number is wildly changing uh
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
this number is varies because we also
 
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
pay for site site developments sites you
 
01:47:14.030 --> 01:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
can imagine a a land in Concord is going
 
01:47:15.590 --> 01:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
to cost well much different than
 
01:47:17.810 --> 01:47:17.820 align:start position:0%
something in kowas County
 
01:47:20.689 --> 01:47:20.699 align:start position:0%
um and you're also if you've got ledge
 
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's going to drive some costs up
 
01:47:25.070 --> 01:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
permitting costs um so forth so
 
01:47:28.129 --> 01:47:28.139 align:start position:0%
um but in general this is a very rough
 
01:47:31.729 --> 01:47:31.739 align:start position:0%
number 550 a square foot
 
01:47:31.739 --> 01:47:32.270 align:start position:0%
number 550 a square foot
um

01:47:32.270 --> 01:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
40 years before a major renovation is
 
01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
needed and when if you think about your
 
01:47:40.189 --> 01:47:40.199 align:start position:0%
own home letting it go for 40 years
 
01:47:42.169 --> 01:47:42.179 align:start position:0%
without doing a major renovation we're
 
01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
not talking building Aid is not talking
 
01:47:46.850 --> 01:47:46.860 align:start position:0%
about paint replacing Windows replacing
 
01:47:49.129 --> 01:47:49.139 align:start position:0%
the roof replacing the boiler all of
 
01:47:50.750 --> 01:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
those things use some of those things
 
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
were covered in the old building aid but
 
01:47:54.770 --> 01:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
the new building Aid does not pay for
 
01:47:56.450 --> 01:47:56.460 align:start position:0%
operation and maintenance they don't pay
 
01:47:57.770 --> 01:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
for new roofs they don't pay for new
 
01:48:00.770 --> 01:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
doors we're talking about rebuild so
 
01:48:02.810 --> 01:48:02.820 align:start position:0%
when we talk about Renovations once
 
01:48:05.390 --> 01:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
every 40 years or so we're talking about
 
01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
studs are showing you're you're building
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
is gutted and that's the area that would
 
01:48:13.810 --> 01:48:13.820 align:start position:0%
be eligible for building Aid so 40 years
 
01:48:16.850 --> 01:48:16.860 align:start position:0%
in reality that's probably pushing to 50
 
01:48:20.209 --> 01:48:20.219 align:start position:0%
years but ideally you really see a lot
 
01:48:24.709 --> 01:48:24.719 align:start position:0%
of degradation beginning in 40 years so
 
01:48:27.649 --> 01:48:27.659 align:start position:0%
I would say 35 to 40 years but I'll I'll
 
01:48:29.390 --> 01:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
use 40 on that end
 
01:48:32.209 --> 01:48:32.219 align:start position:0%
so this is my napkin calculation 23
 
01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
million square feet 400 550
 
01:48:39.530 --> 01:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
um per square foot leaves you with 12.7
 
01:48:43.070 --> 01:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
billion dollars every 40 years so you
 
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
take that and divide it by 40 you end up
 
01:48:48.830 --> 01:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
with 318 million dollars per year of
 
01:48:51.169 --> 01:48:51.179 align:start position:0%
costs again some could argue that well
 
01:48:53.390 --> 01:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
renovation might not cost as much some
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
could argue that renovation sometimes
 
01:48:56.390 --> 01:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
costs more
 
01:49:00.350 --> 01:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
um 318 million per year the average rate
 
01:49:04.510 --> 01:49:04.520 align:start position:0%
per law is 38 percent so that would be
 
01:49:09.169 --> 01:49:09.179 align:start position:0%
120 million dollars per year so 50
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
probably isn't covering it
 
01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
um but again just a it's a calculation
 
01:49:18.229 --> 01:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
to give you a ballpark of numbers that
 
01:49:20.209 --> 01:49:20.219 align:start position:0%
you might be looking at
 
01:49:20.219 --> 01:49:20.930 align:start position:0%
you might be looking at
um

01:49:20.930 --> 01:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:22.729 --> 01:49:22.739 align:start position:0%
and I I think I already mentioned this
 
01:49:25.550 --> 01:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
this just remember this calculation is
 
01:49:28.729 --> 01:49:28.739 align:start position:0%
not based on the actual square footage
 
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
of buildings that we have in New
 
01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we actually don't know because
 
01:49:33.229 --> 01:49:33.239 align:start position:0%
we don't have an inventory
 
01:49:35.450 --> 01:49:35.460 align:start position:0%
um of of that but
 
01:49:36.649 --> 01:49:36.659 align:start position:0%
um when you hear people talk about
 
01:49:38.810 --> 01:49:38.820 align:start position:0%
declining enrollment or so forth this
 
01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
number is based on the current
 
01:49:43.609 --> 01:49:43.619 align:start position:0%
population of students the actual space
 
01:49:46.609 --> 01:49:46.619 align:start position:0%
is much bigger there's CTE spaces as
 
01:49:49.490 --> 01:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
well that are not captured here as well
 
01:49:51.890 --> 01:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
and then the last in the red it's very
 
01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
important to remember that building a
 
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
does not cover operation and maintenance
 
01:50:00.169 --> 01:50:00.179 align:start position:0%
so schools are you know when we talk
 
01:50:02.090 --> 01:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
about deferred maintenance
 
01:50:04.970 --> 01:50:04.980 align:start position:0%
um projects are scored based on if they
 
01:50:07.550 --> 01:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
take properly if they could take good
 
01:50:09.050 --> 01:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
care they're required to take good care
 
01:50:10.910 --> 01:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
of their building if they receive
 
01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
building Aid
 
01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
um but if that's not covering those
 
01:50:20.810 --> 01:50:20.820 align:start position:0%
costs so again roof boiler all of those
 
01:50:24.229 --> 01:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
things are being paid by the school some
 
01:50:26.990 --> 01:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
um there is an estimate typically in the
 
01:50:29.450 --> 01:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
facility World they say operation and
 
01:50:31.250 --> 01:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
maintenance over the life of the
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
building is about the cost of the
 
01:50:35.330 --> 01:50:35.340 align:start position:0%
building so if the building costs 40
 
01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars in general over that 40
 
01:50:40.669 --> 01:50:40.679 align:start position:0%
years the building is around it's going
 
01:50:42.410 --> 01:50:42.420 align:start position:0%
to cost the school district about 40
 
01:50:44.930 --> 01:50:44.940 align:start position:0%
million dollars over that same life of
 
01:50:47.209 --> 01:50:47.219 align:start position:0%
the building to operate and maintain it
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
so just some numbers for you to think
 
01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
about and I am happy
 
01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
to be answering any questions they might
 
01:50:55.199 --> 01:50:57.050 align:start position:0%
to be answering any questions they might
have

01:50:57.050 --> 01:50:57.060 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:50:59.450 --> 01:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:51:00.649 --> 01:51:00.659 align:start position:0%
taking my questions very good
 
01:51:03.530 --> 01:51:03.540 align:start position:0%
presentation appreciate that uh
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
I know you just mentioned that uh the
 
01:51:08.209 --> 01:51:08.219 align:start position:0%
number of the population is decreasing
 
01:51:11.689 --> 01:51:11.699 align:start position:0%
do you have any projections
 
01:51:15.050 --> 01:51:15.060 align:start position:0%
anywhere that uh demographers have
 
01:51:17.090 --> 01:51:17.100 align:start position:0%
um I don't I mean we've lost what
 
01:51:20.209 --> 01:51:20.219 align:start position:0%
approximately 60 000 in the last 10 15
 
01:51:22.669 --> 01:51:22.679 align:start position:0%
years right I don't
 
01:51:24.410 --> 01:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
um the only thing I'll say to that is a
 
01:51:26.090 --> 01:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
lot of our projects our consolidation
 
01:51:26.100 --> 01:51:27.649 align:start position:0%
lot of our projects our consolidation
projects

01:51:27.649 --> 01:51:27.659 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
um and the only last thing I'll say is
 
01:51:34.070 --> 01:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
um my my small comparison of bridges uh
 
01:51:35.930 --> 01:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
still need to be safe just even though
 
01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
there's less traffic over them so the
 
01:51:39.530 --> 01:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
buildings themselves we still have
 
01:51:41.450 --> 01:51:41.460 align:start position:0%
students still I know that that's wasn't
 
01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
your question but I'll just uh add add
 
01:51:45.950 --> 01:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
to that when I can
 
01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:47.209 align:start position:0%
to that when I can
foreign

01:51:47.209 --> 01:51:47.219 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:51:49.370 --> 01:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
to that point you know certainly it's
 
01:51:51.290 --> 01:51:51.300 align:start position:0%
true that the population you know the
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
student population has been decreasing
 
01:51:54.830 --> 01:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
but there are school districts where
 
01:51:58.850 --> 01:51:58.860 align:start position:0%
population is increasing and to have
 
01:52:00.410 --> 01:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
didn't you know to lump it into one
 
01:52:03.109 --> 01:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
bucket doesn't tell a very good story in
 
01:52:05.090 --> 01:52:05.100 align:start position:0%
terms of other school districts where
 
01:52:07.250 --> 01:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
the school population is increasing so
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
it'd be nice to kind of have a sense of
 
01:52:11.149 --> 01:52:11.159 align:start position:0%
where is the decline and where is the
 
01:52:11.159 --> 01:52:12.070 align:start position:0%
where is the decline and where is the
increase

01:52:12.070 --> 01:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
they will also when you go into these
 
01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
schools there are definitely schools you
 
01:52:19.669 --> 01:52:19.679 align:start position:0%
can see oh this got some empty space and
 
01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
so forth but a lot and those schools are
 
01:52:24.169 --> 01:52:24.179 align:start position:0%
probably talking maybe consolidation or
 
01:52:25.970 --> 01:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
at least when they do get ready to build
 
01:52:28.609 --> 01:52:28.619 align:start position:0%
a building a smaller school but there's
 
01:52:28.619 --> 01:52:30.410 align:start position:0%
a building a smaller school but there's
also

01:52:30.410 --> 01:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:52:32.510 --> 01:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of schools even though they have
 
01:52:35.570 --> 01:52:35.580 align:start position:0%
less population are stuffed at the seams
 
01:52:36.890 --> 01:52:36.900 align:start position:0%
and you can tell because they have
 
01:52:39.229 --> 01:52:39.239 align:start position:0%
classrooms in the hallways but their
 
01:52:42.229 --> 01:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
special education needs are so different
 
01:52:44.689 --> 01:52:44.699 align:start position:0%
than what they were back when they were
 
01:52:49.609 --> 01:52:49.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:53.229 --> 01:52:53.239 align:start position:0%
I think that was wonderful I have to say
 
01:52:56.649 --> 01:52:56.659 align:start position:0%
I Ed Murdo was like my guy for so long
 
01:52:59.450 --> 01:52:59.460 align:start position:0%
and you just I'm still the new ad even
 
01:53:01.010 --> 01:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
though he's been gone for a long time
 
01:53:03.410 --> 01:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
I'll always be the new Ed right I've
 
01:53:04.729 --> 01:53:04.739 align:start position:0%
been to the apartment for seven years
 
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm still the new ad yes so
 
01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:08.090 align:start position:0%
and I'm still the new ad yes so
um

01:53:08.090 --> 01:53:08.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:10.490 --> 01:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:53:13.850 --> 01:53:13.860 align:start position:0%
I think I have to preface my comments I
 
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
think there's a desire to provide more
 
01:53:19.669 --> 01:53:19.679 align:start position:0%
building Aid to
 
01:53:21.290 --> 01:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
um the budget
 
01:53:21.300 --> 01:53:21.890 align:start position:0%
um the budget
um

01:53:21.890 --> 01:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:24.890 --> 01:53:24.900 align:start position:0%
what would it be like let's say if we
 
01:53:27.590 --> 01:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
put 60 million dollars in each year of
 
01:53:31.790 --> 01:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
the biennium but we subtract it out and
 
01:53:33.770 --> 01:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
set up another line
 
01:53:37.850 --> 01:53:37.860 align:start position:0%
for those costs that we are committed to
 
01:53:41.390 --> 01:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
from Years Gone by so that building Aid
 
01:53:45.290 --> 01:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
would become a new viable entity with
 
01:53:47.390 --> 01:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
the costs in another
 
01:53:50.270 --> 01:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
line within the budget would you think
 
01:53:52.850 --> 01:53:52.860 align:start position:0%
that would feel like walk like and talk
 
01:53:55.370 --> 01:53:55.380 align:start position:0%
like uh well I know that you have a bill
 
01:53:57.169 --> 01:53:57.179 align:start position:0%
um sponsored by representative Cahill I
 
01:53:57.179 --> 01:53:57.950 align:start position:0%
um sponsored by representative Cahill I
believe

01:53:57.950 --> 01:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
um with um with retro funding so correct
 
01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong that's what you're
 
01:54:04.910 --> 01:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
talking about is funding projects that
 
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
were in that moratorium or no no no no
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
I'm I well that was going to be my other
 
01:54:10.609 --> 01:54:10.619 align:start position:0%
question though I was going to ask you
 
01:54:12.290 --> 01:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
after this question this question
 
01:54:14.870 --> 01:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
relates to just what you're talking
 
01:54:17.689 --> 01:54:17.699 align:start position:0%
about new projects so that we would be
 
01:54:21.109 --> 01:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
walking into the biennium with if we're
 
01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
if the legislature if we're saying we
 
01:54:27.290 --> 01:54:27.300 align:start position:0%
want to provide 60 million dollars each
 
01:54:30.669 --> 01:54:30.679 align:start position:0%
year of the biennium for new projects
 
01:54:33.709 --> 01:54:33.719 align:start position:0%
but we recognize the fact that we still
 
01:54:37.129 --> 01:54:37.139 align:start position:0%
have our former obligations and I really
 
01:54:39.050 --> 01:54:39.060 align:start position:0%
do want to follow up with the treasury
 
01:54:41.930 --> 01:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
about that Bond because
 
01:54:44.330 --> 01:54:44.340 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious but I'm afraid we'll
 
01:54:47.149 --> 01:54:47.159 align:start position:0%
probably get the same answer but we have
 
01:54:48.770 --> 01:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
to I think it's a good thing to ask that
 
01:54:48.780 --> 01:54:49.970 align:start position:0%
to I think it's a good thing to ask that
question

01:54:49.970 --> 01:54:49.980 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:54:52.370 --> 01:54:52.380 align:start position:0%
but would it
 
01:54:54.770 --> 01:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
would it make it simpler or more
 
01:54:58.129 --> 01:54:58.139 align:start position:0%
confusing to go at it that way
 
01:55:02.090 --> 01:55:02.100 align:start position:0%
by separating giving you new money
 
01:55:04.669 --> 01:55:04.679 align:start position:0%
but keep maintaining our obligations but
 
01:55:07.129 --> 01:55:07.139 align:start position:0%
keeping that separate
 
01:55:07.139 --> 01:55:08.330 align:start position:0%
keeping that separate
right

01:55:08.330 --> 01:55:08.340 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:55:08.340 --> 01:55:09.050 align:start position:0%
right
um

01:55:09.050 --> 01:55:09.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
for me
 
01:55:13.609 --> 01:55:13.619 align:start position:0%
um it won't it won't matter in my sense
 
01:55:16.010 --> 01:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
of how we operate our program because
 
01:55:19.070 --> 01:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
the requirement is that we pay off the
 
01:55:20.930 --> 01:55:20.940 align:start position:0%
schools first before we fund new
 
01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
projects that's already in there but I
 
01:55:26.149 --> 01:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
can see conversationally wise
 
01:55:28.910 --> 01:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
um it would be easier to discuss and a
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
little bit easier for schools to
 
01:55:32.990 --> 01:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
understand for me the the biggest thing
 
01:55:38.149 --> 01:55:38.159 align:start position:0%
for schools I think is not knowing how
 
01:55:40.129 --> 01:55:40.139 align:start position:0%
much is available for new projects
 
01:55:41.570 --> 01:55:41.580 align:start position:0%
because you don't build a school
 
01:55:43.550 --> 01:55:43.560 align:start position:0%
overnight you don't design a school so
 
01:55:46.070 --> 01:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
this would help you in the sense of
 
01:55:48.910 --> 01:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
having a separate bucket of money
 
01:55:52.689 --> 01:55:52.699 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing continuingly funded bucket
 
01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
that certainly would help the school
 
01:55:58.669 --> 01:55:58.679 align:start position:0%
districts apply for building Aid now can
 
01:56:02.450 --> 01:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
I now I'll go to representative Cahill's
 
01:56:02.460 --> 01:56:03.290 align:start position:0%
I now I'll go to representative Cahill's
question

01:56:03.290 --> 01:56:03.300 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:56:06.830 --> 01:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
in his legislation he's asking for a
 
01:56:20.209 --> 01:56:20.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:20.219 --> 01:56:22.490 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:56:22.490 --> 01:56:22.500 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:56:26.510 --> 01:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
um with that thought in mind
 
01:56:28.370 --> 01:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
my question is number one did those
 
01:56:31.970 --> 01:56:31.980 align:start position:0%
projects ever go to the Department of Ed
 
01:56:34.790 --> 01:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know it's not right
 
01:56:36.649 --> 01:56:36.659 align:start position:0%
um so they were never some hurdles there
 
01:56:39.530 --> 01:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
priced out on
 
01:56:39.540 --> 01:56:41.090 align:start position:0%
priced out on
allowable

01:56:41.090 --> 01:56:41.100 align:start position:0%
allowable
 
01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:43.189 align:start position:0%
allowable
expenses

01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
01:56:43.199 --> 01:56:45.229 align:start position:0%
expenses
so

01:56:45.229 --> 01:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:56:45.239 --> 01:56:46.970 align:start position:0%
so
and

01:56:46.970 --> 01:56:46.980 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:50.810 --> 01:56:50.820 align:start position:0%
we never seem to have an appetite well
 
01:56:54.350 --> 01:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
let me ask this question when projects
 
01:56:57.050 --> 01:56:57.060 align:start position:0%
went forward
 
01:56:59.870 --> 01:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
did every every single School District
 
01:57:04.370 --> 01:57:04.380 align:start position:0%
was fully notified that there would be
 
01:57:06.830 --> 01:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
the moratorium was on and there would be
 
01:57:10.129 --> 01:57:10.139 align:start position:0%
no funding available
 
01:57:12.290 --> 01:57:12.300 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm not sure I follow your
 
01:57:14.330 --> 01:57:14.340 align:start position:0%
question back in the moratorium during
 
01:57:16.129 --> 01:57:16.139 align:start position:0%
the moratorium years
 
01:57:17.810 --> 01:57:17.820 align:start position:0%
so are you asking do they have a heads
 
01:57:19.310 --> 01:57:19.320 align:start position:0%
up on the moratorium did they have a
 
01:57:22.370 --> 01:57:22.380 align:start position:0%
full understanding of that uh I I don't
 
01:57:26.089 --> 01:57:26.099 align:start position:0%
know my guess is when a when a again I
 
01:57:27.830 --> 01:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't here but my guess is when you
 
01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
have a project that the a program that's
 
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
funded since the for 60 plus years and
 
01:57:34.129 --> 01:57:34.139 align:start position:0%
then someone says there's going to be a
 
01:57:36.229 --> 01:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
two-year pause on the program my guess
 
01:57:38.450 --> 01:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
is that schools were probably hopeful it
 
01:57:40.250 --> 01:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
would come back but that two-year
 
01:57:42.410 --> 01:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
moratorium was repeated five years and
 
01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
then at some point school districts
 
01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:46.310 align:start position:0%
then at some point school districts
probably

01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:57:48.589 --> 01:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
Pro my guess is not a lot of
 
01:57:50.330 --> 01:57:50.340 align:start position:0%
construction took place in the beginning
 
01:57:52.070 --> 01:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
of the moratorium because people were
 
01:57:54.470 --> 01:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
hoping that the more time would end
 
01:57:56.089 --> 01:57:56.099 align:start position:0%
um but then the program completely
 
01:57:57.709 --> 01:57:57.719 align:start position:0%
changed and I'm sure some communities
 
01:57:59.390 --> 01:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
went forward
 
01:58:00.770 --> 01:58:00.780 align:start position:0%
um when when we were in a moment but
 
01:58:02.750 --> 01:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
they never sent you any paperwork no we
 
01:58:04.189 --> 01:58:04.199 align:start position:0%
did not receive applications nothing
 
01:58:06.169 --> 01:58:06.179 align:start position:0%
went through the department of Ed not
 
01:58:07.669 --> 01:58:07.679 align:start position:0%
officially there are always people
 
01:58:10.010 --> 01:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
sending us courtesy copies of plans and
 
01:58:11.629 --> 01:58:11.639 align:start position:0%
so forth which we always appreciate but
 
01:58:14.209 --> 01:58:14.219 align:start position:0%
there was no open application process so
 
01:58:17.629 --> 01:58:17.639 align:start position:0%
if if retro funding was
 
01:58:19.609 --> 01:58:19.619 align:start position:0%
um open I
 
01:58:22.729 --> 01:58:22.739 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be really easy to fund
 
01:58:24.169 --> 01:58:24.179 align:start position:0%
those projects but I'm sure that we
 
01:58:26.270 --> 01:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
could develop rules and regulations on
 
01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
how to accept projects for old old
 
01:58:31.070 --> 01:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
things that are 10 years old
 
01:58:33.169 --> 01:58:33.179 align:start position:0%
um it won't be easy but it's not that it
 
01:58:35.810 --> 01:58:35.820 align:start position:0%
can't be done with some kind of
 
01:58:35.820 --> 01:58:37.070 align:start position:0%
can't be done with some kind of
um

01:58:37.070 --> 01:58:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:46.310 --> 01:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:48.950 --> 01:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
01:58:51.050 --> 01:58:51.060 align:start position:0%
um Amy I want to thank you for on page
 
01:58:54.410 --> 01:58:54.420 align:start position:0%
two the chart the history this this is
 
01:58:56.689 --> 01:58:56.699 align:start position:0%
the best simplification I've seen as far
 
01:58:56.699 --> 01:58:57.490 align:start position:0%
the best simplification I've seen as far
as

01:58:57.490 --> 01:58:57.500 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:59:00.470 --> 01:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
for the history of it okay
 
01:59:03.830 --> 01:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
um and just one other thing is the the
 
01:59:08.030 --> 01:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh the 80 20 that I think we're still in
 
01:59:11.350 --> 01:59:11.360 align:start position:0%
now correct that came out of just
 
01:59:14.750 --> 01:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
desperation because because nothing
 
01:59:17.030 --> 01:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
because they were it was the moratorium
 
01:59:18.050 --> 01:59:18.060 align:start position:0%
was on
 
01:59:20.089 --> 01:59:20.099 align:start position:0%
and so to come out of that moratorium
 
01:59:23.870 --> 01:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's when that 80 20 program
 
01:59:26.870 --> 01:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
started I don't think so I mean
 
01:59:28.669 --> 01:59:28.679 align:start position:0%
representative umberger
 
01:59:31.070 --> 01:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
um previously has stated that that that
 
01:59:33.290 --> 01:59:33.300 align:start position:0%
is by Design and that people are very
 
01:59:35.570 --> 01:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
fond of the 80 20. I know there was a
 
01:59:37.010 --> 01:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
comment yesterday that I listened to
 
01:59:40.189 --> 01:59:40.199 align:start position:0%
about going back to the tale I don't I
 
01:59:41.570 --> 01:59:41.580 align:start position:0%
don't think that's a good idea
 
01:59:43.490 --> 01:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
personally I don't think that that's
 
01:59:45.890 --> 01:59:45.900 align:start position:0%
what schools want I think schools want
 
01:59:47.870 --> 01:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to bond a lower amount save
 
01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
on interest rates and that they will be
 
01:59:52.189 --> 01:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
patiently waiting in line when they
 
01:59:54.709 --> 01:59:54.719 align:start position:0%
don't have to pay interest on their bond
 
01:59:56.510 --> 01:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
um when that comes I think people on the
 
01:59:57.950 --> 01:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
lower on the list would love to have
 
02:00:00.050 --> 02:00:00.060 align:start position:0%
that tail broken out because then they
 
02:00:02.209 --> 02:00:02.219 align:start position:0%
could get funded early on but I don't
 
02:00:03.649 --> 02:00:03.659 align:start position:0%
think it was a part of desperation I
 
02:00:05.990 --> 02:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
think it was a way to save communities
 
02:00:09.109 --> 02:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
on paying all that interest on that Bond
 
02:00:10.970 --> 02:00:10.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:00:14.930 --> 02:00:14.940 align:start position:0%
just to add to those remarks I prefer
 
02:00:17.270 --> 02:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
that the state takes care of its
 
02:00:20.209 --> 02:00:20.219 align:start position:0%
obligations up front this hole let's
 
02:00:22.430 --> 02:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
spend 20 years paying what we committed
 
02:00:24.950 --> 02:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
to pay today not only is more expensive
 
02:00:26.689 --> 02:00:26.699 align:start position:0%
because you know there is more interest
 
02:00:28.609 --> 02:00:28.619 align:start position:0%
to be paid because the whole amount has
 
02:00:30.290 --> 02:00:30.300 align:start position:0%
to be bonded and then we only pay the
 
02:00:32.270 --> 02:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
principal but the interest still has to
 
02:00:34.729 --> 02:00:34.739 align:start position:0%
be paid by the schools but frankly it's
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
a way to shift the expenses that we make
 
02:00:40.010 --> 02:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
today to be paid by taxpayers 20 years
 
02:00:41.209 --> 02:00:41.219 align:start position:0%
from now
 
02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
personally I think that the people who
 
02:00:46.189 --> 02:00:46.199 align:start position:0%
support the expenses should be the ones
 
02:00:49.250 --> 02:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
that pay for it so I understand this
 
02:00:51.229 --> 02:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
frustrates the schools that don't make
 
02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
it and maybe at some point the
 
02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
legislature will want to consider that
 
02:00:58.550 --> 02:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
based on uh you know the you know one
 
02:01:02.209 --> 02:01:02.219 align:start position:0%
page summary here we seem to have a hard
 
02:01:02.219 --> 02:01:05.030 align:start position:0%
page summary here we seem to have a hard
time

02:01:05.030 --> 02:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:07.129 --> 02:01:07.139 align:start position:0%
basically I don't see this tale of
 
02:01:08.570 --> 02:01:08.580 align:start position:0%
projects that get rejected getting
 
02:01:10.850 --> 02:01:10.860 align:start position:0%
smaller based on this you know rough
 
02:01:13.609 --> 02:01:13.619 align:start position:0%
rough estimate so maybe structural
 
02:01:15.290 --> 02:01:15.300 align:start position:0%
changes will be needed in the law maybe
 
02:01:16.910 --> 02:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
we'll need to look at another way to
 
02:01:19.089 --> 02:01:19.099 align:start position:0%
provide this help but
 
02:01:22.370 --> 02:01:22.380 align:start position:0%
whenever we pay whenever we make
 
02:01:24.890 --> 02:01:24.900 align:start position:0%
promises I think most of the funding
 
02:01:26.990 --> 02:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
should come you know when the project is
 
02:01:29.330 --> 02:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
done not be shifted to uh you know
 
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
decades later just my personal thought
 
02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:35.649 align:start position:0%
decades later just my personal thought
of

02:01:35.649 --> 02:01:35.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:39.169 --> 02:01:39.179 align:start position:0%
other comments
 
02:01:40.609 --> 02:01:40.619 align:start position:0%
I have a chair of the school building
 
02:01:40.619 --> 02:01:42.290 align:start position:0%
I have a chair of the school building
authority

02:01:42.290 --> 02:01:42.300 align:start position:0%
authority
 
02:01:44.270 --> 02:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
you would ask what would make it you
 
02:01:46.189 --> 02:01:46.199 align:start position:0%
ought to come up to a mic sorry about
 
02:01:46.199 --> 02:01:48.169 align:start position:0%
ought to come up to a mic sorry about
that

02:01:48.169 --> 02:01:48.179 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:01:51.109 --> 02:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
you can say okay we work well together
 
02:01:53.209 --> 02:01:53.219 align:start position:0%
yeah we do
 
02:01:55.669 --> 02:01:55.679 align:start position:0%
um so as as a chair of the school
 
02:01:58.310 --> 02:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
building authority and and this chair no
 
02:01:59.930 --> 02:01:59.940 align:start position:0%
I'm good
 
02:02:01.490 --> 02:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
um from Australian so I'm used to
 
02:02:03.770 --> 02:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
sitting like this this is fine
 
02:02:05.750 --> 02:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
um oh thank you very much
 
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
so um I in in response to uh
 
02:02:12.770 --> 02:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
representative Heath's comment of what
 
02:02:15.890 --> 02:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
would make Amy's job easier I think it's
 
02:02:17.689 --> 02:02:17.699 align:start position:0%
very important and and she mentioned it
 
02:02:20.450 --> 02:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
but it kind of slid right by
 
02:02:20.460 --> 02:02:21.290 align:start position:0%
but it kind of slid right by
um

02:02:21.290 --> 02:02:21.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:23.570 --> 02:02:23.580 align:start position:0%
I for years have been
 
02:02:25.669 --> 02:02:25.679 align:start position:0%
complaining about the process the
 
02:02:29.209 --> 02:02:29.219 align:start position:0%
process is awful the timeline is awful
 
02:02:31.550 --> 02:02:31.560 align:start position:0%
the amount of applications that come in
 
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
at one time and she has a period of time
 
02:02:38.450 --> 02:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
to review those applications before she
 
02:02:42.050 --> 02:02:42.060 align:start position:0%
gets them to me to all for the school
 
02:02:44.510 --> 02:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
building authority to review before I
 
02:02:47.689 --> 02:02:47.699 align:start position:0%
have to report to the board of ed
 
02:02:50.689 --> 02:02:50.699 align:start position:0%
is about a six-month window
 
02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
so when you saw those 17 applications
 
02:02:56.990 --> 02:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
that came in this year
 
02:03:00.530 --> 02:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
it's important for me to point out that
 
02:03:04.729 --> 02:03:04.739 align:start position:0%
those 17 hadn't had not been approved by
 
02:03:06.530 --> 02:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
their Community yet
 
02:03:09.709 --> 02:03:09.719 align:start position:0%
so Amy is doing all of the work of
 
02:03:13.790 --> 02:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
evaluating all 17 projects meaning site
 
02:03:18.229 --> 02:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
visits reviewing plans all of that
 
02:03:22.189 --> 02:03:22.199 align:start position:0%
for projects that many of them that the
 
02:03:24.709 --> 02:03:24.719 align:start position:0%
community may have no support for and no
 
02:03:27.589 --> 02:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
interest in doing so it would seem to me
 
02:03:32.030 --> 02:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
if there was a way of jiggering the
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
timeline and it may mean that we push
 
02:03:38.330 --> 02:03:38.340 align:start position:0%
this out to a a longer process
 
02:03:41.149 --> 02:03:41.159 align:start position:0%
but if there was a way that we knew the
 
02:03:43.550 --> 02:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
community had interest in it and had the
 
02:03:46.189 --> 02:03:46.199 align:start position:0%
ability to to pay their
 
02:03:50.030 --> 02:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
you know 70 or or 30 percent of the of
 
02:03:54.229 --> 02:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
the cost up front that would relieve
 
02:03:57.530 --> 02:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
looking at process at projects that
 
02:03:59.870 --> 02:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
aren't going to go anywhere anyway you
 
02:04:02.629 --> 02:04:02.639 align:start position:0%
know aren't aren't of Interest I happen
 
02:04:05.810 --> 02:04:05.820 align:start position:0%
to live this because it was my school
 
02:04:09.169 --> 02:04:09.179 align:start position:0%
district last term that came out number
 
02:04:11.689 --> 02:04:11.699 align:start position:0%
one on the on the process but the
 
02:04:15.050 --> 02:04:15.060 align:start position:0%
community voted it down so you know I
 
02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
saw all of the additional work that Amy
 
02:04:21.050 --> 02:04:21.060 align:start position:0%
had to go through and her team
 
02:04:22.910 --> 02:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
when it was never going to be anything
 
02:04:26.209 --> 02:04:26.219 align:start position:0%
that was of Interest or or past the
 
02:04:29.570 --> 02:04:29.580 align:start position:0%
community so I think that is a
 
02:04:31.970 --> 02:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
more so you've seen all the numbers and
 
02:04:34.250 --> 02:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
all of them I I don't dispute
 
02:04:37.129 --> 02:04:37.139 align:start position:0%
um that Amy's given you here
 
02:04:39.890 --> 02:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
processes the bigger problem
 
02:04:42.290 --> 02:04:42.300 align:start position:0%
um it's not the money and and I keep
 
02:04:44.270 --> 02:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
seeing the bills coming through saying
 
02:04:47.450 --> 02:04:47.460 align:start position:0%
let's put more money into this
 
02:04:49.910 --> 02:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
the process is awful so you're putting
 
02:04:52.850 --> 02:04:52.860 align:start position:0%
money into something that that isn't
 
02:04:55.550 --> 02:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
it's indeterminate it isn't working the
 
02:04:57.890 --> 02:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
way it is as it is is it in statute or
 
02:05:00.530 --> 02:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
is this a just a adoptive process no
 
02:05:03.530 --> 02:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
it's interesting yeah
 
02:05:06.350 --> 02:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
um we have for years talked about trying
 
02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:07.370 align:start position:0%
um we have for years talked about trying
to

02:05:07.370 --> 02:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:05:10.070 --> 02:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
get the stakeholders together and figure
 
02:05:12.350 --> 02:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
out a better timeline and I think there
 
02:05:14.930 --> 02:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
is a bill by representative Ladd I'm not
 
02:05:16.850 --> 02:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
happy with that either but that's
 
02:05:19.310 --> 02:05:19.320 align:start position:0%
neither here nor there but there there
 
02:05:21.530 --> 02:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
needs to be a better way that we do that
 
02:05:24.169 --> 02:05:24.179 align:start position:0%
if we in fact are going to do building a
 
02:05:25.689 --> 02:05:25.699 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
02:05:28.790 --> 02:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair do you have a sense
 
02:05:32.089 --> 02:05:32.099 align:start position:0%
of how many of the projects are totally
 
02:05:33.470 --> 02:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
tossed out because they're just not
 
02:05:35.870 --> 02:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
eligible or is it always just part of
 
02:05:38.810 --> 02:05:38.820 align:start position:0%
the project and secondly um you know
 
02:05:40.370 --> 02:05:40.380 align:start position:0%
these have to go to Warren which is town
 
02:05:41.870 --> 02:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
meeting and you know that sort of thing
 
02:05:45.709 --> 02:05:45.719 align:start position:0%
is there a halfway measure of being able
 
02:05:48.050 --> 02:05:48.060 align:start position:0%
to take the the temperature of the
 
02:05:49.850 --> 02:05:49.860 align:start position:0%
community in order to get a sense that
 
02:05:51.649 --> 02:05:51.659 align:start position:0%
probably the community will support it
 
02:05:55.010 --> 02:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
because I think communities will resist
 
02:05:57.530 --> 02:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
voting for a warrant if they have no
 
02:05:59.089 --> 02:05:59.099 align:start position:0%
idea whether they're going to get
 
02:06:01.850 --> 02:06:01.860 align:start position:0%
anything proposed anything approved it's
 
02:06:04.129 --> 02:06:04.139 align:start position:0%
a chicken or egg thing isn't it uh I
 
02:06:05.810 --> 02:06:05.820 align:start position:0%
mean you're thank you for your question
 
02:06:09.169 --> 02:06:09.179 align:start position:0%
it is I don't think there is any way of
 
02:06:11.990 --> 02:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
us predetermining what percentage of
 
02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
those 17 are going to be approved or not
 
02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:15.530 align:start position:0%
those 17 are going to be approved or not
approved

02:06:15.530 --> 02:06:15.540 align:start position:0%
approved
 
02:06:17.750 --> 02:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
but I think there would have to be some
 
02:06:20.450 --> 02:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
kind of a way that in the warrant you
 
02:06:22.129 --> 02:06:22.139 align:start position:0%
would have to have it built into a
 
02:06:24.649 --> 02:06:24.659 align:start position:0%
contingency process if if building Aid
 
02:06:27.350 --> 02:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
was available would you approve if if it
 
02:06:29.629 --> 02:06:29.639 align:start position:0%
wasn't would you approve and then you've
 
02:06:32.030 --> 02:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
got another bigger question
 
02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:32.709 align:start position:0%
got another bigger question
um

02:06:32.709 --> 02:06:32.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:35.930 --> 02:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
what's the obligation of residents in
 
02:06:39.890 --> 02:06:39.900 align:start position:0%
Coos County to have to support
 
02:06:43.070 --> 02:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
the construction of a elementary school
 
02:06:46.370 --> 02:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
in Nashua when Nashua is planning to do
 
02:06:48.050 --> 02:06:48.060 align:start position:0%
it anyway you know whether there's
 
02:06:50.209 --> 02:06:50.219 align:start position:0%
building Aid or not you know you you've
 
02:06:51.669 --> 02:06:51.679 align:start position:0%
got a
 
02:06:55.370 --> 02:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
it's it's difficult to spend well
 
02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
it's really easy to spend other people's
 
02:07:00.290 --> 02:07:00.300 align:start position:0%
money but this is
 
02:07:03.050 --> 02:07:03.060 align:start position:0%
um asking other parts of the state to
 
02:07:05.570 --> 02:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
support a school where those places may
 
02:07:07.370 --> 02:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
be willing to build their school anyway
 
02:07:12.229 --> 02:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:14.030 --> 02:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
and though that the
 
02:07:14.040 --> 02:07:14.810 align:start position:0%
and though that the
um

02:07:14.810 --> 02:07:14.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
I I do feel like the communities have
 
02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
put an investment in the application
 
02:07:21.890 --> 02:07:21.900 align:start position:0%
though so they have had to appropriately
 
02:07:24.589 --> 02:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
or budget a certain amount of money to
 
02:07:26.570 --> 02:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
put in an application for hiring an
 
02:07:29.030 --> 02:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
architect and preliminary plans I would
 
02:07:30.950 --> 02:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
agree that the process the bill
 
02:07:33.050 --> 02:07:33.060 align:start position:0%
representative Vlad has in kind of flips
 
02:07:34.250 --> 02:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
it a little
 
02:07:36.709 --> 02:07:36.719 align:start position:0%
um and I think that will help out the
 
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
process but I guess I would just point
 
02:07:40.370 --> 02:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
out that the
 
02:07:40.380 --> 02:07:41.149 align:start position:0%
out that the
um

02:07:41.149 --> 02:07:41.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:44.750 --> 02:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
for me I look at this list of 17 schools
 
02:07:49.010 --> 02:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
and feel like all the 17 schools uh
 
02:07:50.450 --> 02:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
certainly were worthy of the
 
02:07:52.729 --> 02:07:52.739 align:start position:0%
Department's time I think that they were
 
02:07:56.149 --> 02:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
ranked appropriately I I really um this
 
02:07:57.830 --> 02:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
is a you know we've only been through
 
02:08:00.770 --> 02:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
this really three times now and I did
 
02:08:02.450 --> 02:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
feel like having a large group of
 
02:08:05.209 --> 02:08:05.219 align:start position:0%
applications the feel of it you know you
 
02:08:06.530 --> 02:08:06.540 align:start position:0%
do get into a school and you're kind of
 
02:08:07.550 --> 02:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
like oh you don't know how the points
 
02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
are going to shake out but it does feel
 
02:08:11.270 --> 02:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate so I was pleased with that
 
02:08:13.129 --> 02:08:13.139 align:start position:0%
and the law not that there aren't tweaks
 
02:08:15.050 --> 02:08:15.060 align:start position:0%
that can't be made
 
02:08:16.729 --> 02:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
um but I just want to point out that the
 
02:08:21.109 --> 02:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
communities do have to put up front some
 
02:08:23.450 --> 02:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
fairly significant meaning a hundred
 
02:08:25.310 --> 02:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
thousand maybe even up to two hundred
 
02:08:27.470 --> 02:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in order to apply for
 
02:08:29.209 --> 02:08:29.219 align:start position:0%
these because they are hiring our an
 
02:08:33.109 --> 02:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:33.119 --> 02:08:34.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:08:34.550 --> 02:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:08:36.350 --> 02:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
do you have another question
 
02:08:38.990 --> 02:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
I want to actually concur with what um
 
02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
Amy's saying as a former assistant
 
02:08:43.970 --> 02:08:43.980 align:start position:0%
superintendent we often especially in a
 
02:08:46.010 --> 02:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
small town when they can only vote once
 
02:08:49.550 --> 02:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
a year on to secure a bond or not a lot
 
02:08:51.950 --> 02:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
of work and effort goes in and sometimes
 
02:08:55.490 --> 02:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
we used to say three times a charm so it
 
02:08:57.709 --> 02:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
it doesn't always work the first time
 
02:09:00.290 --> 02:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
but we kept we used to keep going back
 
02:09:03.470 --> 02:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
and building more consensus across it's
 
02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
a good it's a good way to build
 
02:09:07.129 --> 02:09:07.139 align:start position:0%
consensus and bring the community
 
02:09:10.129 --> 02:09:10.139 align:start position:0%
together too to get that Bond
 
02:09:11.689 --> 02:09:11.699 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:09:26.870 --> 02:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:28.010 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:09:28.010 --> 02:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
again offer myself as the chair of the
 
02:09:33.050 --> 02:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
school building authority if you have in
 
02:09:35.870 --> 02:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
information or you have questions on
 
02:09:37.970 --> 02:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
that I can provide information on I'm
 
02:09:40.689 --> 02:09:40.699 align:start position:0%
happy to do that we'll be back I'm sure
 
02:09:43.490 --> 02:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you
 
02:09:45.890 --> 02:09:45.900 align:start position:0%
all set from YouTube or yeah likes it
 
02:09:47.390 --> 02:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
all right excellent presentation thank
 
02:09:58.550 --> 02:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:01.010 --> 02:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
Michael what do you got well first of
 
02:10:03.410 --> 02:10:03.420 align:start position:0%
all I want to second that that was a
 
02:10:04.910 --> 02:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
wonderful presentation I've seen a few
 
02:10:08.209 --> 02:10:08.219 align:start position:0%
of Amy's uh presentations and it's a
 
02:10:10.750 --> 02:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
difficult difficult complicated mess
 
02:10:13.609 --> 02:10:13.619 align:start position:0%
that uh you're getting getting a chance
 
02:10:16.609 --> 02:10:16.619 align:start position:0%
to fix it uh probably not this time but
 
02:10:19.129 --> 02:10:19.139 align:start position:0%
uh in any case I think part of the
 
02:10:22.129 --> 02:10:22.139 align:start position:0%
problem is the is the cap
 
02:10:24.229 --> 02:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
and if we didn't have the cap then
 
02:10:25.970 --> 02:10:25.980 align:start position:0%
school it wouldn't be competitive we
 
02:10:27.649 --> 02:10:27.659 align:start position:0%
could still rank them and say which ones
 
02:10:31.310 --> 02:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
will do first but a town like like uh
 
02:10:33.649 --> 02:10:33.659 align:start position:0%
like Claremont where they where they you
 
02:10:35.689 --> 02:10:35.699 align:start position:0%
know three different votes and they were
 
02:10:37.790 --> 02:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
one short or one you know
 
02:10:39.770 --> 02:10:39.780 align:start position:0%
that's all it takes is one one person
 
02:10:41.450 --> 02:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
stays home watching Dancing with the
 
02:10:43.490 --> 02:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
Stars and you lose the whole thing and
 
02:10:45.410 --> 02:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of effort goes into it
 
02:10:49.370 --> 02:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
so I think the cap is the problem uh my
 
02:10:52.370 --> 02:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
bills has at least 60 million 60 million
 
02:10:54.950 --> 02:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
minimum per year which I think is a is a
 
02:10:57.050 --> 02:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
good starting point yes we have to pay
 
02:11:00.950 --> 02:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
down the debt uh I I wrote to Mr Caswell
 
02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
and trying to push for uh some of this
 
02:11:07.070 --> 02:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
arpa go for money to enable us to do
 
02:11:09.050 --> 02:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
more schools you know on the current
 
02:11:11.689 --> 02:11:11.699 align:start position:0%
list but I don't want to I don't want to
 
02:11:14.870 --> 02:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
overlook the people uh in New Market and
 
02:11:18.229 --> 02:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
in in Windham and in uh so many other
 
02:11:20.689 --> 02:11:20.699 align:start position:0%
communities that went forward when
 
02:11:22.729 --> 02:11:22.739 align:start position:0%
applications were not accepted
 
02:11:26.030 --> 02:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh but we did often as as Amy said we
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
we've submitted plans and we tried to
 
02:11:30.169 --> 02:11:30.179 align:start position:0%
stay in line with what the what the
 
02:11:32.209 --> 02:11:32.219 align:start position:0%
department would accept and was you know
 
02:11:34.729 --> 02:11:34.739 align:start position:0%
with the standards I know that Mr uh
 
02:11:36.410 --> 02:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
Mullen was here earlier they did the
 
02:11:37.910 --> 02:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
same thing with the school they built in
 
02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:38.990 align:start position:0%
same thing with the school they built in
Middleton

02:11:38.990 --> 02:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
Middleton
 
02:11:41.330 --> 02:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
so you know the the districts have
 
02:11:43.310 --> 02:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
worked at this uh the people in the
 
02:11:45.770 --> 02:11:45.780 align:start position:0%
community uh the the reason that the 80
 
02:11:47.810 --> 02:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
20 was done was to try to incentivize
 
02:11:49.970 --> 02:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
people make it easier less expensive for
 
02:11:52.310 --> 02:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
them over time and here in New Hampshire
 
02:11:54.470 --> 02:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes nothing is going to be enough
 
02:11:56.450 --> 02:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
to get some people to vote for something
 
02:11:59.629 --> 02:11:59.639 align:start position:0%
that will cost any money at all
 
02:11:59.639 --> 02:12:00.890 align:start position:0%
that will cost any money at all
um

02:12:00.890 --> 02:12:00.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:03.709 --> 02:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
you know I'm a I'm working on a bill for
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
my next turn for next year which would
 
02:12:07.850 --> 02:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
change the uh what we say on the license
 
02:12:10.669 --> 02:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
plate for from uh Live Free or Die to if
 
02:12:12.410 --> 02:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
it's free that's for me
 
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
I think it's kind of catchy
 
02:12:16.850 --> 02:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
but uh you know we we just have to you
 
02:12:18.709 --> 02:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
know education is important it gets to
 
02:12:21.050 --> 02:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
work for us it gets to people who are
 
02:12:22.370 --> 02:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
here having businesses starting
 
02:12:25.310 --> 02:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
businesses working in businesses uh we
 
02:12:26.629 --> 02:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
want our kids to stay here and be
 
02:12:28.430 --> 02:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
educated do all the trades and all the
 
02:12:29.990 --> 02:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
things that we need to have done they
 
02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
have to go to school and we have to
 
02:12:34.609 --> 02:12:34.619 align:start position:0%
build and maintain the schools and so I
 
02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
hope that you will I understand you're
 
02:12:37.430 --> 02:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
going to work through all these bills
 
02:12:40.010 --> 02:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
and find the best possible solution it
 
02:12:42.169 --> 02:12:42.179 align:start position:0%
could be pieces of this and pieces of
 
02:12:44.270 --> 02:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
that and I wish you the best of luck and
 
02:12:45.530 --> 02:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
I appreciate all the work you're going
 
02:12:46.910 --> 02:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
to put into it
 
02:12:48.770 --> 02:12:48.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:12:48.780 --> 02:12:49.990 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

02:12:49.990 --> 02:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:12:53.750 --> 02:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh I would like to consider did you want
 
02:12:55.609 --> 02:12:55.619 align:start position:0%
to make yeah sure thank you sir I
 
02:12:58.430 --> 02:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:00.169 --> 02:13:00.179 align:start position:0%
my name is Jack Dunn I'm the business
 
02:13:01.729 --> 02:13:01.739 align:start position:0%
administrator for the Concord school
 
02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
district and uh I I will speak the same
 
02:13:06.950 --> 02:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
comments as it relates to Amy Clark
 
02:13:09.410 --> 02:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
she's been fantastic to work with we
 
02:13:11.270 --> 02:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
really appreciate her in-depth knowledge
 
02:13:13.310 --> 02:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
for her and her small Department over
 
02:13:15.589 --> 02:13:15.599 align:start position:0%
there having to uh take care of
 
02:13:18.350 --> 02:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
everything we are ranked number four on
 
02:13:20.330 --> 02:13:20.340 align:start position:0%
the list so as you heard the funding for
 
02:13:22.370 --> 02:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
the first three the fourth one we're
 
02:13:25.010 --> 02:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
just peeking in the window but uh just a
 
02:13:26.870 --> 02:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
couple comments and observations as I
 
02:13:28.910 --> 02:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
was at the bill yesterday for
 
02:13:32.089 --> 02:13:32.099 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner for uh Bill 541
 
02:13:34.850 --> 02:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
to fund it at 100 million per year
 
02:13:36.589 --> 02:13:36.599 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure there's a lot of different
 
02:13:39.169 --> 02:13:39.179 align:start position:0%
competing bills but I just want to kind
 
02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
of mention some things based on what I
 
02:13:43.609 --> 02:13:43.619 align:start position:0%
heard and some maybe ideas uh as far as
 
02:13:45.290 --> 02:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
dealing with enrollment both
 
02:13:46.729 --> 02:13:46.739 align:start position:0%
representatives are right you do have
 
02:13:48.830 --> 02:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
declining enrollment but some towns will
 
02:13:51.950 --> 02:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
go up and some are staying steady uh the
 
02:13:53.930 --> 02:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
Concord example is we did a demographic
 
02:13:57.350 --> 02:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
study in 1819 and everything shows for
 
02:13:59.050 --> 02:13:59.060 align:start position:0%
us flattening out
 
02:14:01.970 --> 02:14:01.980 align:start position:0%
now they're only good for five years why
 
02:14:03.830 --> 02:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
is it five years you go back five years
 
02:14:05.870 --> 02:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
from a five-year-old that's when the
 
02:14:08.330 --> 02:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
baby's born you nothing is reliable
 
02:14:10.729 --> 02:14:10.739 align:start position:0%
after this five years so we're coming up
 
02:14:12.709 --> 02:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
on doing again
 
02:14:14.270 --> 02:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
um here in Concord we're having
 
02:14:16.250 --> 02:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
significant development there's about
 
02:14:19.490 --> 02:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
241 units coming in to conquer between
 
02:14:21.649 --> 02:14:21.659 align:start position:0%
where the proposed Concord steam was
 
02:14:23.510 --> 02:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
going to go and some other parts of the
 
02:14:25.729 --> 02:14:25.739 align:start position:0%
city so that will affect our schools and
 
02:14:29.689 --> 02:14:29.699 align:start position:0%
diff excuse me different ways but I also
 
02:14:31.850 --> 02:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
in our demographic study we were being
 
02:14:36.169 --> 02:14:36.179 align:start position:0%
equated to Portland Maine and Salt Lake
 
02:14:38.390 --> 02:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
City Utah where we are getting what
 
02:14:40.490 --> 02:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
they're calling dinks dual income no
 
02:14:42.770 --> 02:14:42.780 align:start position:0%
kids okay
 
02:14:44.270 --> 02:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
um people are either having kids later
 
02:14:46.729 --> 02:14:46.739 align:start position:0%
or they're not having them at all so I
 
02:14:47.810 --> 02:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
don't think we're going to see the
 
02:14:50.450 --> 02:14:50.460 align:start position:0%
serious influx but I think as Miss Clark
 
02:14:53.149 --> 02:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
had mentioned before Bridges age whether
 
02:14:55.490 --> 02:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
there's more cars or fewer cars schools
 
02:14:57.169 --> 02:14:57.179 align:start position:0%
age whether there's more kids or fewer
 
02:14:59.990 --> 02:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
kids it's all mechanical systems weather
 
02:15:02.089 --> 02:15:02.099 align:start position:0%
we're in a really tough environment
 
02:15:04.669 --> 02:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
especially in the next couple hours that
 
02:15:07.250 --> 02:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
may start up again so
 
02:15:09.169 --> 02:15:09.179 align:start position:0%
um they just need to be the school
 
02:15:12.370 --> 02:15:12.380 align:start position:0%
buildings will need to be addressed
 
02:15:14.689 --> 02:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:15:17.569 --> 02:15:17.579 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Mr Dunn while you are
 
02:15:19.490 --> 02:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
here and since you are from Concord and
 
02:15:22.669 --> 02:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
there were questions about the uh
 
02:15:26.030 --> 02:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
rather High Cost of that school is that
 
02:15:27.350 --> 02:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
something that you know you could give
 
02:15:29.569 --> 02:15:29.579 align:start position:0%
the committee a bit more information
 
02:15:32.089 --> 02:15:32.099 align:start position:0%
about so we understand the Dynamics
 
02:15:33.830 --> 02:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
behind that because I have to say that's
 
02:15:36.410 --> 02:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
quite an eye-popping number so you know
 
02:15:38.270 --> 02:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
I I agree and I was going to address
 
02:15:40.609 --> 02:15:40.619 align:start position:0%
that but I'll go right to that so that
 
02:15:44.810 --> 02:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
176 million is based on estimates by a
 
02:15:47.930 --> 02:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
uh estimator for the architect that we
 
02:15:51.950 --> 02:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
hired our scope of work to prepare this
 
02:15:55.069 --> 02:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
application was 393 thousand dollars so
 
02:15:56.390 --> 02:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
as they were talking about communities
 
02:15:57.770 --> 02:15:57.780 align:start position:0%
made investment
 
02:15:59.870 --> 02:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
communities make significant investments
 
02:16:02.209 --> 02:16:02.219 align:start position:0%
into these applications to get in line
 
02:16:03.890 --> 02:16:03.900 align:start position:0%
which honestly I think they should
 
02:16:05.689 --> 02:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
because they need to make the commitment
 
02:16:07.550 --> 02:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
and show the state hey if we're willing
 
02:16:08.689 --> 02:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
to back you you got to show the
 
02:16:10.010 --> 02:16:10.020 align:start position:0%
commitment you're willing to do the work
 
02:16:13.250 --> 02:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
to get there I totally agree with that
 
02:16:16.310 --> 02:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
um but as it relates to that number that
 
02:16:18.430 --> 02:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
number included a number of things
 
02:16:21.470 --> 02:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
conquered 72 percent of Concord is
 
02:16:24.290 --> 02:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
taxable the rest of it is non-taxable
 
02:16:27.890 --> 02:16:27.900 align:start position:0%
because of non-profits State facilities
 
02:16:31.189 --> 02:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
the next town up has 89 percent of its
 
02:16:33.650 --> 02:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
land taxable so we have a significant
 
02:16:35.990 --> 02:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
issue as it relates to property tax and
 
02:16:38.330 --> 02:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
limiting what that can be raised
 
02:16:39.950 --> 02:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
the other issue is the amount of land
 
02:16:41.629 --> 02:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
that is available that is written in
 
02:16:43.910 --> 02:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
current use or there was a lot of land
 
02:16:45.709 --> 02:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
bought with Federal money in the 60s and
 
02:16:48.049 --> 02:16:48.059 align:start position:0%
70s with Watershed money and limits
 
02:16:51.110 --> 02:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
development so in this number includes a
 
02:16:54.410 --> 02:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
number of things one land acquisition
 
02:16:56.750 --> 02:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
to prepping the land
 
02:16:58.969 --> 02:16:58.979 align:start position:0%
three this building would be electric
 
02:17:02.089 --> 02:17:02.099 align:start position:0%
and also geothermal all those green
 
02:17:04.310 --> 02:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
energy type things are significant
 
02:17:06.530 --> 02:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
dollars these are things that the
 
02:17:08.089 --> 02:17:08.099 align:start position:0%
community said they wanted it also
 
02:17:10.129 --> 02:17:10.139 align:start position:0%
includes a full-size Auditorium to fit
 
02:17:12.049 --> 02:17:12.059 align:start position:0%
every kid in there so in 900 seat
 
02:17:14.690 --> 02:17:14.700 align:start position:0%
Auditorium under State funding you would
 
02:17:16.910 --> 02:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
fund almost half that almost half of
 
02:17:19.370 --> 02:17:19.380 align:start position:0%
that so that would be stuff that the
 
02:17:22.009 --> 02:17:22.019 align:start position:0%
local has to decide do they reduce or do
 
02:17:24.230 --> 02:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
they pick up that cost difference
 
02:17:28.070 --> 02:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
so you also have price escalations so in
 
02:17:29.690 --> 02:17:29.700 align:start position:0%
speaking with our architect they have a
 
02:17:32.570 --> 02:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
project that was quoted bid has started
 
02:17:35.690 --> 02:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
they are now putting the HVAC systems in
 
02:17:38.270 --> 02:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
a year and a half after start 32 million
 
02:17:40.730 --> 02:17:40.740 align:start position:0%
was the number it's 46 It's the final
 
02:17:40.740 --> 02:17:41.990 align:start position:0%
was the number it's 46 It's the final
number

02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:17:45.469 --> 02:17:45.479 align:start position:0%
cost instead of 550 are running 800 a
 
02:17:46.549 --> 02:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
square foot
 
02:17:49.429 --> 02:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
I'm in a way glad that things might
 
02:17:51.290 --> 02:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
tamper down a little bit because it's
 
02:17:53.870 --> 02:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
finding that right time but that is the
 
02:17:55.429 --> 02:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
reason because these prices are coming
 
02:17:57.709 --> 02:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
back significantly higher than we had
 
02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
thought we had when we did this in 2017
 
02:18:03.049 --> 02:18:03.059 align:start position:0%
with the initial visiting session the
 
02:18:05.450 --> 02:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
school was 96 million dollars
 
02:18:09.169 --> 02:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
much more reasonable but now it's okay I
 
02:18:10.849 --> 02:18:10.859 align:start position:0%
hope that answers your question it is
 
02:18:12.770 --> 02:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
just a crazy market and I think these
 
02:18:14.330 --> 02:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
estimators are throwing numbers at it
 
02:18:17.030 --> 02:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
and yes and but we are starting to see
 
02:18:19.070 --> 02:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
some some cracks and I'm going to
 
02:18:20.509 --> 02:18:20.519 align:start position:0%
appreciate the information thank you
 
02:18:21.770 --> 02:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
very welcome
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
so uh a move also you had mentioned
 
02:18:27.110 --> 02:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
about your the debt and I understand the
 
02:18:28.549 --> 02:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
complexities as it relates to the
 
02:18:32.450 --> 02:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
obligations for uh the debt that the
 
02:18:34.610 --> 02:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
state committed to pay for bonds that
 
02:18:37.190 --> 02:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
were done by local uh municipalities and
 
02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
school districts obviously you can't
 
02:18:42.230 --> 02:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
control that but it's really questioning
 
02:18:44.330 --> 02:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
what if they got that money paid early
 
02:18:46.490 --> 02:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
what would that mean I think moving to
 
02:18:48.230 --> 02:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
the column where they borrowed the money
 
02:18:50.810 --> 02:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
in the 1011 budget to fund their
 
02:18:52.849 --> 02:18:52.859 align:start position:0%
obligations is really asking the key
 
02:18:55.429 --> 02:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
questions is what is the call date on
 
02:18:58.190 --> 02:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
that Bond and can it be paid off it may
 
02:19:00.290 --> 02:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
not be worth it if it if the interest
 
02:19:02.629 --> 02:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
rate's very low but I think asking what
 
02:19:04.549 --> 02:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
the call date is and could they is there
 
02:19:07.129 --> 02:19:07.139 align:start position:0%
a penalty for paying it for Concord we
 
02:19:08.629 --> 02:19:08.639 align:start position:0%
took 30-year Bonds on our elementary
 
02:19:11.570 --> 02:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
project the call date was 10 years we
 
02:19:12.950 --> 02:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
hit it right at the right time we
 
02:19:16.610 --> 02:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
refinanced and save 425 000 a year for
 
02:19:19.370 --> 02:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
20 years by refinancing it
 
02:19:21.410 --> 02:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
that may be something to look at too may
 
02:19:23.030 --> 02:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
not be worth taking today's money and
 
02:19:24.770 --> 02:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
paying that off that's part of the
 
02:19:26.270 --> 02:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
things I look at too when you look down
 
02:19:28.250 --> 02:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
the road what's the present value of
 
02:19:30.049 --> 02:19:30.059 align:start position:0%
that money when you look down the road
 
02:19:34.190 --> 02:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
it may not make sense for me some idea
 
02:19:36.830 --> 02:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
might be in a combination of these bills
 
02:19:39.530 --> 02:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
is you're going from an old program as I
 
02:19:41.330 --> 02:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
said was unsustainable representative
 
02:19:42.589 --> 02:19:42.599 align:start position:0%
Heath you had said that it was getting
 
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
higher and higher going up to 30 and
 
02:19:49.250 --> 02:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
20-year commitments uh representative
 
02:19:50.389 --> 02:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned you don't like that
 
02:19:52.370 --> 02:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
but maybe going a little shorter because
 
02:19:54.650 --> 02:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
you're going from one extreme of 20 30
 
02:19:56.570 --> 02:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
years Dental it's paid off in two years
 
02:19:58.190 --> 02:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
for a building that's going to be around
 
02:20:00.050 --> 02:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
for 50 years
 
02:20:01.910 --> 02:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of flexibilities that
 
02:20:03.710 --> 02:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities and school districts have
 
02:20:05.510 --> 02:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
as it relates to bonding and borrowing
 
02:20:08.570 --> 02:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
but maybe amortize it over five years if
 
02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
we took the 17 projects that you have
 
02:20:14.030 --> 02:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
that were approved this year the state's
 
02:20:16.550 --> 02:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
Commitment if everything was eligible as
 
02:20:19.730 --> 02:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
uh as uh Amy Clark had mentioned not
 
02:20:21.410 --> 02:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
every bit of that is eligible so even
 
02:20:24.110 --> 02:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
though for Concord 176 million 40
 
02:20:26.450 --> 02:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
percent is 70 million likely not every
 
02:20:29.389 --> 02:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
bit of that is eligible but for the
 
02:20:31.730 --> 02:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
eligible portion if that all got funded
 
02:20:33.710 --> 02:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
up front and was amortized over five
 
02:20:36.590 --> 02:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
years you could do your 50 million a
 
02:20:38.510 --> 02:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
year and commit the funding and taking
 
02:20:40.809 --> 02:20:40.819 align:start position:0%
care of 17 projects now
 
02:20:43.130 --> 02:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
downside of that is what's available
 
02:20:46.250 --> 02:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
after that so but could this be a test
 
02:20:49.010 --> 02:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
thing to try and do a layered five-year
 
02:20:50.929 --> 02:20:50.939 align:start position:0%
amortization because once you get the
 
02:20:52.550 --> 02:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
five years you've knocked out a bunch
 
02:20:55.130 --> 02:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
every year you're going to have debt
 
02:20:58.070 --> 02:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
expire because that five is done then
 
02:21:00.050 --> 02:21:00.060 align:start position:0%
the next five is done so it would be
 
02:21:01.969 --> 02:21:01.979 align:start position:0%
stacked it's exactly what they do with
 
02:21:03.469 --> 02:21:03.479 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire retirement system as
 
02:21:06.650 --> 02:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
it relates the benefits so it's not a 30
 
02:21:08.690 --> 02:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
year and 20 year obligation but not
 
02:21:10.370 --> 02:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
taking a 50-year beta building and
 
02:21:12.830 --> 02:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
paying it off in two years but maybe
 
02:21:14.809 --> 02:21:14.819 align:start position:0%
doing it in five and again you're
 
02:21:16.730 --> 02:21:16.740 align:start position:0%
locking in at the rates and the
 
02:21:19.070 --> 02:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
commitment of that day you're not paying
 
02:21:21.290 --> 02:21:21.300 align:start position:0%
future obligations because you what
 
02:21:23.270 --> 02:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
you've said is we're going to pay you x
 
02:21:26.090 --> 02:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
amount over the five years states don't
 
02:21:27.950 --> 02:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
pay any interest on that it's just money
 
02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
that's encumbered to be for the future
 
02:21:30.720 --> 02:21:32.210 align:start position:0%
that's encumbered to be for the future
years

02:21:32.210 --> 02:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:21:35.870 --> 02:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
so that's an idea there sorry
 
02:21:37.610 --> 02:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
02:21:40.670 --> 02:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea yeah I I I think it
 
02:21:42.050 --> 02:21:42.060 align:start position:0%
might be able to help
 
02:21:43.910 --> 02:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
um and then going speaking locally what
 
02:21:45.590 --> 02:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
I see we're a little bit different
 
02:21:47.510 --> 02:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
conquered uh as it relates to our school
 
02:21:49.130 --> 02:21:49.140 align:start position:0%
board because it is an autonomous school
 
02:21:50.690 --> 02:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
board and is the only one that has the
 
02:21:52.790 --> 02:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
abilities of that in the state from my
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
understanding so it's a very powerful
 
02:21:57.590 --> 02:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
position but even I'm sure it's no
 
02:21:59.210 --> 02:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
different than the ones that go with
 
02:22:00.950 --> 02:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
their pockets when they go to vote or
 
02:22:03.770 --> 02:22:03.780 align:start position:0%
the nine board members I report to in
 
02:22:05.090 --> 02:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
the end if there's no State commitment
 
02:22:06.650 --> 02:22:06.660 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be able to commit
 
02:22:08.450 --> 02:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
to moving forward it's the biggest thing
 
02:22:10.070 --> 02:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
I hear from my board and I'm sure it's
 
02:22:11.929 --> 02:22:11.939 align:start position:0%
the same thing with voters if they know
 
02:22:13.490 --> 02:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
that state commitment is there to fund
 
02:22:16.429 --> 02:22:16.439 align:start position:0%
it it makes it more palatable I know for
 
02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
us if I get the state's portion I can
 
02:22:21.650 --> 02:22:21.660 align:start position:0%
build this with no additional tax impact
 
02:22:23.410 --> 02:22:23.420 align:start position:0%
to our residents
 
02:22:27.170 --> 02:22:27.180 align:start position:0%
Concord since 2005 has earmarked five
 
02:22:29.870 --> 02:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
percent of its general fund budget
 
02:22:32.630 --> 02:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
or Debt Service it knows it's got seven
 
02:22:34.370 --> 02:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
buildings it knows it's going they're
 
02:22:36.830 --> 02:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
gonna Age and what happens is when we're
 
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
below that we put it into a trust fund
 
02:22:40.849 --> 02:22:40.859 align:start position:0%
that the board oversees when we're above
 
02:22:43.190 --> 02:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
it we draw down on it so we always
 
02:22:45.710 --> 02:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
maintain five percent and the tax impact
 
02:22:48.889 --> 02:22:48.899 align:start position:0%
is not significant so to give you an
 
02:22:48.899 --> 02:22:50.090 align:start position:0%
is not significant so to give you an
idea

02:22:50.090 --> 02:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
idea
 
02:22:52.429 --> 02:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
um if we don't have state aid and I
 
02:22:59.349 --> 02:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:01.969 --> 02:23:01.979 align:start position:0%
767 dollar tax increase in the first
 
02:23:01.979 --> 02:23:02.809 align:start position:0%
767 dollar tax increase in the first
year

02:23:02.809 --> 02:23:02.819 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:23:07.790 --> 02:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
for what for our budget on a 324 000
 
02:23:09.830 --> 02:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
home okay
 
02:23:11.929 --> 02:23:11.939 align:start position:0%
if I have building a
 
02:23:15.710 --> 02:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
it's 411 the first year then when I
 
02:23:17.510 --> 02:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
start applying the 10 and a half million
 
02:23:20.090 --> 02:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
I have saved I can significantly
 
02:23:22.550 --> 02:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
mitigate this I know this school is not
 
02:23:25.010 --> 02:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
going to be 176 million that's why I'm
 
02:23:27.170 --> 02:23:27.180 align:start position:0%
confident I did three elementary schools
 
02:23:29.210 --> 02:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
10 years ago with no additional
 
02:23:31.730 --> 02:23:31.740 align:start position:0%
tax impact and I feel can be done again
 
02:23:33.770 --> 02:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
and I think there's a number of bills
 
02:23:35.750 --> 02:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
here where there's a solution to be able
 
02:23:38.270 --> 02:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
to fund schools and send a message to
 
02:23:40.429 --> 02:23:40.439 align:start position:0%
local to your constituents back home
 
02:23:43.370 --> 02:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
that the state's willing to commit and
 
02:23:45.110 --> 02:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
make it sustainable
 
02:23:45.120 --> 02:23:46.730 align:start position:0%
make it sustainable
so

02:23:46.730 --> 02:23:46.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:50.750 --> 02:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair uh let me start
 
02:23:53.750 --> 02:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
by saying that I really want to commend
 
02:23:55.910 --> 02:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
the concord's approach to taking that
 
02:23:58.070 --> 02:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know five percent and saving it and
 
02:24:00.710 --> 02:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
budgeting for very predictable building
 
02:24:03.050 --> 02:24:03.060 align:start position:0%
expenses yes even in years when they
 
02:24:05.270 --> 02:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
don't have projects frankly I wish more
 
02:24:07.190 --> 02:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
communities would do that and I think at
 
02:24:09.110 --> 02:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
some point the state should discuss ways
 
02:24:11.630 --> 02:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
to uh encourage them to plan accordingly
 
02:24:13.910 --> 02:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
because long range planning no building
 
02:24:16.610 --> 02:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
jumps on you as a surprise those things
 
02:24:18.410 --> 02:24:18.420 align:start position:0%
are there for decades
 
02:24:20.690 --> 02:24:20.700 align:start position:0%
some boards choose to be responsible and
 
02:24:22.790 --> 02:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that some boards choose to
 
02:24:24.650 --> 02:24:24.660 align:start position:0%
wait and see and not spend money today
 
02:24:28.270 --> 02:24:28.280 align:start position:0%
and then they get hit with a huge bill
 
02:24:31.190 --> 02:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
in terms of the your ability to
 
02:24:32.750 --> 02:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
refinance because you had a 10-year
 
02:24:35.929 --> 02:24:35.939 align:start position:0%
option I'm glad that that gamble worked
 
02:24:37.849 --> 02:24:37.859 align:start position:0%
out for you but you did have to pay a
 
02:24:39.710 --> 02:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
higher interest rate when you offer the
 
02:24:42.349 --> 02:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
bonds because that call option causes
 
02:24:44.990 --> 02:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
investors to require a bit more you know
 
02:24:47.750 --> 02:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
interest so every you know it's a good
 
02:24:50.389 --> 02:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
strategy but I think the Bond Bank is
 
02:24:52.969 --> 02:24:52.979 align:start position:0%
taking the no call option to cut costs
 
02:24:55.730 --> 02:24:55.740 align:start position:0%
up front so they are much more
 
02:24:57.230 --> 02:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
challenged in their abilities to
 
02:24:57.240 --> 02:24:58.370 align:start position:0%
challenged in their abilities to
refinance

02:24:58.370 --> 02:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
refinance
 
02:25:00.710 --> 02:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:25:04.190 --> 02:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
oh look at that never mind I lost that
 
02:25:05.929 --> 02:25:05.939 align:start position:0%
train of thought I'll differ right now
 
02:25:07.309 --> 02:25:07.319 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:25:09.590 --> 02:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thank you
 
02:25:12.230 --> 02:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh what I'd like to do is bundle the
 
02:25:14.270 --> 02:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
next these three bills
 
02:25:16.790 --> 02:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
we'll take one vote but you'll the clerk
 
02:25:18.349 --> 02:25:18.359 align:start position:0%
will fill out three different
 
02:25:21.710 --> 02:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
uh voting sheets so that I would look
 
02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
for a motion to retain 332 541 and 546.
 
02:25:28.389 --> 02:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
oh second uh
 
02:25:30.530 --> 02:25:30.540 align:start position:0%
representative Heath and
 
02:25:32.929 --> 02:25:32.939 align:start position:0%
a representative Petrie okay
 
02:25:36.349 --> 02:25:36.359 align:start position:0%
if the clerk would call the roll
 
02:25:39.110 --> 02:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
this would be thank you we are having a
 
02:25:40.969 --> 02:25:40.979 align:start position:0%
motion to retain all three Bills
 
02:25:43.429 --> 02:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
currently under consideration
 
02:25:48.830 --> 02:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:51.349 --> 02:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
representative Bean
 
02:25:55.510 --> 02:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
myself yes representative Buco yes
 
02:25:57.710 --> 02:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
representative Heath
 
02:26:00.710 --> 02:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
representative Murray yes representative
 
02:26:03.590 --> 02:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
Hawkins Phillips yes and chairman
 
02:26:07.250 --> 02:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
emmeric yes emotions pass a to zero
 
02:26:09.230 --> 02:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
again this will be recorded as three
 
02:26:10.910 --> 02:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
separate motions for three separate
 
02:26:13.670 --> 02:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
bills so they are all taken care of
 
02:26:15.590 --> 02:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:16.670 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
well

02:26:16.670 --> 02:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:26:18.830 --> 02:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
it's been a good morning I think I'm a
 
02:26:20.990 --> 02:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
lot smarter than I was when I showed up
 
02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:22.790 align:start position:0%
lot smarter than I was when I showed up
uh

02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:26:25.490 --> 02:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
I don't know when we'll reconvene but at
 
02:26:27.830 --> 02:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
any time if you have ideas we're gonna
 
02:26:29.750 --> 02:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
have to solve this one or at least make
 
02:26:30.950 --> 02:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
an attempt
 
02:26:34.130 --> 02:26:34.140 align:start position:0%
uh I've got to sleep on it a little bit
 
02:26:36.410 --> 02:26:36.420 align:start position:0%
what what I gotta sleep a little bit off
 
02:26:39.650 --> 02:26:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:41.750 --> 02:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
right that would be helpful
 
02:26:46.309 --> 02:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
any ideas just email us as a group yeah
 
02:26:46.319 --> 02:26:51.590 align:start position:0%
any ideas just email us as a group yeah
okay

02:26:51.590 --> 02:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:53.389 --> 02:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
so this came up quite a bit last term
 
02:26:55.250 --> 02:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
and we heard testimony from the treasure
 
02:26:57.170 --> 02:26:57.180 align:start position:0%
that it's not really a feasible option
 
02:26:59.330 --> 02:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
with the bond the bonds on the uh that
 
02:27:01.849 --> 02:27:01.859 align:start position:0%
are issued for that debt
 
02:27:04.670 --> 02:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
okay yes
 
02:27:07.550 --> 02:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
committee with for how thank you
 
02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:08.330 align:start position:0%
committee with for how thank you
um

02:27:08.330 --> 02:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:10.730 --> 02:27:10.740 align:start position:0%
the three sponsors of these bills and a
 
02:27:13.210 --> 02:27:13.220 align:start position:0%
couple of us to see if at least
 
02:27:16.610 --> 02:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
combining things down into one bill
 
02:27:16.620 --> 02:27:17.270 align:start position:0%
combining things down into one bill
um

02:27:17.270 --> 02:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:18.710 --> 02:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
is that we were attaining all three
 
02:27:19.790 --> 02:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to at some point
 
02:27:21.530 --> 02:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
make decisions
 
02:27:24.290 --> 02:27:24.300 align:start position:0%
um on this the elements of the bills
 
02:27:26.690 --> 02:27:26.700 align:start position:0%
that differ from one another and is
 
02:27:29.150 --> 02:27:29.160 align:start position:0%
there a way of having that discussion in
 
02:27:30.889 --> 02:27:30.899 align:start position:0%
terms of what do we want to keep and
 
02:27:32.990 --> 02:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
what should we not keep I really I
 
02:27:35.510 --> 02:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:42.290 --> 02:27:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:43.490 --> 02:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:45.070 align:start position:0%
thank you
right

02:27:45.070 --> 02:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:27:47.330 --> 02:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
so it works just as well to maintain
 
02:27:49.610 --> 02:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
wait until we actually have the money to
 
02:27:51.830 --> 02:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
deal with it I think we have to know how
 
02:27:54.469 --> 02:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
much money how big the stack of bucks
 
02:27:54.479 --> 02:27:55.730 align:start position:0%
much money how big the stack of bucks
are

02:27:55.730 --> 02:27:55.740 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:27:55.740 --> 02:27:58.550 align:start position:0%
are
but

02:27:58.550 --> 02:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:58.560 --> 02:28:02.330 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:28:02.330 --> 02:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:02.340 --> 02:28:03.830 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:28:03.830 --> 02:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:28:05.990 --> 02:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
yeah let's sleep on it because I I want
 
02:28:07.550 --> 02:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
to go back and reread the bills now that
 
02:28:09.469 --> 02:28:09.479 align:start position:0%
I understand what it
 
02:28:11.990 --> 02:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
the program is and I will just remind
 
02:28:13.790 --> 02:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
everyone that you may have touched on
 
02:28:15.050 --> 02:28:15.060 align:start position:0%
this representative Murray you will get
 
02:28:16.250 --> 02:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
a fourth
 
02:28:16.260 --> 02:28:16.910 align:start position:0%
a fourth
um

02:28:16.910 --> 02:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:18.650 --> 02:28:18.660 align:start position:0%
proposal if you will when you do get
 
02:28:20.690 --> 02:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
House Bill one and two so the governor's
 
02:28:22.250 --> 02:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
position on school building a will be in
 
02:28:24.110 --> 02:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
there one way or another whether it's
 
02:28:26.330 --> 02:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
you know along the lines of any of these
 
02:28:28.010 --> 02:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
a different proposal or just leaving the
 
02:28:30.230 --> 02:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
program as it is so that'll just be
 
02:28:32.510 --> 02:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
something else to consider uh in all
 
02:28:34.309 --> 02:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
likelihood whatever this committee's
 
02:28:36.469 --> 02:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
policy the position on school building
 
02:28:38.210 --> 02:28:38.220 align:start position:0%
it'll be House Bill one and two so these
 
02:28:39.410 --> 02:28:39.420 align:start position:0%
bills will
 
02:28:41.690 --> 02:28:41.700 align:start position:0%
you know we can revisit them over the
 
02:28:43.910 --> 02:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
summer they may be uh
 
02:28:45.830 --> 02:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
the point may be moved by then because
 
02:28:46.969 --> 02:28:46.979 align:start position:0%
you may have had something in the budget
 
02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
already passed and you'd it all the
 
02:28:50.690 --> 02:28:50.700 align:start position:0%
bills later but at this point you're
 
02:28:52.490 --> 02:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
keeping the subject matter Alive by
 
02:28:53.990 --> 02:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
retaining them we'll deal with it in the
 
02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:55.130 align:start position:0%
retaining them we'll deal with it in the
budget

02:28:55.130 --> 02:28:55.140 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:28:57.830 --> 02:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
more to follow
 
02:29:00.530 --> 02:29:00.540 align:start position:0%
stay tuned yeah have a good afternoon
 
02:29:00.540 --> 02:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
stay tuned yeah have a good afternoon
all
