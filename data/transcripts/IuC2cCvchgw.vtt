00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody uh welcome to the
 
00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 align:start position:0%
education committee uh today we have uh
 
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 align:start position:0%
a number of bills on the docket here uh
 
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
let me go through and try and explain
 
00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 align:start position:0%
some of the things that we're
 
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
encouraging those that testify to do if
 
00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 align:start position:0%
you hear have heard something that you
 
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
want to say at that's already been said
 
00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 align:start position:0%
or submitted to us in writing um that
 
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 align:start position:0%
that a person has right here and like
 
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
representative Cordell is sitting there
 
00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
testifying right now please don't
 
00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 align:start position:0%
replicate that or duplicate it say just
 
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
I support that so that we you don't have
 
00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
to hear the same thing over and over and
 
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
save some time for the questioning and
 
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
which is then digs down drills down a
 
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 align:start position:0%
little bit more in into the topic from
 
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
the committee to the people speaking
 
00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 align:start position:0%
that will certainly help the way the the
 
00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 align:start position:0%
meetings are held the person who is
 
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
sponsoring the bill the prime sponsor is
 
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 align:start position:0%
given latitude as far as time then I
 
00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
look at the number of pink cards which
 
00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
we're receiving here and we have on a
 
00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 align:start position:0%
number of bills had to put a time limit
 
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
and time limit depending upon it's
 
00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
either three minutes or two minutes
 
00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
based upon the number of cards I receive
 
00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
one of the issues which occurs is that
 
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
we look and see oh there's only five
 
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 align:start position:0%
cards here so we can open that up or or
 
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
maybe 10 cards here we can do that with
 
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
three minutes but all of a sudden during
 
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
the bill a lot lot occurs and we have a
 
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
pile in of another 10 cards then we have
 
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 align:start position:0%
to eliminate down to two two minutes so
 
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 align:start position:0%
please support us on that we're trying
 
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
to get everybody up to testify and we
 
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 align:start position:0%

attorney bond from his office um on on
 
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
this um legislation and what I'd like to
 
00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
do is Step you through it um if I might
 
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
and provide some of the legal
 
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
underpinnings um as we go through
 
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
it so on uh the first page page uh
 
00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 align:start position:0%
section one um this is from the criminal
 
00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 align:start position:0%
statutes right now there are certain um
 
00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:44.439 align:start position:0%
institutions exempt from our obscenity
 
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
laws my change here restricts that
 
00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
exemption just to higher education K12
 
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
education will no longer be exempt from
 
00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
our obscenity
 
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
laws uh um and important thing to note
 
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
here is in talking with the attorney
 
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
general he thought it would be rare and
 
00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 align:start position:0%
would have to be an extreme case for
 
00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479 align:start position:0%
there to be any criminal prosecution of
 
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
anyone um related to this
 
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
legislation the next thing uh is section
 
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
two uh starting on lines basically uh
 
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
which is a new section of
 
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
Law and it relates to the important
 
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
topic of materials that are harmful to
 
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
Miners and that's key phrase harmful to
 
00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
um the point is that that is what we are
 
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
interested in materials that are harmful
 
00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
to miners you know you might hear um or
 
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
have seen things on social media or
 
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 align:start position:0%
outside about banning books and so forth
 
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
that is not the purpose of this
 
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
legislation this is the purpose of this
 
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
legislation is to prohibit materials
 
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
that are harmful to minors in our
 
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
schools so starting on line uh eight on
 
00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
down you'll see a number of
 
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
definitions um including nudity uh
 
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 align:start position:0%
sastic abuse sexual conduct
 
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.350 align:start position:0%
sastic abuse sexual conduct
Etc

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 align:start position:0%
um the next section I want to point out
 
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
on page two starting on line seven is
 
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
the material is harmful to miners
 
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.270 align:start position:0%
the material is harmful to miners
when

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
this items one two and three are taken
 
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
from state law and federal law it dates
 
00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
back to the
 
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
1960s where there was a case uh Ginsburg
 
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 align:start position:0%
versus New
 
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
York and um Sam Ginsburg and his wife
 
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
owned a little lunchonette and they also
 
00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
sold some magazines including what was
 
00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:16.759 align:start position:0%
called girly
 
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
magazines um so uh he ended up
 
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
selling um two of these magazines to a
 
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
16-year-old and was um uh caught doing
 
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
that and prosecuted under New York penal
 
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
law section
 
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
434 which prohibited the selling of um
 
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
girly magazines and materials harmful to
 
00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:50.599 align:start position:0%
miners um under the age of
 
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
17 uh he was found guilty in State Court
 
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
state supreme court and it went to the
 
00:06:59.469 --> 00:06:59.479 align:start position:0%
US Supreme Court and that's Ginsburg
 
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
versus New York is the uh case
 
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
um the Court ruled he was in violation
 
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
law um the Justice again Justice Brennan
 
00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:18.510 align:start position:0%
law um the Justice again Justice Brennan
uh

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
said that well let me step back once
 
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
this is where the concept of variable
 
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
obscenity comes into play variable
 
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
obscenity meaning that something that
 
00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:35.479 align:start position:0%
might not be
 
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
obscene for an adult could be considered
 
00:07:42.869 --> 00:07:42.879 align:start position:0%
obscene for a minor the term they use is
 
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
variable obscenity so Justice Brandon
 
00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:48.879 align:start position:0%
reasoned that the New York State Statute
 
00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
and I quote simply adjust the definition
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
of of obscenity to social realities and
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
serves the state interests in protecting
 
00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
minors so that's the um Ginsburg versus
 
00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
New York case
 
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
and uh this has
 
00:08:11.469 --> 00:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
been these um um purposes that you see
 
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
one through three are in federal statute
 
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
now um 20 USC
 
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.950 align:start position:0%
now um 20 USC
9134

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
9134
 
00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
F7 um this is taken from there um it's
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
also in various States I've read that
 
00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
Most states have language in their laws
 
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
related to materials that are harmful to
 
00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
Miners And this is uh the most common um
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
thread in that regard um item number
 
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:43.519 align:start position:0%
four um is my addition in that it's
 
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to miners to whom the
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
available the next section I wanted to
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
point out is uh a complaint section has
 
00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
been uh added complaint process and
 
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:05.240 align:start position:0%
these are minimum requirements for local
 
00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.550 align:start position:0%
these are minimum requirements for local
complaint

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
processes um complaints can be made by
 
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
parents or Guardians about materials
 
00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:14.839 align:start position:0%
that are available in the schools to
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
their children uh the complaints should
 
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:19.720 align:start position:0%
go up the line from the principal you'll
 
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:22.240 align:start position:0%
see on line
 
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
27 going on up through uh the principal
 
00:09:29.389 --> 00:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
uh if there's um they want to appeal the
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
principal's decision they can go to the
 
00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
school board that's on page three uh
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
section Roman
 
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
6 um they can appeal to the school board
 
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
and then in section seven an agreed
 
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
parent can appeal to the State Board of
 
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
Education um if need
 
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
be so that's the
 
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:55.240 align:start position:0%
minimum complaint process that must be
 
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
in place in local
 
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
districts the next section C is the
 
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement and penalty section
 
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
beginning on line uh 27 on page three
 
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:11.720 align:start position:0%
and this is in the Civil section of our
 
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
statutes so it's possible that a civil
 
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
action could be taken um against the
 
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
school district under two circumstances
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
and that's on lines 31 and
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
32 when the school or school district
 
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:29.720 align:start position:0%
and has not
 
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
uh adhered to this complaint process or
 
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:37.720 align:start position:0%
the material complained about continues
 
00:10:39.629 --> 00:10:39.639 align:start position:0%
to be made available to
 
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
miners after a
 
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
determination pursuant to the above that
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
it should not be available so those are
 
00:10:51.069 --> 00:10:51.079 align:start position:0%
the two uh criteria for a complaint a
 
00:10:51.079 --> 00:10:52.670 align:start position:0%
the two uh criteria for a complaint a
civil

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
civil
 
00:10:55.949 --> 00:10:55.959 align:start position:0%
complaint um the petitioner if
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
successful can be
 
00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
violation and then there is a provision
 
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
also that uh violations can be uh
 
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
considered um a violation of the
 
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
educator code of
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
conduct so
 
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
that very simply hopefully is the
 
00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
legislation and the legal pinnings for
 
00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
this legislation so it's been tested at
 
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
the United States Supreme Court um and
 
00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
in state courts around the nation um
 
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
Georgia Etc i' I've looked at a number
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
of states um legislation in this regard
 
00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
um I'm not going to get into um some of
 
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
the materials that uh might be found in
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
our schools I think maybe there will be
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
others um who will uh talk about that uh
 
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to to talk about uh
 
00:12:03.629 --> 00:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
specifically what the intent of my bill
 
00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:07.839 align:start position:0%
is and the um requirements um that I've
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
included uh in the legislation with that
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:13.519 align:start position:0%
representative cordellia are there
 
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee for the
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative not seeing any thank you
 
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
very oh yes representa whitcock thank
 
00:12:25.389 --> 00:12:25.399 align:start position:0%
you uh ear just a question on the uh
 
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
complaint process um I'm looking at uh
 
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
21 through 30ish on page three two GL U
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
where did that come
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
from the the complaint process um it's a
 
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.069 align:start position:0%
from the the complaint process um it's a
comp

00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
comp
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
comp yes right thank you me m um I need
 
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
some more coffee I guess um from several
 
00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
States process that I looked at um as
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
well as my additions um based on um uh
 
00:12:59.829 --> 00:12:59.839 align:start position:0%
processes here in New Hampshire
 
00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
follow yes thank you so this process is
 
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
not in place anywhere this is just your
 
00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
compulation of stuff right yes thank you
 
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's not a direct pull from any
 
00:13:13.069 --> 00:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
location okay thank you thank you chair
 
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
yeah Ron cordello thank you Mr chair and
 
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and for
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
bringing this uh Bill forward so my
 
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
question relates to on page two where
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
you have uh it's Roman numeral 2 for
 
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
purposes of the subdivision materials
 
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
har to minors when and you give uh Four
 
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
Points there and the first three are as
 
00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
you indicated the they're commonly known
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
as the Miller test so it's been a is
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
that you're taking that um just for my
 
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
actually kind of a two-part question so
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
um is this language taken directly from
 
00:13:49.069 --> 00:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
sort of that Supreme Court
 
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
precedent um it's it's taken from
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
several courses I don't think it's um
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%
directly related to uh it partially
 
00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:00.519 align:start position:0%
related uh I guess to the um Miller
 
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:03.160 align:start position:0%
versus California case you mentioned um
 
00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:06.519 align:start position:0%
a lot of it does come from there but um
 
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
I I looked at that as well as
 
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
specifically the Ginsburg case because
 
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:13.480 align:start position:0%
that was directly related to
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
miners okay and then a follow up because
 
00:14:18.749 --> 00:14:18.759 align:start position:0%
of um part four so the first three are
 
00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:19.839 align:start position:0%
pretty much a
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
standard three-prong test that's been
 
00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
used for decades to standardize
 
00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:27.560 align:start position:0%
definition of obscenity I just was
 
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:29.240 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could clarify a little
 
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
bit the fourth point the material isn't
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to the age of miners just
 
00:14:36.189 --> 00:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
a little Clarity of what you mean it
 
00:14:38.749 --> 00:14:38.759 align:start position:0%
seems a little vague so what you could
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
you elaborate a little on that last
 
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
point right I I think um I wanted to get
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
to the heart of it in
 
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
that the material should be age
 
00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate so that was the reason for
 
00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
my addition there line for um you know
 
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
what might be uh appropriate to a in a a
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
high school uh classroom or made
 
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
available to high school students uh
 
00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
very possibly might not be appropriate
 
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
to uh an elementary school
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
library further questions from the
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
committee he has represent
 
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
bbon thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um when we looked
 
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
at the similar Bill about this last year
 
00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:26.440 align:start position:0%
it was brought up that many districts
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
already have policies to address
 
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
complaints um how is your process
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
different I assume that you've looked at
 
00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of those policies and um why do
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
you feel those policies aren't
 
00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.990 align:start position:0%
you feel those policies aren't
sufficient

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
sufficient
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to lay out what I thought
 
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
was a moment a minimum requirement
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
including the appeal to the State Board
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
which um I don't know um how many um
 
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
local processes
 
00:15:59.550 --> 00:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
have rep representative Tanner
 
00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:04.959 align:start position:0%
thank you um under uh on line 13 on page
 
00:16:07.309 --> 00:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
one the higher education shall mean any
 
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
institution in the University system uh
 
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:12.680 align:start position:0%
and that's the only one that you exempt
 
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
Exempted from the um education Statute
 
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
in the criminal statute of obscenity so
 
00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
any other educational institution any
 
00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
other educational
 
00:16:25.079 --> 00:16:27.150 align:start position:0%
other educational
organization

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:27.160 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
um other than the higher other than the
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
university system uh is subject to this
 
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
bill uh I I think that that definition
 
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
was taken from existing
 
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
statute so should it be
 
00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.189 align:start position:0%
statute so should it be
changed

00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:16:47.069 --> 00:16:47.079 align:start position:0%
I it's it's committee's committee's Bill
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
now is that your intent what did that
 
00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:53.839 align:start position:0%
only the university
 
00:16:56.829 --> 00:16:56.839 align:start position:0%
system and the community college system
 
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you so it
 
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
seems to me that we already have this in
 
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
law um RSA
 
00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
571b is a harmful to minor statute it's
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
not clear to me why we need this
 
00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:25.959 align:start position:0%
bill I I believe that we need something
 
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
uh specifically related to um materials
 
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
that are harmful to miners with
 
00:17:33.549 --> 00:17:33.559 align:start position:0%
everything we've seen going on around
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
the state and around the nation um we
 
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
need to uh tie this
 
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
into um sexualization of children uh I
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
think it's important to uh provide um
 
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
the definitions and the requirements um
 
00:17:53.789 --> 00:17:53.799 align:start position:0%
in terms of what are harmful uh to
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
minors um according to uh the US Supreme
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
Court and many state laws as well so I
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
think that um that is the
 
00:18:08.029 --> 00:18:08.039 align:start position:0%
need follow up thank
 
00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
you I appreciate your concerns and I
 
00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
still think this is duplicative have you
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
read RSA 571b was that considered in the
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
drafting of your proposed legislation I
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
I considered more um um you know what
 
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
has been handed down by
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
by the US Supreme Court and other courts
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
um in uh drafting this and in working
 
00:18:38.149 --> 00:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
general one more we have a lot of people
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
that want to ask questions go ahead it's
 
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:45.880 align:start position:0%
just not clear to me why we would want
 
00:18:49.149 --> 00:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
to create a redundant law so maybe we
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
need to consider that more thank
 
00:18:54.029 --> 00:18:54.039 align:start position:0%
you further questions yes representative
 
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
cascaden thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:58.990 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
question

00:18:58.990 --> 00:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
you uh mentioned that
 
00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:05.240 align:start position:0%
um the purpose of your bill was because
 
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of um specifics going
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
on around the state could you clarify
 
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
for me what is it you're talking about
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
that's going on around the state that is
 
00:19:17.549 --> 00:19:17.559 align:start position:0%
not already covered by Statute um I I
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
think that um we've uh read about many
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
instances of uh um uh materials being in
 
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
uh School libraries and in tools um that
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh are objectionable to parents because
 
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
of the nature of the
 
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
materials so I think that's why this
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
necessary representa Tanner so before
 
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
you stated that this wasn't a ban book
 
00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
uh problem uh and now you're talking
 
00:19:51.909 --> 00:19:51.919 align:start position:0%
about that it's it's in school libraries
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
and of course libraries have their own
 
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
um regulations and and methods of
 
00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
reviewing books and and that sort of
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
thing so um I just wanted to follow up
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
is it a band book is it a band Book uh
 
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
bill or not it is
 
00:20:11.149 --> 00:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
not uh very simply it's not um School
 
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
libraries I'm not sure about what
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
regulations you're talking about that
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
school libraries have but I think school
 
00:20:20.669 --> 00:20:20.679 align:start position:0%
libraries should uh comply with the law
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
when it comes to making materials
 
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
minors further questions represent co
 
00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:30.909 align:start position:0%
minors further questions represent co
question

00:20:30.909 --> 00:20:30.919 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
short I just want to go back to um only
 
00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
after your response on line uh 15 of
 
00:20:38.909 --> 00:20:38.919 align:start position:0%
page two when you're talking about
 
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
inappropriate um the age of the minus
 
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
how is that
 
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
determined how is the appropriateness
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
and age determined it doesn't tell you
 
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
there right um who makes that decision I
 
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
I I think that's part of the process um
 
00:20:59.310 --> 00:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
throughout the complaint process um you
 
00:21:01.549 --> 00:21:01.559 align:start position:0%
know there is we talked about that with
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office and um
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
felt that this was uh sufficient um uh
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
there is you know one state um that I
 
00:21:14.029 --> 00:21:14.039 align:start position:0%
know of I believe it's Oklahoma that has
 
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
um um layered um in terms of uh General
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
Provisions more specific POS Pro
 
00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
Provisions as to um age requirements uh
 
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
sort of like a um movie uh rating system
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
um but that is the only one that I know
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
of um that uh goes beyond um something
 
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.149 align:start position:0%
of um that uh goes beyond um something
like

00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
this yes so there is
 
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
no rating system here so it says the the
 
00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
material is that that's it's the one
 
00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
part that you inserted you said it was
 
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
yours but it doesn't tell you anything
 
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
about how you determine what is age
 
00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:54.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate to
 
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
minor um that's all I did there's no
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
there's no way to determine that
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
I think I I think that uh age
 
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
appropriateness um is to be determined
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
um by the uh school and the State Board
 
00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
um and the courts if if need
 
00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
be thank you thank you sh I do have a
 
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:19.640 align:start position:0%
question so I'd like to follow up where
 
00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
I'm putting my uh trustee hat on for the
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
University system now and asking why do
 
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
we have higher education in this bill at
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
all when we're talking about
 
00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
professional employees of a school
 
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
district we're saying at the end of the
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
bill that you're we're referencing the
 
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
code of ethics which is not applicable
 
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
to uh the noncertified professionals
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
from professors at the University in
 
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
Community College I understand Community
 
00:22:52.669 --> 00:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
College may have dual concurrent rment
 
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
and may be dealing minors but would you
 
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
recommend that we strike out higher
 
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
education from this
 
00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.470 align:start position:0%
education from this
bill

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:23:06.029 --> 00:23:06.039 align:start position:0%
um I left right now it just says
 
00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
education is exempt from the exended
 
00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:13.039 align:start position:0%
laws so I left it I wanted to remove K12
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
from that so I left higher education in
 
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
there um I did not want to get into the
 
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
discussion about uh you know medical
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
school possibly uh providing something
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
that someone might consider um
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh obscene or uh legal um a law school
 
00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:37.480 align:start position:0%
um who would be examining cases and
 
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
looking at testimony and looking at
 
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
materials from prior cases that might um
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
raise questions about whether um there
 
00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:49.400 align:start position:0%
was obscene material involved in the um
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
law review of
 
00:23:53.789 --> 00:23:53.799 align:start position:0%
materials so I you know
 
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
if if someone thinks um you know higher
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
ed should not be exempt either um you
 
00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
know we we certainly can have that
 
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
discussion thank you further question
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
representa Tanner thank you um I'm I'm
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
wondering on page I'm looking at page
 
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%
two the um the enforcement and penalties
 
00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
and um I'm we I can't remember an
 
00:24:20.549 --> 00:24:20.559 align:start position:0%
education bill that we've passed that
 
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
has a set fee of like $1,000 minimum and
 
00:24:29.389 --> 00:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
who collects those fees and do they go
 
00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:34.360 align:start position:0%
and also um isn't that an incentive for
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
false accusations to come
 
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
through I I don't believe it is because
 
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
there are um uh criteria laid out um on
 
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
lines 32 and 33 as to um what would be
 
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.070 align:start position:0%
 
complaint

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
quickly so are we prescribing to to the
 
00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
courts or are we giving the Department
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
of Education the ability to assess a
 
00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:07.559 align:start position:0%
fine of not less than $1,000 it's the
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
courts this a civil section this is the
 
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
court we're telling the courts what they
 
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:25:18.269 --> 00:25:18.279 align:start position:0%
do I I think u in our legal statutes
 
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
you'll see uh uh Provisions made out to
 
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh amounts of fines um jail terms Etc so
 
00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
I don't see that this is any different
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
than what is done in law uh throughout
 
00:25:31.789 --> 00:25:31.799 align:start position:0%
the country isn't that criminal law
 
00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
though not in all cases
 
00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:38.039 align:start position:0%
no okay let's I'd like to move on we
 
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
have 15 cards here represent B Bon do
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
have one last aching question go
 
00:25:47.549 --> 00:25:47.559 align:start position:0%
ahead thank and thank you for taking my
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
question um I just have it's not really
 
00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:52.120 align:start position:0%
spelled out in here but obviously in
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
health education um there's descriptions
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
of sexual education and some of these
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
terms that you use in here um pictures
 
00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
and descriptions can be used to describe
 
00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
sexual intercourse and um contact and
 
00:26:10.909 --> 00:26:10.919 align:start position:0%
questions come up during those
 
00:26:10.919 --> 00:26:12.430 align:start position:0%
questions come up during those
discussions

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
um they couldn't be
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted um and I I think with the
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
our statutes related to uh sexual
 
00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
education parents can uh also uh opt
 
00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799 align:start position:0%
their children out of some of those
 
00:26:26.799 --> 00:26:29.549 align:start position:0%
their children out of some of those
lessons

00:26:29.549 --> 00:26:29.559 align:start position:0%
lessons
 
00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
questions I I know but we will have a
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
chance to do that during exec session as
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%

thank
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
you on the def representative Cardel on
 
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
the definitions on page one yes um those
 
00:26:51.909 --> 00:26:51.919 align:start position:0%
came from some other place those came
 
00:26:54.909 --> 00:26:54.919 align:start position:0%
from um the uh New York penal law that
 
00:26:57.549 --> 00:26:57.559 align:start position:0%
was upheld by okay so I'm looking at se
 
00:26:59.909 --> 00:26:59.919 align:start position:0%
ual conduct and I read through it
 
00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
quickly and I should have read through
 
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:04.120 align:start position:0%
it more clearly would this impact some
 
00:27:07.029 --> 00:27:07.039 align:start position:0%
of our our cheering squads some of our
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
dance squads some of those programs some
 
00:27:10.269 --> 00:27:10.279 align:start position:0%
of those teachers that teach
 
00:27:11.909 --> 00:27:11.919 align:start position:0%
choreography that teaches different
 
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
theater and plays I'm I'm I'm I'm
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
visioning some of the acts that you're
 
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
talking about here and thinking back on
 
00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:21.320 align:start position:0%
even looking at last week's uh drum line
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh at the school so would that would
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
that fall into this category Shing
 
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
theater I've never seen cheerleading at
 
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:32.440 align:start position:0%
any football game that I've attended or
 
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
basketball game that would uh fall under
 
00:27:37.029 --> 00:27:37.039 align:start position:0%
this sexual conduct you've never seen
 
00:27:39.389 --> 00:27:39.399 align:start position:0%
that gyration or anything uh you you you
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
must be going to a Baptist school okay I
 
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%

I have to run back to work um and I will
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
do my best to keep it uh as close to two
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
as possible um my name is Michael Strand
 
00:28:24.029 --> 00:28:24.039 align:start position:0%
I'm a Bedford resident and town
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
counselor um speaking for myself only
 
00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.070 align:start position:0%
counselor um speaking for myself only
today

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
um and most importantly I am the dad of
 
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
a 10-year-old girl in uh Bedford public
 
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:35.320 align:start position:0%
schools I'm here to testify against this
 
00:28:37.389 --> 00:28:37.399 align:start position:0%
fill because I have serious concerns
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
about the real intent and the Practical
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
inability to enforce it should it become
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
law in addition I believe it would cause
 
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
serious long-term delerious consequences
 
00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:49.480 align:start position:0%
both intended and unintended on our
 
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
school system and most importantly our
 
00:28:53.549 --> 00:28:53.559 align:start position:0%
kids ability to learn and think for
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
themselves free of government overreach
 
00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.389 align:start position:0%
themselves free of government overreach
and

00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:56.399 --> 00:28:57.990 align:start position:0%
and
control

00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
quick story uh in 1938 my
 
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
great-grandmother uh left Slovakia in
 
00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:05.919 align:start position:0%
the Far Eastern edge of Europe next to
 
00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:08.360 align:start position:0%
Ukraine she was eight months pregnant
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
she got out before Hitler invaded um she
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
was by herself she didn't speak a word
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
of English and her first job was
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
sweeping the stairs of the Empire State
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
Building uh my paternal grandfather was
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
in Pearl Harbor and once spent two days
 
00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
in the open water before he was
 
00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
rescued our grandparents didn't fight
 
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
against f reg
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
regimes so that our children could go to
 
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
school in a country that makes it easier
 
00:29:34.029 --> 00:29:34.039 align:start position:0%
to ban
 
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
books however well intended this bill
 
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
may be however we might all agree there
 
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
are some things we may not want our kids
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
to see at certain ages it's up to us as
 
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:44.120 align:start position:0%
parents to know what our kids are
 
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
reading not to impose our personal
 
00:29:48.909 --> 00:29:48.919 align:start position:0%
family or religious values on a whole
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
class or school or District or in this
 
00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
case a whole state and let's be honest
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is not about protecting my
 
00:29:57.549 --> 00:29:57.559 align:start position:0%
10-year-old from pornography in her
 
00:29:59.630 --> 00:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
fourth grade elementary school library
 
00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
because there's nothing even remotely
 
00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:03.919 align:start position:0%
objectionable in that Library I've been
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
there even if there were there are
 
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
already suitable mechanisms for
 
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
librarians parents teachers principles
 
00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
to curate the curriculum in age
 
00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:14.799 align:start position:0%
appropriate ways based on the needs of
 
00:30:17.509 --> 00:30:17.519 align:start position:0%
their local districts and populations I
 
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
know this because they already do
 
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
it this bill in my opinion I believe is
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
about censoring and curating High School
 
00:30:27.389 --> 00:30:27.399 align:start position:0%
curriculum to fit a political agenda
 
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
kids are far past the Age of Reason
 
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
should have open access to information
 
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
in order to learn how to think
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
critically they should be exposed to
 
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
information outside of their comfort
 
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
zone they should be challenged they
 
00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:39.559 align:start position:0%
should question because real learning is
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
controversial freedom is controversial
 
00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:43.480 align:start position:0%
there's no other
 
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
way to the committee I would ask you
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
when will we stop wasting time and
 
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:49.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars on culture wars which I
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
believe this is connected to and I know
 
00:30:54.509 --> 00:30:54.519 align:start position:0%
I have to wrap up here um there's some
 
00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:56.039 align:start position:0%
language in here that I wanted to focus
 
00:30:57.909 --> 00:30:57.919 align:start position:0%
on quickly and
 
00:31:00.629 --> 00:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
uh you can kick me out um I have
 
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:02.440 align:start position:0%
concerns that may perhaps there might be
 
00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
some questions for you and you can
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
integrate that into your responses can I
 
00:31:08.629 --> 00:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
just make one comment about the
 
00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
escalation piece of it uh uh biggest
 
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
concern is that this undermines local
 
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
control uh for locally elected school
 
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
board members and districts um the uh
 
00:31:21.389 --> 00:31:21.399 align:start position:0%
Clause that mentions app parent Guardian
 
00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
May appeal the local Schoolboard
 
00:31:24.389 --> 00:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
decision to the State Board of Education
 
00:31:25.629 --> 00:31:25.639 align:start position:0%
is problematic and that's the most
 
00:31:27.789 --> 00:31:27.799 align:start position:0%
important thing I wanted to share today
 
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't think we should be
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
willing to relinquish any risk of you
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
know losing local control um it should
 
00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:36.200 align:start position:0%
be up to Local District uh local
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
principles and you know not designed to
 
00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
intentionally create an environment of
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
fear and censorship where parents or
 
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
politicians with minority viewpoints
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
might be able um to escalate this if
 
00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
they're motivated by special interests
 
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
and override local Authority by you know
 
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
appealing to the school board and part
 
00:31:54.909 --> 00:31:54.919 align:start position:0%
of the reason for that um is I believe
 
00:31:57.149 --> 00:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
that our school board itself uh or the
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
the board of education at the state
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
level um is compromised politicized and
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
biased um thank you if that's in your
 
00:32:06.909 --> 00:32:06.919 align:start position:0%
written testimony could you submit that
 
00:32:08.629 --> 00:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
that will be placed in the record I'm
 
00:32:10.269 --> 00:32:10.279 align:start position:0%
going to have to cut you off right now
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
and and totally totally inter will you
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
accept questions yeah of course
 
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
representa thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question two you at
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
one point referred to book Banning and I
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
know that term will come up a lot today
 
00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
you also mentioned your ancestors and
 
00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
some which brings up sort of historical
 
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
precedent historically book
 
00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
Banning is when a book is prohibited
 
00:32:40.269 --> 00:32:40.279 align:start position:0%
like no one can get it sure it's not
 
00:32:41.909 --> 00:32:41.919 align:start position:0%
published it's not available anywhere
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
children adults that's historically what
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
book Banning is sure so considering that
 
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
this bill is just calling for uh
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
prohibiting a vulnerable age group from
 
00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:01.480 align:start position:0%
seeing material that can objectively be
 
00:33:06.509 --> 00:33:06.519 align:start position:0%
judged as harmful to them uh how exactly
 
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
is this a book ban because I think it
 
00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:11.720 align:start position:0%
creates a mechanism where you can
 
00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
escalate this to uh you know the uh the
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
Board of Education you know and and
 
00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:20.360 align:start position:0%
again back to you know my prior Point um
 
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
you know no intent to politicize here
 
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
but right now we have a board of
 
00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
education where um the V uh you know the
 
00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
Vice chair of the Republican Party sits
 
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
on the board of education that's a
 
00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:33.519 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest um we have a very
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
nice intelligent man from my own town
 
00:33:36.669 --> 00:33:36.679 align:start position:0%
who sits on the board of education but
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
he also runs a conservative talk radio
 
00:33:40.909 --> 00:33:40.919 align:start position:0%
show and has had to recuse himself from
 
00:33:42.669 --> 00:33:42.679 align:start position:0%
votes before because he actually was
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
connected to or invested in a company
 
00:33:47.549 --> 00:33:47.559 align:start position:0%
receiving a you know a public contract
 
00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:49.480 align:start position:0%
from the state uh that's a conflict of
 
00:33:51.549 --> 00:33:51.559 align:start position:0%
interests and you know even the chairman
 
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
of the board of education is a man who
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh no knock to him or his choices but he
 
00:33:58.990 --> 00:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
homeschooled all five of his children
 
00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:01.559 align:start position:0%
for personal religious reasons so he now
 
00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
gets a potentially tiebreaking vote on
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
what material is age appropriate
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
acceptable objectionable or offensive
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
for my daughter I mean I I don't think
 
00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
so that doesn't work further questions
 
00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative leus and
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
then representa
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
Damon you had mentioned that you thought
 
00:34:25.629 --> 00:34:25.639 align:start position:0%
determining what that it was up to the
 
00:34:28.349 --> 00:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
parents to determine what a child sees
 
00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
or doesn't see and I'm wondering how the
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
parents can do that when their child is
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
sent off to school for many hours during
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
the day how does the parent know
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
everything that is in that school
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
library or that classroom yeah I think
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
it requires a level of public trust in
 
00:34:53.669 --> 00:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
Educators in Librarians that actually
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
have to get a you can't even do with a
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree it requires a master's
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
of Library science in many cases there
 
00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:02.200 align:start position:0%
are mechanisms for book selection um you
 
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
know I did this in college uh is a a
 
00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
quick side example and it was one of the
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
more challenging experience I had and I
 
00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:09.640 align:start position:0%
know we're not talking about college um
 
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:12.200 align:start position:0%
I I interned at this you know sort of
 
00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
radical small alternative press magazine
 
00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
um and this is you know pre me too
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
movement pre you know some of uh the
 
00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
vocalization of you know a need for um
 
00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:25.960 align:start position:0%
LBGTQ representation equal rights and I
 
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
had to objectively choose books um
 
00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
that were challenging for me you know
 
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
and didn't necessarily align with my
 
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
experiences or um you know or ideas that
 
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
I had never even had or values that I
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
potentially had but that was uh that was
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
a good challenge for me as a young
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
person to understand that just because I
 
00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
may not agree with a certain perspective
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
or lifestyle or have a personal
 
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
experience that you know those voices
 
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
still deserve to be heard and I think
 
00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
that this bill whether intentionally or
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
not you know with respect to
 
00:36:02.309 --> 00:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli I think it uh
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
you know really threatens to undermine
 
00:36:07.069 --> 00:36:07.079 align:start position:0%
um you know the sort of open society and
 
00:36:08.829 --> 00:36:08.839 align:start position:0%
and you know open critical thinking and
 
00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
and learning that uh is the Bedrock of
 
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
our democracy so I I don't don't mean to
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
be dramatic but I think the long-term
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
consequences of this could be severe in
 
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know unamerican frankly in my
 
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
opinion represent representative Damon
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
then represent
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
being here and bringing in your personal
 
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
family history to the reasons why you
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill could you give us a
 
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
little more of you referenced that you
 
00:36:41.109 --> 00:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
had some specific concerns about the
 
00:36:42.309 --> 00:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
language in the bill could you speak
 
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
more to that um
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
sure briefly out of respect to the other
 
00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
folks here um so you know uh you I just
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
had a couple pull quotes here from the
 
00:36:55.309 --> 00:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
language uh quote material lack serious
 
00:36:57.069 --> 00:36:57.079 align:start position:0%
literary scientific Medical Art artistic
 
00:36:59.550 --> 00:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
or political value for miners um who
 
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
decides serious what objective system of
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
measurement could be used to determine
 
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
the seriousness of value when talking
 
00:37:07.309 --> 00:37:07.319 align:start position:0%
about literature or politics um I was an
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
English major um you know I think uh you
 
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:12.280 align:start position:0%
know maybe not in high school but I
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
guess I don't know if I'm allowed to ask
 
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
questions I had a question potentially
 
00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
for representative cordelli um you know
 
00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:21.400 align:start position:0%
I'm curious if uh if representative
 
00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:23.720 align:start position:0%
cordelli thinks that you can't you can't
 
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
I I'm sorry that so um you know Alan
 
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
Ginsburg I heard a Ginsburg reference
 
00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
here um Alan ginsburg's famous famous
 
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
poem how uh went through many trials and
 
00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:38.079 align:start position:0%
tribulations in terms of banning
 
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's a meaningful important
 
00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:43.160 align:start position:0%
poem that's part of American history
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
that uh does intentionally use vulgarity
 
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh rhetorically uh to you know to elicit
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
a response from the reader and it's
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with mental health issues and
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
issues of systemic homophobia at that
 
00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
time uh when gay people were openly
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
oppressed um this is important from a
 
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
civil rights perspective and an artistic
 
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
perspective and that that's just one
 
00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
more extreme example but I think we
 
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
could find many more by Walt
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
Whitman what are we what are we not
 
00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
going to teach thank you thank you
 
00:38:13.599 --> 00:38:16.069 align:start position:0%
going to teach thank you thank you
represent

00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
belshire thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony um you've you've
 
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
just testified that um what you've
 
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:25.720 align:start position:0%
deemed to be true learning can only
 
00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:28.280 align:start position:0%
occur when children are made to be
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable can you provide any
 
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
specific examples of how children in
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
your District are purposely made to be
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable and how that's a positive
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
thing for their learning sure it's a
 
00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
fair question um again this is where I
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
think we have to trust uh Educators and
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
professionals and I don't you I don't
 
00:38:46.109 --> 00:38:46.119 align:start position:0%
know that it's fair to say we're
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
intentionally making kids uncomfortable
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
um and this is also again where we get
 
00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
back to what's age appropriate and that
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
should be determined locally um you know
 
00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
I'll give you a perfect example um you
 
00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
know in in our town and I'm not on the
 
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
school board I'm not really that
 
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
involved my again my you know my kiddo
 
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:04.280 align:start position:0%
is in elementary school so I don't know
 
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
what you know filling the library of the
 
00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
high school and you know I paid a little
 
00:39:11.309 --> 00:39:11.319 align:start position:0%
more attention lately because um there's
 
00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
been you know supposed controversy over
 
00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
it um and you know we had a gentleman
 
00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:18.280 align:start position:0%
who was protesting at a municipal
 
00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:21.640 align:start position:0%
election with uh you know a pull quote
 
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
from a book um that you know made that
 
00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
book look like it was you know
 
00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
gratuitous vulgarity um you know the
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
board had actually I think the local
 
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
school board had already adjudicated on
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
this with input from parents in the
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
local community and you know the context
 
00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:38.550 align:start position:0%
local community and you know the context
was

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
completely um you know manipulated uh
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
for the sake of that and and only the
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
vulgar content was put on a billboard
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
where children who probably shouldn't
 
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
have been reading that had to see it
 
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
because it was from the high school you
 
00:39:54.109 --> 00:39:54.119 align:start position:0%
know so I don't know that it's about
 
00:39:55.309 --> 00:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
intentionally making anybody
 
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable but I think that in open
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
dialogue especially in you know uh in
 
00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:03.880 align:start position:0%
study of the arts and history and
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
government and uh in literature um you
 
00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.069 align:start position:0%
government and uh in literature um you
know

00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:08.079 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:40:10.829 --> 00:40:10.839 align:start position:0%
healthy challenging conversations and
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
dialogue and dialectical learning is
 
00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
going to happen um I don't know that
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
we're forcing it or
 
00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
should thank you if I may just in a
 
00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
brief followup does that then mean that
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
you would retract your specific
 
00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
statement that the true learning can
 
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
only occur when enforced outside of
 
00:40:29.309 --> 00:40:29.319 align:start position:0%
their comfort zone I think it depends on
 
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
the context I mean that's a broad brush
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
but uh you know I think again depending
 
00:40:38.309 --> 00:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
upon age and content um it's healthy to
 
00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
be exposed to things that are different
 
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
than what we're used to and I think it
 
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
may be especially relevant in New
 
00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire further
 
00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
questions represent have you asked one
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
of I did that's I'd like to move on
 
00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
please uh representative ner thank you
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:05.069 --> 00:41:05.079 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and members of
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm representative ner and
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
I'm here because I wanted to be on
 
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
record supporting this bill because when
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
we know that something is inherently
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
wrong and we do nothing to try to stop
 
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
it then we too are at fault and I
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
believe wholeheartedly that letting
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
Little Children See perverse material
 
00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
is it's just just disgusting and it it's
 
00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
it's wrong and we should not allow it
 
00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
thank you and that's it thank you thank
 
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
you questions thank you very much
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative uh I'd like to call
 
00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
abar State Rep yeah thank you Mr
 
00:41:59.870 --> 00:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.349 align:start position:0%
 
b

00:42:10.349 --> 00:42:10.359 align:start position:0%
b
 
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
o did you hear the yes yes we did what
 
00:42:17.069 --> 00:42:17.079 align:start position:0%
we are here today to discuss is a step
 
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
along a path it is a step that is at the
 
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
same time regrettable as regrettable as
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
necessary the responsibility of parents
 
00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
is to determine how best to create
 
00:42:30.119 --> 00:42:32.470 align:start position:0%
is to determine how best to create
future

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
adults what we are doing this morning is
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
we are discussing a way to protect the
 
00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.470 align:start position:0%
we are discussing a way to protect the
Next

00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
Next
 
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
Generation here are the questions before
 
00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
you today why are we placing in schools
 
00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
materials that are considered harassment
 
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
if they were in the
 
00:42:54.589 --> 00:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
workplace why are we not providing the
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
same protection to children in our
 
00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
schools that we provide employees in our
 
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
workplaces does that make
 
00:43:08.109 --> 00:43:08.119 align:start position:0%
sense I think not enough is enough House
 
00:43:08.119 --> 00:43:09.230 align:start position:0%
sense I think not enough is enough House
Bill

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
1419 takes a stand it is regrettable
 
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
that it is
 
00:43:17.349 --> 00:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
necessary but it is time to deal with a
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
situation that is undercutting our
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
principles and our values if we wish to
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
continue the American uh dream if we
 
00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
intend to this to have this country uh
 
00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
move forward into the future with the
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
prosperity that we have been able to
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
develop in the past we need to protect
 
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
our future
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
generation the do nothing alternative is
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
just simply irresponsible we've reached
 
00:43:54.349 --> 00:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
a place where we have in our schools an
 
00:43:59.230 --> 00:43:59.240 align:start position:0%
open uh rep repository for material that
 
00:44:02.109 --> 00:44:02.119 align:start position:0%
is uh ethically
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
morally questionable and we need to do
 
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
something to put up some guide
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
rails quibbling about how we do
 
00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:13.720 align:start position:0%
it may be
 
00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate but we need to take some
 
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
kind of action if this committee
 
00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't do it last
 
00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:24.079 align:start position:0%
year what's to what reassurance do you
 
00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
provide the the public that you'll deal
 
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
with it in the F in the future in the
 
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
present you have a bill before you if
 
00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
you don't like what's in
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
it say what's wrong with it Mark it up
 
00:44:41.549 --> 00:44:41.559 align:start position:0%
and move
 
00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:43.960 align:start position:0%
forward that's all I have to say Mr
 
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:45.440 align:start position:0%

Paige

00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:36.069 --> 00:45:36.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and good morning
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
everyone good morning um I'm here today
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
to oppose the bill I would however like
 
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.030 align:start position:0%
to oppose the bill I would however like
to

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:45:46.549 --> 00:45:46.559 align:start position:0%
begin um by expressing support for part
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
of what the sponsor is trying to do
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
because I do agree with the sponsor
 
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
about one thing which is that parents
 
00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
and Guardians deserve a clear and
 
00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
transparent process for raising obje
 
00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
ction this is already the case in the
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
vast majority of districts who have
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
policies in place but I agree with the
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor that something needs to be done
 
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
about that and I think we can do
 
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
something about that and I've been
 
00:46:07.069 --> 00:46:07.079 align:start position:0%
trying to work on that issue on a
 
00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:09.400 align:start position:0%
bipartisan basis this
 
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
year the bill before us today though I
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
have a lot of issues with um and I want
 
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
to touch on Four Points here that that
 
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
are problematic for me the first is the
 
00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
vagueness in the way that we're defining
 
00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:25.160 align:start position:0%
materials harmful to miners the second
 
00:46:26.549 --> 00:46:26.559 align:start position:0%
is the impact
 
00:46:26.559 --> 00:46:27.670 align:start position:0%
is the impact
on

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
students the third is the procedure
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
itself which I think is impracticable
 
00:46:35.549 --> 00:46:35.559 align:start position:0%
for many schools in districts and the
 
00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:37.480 align:start position:0%
appeal process which a prior speaker
 
00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
touched on so I'll try to stay very
 
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
brief on that
 
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
point so to the point of the vagueness
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
of our definitions here I think I'd like
 
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
everyone to just do a quick silent
 
00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.109 align:start position:0%
everyone to just do a quick silent
thought

00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
thought
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
exercise which is to
 
00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:56.680 align:start position:0%
imagine what material for you personally
 
00:46:58.990 --> 00:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
you think crosses the line into being
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
harmful for minors imagining something
 
00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
that just crosses over the line for a
 
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
seven-year-old now imagine what does
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
that material look like for a
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
12-year-old now imagine what does that
 
00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:14.200 align:start position:0%
material look like for a
 
00:47:16.349 --> 00:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
17-year-old and I can guarantee you a
 
00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:19.079 align:start position:0%
couple things if we all do that one is
 
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
that we would all agree that there are
 
00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
certain materials that would be wildly
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
inappropriate they're not there right
 
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have pornography being
 
00:47:29.549 --> 00:47:29.559 align:start position:0%
distributed in school we all would agree
 
00:47:29.559 --> 00:47:30.630 align:start position:0%
distributed in school we all would agree
that's

00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
inappropriate something else I think we
 
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
could I can guarantee is that each of us
 
00:47:39.309 --> 00:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
would have put that line somewhere a
 
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
little bit different depending on what
 
00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
age group we're talking about depending
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
on who we are what our individual Family
 
00:47:45.599 --> 00:47:46.630 align:start position:0%
on who we are what our individual Family
Values

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
Values
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
are and the reason I I ask everyone to
 
00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
think through it this way is Imagine The
 
00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:55.720 align:start position:0%
Impossible position we are putting an ed
 
00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:00.200 align:start position:0%
educator in and trying to draw that line
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
based on our widely differing
 
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
interpretations of exactly where it
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
falls we are putting them in an
 
00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:09.109 align:start position:0%
falls we are putting them in an
impossible

00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
00:48:12.829 --> 00:48:12.839 align:start position:0%
position I'd also note that our trained
 
00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
professionals who are making these
 
00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
selection decisions are doing this very
 
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
thing themselves already right they are
 
00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
trying to determine what is appropriate
 
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
for the children that they serve in
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
so I think this vagueness is problematic
 
00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
both for the Educators on the ground I
 
00:48:35.069 --> 00:48:35.079 align:start position:0%
think it also guarantees as we've seen
 
00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
in other states this is going to be a
 
00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
long drawn out litigation process if it
 
00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
were to pass this is what we're seeing
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
happen in other places like Arkansas
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
your your time is time is up we gave you
 
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
three minutes oh okay all right I'm I'm
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
sorry I guess I would I would then just
 
00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
um I'll I'll submit some written
 
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
testimony after the fact and I would
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
just um stress the point that we are
 
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
going to be putting Educators in a
 
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
position where they are trying to
 
00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
operate within a Safe Harbor and not
 
00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:07.960 align:start position:0%
taking risks and the students who are
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
going to be disserved by that are some
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
of our most vulnerable students
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
including lgbtq kids including children
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
who have faced um sexual trauma and
 
00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
violence and that a lot of the materials
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
that are being targeted are materials
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
that can help them as they navigate
 
00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0%
those things in their lives thank you
 
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
very much are you willing to take any
 
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
questions sure any questions from the
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
committee representative Tanner thank
 
00:49:34.109 --> 00:49:34.119 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony could you explain
 
00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
a little bit um since you're actually uh
 
00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:39.160 align:start position:0%
making a clear policy on how to work
 
00:49:41.549 --> 00:49:41.559 align:start position:0%
through this um you said procedure was
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
one of your issues could you explain a
 
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
little bit more on that certainly yes I
 
00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:47.839 align:start position:0%
think um I appreciate the sponsor's
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
intent of trying to of guarantee a swift
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
resolution I think that goal is laudable
 
00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:55.720 align:start position:0%
but I think on the ground it will be
 
00:49:58.270 --> 00:49:58.280 align:start position:0%
very difficult to implement um in many
 
00:50:00.589 --> 00:50:00.599 align:start position:0%
districts you you assemble a committee
 
00:50:02.109 --> 00:50:02.119 align:start position:0%
that might include a parent it might
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
include your school librarian a relevant
 
00:50:06.109 --> 00:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
subject area teacher maybe even a
 
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
student to review the material and you
 
00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
have to review the work as a whole right
 
00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
the Miller test says you know the work
 
00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
considered as a whole has no literary
 
00:50:18.349 --> 00:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
value its primary purpose is to appeal
 
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
to aan interest right so you need to
 
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
analyze the work as a whole that whole
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
committee would need to read through the
 
00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
material right so I think it's not
 
00:50:29.069 --> 00:50:29.079 align:start position:0%
practical the deadlines that have been
 
00:50:30.789 --> 00:50:30.799 align:start position:0%
set and districts will need more
 
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
flexibility I'd also note that we're
 
00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
having uh in New Hampshire we're seeing
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
more and more of people coming forward
 
00:50:39.549 --> 00:50:39.559 align:start position:0%
with multiple complaints at once so a
 
00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
parent might come in with a list of 20
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
books and it's just not workable to
 
00:50:47.309 --> 00:50:47.319 align:start position:0%
provide the thoughtful analysis of each
 
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
of those 20 titles that is needed on the
 
00:50:51.069 --> 00:50:51.079 align:start position:0%
timelines provided I applaud the goal of
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
be you know trying to be responsive to
 
00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:56.680 align:start position:0%
the complaint in a timely fashion but I
 
00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
think the specific stringent uh and
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
inflexible uh timelines that are here
 
00:51:02.789 --> 00:51:02.799 align:start position:0%
are just not
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
workable thank you very much further
 
00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:07.960 align:start position:0%
represent Woodcock thank you chairman L
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
paig welcome good to see you thank you
 
00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:13.880 align:start position:0%
um you you sound as you're presenting as
 
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
you have a background in this you have a
 
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
background in in uh books or Banning or
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
or evaluation I I work with I work with
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
Librarians a lot
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank further
 
00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Hall thank
 
00:51:31.549 --> 00:51:31.559 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:51:34.109 --> 00:51:34.119 align:start position:0%
question one of your categories was
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
appeal process you concerns can you just
 
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
speak a little bit about that sure so
 
00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
the way I see this is on the one hand
 
00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
we're we're saying that we're making
 
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
this determination based on prevailing
 
00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:47.480 align:start position:0%
Community standards right that's how
 
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
we're determining what's harmful to
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
miners is prevailing Community standards
 
00:51:54.109 --> 00:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
on the other hand we're saying when a
 
00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
local school board Mak makes that
 
00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
determination a school board that's
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
accountable to their local community and
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
the people who elected them who can be
 
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
removed if people don't like the way
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
they're they're voting on these
 
00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
things we're taking that that power away
 
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
and giving it to unelected bureaucrats
 
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
to say we disagree with your local
 
00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
decision about what your prevailing
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
Community standards are I see that as
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
extremely problematic I also see it as
 
00:52:21.789 --> 00:52:21.799 align:start position:0%
problematic that this would be
 
00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
determined not in a court of law I mean
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
typically when we're talking about obs
 
00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:26.559 align:start position:0%
we're talking about IL legal
 
00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
determination I I find it I find that
 
00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
piece of this bill particularly
 
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
problematic thank you fur the questions
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
from the committee thank you very much
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um I have a
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
card here just take on the order they

boards do you want to speak now or do
 
00:52:46.789 --> 00:52:46.799 align:start position:0%
you have you don't take a position I I

00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:18.839 align:start position:0%
single parent of an autistic child
 
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
living in Seabrook New Hampshire I met
 
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
Tabitha several months ago because of
 
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:26.200 align:start position:0%
the numerous problems her son was
 
00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
experiencing in public school one of the
 
00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
first things I do is try to figure out
 
00:53:32.349 --> 00:53:32.359 align:start position:0%
how to keep a student in their local
 
00:53:34.829 --> 00:53:34.839 align:start position:0%
public school Tabitha said her son once
 
00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
loved his school but she could see that
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
he was beginning to hate it I attended a
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
virtual IEP meeting with another parent
 
00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:43.720 align:start position:0%
advocate New Hampshire to make sure that
 
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
the school Personnel working with
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
Tabitha's son were following some of the
 
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
procedures that apply to autistic
 
00:53:51.789 --> 00:53:51.799 align:start position:0%
children there were some problems that
 
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
were occurring with some of the school
 
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
personnel which she believed caused her
 
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
son to act out in an inappropriate way a
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
once happy autistic child started to
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
change his behavior after starting
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
school in the fall Tabitha explained how
 
00:54:06.190 --> 00:54:06.200 align:start position:0%
her son in sixth grade told her that he
 
00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:08.839 align:start position:0%
was shown sexual images and exposed to
 
00:54:08.839 --> 00:54:09.870 align:start position:0%
was shown sexual images and exposed to
sexual

00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
sexual
 
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
language she began looking into what was
 
00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
available to him on the Chromebook and
 
00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
found the Sora app the library app the
 
00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
school supply students contains
 
00:54:19.789 --> 00:54:19.799 align:start position:0%
pornographic books that are not
 
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:24.079 --> 00:54:26.829 align:start position:0%
 
ES

00:54:26.829 --> 00:54:26.839 align:start position:0%
ES
 
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
autistic child can be a bit of a
 
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
challenge but Tabitha was able to figure
 
00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
out that something was seriously wrong
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
she even filed a report with the
 
00:54:36.349 --> 00:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the local police as a
 
00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
single parent of an autistic child she
 
00:54:40.750 --> 00:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
made sure that anything that was able he
 
00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
was able to access at home did not
 
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
include this kind of obscenity autistic
 
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
parents know that this kind of x-rated
 
00:54:50.789 --> 00:54:50.799 align:start position:0%
material could cause behavior problems
 
00:54:52.349 --> 00:54:52.359 align:start position:0%
that they do not want to have to deal
 
00:54:55.069 --> 00:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
with and yet here he was using sexual I
 
00:54:56.589 --> 00:54:56.599 align:start position:0%
and highly inappropriate language in
 
00:54:59.390 --> 00:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
school towards his teachers then this
 
00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:01.960 align:start position:0%
resulted in punishments towards him
 
00:55:04.109 --> 00:55:04.119 align:start position:0%
Tabitha feels that the district making
 
00:55:05.829 --> 00:55:05.839 align:start position:0%
these books available to her child
 
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
helped create behavior problems how do
 
00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
you trust adults working with special
 
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
needs students who make obscene
 
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
materials available to
 
00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:16.280 align:start position:0%
children she felt her rights were
 
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
violated Under Disability civil rights
 
00:55:21.309 --> 00:55:21.319 align:start position:0%
and idea this all caused his behaviors
 
00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:23.720 align:start position:0%
to worsen she felt it gave them the
 
00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
ability to punish him
 
00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:27.400 align:start position:0%
she felt she had no other choice but to
 
00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:30.200 align:start position:0%
homeschool her son to keep him safe and
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
provide a better education for him how
 
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
many other children have acted out based
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
on highly sexualized content and
 
00:55:39.549 --> 00:55:39.559 align:start position:0%
pictures that have been made available
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
to them a child who acts out but lacks
 
00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
the ability to control their behavior
 
00:55:46.789 --> 00:55:46.799 align:start position:0%
like other children he was not only
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
punished but had to leave his public
 
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
school if you care about supporting
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
public education children with special
 
00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:55.559 align:start position:0%
needs and other children
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
then you don't provide these kinds of
 
00:56:00.549 --> 00:56:00.559 align:start position:0%
materials obscene and pornographic as
 
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
I've reported to this Committee in the
 
00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
past parents need to understand that
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
books that simp that they simply do not
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
like cannot be removed from the school
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
library it's too subjective however when
 
00:56:15.069 --> 00:56:15.079 align:start position:0%
a book or any materials cross over to
 
00:56:17.789 --> 00:56:17.799 align:start position:0%
obscenities it is considered child
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse here three minutes is up
 
00:56:23.829 --> 00:56:23.839 align:start position:0%
one more statement stopit now.org is

committed to stopping sexual abuse of
 
00:56:27.549 --> 00:56:27.559 align:start position:0%
children on their website it says
 
00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:30.240 align:start position:0%

not have something read right there for
 
00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:45.160 align:start position:0%
B we can we can read that um are there
 
00:56:49.589 --> 00:56:49.599 align:start position:0%

you good morning good morning thank you
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my name is Megan
 
00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
Tuttle president na New Hampshire
 
00:57:25.349 --> 00:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
representing about 17,000 educ across
 
00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
the state now we'll keep this short here
 
00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
today to express our opposition to House
 
00:57:33.029 --> 00:57:33.039 align:start position:0%
Bill 1419 which really just amounts to
 
00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
another attempt at eliminating unnamed
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
books from our public schools by using
 
00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
vague standards accompanied by a process
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
that's difficult to piece together
 
00:57:42.589 --> 00:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
potentially very harmful to an educator
 
00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:44.200 align:start position:0%
that's caught in the middle of
 
00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
this as it was brought up before it's
 
00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:49.559 align:start position:0%
unclear to us why we need this bill
 
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
since we have an objectionable material
 
00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
statute that already lays out a process
 
00:57:55.470 --> 00:57:55.480 align:start position:0%
for exempting a student from material
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
that a parent objects to their student
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
viewing so what sorts of books and
 
00:58:00.109 --> 00:58:00.119 align:start position:0%
materials does this for hose Bill
 
00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:01.640 align:start position:0%
language capture that the current
 
00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
statute is not it does provide specific
 
00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
definitions at the beginning but then it
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
becomes vague contains very subjective
 
00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:10.799 align:start position:0%
standards for example under the
 
00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:13.880 align:start position:0%
definition harmful to minors what does
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
the phrase patently offensive to
 
00:58:18.109 --> 00:58:18.119 align:start position:0%
prevailing standards in the adult
 
00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:19.839 align:start position:0%
community with respect to what is
 
00:58:22.029 --> 00:58:22.039 align:start position:0%
suitable for minors mean the entire
 
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
sentence is difficult to assess
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
especially from the stand point of the
 
00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:28.280 align:start position:0%
educator um that has to adjudicate the
 
00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
law so who decides who decides what the
 
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
prevailing standard is which Adult
 
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
Community is the bill referring to
 
00:58:36.309 --> 00:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
anyone reading the news on a daily basis
 
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
can probably surmise that we lack any
 
00:58:40.589 --> 00:58:40.599 align:start position:0%
kind of cohesive Adult Community who
 
00:58:42.430 --> 00:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
could arrive at an agreement as to what
 
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
is offensive is this the adult community
 
00:58:46.829 --> 00:58:46.839 align:start position:0%
who thinks books about gay relationships
 
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
are offensive or the adult community who
 
00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
does not this is hardly an objective
 
00:58:52.349 --> 00:58:52.359 align:start position:0%
standard by which to
 
00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
operate in today's climate we cannot
 
00:58:56.789 --> 00:58:56.799 align:start position:0%
seem to agree as an adult community what
 
00:58:58.710 --> 00:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
material holds serious literary or
 
00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:01.799 align:start position:0%
scientific value with such a subjetive
 
00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
subjective excuse me set of standards as
 
00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
is laid out in the subdivision under
 
00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:07.400 align:start position:0%
paragraph 2 this will be a difficult
 
00:59:08.910 --> 00:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
Bill to interpret or
 
00:59:11.349 --> 00:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
enforce this lastly leads me to our
 
00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
concerns regarding the complaint process
 
00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
that's laid out in the
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
bill the legislation calls for each
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
local school board to adopt a complaint
 
00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
resolution uh policy but it's quite
 
00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:23.720 align:start position:0%
prescriptive and ends with the State
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
Board making the final determination on
 
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
what is harmful it lays the first
 
00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
decision on the school principal or
 
00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:30.680 align:start position:0%
their designate as to whether the
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
material meets the vague and subjective
 
00:59:34.349 --> 00:59:34.359 align:start position:0%
standards outlined earlier in the bill
 
00:59:35.789 --> 00:59:35.799 align:start position:0%
and whether it should be removed or
 
00:59:37.870 --> 00:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
restricted that determination could mean
 
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
that one parent's assessment of a
 
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
particular book leads to no other
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
student being able to assess that work
 
00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:44.839 align:start position:0%
access that work excuse me the appeal
 
00:59:47.029 --> 00:59:47.039 align:start position:0%
process of a particular uh leads to the
 
00:59:48.789 --> 00:59:48.799 align:start position:0%
local school board and then to the state
 
00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
board at the point a determination is
 
00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
appealed to the State Board are they
 
00:59:54.750 --> 00:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
determining whether the local school
 
00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:55.589 align:start position:0%
determining whether the local school
board

00:59:55.589 --> 00:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
followed the process correctly or are
 
00:59:59.670 --> 00:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
they making a decision on a case-by
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
casee basis as to whether certain works
 
01:00:03.029 --> 01:00:03.039 align:start position:0%
are allowable under the statute for
 
01:00:05.829 --> 01:00:05.839 align:start position:0%
conceivably all students to the state so
 
01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
we're left wondering what the bill
 
01:00:08.549 --> 01:00:08.559 align:start position:0%
accomplishes be beyond the current
 
01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
objectionable materials law other than
 
01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
to let one subjective interpretation of
 
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
its vague standards affect access access
 
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
to school material that allows other
 
01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
students of freedom to learn and so for
 
01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
these reasons we're respectfully asking
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
the house education committee to find
 
01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:23.839 align:start position:0%
house on the money House Bill 1419 and
 
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
expedience 18 years in the
 
01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
classroom thank you very much I do have
 
01:00:30.829 --> 01:00:30.839 align:start position:0%
a written testimony that has some more
 
01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
to hand down are there any questions yes
 
01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:35.190 align:start position:0%
to hand down are there any questions yes
represent

01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
leus when it comes to the objectionable
 
01:00:40.029 --> 01:00:40.039 align:start position:0%
material and thanks for taking my
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
question by the way when it comes to
 
01:00:43.789 --> 01:00:43.799 align:start position:0%
objectional material which you talked
 
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
about schools have to post and publish
 
01:00:49.789 --> 01:00:49.799 align:start position:0%
that my question is how will parents
 
01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:53.000 align:start position:0%
know what books are in their Library
 
01:00:55.789 --> 01:00:55.799 align:start position:0%
since in lots of schools they can't go
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
in and peruse the school library so how
 
01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:01.240 align:start position:0%
are you suggesting that parents know
 
01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:03.400 align:start position:0%
that thank for the question there's lots
 
01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
of ways that parents can be involved in
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
their child's education they can contact
 
01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
the school librarian if they hear that
 
01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
something's in there that they don't
 
01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:11.480 align:start position:0%
like if they see it on an app that their
 
01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
child might have I know there's apps out
 
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
there for libraries you know for schools
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
across the state if they see something
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
they can contact the
 
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
school I think it's easy to get in touch
 
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
with the school I have three children of
 
01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
my own I'm in contact with the school
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
they're they're teachers they're
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
Administration all the
 
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
time thank you thank
 
01:01:32.309 --> 01:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
you yes um wouldn't that be after the
 
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
child has already seen the material how
 
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
does the parent know beforehand so that
 
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
the child doesn't see the
 
01:01:40.510 --> 01:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
material thank you for the question I I
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
still think there's other ways that they
 
01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:43.160 align:start position:0%
can do it if they're hearing things in
 
01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
the community before their child I mean
 
01:01:46.829 --> 01:01:46.839 align:start position:0%
this this isn't a I don't see this as a
 
01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:49.480 align:start position:0%
silent issue where parents don't have
 
01:01:51.069 --> 01:01:51.079 align:start position:0%
any idea what's going on in their in
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
their children's schools I think
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
something that is considered or might be
 
01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
considered objectionable is probably
 
01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
being talked about whether a child has
 
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
checked out the book or not or seen it
 
01:02:03.789 --> 01:02:03.799 align:start position:0%
on an app and I think there's lots of
 
01:02:05.069 --> 01:02:05.079 align:start position:0%
ways you can be in contact with the
 
01:02:07.069 --> 01:02:07.079 align:start position:0%
schools the schools are open for parents
 
01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
to contact them with questions concerns
 
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
lots of things like that thank you
 
01:02:15.069 --> 01:02:15.079 align:start position:0%
welome thank you representative dry
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
question um I wanted to talk about um
 
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
the appeal to the State Board of
 
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
Education um it talks about the appeal
 
01:02:26.029 --> 01:02:26.039 align:start position:0%
of the local School Board decision so
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
that would be the decision between the
 
01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
parent and the school board which is um
 
01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:34.760 align:start position:0%
the that's the purview of the State
 
01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
Board to hear appeals and issue
 
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
decisions about disputes between
 
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
individuals and school systems so I
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
think that there wouldn't you agree that
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
maybe this is talking about that
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
particular ruling and the decision of
 
01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
that particular parent thank you for the
 
01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
question I think it could yes okay thank
 
01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
you thank you re represent Damon or was
 
01:02:59.430 --> 01:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
it represent Hall yeah okay thank you Mr
 
01:03:00.589 --> 01:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
question do you know if most or how many
 
01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
school libraries have their Library C
 
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
it's online you can just go in and see
 
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
what books they have uh thank you for
 
01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
the question I do not know the exact
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
number that have that um I could I would
 
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
assume and again this is just an
 
01:03:17.069 --> 01:03:17.079 align:start position:0%
assumption without looking at all of
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
them that with technology that we have
 
01:03:20.829 --> 01:03:20.839 align:start position:0%
today that's a pretty fair assumption
 
01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
that you would be able to see the
 
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
materials that are in there but again I
 
01:03:25.309 --> 01:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
can't say that for every single school
 
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
right okay thank you thank you very much
 
01:03:29.269 --> 01:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner thank you just to
 
01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:32.200 align:start position:0%
clarify the earlier question about the
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
uh appeal to the state school board is
 
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
the state school board making a decision
 
01:03:39.789 --> 01:03:39.799 align:start position:0%
on that the local school board did not
 
01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
follow the proper procedure and give the
 
01:03:44.109 --> 01:03:44.119 align:start position:0%
parent the ability to go through that
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
procedure or are they deciding whether
 
01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:49.960 align:start position:0%
the material itself is objectionable or
 
01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
not thank you for the question that was
 
01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.269 align:start position:0%
not thank you for the question that was
my

01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.279 align:start position:0%

good morning Nancy Beerman um I'm here
 
01:04:43.789 --> 01:04:43.799 align:start position:0%
to uh speak in support of this bill um
 
01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
as a parent who has actually um brought
 
01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:49.240 align:start position:0%
um questions and concerns about a book
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
that was brought into the
 
01:04:53.349 --> 01:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
curriculum uh for our school district
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
about 5 years ago
 
01:04:59.190 --> 01:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
and uh was um not really heard by her
 
01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
school board and brought up fact after
 
01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
fact that the school board did not
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
follow policy it was not brought in
 
01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
front of the curriculum committee um the
 
01:05:09.549 --> 01:05:09.559 align:start position:0%
two administrators who actually uh
 
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
proposed the book uh only read the first
 
01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
two chapters never read the entire book
 
01:05:18.069 --> 01:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
which I find uh horrific as an educator
 
01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
um and um no my child did not read this
 
01:05:25.069 --> 01:05:25.079 align:start position:0%
book and um and the school district and
 
01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:27.640 align:start position:0%
the board still did not take the book
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
out of uh the school and the curriculum
 
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
and have it reviewed and uh looked at
 
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
like it was supposed to according to its
 
01:05:37.269 --> 01:05:37.279 align:start position:0%
policies so all of you that say there
 
01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
are policies in place yeah there's
 
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
policies but they choose not to follow
 
01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
them so that is a big problem
 
01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
um I've been an educator for 15 years
 
01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
I've taught K to8 uh grade levels there
 
01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:55.160 align:start position:0%
has never been an instance where I felt
 
01:05:58.109 --> 01:05:58.119 align:start position:0%
like I needed to have a book that
 
01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
contained graphic uh descriptions or
 
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
materials in the classroom at all um I
 
01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
don't know where this push is that we
 
01:06:08.309 --> 01:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
need to have this material in the
 
01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
classroom um I would never choose to
 
01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:13.839 align:start position:0%
have it um when students would have
 
01:06:16.549 --> 01:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
questions um I knew where the line was
 
01:06:18.269 --> 01:06:18.279 align:start position:0%
and today's Educators don't seem to know
 
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
where the line is anymore um I knew that
 
01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
if a child asked a question and I felt
 
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
like that was definitely a parents
 
01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
opinion and Viewpoint I would say you
 
01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
know that's a question for your mom and
 
01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
dad and that's not a question that I'm
 
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
going to answer in the classroom today
 
01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
and then I would we would move on to
 
01:06:38.269 --> 01:06:38.279 align:start position:0%
another topic I don't understand why
 
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
teachers feel like they have to answer
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
every question a child asks and then
 
01:06:44.109 --> 01:06:44.119 align:start position:0%
again if that question I would
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
definitely call the parents and tell
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
them you know hey your child had this
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
question today in school I think you
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
need to have a discussion about this I
 
01:06:53.230 --> 01:06:53.240 align:start position:0%
knew my place and I knew that I should
 
01:06:55.069 --> 01:06:55.079 align:start position:0%
not step over that that line and
 
01:06:58.069 --> 01:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
interfere with a child and a parents
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
beliefs and um opinions and ideas and
 
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
kids never knew what my opinion belief
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
and ideas were and I taught us
 
01:07:09.269 --> 01:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
government for many years so they did
 
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
not know it um as far as um the teachers
 
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh Union saying that objectional
 
01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
material that parents would know about
 
01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
it before and we don't there have been
 
01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
many incidences where teachers have
 
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
shown stuff and parents find out after
 
01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
the fact so the kids have already been
 
01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
exposed to this material and the damage
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
has already been done and this is what
 
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
we need to stop I don't know why this
 
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
even has to be a bill because I would
 
01:07:36.029 --> 01:07:36.039 align:start position:0%
think that teachers would know and
 
01:07:38.069 --> 01:07:38.079 align:start position:0%
Educators would know that this does not
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
need to be there and Librarians should
 
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
know that this should not be in the
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
schools your your time is up thank you
 
01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:46.520 align:start position:0%

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:47.630 align:start position:0%
you're welcome are there questions from
the

committee see thank you very
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning thank you for
 
01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:12.279 align:start position:0%
your time today um I am here on behalf
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire school
 
01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
administrators Association Equity
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
committee to oppose HB
 
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
1419 um I'd like to say that I am Dr
 
01:08:24.269 --> 01:08:24.279 align:start position:0%
Sydney leot um I am here on on behalf of
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
the equity committee but I'd also like
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
to say that I am a 25-year U Public
 
01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
School educator I have been a teacher a
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
principal I have been a director of
 
01:08:36.669 --> 01:08:36.679 align:start position:0%
curriculum instruction and assessment
 
01:08:38.749 --> 01:08:38.759 align:start position:0%
and for the last seven years I've been a
 
01:08:41.229 --> 01:08:41.239 align:start position:0%
superintendent I also will add that I
 
01:08:42.669 --> 01:08:42.679 align:start position:0%
have three wonderful children who have
 
01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
gone through New Hampshire
 
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
schools hb1 1419 raises very significant
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
concerns particularly in the context of
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
Education the primary reasons for my
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
objection are the dangerous slippery
 
01:08:57.709 --> 01:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
slope of curriculum bands um and I also
 
01:08:59.590 --> 01:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
am concerned because there seems to be a
 
01:09:01.309 --> 01:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
conflation between curriculum and
 
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
library and I hope that the committee
 
01:09:06.110 --> 01:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
considers that those are not the same
 
01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
thing um there are potentially negative
 
01:09:10.510 --> 01:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
side effects on students in need and
 
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
once again the inclusion of conduct
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
violations and threats of firing
 
01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
teachers is not going to help New
 
01:09:18.749 --> 01:09:18.759 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students or New Hampshire
 
01:09:21.070 --> 01:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
Educators I find this bill to be
 
01:09:23.229 --> 01:09:23.239 align:start position:0%
redundant uh because we already have
 
01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
systems laws regulations and policies in
 
01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
place as many people have already stated
 
01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:31.799 align:start position:0%
here that uh deal with objectionable
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
materials teachers and curriculum
 
01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
experts are trained to select materials
 
01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:38.759 align:start position:0%
that follow curriculum standards and
 
01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
meet the developmental needs of their
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
Learners there is absolutely no need to
 
01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
start uh add new language in any law
 
01:09:48.510 --> 01:09:48.520 align:start position:0%
that promotes outright banss on
 
01:09:50.749 --> 01:09:50.759 align:start position:0%
curriculum or books because we already
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
have processes in place to take care of
 
01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:54.709 align:start position:0%
have processes in place to take care of
these

01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:09:57.149 --> 01:09:57.159 align:start position:0%
issues this kind of a law is a
 
01:09:59.350 --> 01:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
significant overstep in enforcing and
 
01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
imposing specific values on Educators
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
families kids and Schools teachers
 
01:10:07.229 --> 01:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
already restrict and allow curriculum
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
materials through a process then they
 
01:10:12.430 --> 01:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
are trained experts to do just
 
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
that it is clear that this is another
 
01:10:17.149 --> 01:10:17.159 align:start position:0%
attempt on Banning anything in schools
 
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
potentially related to sexuality and
 
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
gender identity a Target against the
 
01:10:24.189 --> 01:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
lgbtq community
 
01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
and I really want to remind this
 
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
committee that those are protected
 
01:10:29.070 --> 01:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
classes under the
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
law um this is also language that comes
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
from other states this bill is largely
 
01:10:37.149 --> 01:10:37.159 align:start position:0%
language that comes from other states
 
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
this is not a New Hampshire problem I
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
can tell you that in about the 25 years
 
01:10:43.630 --> 01:10:43.640 align:start position:0%
I've been an educator I can think of
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
possibly two examples where we went
 
01:10:48.189 --> 01:10:48.199 align:start position:0%
through an objectionable materials
 
01:10:50.910 --> 01:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
process the process was handled well and
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
I would argue that the Educators and the
 
01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
parents both walked away feeling good
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
about the dialogue and the conversation
 
01:10:59.790 --> 01:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
that happened throughout the
 
01:11:02.350 --> 01:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
process this will add another chilling
 
01:11:04.990 --> 01:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
factor that makes Educators feel unsure
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
uneasy and concerned about their
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
jobs it is difficult to hire teachers
 
01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
are ready more leaving the profession
 
01:11:13.390 --> 01:11:13.400 align:start position:0%
and the ones who are currently in
 
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
schools feel that their jobs and their
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
licenses are more on the line than ever
 
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
can you can you wrap it up you've just
 
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
gone by three minutes
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely um I just want to get to the
 
01:11:24.910 --> 01:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
the special the effect on students and
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
then I'll I'll absolutely stop and take
 
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
questions um students do need to have
 
01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
access to information and that is a law
 
01:11:36.790 --> 01:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
and I really worry about how this bill
 
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
would affect our school counselors our
 
01:11:40.990 --> 01:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
School nurses or anybody else um who
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
might be working with a student in need
 
01:11:46.510 --> 01:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
who could be potentially having issues
 
01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse they need a trusted adult
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
to help them this really puts into play
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of um barriers for students
 
01:11:56.350 --> 01:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
getting the help that they need I urge
 
01:11:57.950 --> 01:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
you to reconsider the implications of
 
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
hb1 1419 largely it is redundant thank
 
01:12:03.070 --> 01:12:03.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you and I'll be happy to take
 
01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
questions you have written comment could
 
01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
you please submit that so we can get
 
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
that into the record represent Cordell
 
01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you it's a
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
question I asked before because you also
 
01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
have brought up the term Book Banning uh
 
01:12:18.430 --> 01:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you use the exact phrase
 
01:12:20.350 --> 01:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
but THS were in there curriculum Banning
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
Banning of books and it seems that this
 
01:12:26.830 --> 01:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
term has the definition seems to be
 
01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
changing because historically it meant
 
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
the book would not be available to
 
01:12:32.629 --> 01:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
anyone it would be prohibited and the
 
01:12:34.110 --> 01:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
only way to obtain it would be through
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
some sort of Black Market
 
01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
underground um so given
 
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
this idea of book Banning as it's
 
01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
traditionally been known um how do you
 
01:12:46.510 --> 01:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
see this as a ban where it's just being
 
01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh Pro prohibit to one vulnerable group
 
01:12:51.709 --> 01:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
who may clearly be harmed by the
 
01:12:54.990 --> 01:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
material mostly because uh and this is
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
where I think there's a completion
 
01:12:58.510 --> 01:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
between curriculum laws regulation
 
01:13:00.270 --> 01:13:00.280 align:start position:0%
policies and libraries because in
 
01:13:01.709 --> 01:13:01.719 align:start position:0%
libraries which I think is what you're
 
01:13:05.070 --> 01:13:05.080 align:start position:0%
talking about right um is that students
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
still have an access still have a right
 
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
to access information so this is an
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
infringement on First Amendment rights
 
01:13:13.229 --> 01:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
for students and when you are
 
01:13:15.709 --> 01:13:15.719 align:start position:0%
prohibiting something specifically
 
01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
prohibiting a book it is book Banning
 
01:13:18.990 --> 01:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's in a school or whether it's
 
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
for the larger public it's the same
 
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
thing thank you further questions from
 
01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
not seeing thank you very much thank
 
01:13:39.629 --> 01:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:42.430 --> 01:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
besset morning everybody um there's been
 
01:13:44.110 --> 01:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
a lot said already and I'm not going to
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
repeat what other people have said I
 
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
want to tell you two very brief stories
 
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
so that you can connect my name is
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
Michael bassette I'm the assistant
 
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
superintendent of the karge Regional
 
01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
School District but I'm a former
 
01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
educator in the classroom I spent uh
 
01:13:57.550 --> 01:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
about eight years teaching biology at uh
 
01:13:59.790 --> 01:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
sixth seventh and eth grade levels okay
 
01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
and I taught in New York I'm also the
 
01:14:02.709 --> 01:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
New York State first class teacher of
 
01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
the year okay so that was my first year
 
01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
teaching um I want to tell you a brief
 
01:14:08.229 --> 01:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
story about that experience in my first
 
01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:10.280 align:start position:0%
year because interestingly enough it has
 
01:14:12.629 --> 01:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
application to this um I was teaching
 
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
biology I was teaching a course to
 
01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
seventh grade students it was relevant
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
to the topic of the value of human life
 
01:14:20.709 --> 01:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
and I was actually teaching a multi-part
 
01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
unit in which I was comparing the value
 
01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
of human Life by having children explore
 
01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
the concept through cognitive dissonance
 
01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
that people have and that's that that
 
01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
conversation I think that represented
 
01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
vure was describing about having to
 
01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:35.960 align:start position:0%
learn in in a situation in which that
 
01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
that jux toos between two realities
 
01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
exists um I was teaching seventh graders
 
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
that different people have different
 
01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
values of human life and that was a
 
01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
shock to them and this is in
 
01:14:49.149 --> 01:14:49.159 align:start position:0%
1993 okay where I was having this
 
01:14:50.709 --> 01:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
conversation and I put it out on the
 
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
table for them that uh Insurance Company
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
for example value by uh you know their
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
Actuarial costs and all the associated
 
01:14:58.750 --> 01:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
things that are assigned to that if you
 
01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
melt down a human body sounds pretty
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
gross but I'm a biology teacher you take
 
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
all those elements down you take down
 
01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
you take the mineral content that actual
 
01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
H value has a value assigned to it and
 
01:15:10.110 --> 01:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
so that explored process of looking at
 
01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
different types of perspectives and
 
01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
viewpoints allowed me to have a a moment
 
01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
with children to be able to explain to
 
01:15:17.709 --> 01:15:17.719 align:start position:0%
them that different purposes and
 
01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
different subjective viewpoints do
 
01:15:21.629 --> 01:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
matter they make a difference on all of
 
01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
the ways that we experience the world
 
01:15:24.629 --> 01:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
around them that's
 
01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
1993 okay it's a strange situation when
 
01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:30.280 align:start position:0%
I actually agree with representative
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
cordelli at no offense sir but the
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
honest answer is I actually agree with
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
the concept of keeping Kids Safe in
 
01:15:38.990 --> 01:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
schools as a school principal for 16
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
years in grades fourth through sixth
 
01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
grade I worked with students in an age
 
01:15:45.669 --> 01:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
group that's particularly vulnerable in
 
01:15:48.590 --> 01:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
that regard and I can tell you firsthand
 
01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
that I had experiences with parents many
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
experiences with parents one primary
 
01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
story sticks out in my mind in which I
 
01:15:58.590 --> 01:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
had to literally take out and send out
 
01:16:00.669 --> 01:16:00.679 align:start position:0%
Communications to the school and a very
 
01:16:02.629 --> 01:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
wealthy affluent Community it for the
 
01:16:04.030 --> 01:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
most part in terms of the hackington
 
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
school district I had to send
 
01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:09.080 align:start position:0%
notification to parents including at
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
that time the students in that school
 
01:16:13.629 --> 01:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
the governor of the state of New
 
01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire information telling them that
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
motion picture video guidelines for
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
video games which included at the time a
 
01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
rash of kids bringing in information
 
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
about Grand Theft Auto in which
 
01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
prostitutes are beaten to death for
 
01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
points I had to explain to parents that
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
those types of video games that were in
 
01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
the hands of their fourth grade students
 
01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:39.270 align:start position:0%
the hands of their fourth grade students
was

01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
inappropriate so I take offense at the
 
01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
terminology of people saying that
 
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
Educators out there aren't on the
 
01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
defensive trying to protect students
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
from unhealthy or unsafe situations we
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
do it on a daily basis where I take
 
01:16:53.790 --> 01:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
offense in this this particular
 
01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
legislation is all around the removal of
 
01:16:59.310 --> 01:16:59.320 align:start position:0%
the local standard representative
 
01:17:01.629 --> 01:17:01.639 align:start position:0%
cordelli touts the fact that that Miller
 
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
versus uh California was a standard
 
01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
that's 1972 by the way in case you
 
01:17:08.189 --> 01:17:08.199 align:start position:0%
didn't know that particular fact you
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
just ran out of time well and may I may
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
I up for questions sir I appreciate
 
01:17:15.709 --> 01:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
you're an intermediate level principal
 
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
too at one time I was also and well are
 
01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:21.990 align:start position:0%
too at one time I was also and well are
there

01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.590 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
do you have written testimony oh
 
01:17:28.030 --> 01:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner could you explain a
 
01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
little bit more about um the values that
 
01:17:34.590 --> 01:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
of the Miller uh certainly the prong of
 
01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
the Miller that I find the most
 
01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
challenging and I think that there's a
 
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
plethora of literature that's out there
 
01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
that supports this is the vagueness
 
01:17:43.629 --> 01:17:43.639 align:start position:0%
standard and there the the Supreme Court
 
01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
says it the the Journal of New England
 
01:17:48.750 --> 01:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
law says it and frankly in 1987 that all
 
01:17:51.070 --> 01:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
of the case law after that found it
 
01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
particularly challenging to be able to
 
01:17:55.149 --> 01:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
identify the standards that
 
01:17:56.910 --> 01:17:56.920 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli built into the
 
01:17:59.550 --> 01:17:59.560 align:start position:0%
language which I believe is that uh that
 
01:18:01.950 --> 01:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
whole standard that surrounds the idea
 
01:18:05.229 --> 01:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
of um of content that has value among
 
01:18:07.470 --> 01:18:07.480 align:start position:0%
other things um the one thing that I
 
01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
think that is most important to me if I
 
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
if you leave you with no other fact
 
01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
whatsoever is is that the importance of
 
01:18:15.149 --> 01:18:15.159 align:start position:0%
that standard for Miller says the same
 
01:18:17.070 --> 01:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
thing and it says that the community
 
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
standard is the value that is one of the
 
01:18:21.870 --> 01:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
most important prongs that stems from
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
that decision that the local local
 
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
community gets to make the decision
 
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
where the value lies but the bill that's
 
01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
being placed out here in front of us
 
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
today absolutely is a it is a false
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
representation of community value it
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
simply says that you know what we're
 
01:18:39.070 --> 01:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
going to put in front of you uh the
 
01:18:41.070 --> 01:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
ability to challenge curriculum which
 
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
already exists by the way under policy K
 
01:18:46.270 --> 01:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
and many other policies in schools for
 
01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
individual parents to make individual
 
01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
rights decisions about their personal
 
01:18:51.669 --> 01:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
values but when it comes to the
 
01:18:53.390 --> 01:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
materials in our libraries the materials
 
01:18:55.870 --> 01:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
in our classroom there is policy it's by
 
01:18:58.510 --> 01:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
law mandatory and yes to your question
 
01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
that was asked over here accessibility
 
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
to library contents is already in
 
01:19:05.310 --> 01:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
legislation and almost every school has
 
01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
a digital format for inter Library loan
 
01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
information and tracking where those
 
01:19:10.590 --> 01:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
books are being sent and what the
 
01:19:13.629 --> 01:19:13.639 align:start position:0%
content of libraries are but when you
 
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
take this decision you move it away from
 
01:19:17.070 --> 01:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
the school principal or the lead
 
01:19:18.430 --> 01:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
investigator which has to do the
 
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
impossible in the first place make that
 
01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
decision and you move it to a board
 
01:19:24.910 --> 01:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
which is the elected body and that body
 
01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
is denied because somebody doesn't agree
 
01:19:28.189 --> 01:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
with the decision and they move it to a
 
01:19:30.030 --> 01:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
political body how is that a
 
01:19:32.110 --> 01:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
representation of the local community
 
01:19:34.229 --> 01:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
it's not it's the state and in this case
 
01:19:36.669 --> 01:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
it's a particular political bent of the
 
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
state because it's an appointed body
 
01:19:40.350 --> 01:19:40.360 align:start position:0%
that's making the decision so I ask you
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
to strongly consider that yes we need to
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
keep our children safe allow us to do
 
01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
the work that we do in education the
 
01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
right way please allow us that but
 
01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
please leave the decision at the school
 
01:19:52.990 --> 01:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
board level is the final appeal process
 
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further
 
01:19:58.030 --> 01:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
questions very quick one please um could
 
01:20:00.910 --> 01:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
you comment on uh We've several people
 
01:20:02.350 --> 01:20:02.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned the chilling effect on
 
01:20:05.790 --> 01:20:05.800 align:start position:0%
teachers that even having this bill and
 
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
having it go through all the Hoops in in
 
01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
you know the the house and the Senate
 
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
and that sort of thing have on your
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
ability as a as a superintendent or
 
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
assistant superintendent I can and I can
 
01:20:19.870 --> 01:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
tell you the personal story of me when a
 
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
group of individuals as I was doing the
 
01:20:24.510 --> 01:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
lesson that I was descri ding to the day
 
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
after I completed that lesson I was in
 
01:20:28.910 --> 01:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
my classroom and I have similar stories
 
01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:30.440 align:start position:0%
I could share with you about modern
 
01:20:32.149 --> 01:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
classrooms from the years that I was the
 
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
principal in this particular situation A
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
group of parents came into the school
 
01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
they snuck into the school because they
 
01:20:39.149 --> 01:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
walked in through the front door there
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
were about 15 to 20 of them they were
 
01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
wearing white blouses and black overalls
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
and hats and they all had Bibles in
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
front of them and they walked into my
 
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
lab and they lined up in a straight line
 
01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
women in front Men Behind with the
 
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
Bibles all open quoting Genesis to me I
 
01:20:58.110 --> 01:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
was terrified I was 21 years
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
old and I didn't know what was going to
 
01:21:01.870 --> 01:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
happen if not for the fact that that
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
school principal Joe cordelli was
 
01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
sitting in that office come running down
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
the hallway saying you can't be doing
 
01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
this I would have been absolutely
 
01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
chilled to the fact that I would never
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
have taught that lesson which by the way
 
01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
was on human life it wasn't even on
 
01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
Evolution which was the next
 
01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:23.639 align:start position:0%
chapter thank thank you Woodcock thank
 
01:21:25.709 --> 01:21:25.719 align:start position:0%
you chair uh welcome and thank you for
 
01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
your uh testimony has been terrific than
 
01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
um and and for your dedication to the
 
01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
education profession thank you uh you
 
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the Miller standard was
 
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
1972 Miller California believe was 72
 
01:21:41.629 --> 01:21:41.639 align:start position:0%
yep okay as 50 some OD years ago uh five
 
01:21:44.350 --> 01:21:44.360 align:start position:0%
decades half these people weren't even
 
01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
here uh do you know if that standard has
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
been uh changed since then I'm not a
 
01:21:51.070 --> 01:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
lawyer there are people in this audience
 
01:21:53.550 --> 01:21:53.560 align:start position:0%
who are they can speak to that with far
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
greater um you know Authority than
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
myself probably CH be Christina could
 
01:21:59.590 --> 01:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
tell you that one but I do know this in
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
in a simple search and research of the
 
01:22:03.709 --> 01:22:03.719 align:start position:0%
topic the themes that I was able to come
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
up with based off of the Miller decision
 
01:22:08.229 --> 01:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
which were predicated by decisions U on
 
01:22:09.790 --> 01:22:09.800 align:start position:0%
I think it was called Mission or
 
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
missionary or something to that effect
 
01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
of Massachusetts and there was another
 
01:22:15.070 --> 01:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
one prior to that all of those comments
 
01:22:16.750 --> 01:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
that came forward say the same thing
 
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
when you leave the definitions vague and
 
01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
you leave the definitions in places
 
01:22:22.629 --> 01:22:22.639 align:start position:0%
where you don't have that Clarity it
 
01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
creates that nebulous chilling effect
 
01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
for teachers and it happens I have
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
teachers who are refusing to use art in
 
01:22:31.070 --> 01:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
schools in classrooms dega right now if
 
01:22:33.149 --> 01:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
or man rather if I want to show you the
 
01:22:34.990 --> 01:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
picture of Olympia where Olympia is in a
 
01:22:36.669 --> 01:22:36.679 align:start position:0%
reclined position and her breast is
 
01:22:39.189 --> 01:22:39.199 align:start position:0%
exposed I'm subject to Mr cordelli or
 
01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative cordell's um
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
interpretation as to whether or not that
 
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
has artistic value that's not fair
 
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
because it's going to create a chilling
 
01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:50.719 align:start position:0%
effect why because the process that's
 
01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
defined inside this bill doesn't allow
 
01:22:55.590 --> 01:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
the school board to make that decision
 
01:22:57.550 --> 01:22:57.560 align:start position:0%
it rests on a political body with a
 
01:22:59.790 --> 01:22:59.800 align:start position:0%
political bent and so rather than take
 
01:23:01.229 --> 01:23:01.239 align:start position:0%
the risk and by the way there's a
 
01:23:03.149 --> 01:23:03.159 align:start position:0%
financial cost to this whether the note
 
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
says it or not I as the school
 
01:23:06.709 --> 01:23:06.719 align:start position:0%
administrator I'm going to employ a
 
01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
lawyer that's going to cost a lot of
 
01:23:10.669 --> 01:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
money by the way and if you think that
 
01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
we're not facing a a situation right now
 
01:23:14.590 --> 01:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
where frivolous complaints are being
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
filed I would refer you to the 91a
 
01:23:19.070 --> 01:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
complaints for Stacks and stacks and
 
01:23:20.750 --> 01:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
stacks of information that are being put
 
01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
out because they know and representative
 
01:23:26.310 --> 01:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
cordelli knows this that by creating the
 
01:23:28.830 --> 01:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
chilling effect that's in place it's
 
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
going to prohibit people from doing it
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
in the first place because individuals
 
01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:34.719 align:start position:0%
aren't getting their way because they're
 
01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
not in alignment with a community moral
 
01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
standard thank you thank you thank
 
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
you no no no no
 
01:23:46.110 --> 01:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
no further questions thank you very much
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:54.790 align:start position:0%
 
aim

01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
no because you've already testified you
 
01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
can't good morning thank you for having
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
us here today um I'm from londonairy
 
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
Laura Alam I have five kids um couple of
 
01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
things um I think words are important
 
01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
and it just keeps going round and round
 
01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
words have meaning this is this bill
 
01:24:17.229 --> 01:24:17.239 align:start position:0%
keeping obscene materials out of schools
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
is no more book Banning than having an
 
01:24:22.149 --> 01:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
ID check at a at a strip club or at a
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
night Club it's just something that
 
01:24:26.750 --> 01:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable adults have understood for
 
01:24:29.550 --> 01:24:29.560 align:start position:0%
ages is a fact some materials are okay
 
01:24:32.709 --> 01:24:32.719 align:start position:0%
for adults but not okay for children um
 
01:24:34.709 --> 01:24:34.719 align:start position:0%
my children when they grew up there were
 
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
things that we discussed at home that we
 
01:24:37.790 --> 01:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
didn't discuss at schools I never
 
01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
certainly said to them the only thing
 
01:24:41.470 --> 01:24:41.480 align:start position:0%
it's okay to talk about is what your
 
01:24:43.109 --> 01:24:43.119 align:start position:0%
history teacher talks to you about or
 
01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
what your biology teacher talks to you
 
01:24:46.830 --> 01:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
about it's my job to talk about all
 
01:24:48.830 --> 01:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
kinds of things to expand their Horizons
 
01:24:50.830 --> 01:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
make them better people a lot of it just
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't belong in schools and when I
 
01:24:55.109 --> 01:24:55.119 align:start position:0%
think about the frequent argument that I
 
01:24:56.590 --> 01:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
keep hearing I just really wish you'd
 
01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
reject it the idea that there is a group
 
01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
of people whether they identify with a
 
01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:03.560 align:start position:0%
certain ideology or whether they've had
 
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
certain experiences in their lives that
 
01:25:07.109 --> 01:25:07.119 align:start position:0%
may have been
 
01:25:10.350 --> 01:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
tragic that they should identify that
 
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
they need to have their identity built
 
01:25:16.510 --> 01:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
upon an obscene book A book that depicts
 
01:25:20.109 --> 01:25:20.119 align:start position:0%
very graphically not just biological sex
 
01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
but all kinds of of really per verted
 
01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
things and it may not be your opinion
 
01:25:27.070 --> 01:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
that you're that that's perverted that's
 
01:25:31.149 --> 01:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
okay but to tell your kid because of who
 
01:25:34.109 --> 01:25:34.119 align:start position:0%
you are because of who you want to be
 
01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
this book is absolutely critical to your
 
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
identity I think that's a tragic tragic
 
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
diminishment of their human dignity and
 
01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
it really limits their Horizons and I
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
wish that we didn't have to stake the
 
01:25:49.030 --> 01:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
happiness of kids or their their
 
01:25:51.629 --> 01:25:51.639 align:start position:0%
emotional well-being on the existence of
 
01:25:51.639 --> 01:25:52.870 align:start position:0%
emotional well-being on the existence of
bruant

01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
bruant
 
01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
really truly disgusting books available
 
01:25:57.030 --> 01:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
to them in the libraries it isn't book
 
01:25:59.189 --> 01:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
Banning it's just simple responsible
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
adulthood to say hey you can go down and
 
01:26:02.910 --> 01:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
get that at Barnes &amp; Noble but it's not
 
01:26:05.109 --> 01:26:05.119 align:start position:0%
going to be available in the publicly
 
01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
funded uh Library that's all thank you
 
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
very much are you willing to take
 
01:26:11.070 --> 01:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
questions sure are there any questions
 
01:26:11.950 --> 01:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
committee not see any thank you very
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:21.199 --> 01:26:38.070 align:start position:0%
 
biset

01:26:38.070 --> 01:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:39.870 --> 01:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh members of
 
01:26:42.669 --> 01:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you uh first time uh
 
01:26:44.109 --> 01:26:44.119 align:start position:0%
the session for this committee so it's
 
01:26:46.510 --> 01:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
good to see you all jel B on the legal
 
01:26:49.709 --> 01:26:49.719 align:start position:0%
director uh of the ACLU of New Hampshire
 
01:26:51.709 --> 01:26:51.719 align:start position:0%
strongly uh in opposition uh with
 
01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
respect to to uh this bill and I know
 
01:26:56.109 --> 01:26:56.119 align:start position:0%
that I have very limited time so I kind
 
01:26:57.629 --> 01:26:57.639 align:start position:0%
of want to go through my points pretty
 
01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
quickly but I do think they're they're
 
01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
very important here and I I do think
 
01:27:03.709 --> 01:27:03.719 align:start position:0%
that this is a bill really uh in in
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
search of a problem I haven't seen any
 
01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
indication today that existing School
 
01:27:09.669 --> 01:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
District or School Board policies are
 
01:27:11.709 --> 01:27:11.719 align:start position:0%
insufficient and don't permit book
 
01:27:13.470 --> 01:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
challenges in fact we have seen book
 
01:27:15.270 --> 01:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
challenges throughout the state
 
01:27:17.070 --> 01:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
districts have policies in place to
 
01:27:19.189 --> 01:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
address these so Community can community
 
01:27:21.229 --> 01:27:21.239 align:start position:0%
members can raise concerns and those can
 
01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
be vetted
 
01:27:25.629 --> 01:27:25.639 align:start position:0%
um so I don't think uh this bill is
 
01:27:27.310 --> 01:27:27.320 align:start position:0%
necessary to that extent because I don't
 
01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
think I've heard any real reason to
 
01:27:31.350 --> 01:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
indicate why those policies are in any
 
01:27:34.030 --> 01:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
way insufficient or inadequate but I
 
01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
think more importantly there are
 
01:27:37.870 --> 01:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
existing laws on the books here and I
 
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
just think um it's it's critical to
 
01:27:42.510 --> 01:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
understand that and even to dive into
 
01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
what those laws do so on page two of my
 
01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
testimony I actually recite um not the
 
01:27:49.990 --> 01:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
entirety but the entire of the chapter
 
01:27:52.430 --> 01:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
but the entirety of two sections that
 
01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire's harmful to miners
 
01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
statute and that's what we're talking
 
01:27:57.709 --> 01:27:57.719 align:start position:0%
about here but we already have a statute
 
01:28:01.149 --> 01:28:01.159 align:start position:0%
that addresses this and that's RSA 571
 
01:28:06.189 --> 01:28:06.199 align:start position:0%
B1 and 571 B2 and I I just haven't heard
 
01:28:08.590 --> 01:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
anything today to demonstrate why that
 
01:28:11.070 --> 01:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
statute's insufficient at all and I
 
01:28:12.669 --> 01:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
think that is really like the critical
 
01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
question here um in what ways is that
 
01:28:17.950 --> 01:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
statute inadequate um and I don't think
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
it is inadequate in any way and to the
 
01:28:23.310 --> 01:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
extent that this bill is aimed at um
 
01:28:26.229 --> 01:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
calling out books or instructional
 
01:28:28.830 --> 01:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
material that is not covered under
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
existing law to the extent it goes
 
01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
beyond that that's actually could uh
 
01:28:36.629 --> 01:28:36.639 align:start position:0%
create serious constitutional issues um
 
01:28:38.350 --> 01:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
that I want to walk this committee uh
 
01:28:41.910 --> 01:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
through but there are uh uh real uh ways
 
01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
too in which this bill frankly is
 
01:28:45.790 --> 01:28:45.800 align:start position:0%
actually even more expansive than
 
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
existing law which I think is just as
 
01:28:50.030 --> 01:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
problematic the first is there's no
 
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
knowing requirement here um in this
 
01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:53.590 align:start position:0%
knowing requirement here um in this
particular

01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:28:56.750 --> 01:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
statute um in addition uh as was
 
01:28:58.430 --> 01:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned before and I think it's
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
important to highlight when we talk
 
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
about obscenity we're talking about uh
 
01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
Community standards um this I actually
 
01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
think um goes beyond that it is true
 
01:29:09.189 --> 01:29:09.199 align:start position:0%
that there is kind of a complaint
 
01:29:11.149 --> 01:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
process that's done at the local level
 
01:29:13.109 --> 01:29:13.119 align:start position:0%
under this bill but it's subject to
 
01:29:15.629 --> 01:29:15.639 align:start position:0%
appeal by the State Board of Education
 
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
what standards are is the State Board of
 
01:29:19.790 --> 01:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
Education going to be using is it the
 
01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
community is it the state and the fact
 
01:29:23.709 --> 01:29:23.719 align:start position:0%
that it's a state board of education I
 
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
think highlights a problem with this
 
01:29:26.990 --> 01:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
which is that the decision at the end of
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
the day can and should be at the local
 
01:29:31.390 --> 01:29:31.400 align:start position:0%
level which is consistent with current
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
practice and I think this uh upends that
 
01:29:37.390 --> 01:29:37.400 align:start position:0%
Norm and also I do think runs uh
 
01:29:38.830 --> 01:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
somewhat contrary to the community
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
standards approach that exists in state
 
01:29:43.629 --> 01:29:43.639 align:start position:0%
law in addition one way in this statute
 
01:29:45.669 --> 01:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
is more expansive and potentially in a
 
01:29:48.510 --> 01:29:48.520 align:start position:0%
prob problematic way is that it targets
 
01:29:50.790 --> 01:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
more than just sexual conduct it targets
 
01:29:54.669 --> 01:29:54.679 align:start position:0%
M nudity uh and sexual uh uh excitement
 
01:29:56.430 --> 01:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
um and I think that does create some
 
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional problems particularly
 
01:30:01.149 --> 01:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
when you look at the Reno uh versus ACLU
 
01:30:03.510 --> 01:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
case uh which talks about how from a
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional perspective you would
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
need to limit obscenity to OBEX to
 
01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
sexual conduct that is not what this
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
bill does I also do think that this bill
 
01:30:14.750 --> 01:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
adds a separate standard apart from the
 
01:30:16.189 --> 01:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
Constitution standard which is the
 
01:30:18.149 --> 01:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
fourth criteria that represent if you've
 
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
gone beyond your time sure the
 
01:30:21.189 --> 01:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to the age of the minor
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
standard I just would note exists
 
01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
outside of constitutional Doctrine this
 
01:30:27.390 --> 01:30:27.400 align:start position:0%
problematic and lastly this the law is
 
01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
vague and lastly I think the criminal
 
01:30:31.149 --> 01:30:31.159 align:start position:0%
piece in section one is really a
 
01:30:33.629 --> 01:30:33.639 align:start position:0%
different thing altogether it should be
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
um stricken that also would implicate um
 
01:30:38.709 --> 01:30:38.719 align:start position:0%
K through 12 private schools as well um
 
01:30:40.350 --> 01:30:40.360 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to to flag that
 
01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
particular issue but that's mentioned in
 
01:30:43.470 --> 01:30:43.480 align:start position:0%
my testimony thank you thank you very
 
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
much are there questions represent
 
01:30:48.070 --> 01:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
dry thank you and thank you for taking
 
01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
my question thank you I wanted just
 
01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
again to talk about school board and the
 
01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
decision um process because that's part
 
01:30:59.870 --> 01:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
of due process is to be able to uh take
 
01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
an appeal a decision between a
 
01:31:04.350 --> 01:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
individual and a school
 
01:31:08.910 --> 01:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
system so yeah would you dis take that
 
01:31:10.669 --> 01:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
part out of the equation then and not
 
01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
have it in due process be part of the
 
01:31:14.830 --> 01:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
process oh no I think there's plenty of
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
due process in fact there there already
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
would be multiple layers of review right
 
01:31:21.310 --> 01:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
you go to the superintendent right layer
 
01:31:23.550 --> 01:31:23.560 align:start position:0%
number one if you disagree with that
 
01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
that decision you can go to the local
 
01:31:28.390 --> 01:31:28.400 align:start position:0%
school board I think that is fine and in
 
01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
fact I think that's consistent with
 
01:31:32.229 --> 01:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
current current policy I think that is
 
01:31:35.470 --> 01:31:35.480 align:start position:0%
consistent with due process what I have
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
added layer of concern about is this
 
01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
whole separate kind of State Board of
 
01:31:40.750 --> 01:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
Education process which I think now
 
01:31:42.590 --> 01:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
takes this out of the community
 
01:31:45.030 --> 01:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
standards approach which is what we um
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
we normally how we normally consider
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
these issues um the the law that I
 
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned 517b is uh I think think is
 
01:31:53.390 --> 01:31:53.400 align:start position:0%
reflective of that you file you know a
 
01:31:55.790 --> 01:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
lawsuit could be filed in County court
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's adjudicated by a County judge a
 
01:31:59.550 --> 01:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
county attorney can also bring a claim
 
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
that two is consistent with Community
 
01:32:03.070 --> 01:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
standards I don't think the State Board
 
01:32:07.109 --> 01:32:07.119 align:start position:0%
of educ Education piece here
 
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
is thank you further questions from the
 
01:32:11.870 --> 01:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
committee represent whitcock thank you
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
chairman good morning and thank you for
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
being here thank you um I was just heing
 
01:32:17.550 --> 01:32:17.560 align:start position:0%
some CLA I asked the previous speaker
 
01:32:20.310 --> 01:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
and he knowled I should ask someone more
 
01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable in law than him and that's
 
01:32:23.470 --> 01:32:23.480 align:start position:0%
more than me so I'm going to go back to
 
01:32:27.790 --> 01:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
the middle of 1972 stand um there was uh
 
01:32:30.750 --> 01:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
a lot that this bill is predicated
 
01:32:34.270 --> 01:32:34.280 align:start position:0%
on uh are you aware if that law has been
 
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
changed to be less vague and more
 
01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
specific as time is going on I it's I
 
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
think it's generally frankly this this
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
this this current standard um and I
 
01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
think you have to look at Miller and the
 
01:32:46.510 --> 01:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
Ginsburg case that represented cordelli
 
01:32:47.950 --> 01:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned and kind of that because that
 
01:32:50.990 --> 01:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
case deals with miners in particular um
 
01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
those standards as old as they are um
 
01:32:56.830 --> 01:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
still exist and they're evaluated and
 
01:32:58.910 --> 01:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
adjudicated at the community level
 
01:33:01.629 --> 01:33:01.639 align:start position:0%
because communities are are different so
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
I do view it as the current state of the
 
01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
law still okay thank you thank you
 
01:33:08.109 --> 01:33:08.119 align:start position:0%
you're welcome yeah further further
 
01:33:10.109 --> 01:33:10.119 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
01:33:18.870 --> 01:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:21.629 --> 01:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
Chester hi my name is Russ anchester I'm
 
01:33:23.229 --> 01:33:23.239 align:start position:0%
from Bedford New Hampshire and I would
 
01:33:25.189 --> 01:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
just like to say yes parents are being
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
denied to go into libraries um happening
 
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
in my town the fact that Michael Strand
 
01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
who lives in my town sat up here and
 
01:33:37.470 --> 01:33:37.480 align:start position:0%
said it's not happening is concerning um
 
01:33:39.790 --> 01:33:39.800 align:start position:0%
the other thing I want to bring out is
 
01:33:44.350 --> 01:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
the poster that he mentioned um was is
 
01:33:46.629 --> 01:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
from it was a quote it was put in
 
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
writing none of the pictures were put on
 
01:33:52.189 --> 01:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
that poster it was during polling and um
 
01:33:54.590 --> 01:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
or during during our election local
 
01:33:57.790 --> 01:33:57.800 align:start position:0%
elections and one of the words
 
01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
was s and then it did star star star
 
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
k so we didn't even put something on
 
01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
there so that the kids and they said
 
01:34:13.470 --> 01:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
well they could all figure it out well
 
01:34:15.109 --> 01:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
the fact that the parents had the
 
01:34:17.669 --> 01:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
problem with it at a polling station
 
01:34:19.149 --> 01:34:19.159 align:start position:0%
means it probably shouldn't have been in
 
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
grammar school library
 
01:34:27.149 --> 01:34:27.159 align:start position:0%
I had a child that went to school in
 
01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
2005 it was through the health education
 
01:34:34.109 --> 01:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
she was a sexually reactive child um she
 
01:34:37.149 --> 01:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
was my stepchild uh sexually reactive
 
01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
child and uh she wanted she didn't want
 
01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
to be different she wanted to go through
 
01:34:44.510 --> 01:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
the sexed class with the rest of her
 
01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
students I said okay every night when
 
01:34:51.709 --> 01:34:51.719 align:start position:0%
you come home we will process this the
 
01:34:54.030 --> 01:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
school not knowing that she was a SE
 
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
sexually reactive child because she was
 
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
in counseling and she didn't want people
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
to know um and her counselors supported
 
01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:03.310 align:start position:0%
to know um and her counselors supported
that

01:35:03.310 --> 01:35:03.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:06.910 --> 01:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
decision but because she started having
 
01:35:10.270 --> 01:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
signs and symptoms of a sexually abused
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
child the school the counselor the
 
01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
teacher and the administration of that
 
01:35:19.030 --> 01:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
Middle School took it upon themselves to
 
01:35:24.030 --> 01:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
file a CPS uh allegation against myself
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
and my
 
01:35:29.149 --> 01:35:29.159 align:start position:0%
husband I spent 17 years doing abuse and
 
01:35:32.070 --> 01:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
neglect investigation and the questions
 
01:35:36.510 --> 01:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
that they asked my child was not okay
 
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
and the fact that we even have to sit
 
01:35:41.189 --> 01:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
here and say what's too
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
much do you know 90 97% of autistic
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
children also identify as lgbtq
 
01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:53.070 align:start position:0%
children also identify as lgbtq
Plus

01:35:53.070 --> 01:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
Plus
 
01:35:56.350 --> 01:35:56.360 align:start position:0%
that's huge we're talking about an we're
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
talking about a population who socially
 
01:36:01.910 --> 01:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
they may be 12 years old but socially
 
01:36:05.149 --> 01:36:05.159 align:start position:0%
they may not be and it's not okay every
 
01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
child should be looked at individually
 
01:36:10.990 --> 01:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
that the fact that that folks have said
 
01:36:12.990 --> 01:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
things like we need to trust our
 
01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
teachers and our counselors well how's
 
01:36:18.109 --> 01:36:18.119 align:start position:0%

hearing we already have the laws there's
 
01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
plenty of due process well if there is
 
01:37:04.990 --> 01:37:05.000 align:start position:0%

said can I can I rephrase yes thank you
 
01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
I was I was a counselor I know there are
 
01:37:39.950 --> 01:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
great teachers and great school
 
01:37:41.870 --> 01:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
counselors and great Librarians and
 
01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
great superintendents and great
 
01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
principles but the problem is is that I
 
01:37:49.790 --> 01:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
did sexual abuse and neglect
 
01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
investigation for 77 years and the
 
01:37:55.109 --> 01:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
bottom line is those perpetrators will
 
01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
go where their victims are which is our
 
01:37:59.790 --> 01:37:59.800 align:start position:0%
schools and that's the bottom line
 
01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:00.870 align:start position:0%
schools and that's the bottom line
further

01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing you thank you very
 
01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:14.430 --> 01:38:14.440 align:start position:0%
Harrington hi I'm Betsy Harrington I'm
 
01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
from Deering I'm a mom of two boys at
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro deing High School I'm also
 
01:38:21.189 --> 01:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
trained as a therapist and I worked as a
 
01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
sex offender counselor at the prison
 
01:38:25.229 --> 01:38:25.239 align:start position:0%
just down the street I'm not just a
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
worried mom here I'm a professional that
 
01:38:29.669 --> 01:38:29.679 align:start position:0%
has Grave concerns I've seen it for
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
myself and I can see that boundaries
 
01:38:34.430 --> 01:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
need to be set we are at the Event
 
01:38:37.149 --> 01:38:37.159 align:start position:0%
Horizon if we don't set this very simple
 
01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
boundary now we might not come back this
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
is the minimum this is literally using
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
the language from the American Library
 
01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
Association if we can't agree on this
 
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
we've all gone mad this bill would only
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
be stopping the most blatant of
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
offensive materials it won't protect
 
01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:55.679 align:start position:0%
kids from all sexually explicit
 
01:38:57.629 --> 01:38:57.639 align:start position:0%
materials it would only keep out the
 
01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
most obvious of overt sexual content
 
01:39:02.990 --> 01:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
like Penthouse and tri XX this is
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
content most Educators already agree as
 
01:39:07.870 --> 01:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
age inappropriate it won't weed out all
 
01:39:10.510 --> 01:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
the sexual content repackaged for kids
 
01:39:12.669 --> 01:39:12.679 align:start position:0%
this bill keeps out only the worst it's
 
01:39:15.070 --> 01:39:15.080 align:start position:0%
a no-brainer even for the liberal-minded
 
01:39:18.270 --> 01:39:18.280 align:start position:0%
the truth is my kids get promoted a ton
 
01:39:20.350 --> 01:39:20.360 align:start position:0%
of unwanted sexually explicit content
 
01:39:21.870 --> 01:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
through their Chromebook books and
 
01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
libraries I want you all to know that my
 
01:39:25.910 --> 01:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
kids are banned from using the library
 
01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
the first time I went to my school board
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
to complain about the first book I've
 
01:39:32.910 --> 01:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
ever even gone to a meeting they said
 
01:39:35.149 --> 01:39:35.159 align:start position:0%
okay your kids can't use Library anymore
 
01:39:36.790 --> 01:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
and it's been since this been over a
 
01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
year now that my kids have been banned
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
from using the library they're the two
 
01:39:42.790 --> 01:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
top students in their in their classes
 
01:39:44.229 --> 01:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
but they can't use the library just want
 
01:39:46.750 --> 01:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure you all knew that strangely
 
01:39:48.510 --> 01:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
I can see the sex ed curriculum two
 
01:39:50.109 --> 01:39:50.119 align:start position:0%
weeks ahead of time and approve or
 
01:39:52.189 --> 01:39:52.199 align:start position:0%
disapprove yet I can't disapprove of
 
01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
blatant sex misinformation being
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
promoted through their their Chromebooks
 
01:39:58.470 --> 01:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
and their libraries why why can't I
 
01:40:00.350 --> 01:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
protect my kids for OB sexual content in
 
01:40:02.709 --> 01:40:02.719 align:start position:0%
school too let me read a few lines from
 
01:40:05.390 --> 01:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
Juno Dawson's book this book is gay this
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
award winner reads differently through
 
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
the online school library because it
 
01:40:11.589 --> 01:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
includes a blue hyperlink to adult
 
01:40:13.470 --> 01:40:13.480 align:start position:0%
dating apps in the section of the book
 
01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
titled how to use sex apps pay attention
 
01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
here we are literally hyperlinking our
 
01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
kids to sex seeking adults through their
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
online school books we call that sex
 
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
trafficking let me quote from that
 
01:40:29.790 --> 01:40:29.800 align:start position:0%
section where they hyperlink straight to
 
01:40:32.669 --> 01:40:32.679 align:start position:0%

01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
to app sex like ducks to sexy water
 
01:40:37.870 --> 01:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
technology changes frighteningly quick
 
01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
the lesbian app Crusher has been gone
 
01:40:41.830 --> 01:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
already but it seems the market leader
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
grinder is here to stay how sex apps
 
01:40:47.310 --> 01:40:47.320 align:start position:0%
work upload a tiny picture of yourself
 
01:40:49.229 --> 01:40:49.239 align:start position:0%
to the app the app works out your
 
01:40:51.629 --> 01:40:51.639 align:start position:0%
location the app tells
 
01:40:53.310 --> 01:40:53.320 align:start position:0%
tells you who are the nearest
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%

01:41:01.149 --> 01:41:01.159 align:start position:0%
up with them meet up with them yes our
 
01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
school books now hyperlink our kids to
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
sex-seeking adults for meeting up the
 
01:41:08.430 --> 01:41:08.440 align:start position:0%
book then goes on to give an exact play
 
01:41:10.470 --> 01:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
byplay on how to please the adults with
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
explanations of handies bloes and
 
01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
bumming you'll have to read the book if
 
01:41:16.589 --> 01:41:16.599 align:start position:0%
you want to know what that means this
 
01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
book has a ward on it and is in the
 
01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
shared New Hampshire collection of the
 
01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
Sor Student Life Library app it's
 
01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
promoted to thousands possibly tens of
 
01:41:26.629 --> 01:41:26.639 align:start position:0%
thousands of our New Hampshire students
 
01:41:29.310 --> 01:41:29.320 align:start position:0%
if even only one kid clicks through what
 
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
does that mean we did excuse me you're
 
01:41:32.550 --> 01:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
you're out of time I'll finish up
 
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
there's only two more sentences this is
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
so unwelcome to parents it is time we
 
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
set some minimum standards around the
 
01:41:40.350 --> 01:41:40.360 align:start position:0%
sexually explicit materials this is the
 
01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
minimum this is using their language P
 
01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
this or we have crossed the precipice
 
01:41:47.070 --> 01:41:47.080 align:start position:0%
into true depravity there will be no
 
01:41:48.870 --> 01:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
standards are questions from the
 
01:41:51.990 --> 01:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
committee represent leus
 
01:41:54.589 --> 01:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
that book with you which you referenced
 
01:41:58.390 --> 01:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
is intended for adults um and it's rated
 
01:42:00.270 --> 01:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
that way so I'm
 
01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
wondering what age is that available to
 
01:42:06.109 --> 01:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
students in our schools so that's in the
 
01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
store student Library this is available
 
01:42:11.109 --> 01:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
to T tens of thousands of students
 
01:42:14.830 --> 01:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
around our state 53,000 school districts
 
01:42:17.430 --> 01:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
in the country use that Sora reading
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
Library app so it's really why and it's
 
01:42:23.790 --> 01:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
in our shared New Hampshire collection
 
01:42:27.390 --> 01:42:27.400 align:start position:0%
so why would that be a shared book in a
 
01:42:29.189 --> 01:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
collection of a library that has over
 
01:42:31.550 --> 01:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
8,000 titles why would we have a book
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
that has a blue hyperlink that
 
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
hyperlinks you to sex-seeking adults but
 
01:42:38.270 --> 01:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
yet it's there and I can show you all
 
01:42:39.750 --> 01:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
because I have access to the Sora
 
01:42:41.470 --> 01:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
reading Library app right here on my
 
01:42:43.830 --> 01:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
phone so what age is that further
 
01:42:46.669 --> 01:42:46.679 align:start position:0%
questions well the ask re asking the
 
01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
same question my kids are getting it my
 
01:42:52.149 --> 01:42:52.159 align:start position:0%
kids are in high school okay thank thank
 
01:42:54.750 --> 01:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
you very much further questions rep and
 
01:42:56.750 --> 01:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
dry thank you and thank you for taking
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
my question are there any like a
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
parental um guidelines that you can make
 
01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
on the Chromebook to block things that
 
01:43:08.310 --> 01:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
are inappropriate no so when I went to
 
01:43:10.990 --> 01:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
the school for the very first time and
 
01:43:12.629 --> 01:43:12.639 align:start position:0%
let me tell you I scheduled a private
 
01:43:14.270 --> 01:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
meeting because I was very embarrassed
 
01:43:16.270 --> 01:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
I'd never been to a school board meeting
 
01:43:19.350 --> 01:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
before a teacher posted to the town that
 
01:43:21.470 --> 01:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
I was going to try to ban books and that
 
01:43:22.990 --> 01:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
the whole town should come to my private
 
01:43:25.990 --> 01:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
meeting I was so ashamed and Afraid all
 
01:43:28.030 --> 01:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
I wanted to do was let them see it that
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
was it I did not want a big protest and
 
01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
me to become this lady who I now am
 
01:43:37.510 --> 01:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
right but I can't stop because I saw it
 
01:43:39.669 --> 01:43:39.679 align:start position:0%
it's a blue hyperlink to sex-seeking
 
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
adults in my kids Chromebook and I can't
 
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
turn it off they said it can't be turned
 
01:43:48.910 --> 01:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
off match.com always blue hyperlink 100%
 
01:43:51.310 --> 01:43:51.320 align:start position:0%
of the time you cannot stop match.com
 
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
from that blue hyperlink so I asked them
 
01:43:56.189 --> 01:43:56.199 align:start position:0%
to take the book out nope it's in the
 
01:43:58.229 --> 01:43:58.239 align:start position:0%
shared New Hampshire collection no one
 
01:44:00.030 --> 01:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
is cultivating that Library I want you
 
01:44:02.830 --> 01:44:02.840 align:start position:0%
all to know that Sora reading Library
 
01:44:05.149 --> 01:44:05.159 align:start position:0%
the The Librarians are not cultivating
 
01:44:07.629 --> 01:44:07.639 align:start position:0%
that Library My Librarian just leaves it
 
01:44:10.350 --> 01:44:10.360 align:start position:0%
alone it comes from California that's
 
01:44:11.950 --> 01:44:11.960 align:start position:0%
the librarian that cultivates that
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
Library we pay $250 a year to get 8,000
 
01:44:19.229 --> 01:44:19.239 align:start position:0%
trashy books there are zero Steinbeck

books in that library but there are 95
 
01:44:25.270 --> 01:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
Pokemon books so it's just trash and
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
this book is gay which has the blue
 
01:44:29.629 --> 01:44:29.639 align:start position:0%
hyperlink and other books that hyperlink
 
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
the kids straight to really bad places
 
01:44:34.510 --> 01:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
we should not have hyperlinks in our
 
01:44:36.430 --> 01:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
libraries thank you very much are there
 
01:44:38.910 --> 01:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee not
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:49.560 --> 01:45:06.589 align:start position:0%
 
house

01:45:06.589 --> 01:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:08.189 --> 01:45:08.199 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning chairman lad
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
members of
 
01:45:11.669 --> 01:45:11.679 align:start position:0%
morning uh yes we've heard a lot of
 
01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
testimony already and I will try not to
 
01:45:16.109 --> 01:45:16.119 align:start position:0%
be repetitive but my name is Deborah H
 
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm the president of the American
 
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
Federation of teachers New Hampshire I'm
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
here to speak on behalf of our 3700
 
01:45:23.910 --> 01:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
members across the state mostly in uh
 
01:45:26.350 --> 01:45:26.360 align:start position:0%
prek through 12 public schools and we
 
01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
are here to oppose hb1 1419 and despite
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
the impression you might get from
 
01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
reading the bill or listening to some of
 
01:45:35.070 --> 01:45:35.080 align:start position:0%
the previous testimony uh the members of
 
01:45:36.550 --> 01:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
my union are focused on teaching
 
01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
children to read and write not enforcing
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
inappropriate books in their hands now
 
01:45:41.950 --> 01:45:41.960 align:start position:0%
is a time when we should be focusing on
 
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
real solutions to make sure that all of
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
our Granite State Public Schools
 
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
students can uh learn to read and write
 
01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:49.320 align:start position:0%
and thrive in their Public Schools if
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
they have all the resources need to do
 
01:45:53.470 --> 01:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
that we should not be focusing on bills
 
01:45:55.030 --> 01:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
that will divide communities pitting
 
01:45:57.030 --> 01:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
families against each other and making
 
01:45:59.270 --> 01:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
making it easier to remove books from
 
01:46:01.589 --> 01:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
school libraries which will indeed make
 
01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
it impossible for many students to
 
01:46:06.430 --> 01:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
access those books in fact it would be a
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
book bad we have heard a lot of
 
01:46:10.149 --> 01:46:10.159 align:start position:0%
discussion about the Miller test and
 
01:46:13.149 --> 01:46:13.159 align:start position:0%
despite the really clear descriptions of
 
01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
things that would be red flags that I
 
01:46:17.589 --> 01:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
think we can agree you don't want many
 
01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
students exposed to the Miller test is
 
01:46:23.109 --> 01:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
objective and the complaint process
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
described in this bill would put the
 
01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
decision making um out of the hands of
 
01:46:31.350 --> 01:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
local control we have a
 
01:46:35.350 --> 01:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
long history of local control in our
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
state and the ultimate irony here in a
 
01:46:39.629 --> 01:46:39.639 align:start position:0%
state with such a tradition of local
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
control and individual liberties this
 
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
bill would Envision putting the decision
 
01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
making on what would be inappropriate or
 
01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
um you know wholly and predominantly
 
01:46:55.310 --> 01:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
appealing to prian interests first on
 
01:46:58.229 --> 01:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
the decision making of the principes so
 
01:47:00.629 --> 01:47:00.639 align:start position:0%
that's one person rather than the whole
 
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
Community um and then you could appeal
 
01:47:05.950 --> 01:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
it up to the state board so you'll be
 
01:47:08.149 --> 01:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
bypassing policies that are in place
 
01:47:10.430 --> 01:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
where you involve a whole committee that
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
could be you know a school board member
 
01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
a principal a librarian a parent or or
 
01:47:18.149 --> 01:47:18.159 align:start position:0%
even a larger group that have to read
 
01:47:20.109 --> 01:47:20.119 align:start position:0%
the book and consider it as a whole we
 
01:47:22.229 --> 01:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
don't want to forgo policies that are
 
01:47:24.550 --> 01:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
already in place to consider works on a
 
01:47:26.950 --> 01:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
whole uh and whether you should keep
 
01:47:29.589 --> 01:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
them circulating in the collection so
 
01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
that students can access them because if
 
01:47:34.109 --> 01:47:34.119 align:start position:0%
a student can't access a book it is
 
01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:40.910 --> 01:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
reach finally and I know these words
 
01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
will probably be taken out of context
 
01:47:44.750 --> 01:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
but there are some books in school
 
01:47:46.709 --> 01:47:46.719 align:start position:0%
libraries that can literally be life
 
01:47:49.229 --> 01:47:49.239 align:start position:0%
saving for a young person for example a
 
01:47:51.589 --> 01:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
book about surviving childhood sexual
 
01:47:53.950 --> 01:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
abuse for a child who has been through
 
01:47:57.669 --> 01:47:57.679 align:start position:0%
it can be something they really need to
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
see they may not be ready to talk about
 
01:48:01.990 --> 01:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
it with anyone else but if they come
 
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
across a book like that and read
 
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
it they might realize that they're not
 
01:48:10.629 --> 01:48:10.639 align:start position:0%
alone that someone else has lived
 
01:48:13.229 --> 01:48:13.239 align:start position:0%
through that experience and that it
 
01:48:13.239 --> 01:48:14.350 align:start position:0%
through that experience and that it
gives

01:48:14.350 --> 01:48:14.360 align:start position:0%
gives
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
them hope it gives them a sense that
 
01:48:23.470 --> 01:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
they can survive as well so even if a
 
01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
book is challenging even if it is
 
01:48:27.310 --> 01:48:27.320 align:start position:0%
something that you would not want your
 
01:48:30.669 --> 01:48:30.679 align:start position:0%
own child to read it might have a reason
 
01:48:33.189 --> 01:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
for being in the collection in the high
 
01:48:37.589 --> 01:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
school library so that a child who needs
 
01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
to see it has the ability to access
 
01:48:44.910 --> 01:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
it and if it is not available in the
 
01:48:46.990 --> 01:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
school library there may be no other
 
01:48:48.750 --> 01:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
place they can get to it thank thank you
 
01:48:51.390 --> 01:48:51.400 align:start position:0%
very much and I will be my testimony to
 
01:48:53.910 --> 01:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you yes thank you I will
 
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
answer if I can but if it's the same
 
01:48:56.629 --> 01:48:56.639 align:start position:0%
question you've already asked and answer
 
01:48:59.709 --> 01:48:59.719 align:start position:0%
I Willer but I just want to clarify I'm
 
01:49:01.709 --> 01:49:01.719 align:start position:0%
sorry okay thank you Mr chair and I'm
 
01:49:02.910 --> 01:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
sorry to be
 
01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
repetitive but it's being repeated by
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
numerous people and the fact is that
 
01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:11.350 align:start position:0%
numerous people and the fact is that
these

01:49:11.350 --> 01:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
books are available in other places and
 
01:49:17.229 --> 01:49:17.239 align:start position:0%
a parent has every ability to access it
 
01:49:19.149 --> 01:49:19.159 align:start position:0%
if they think their child should read it
 
01:49:23.589 --> 01:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
on Amazon Barn and Noble even public
 
01:49:27.950 --> 01:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
libraries so just clarify how then this
 
01:49:31.510 --> 01:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
is a book b well actually under uh
 
01:49:33.709 --> 01:49:33.719 align:start position:0%
Miller children have the right to access
 
01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
material as well so if a child just
 
01:49:38.950 --> 01:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
cannot get to the library to the public
 
01:49:40.990 --> 01:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
library because in many places they're
 
01:49:42.990 --> 01:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
only open a few hours a
 
01:49:45.510 --> 01:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
week and if the only Library the child
 
01:49:49.070 --> 01:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
can get to is a school library then how
 
01:49:51.070 --> 01:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
do they have access to it elsewhere what
 
01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
if they don't have money to go buy the
 
01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:53.629 align:start position:0%
if they don't have money to go buy the
book

01:49:53.629 --> 01:49:53.639 align:start position:0%
book
 
01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639 align:start position:0%
themselves um then then it is inde De
 
01:49:58.870 --> 01:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
banned and a parent does have the right
 
01:50:00.430 --> 01:50:00.440 align:start position:0%
to decide what their own child can read
 
01:50:01.709 --> 01:50:01.719 align:start position:0%
but they don't have the right to decide
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
what every other child in the community
 
01:50:05.950 --> 01:50:05.960 align:start position:0%
can read in and of themselves not just
 
01:50:08.189 --> 01:50:08.199 align:start position:0%
one parent that's why we have policies
 
01:50:11.669 --> 01:50:11.679 align:start position:0%
that involve a committee and a community
 
01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
standard that's what the Miller test is
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
about thank you yeah represent
 
01:50:20.109 --> 01:50:20.119 align:start position:0%
leus so do you think it is imp
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
apprpriate for a high school student to
 
01:50:28.629 --> 01:50:28.639 align:start position:0%
have access to an adult book which has a
 
01:50:28.639 --> 01:50:30.149 align:start position:0%
have access to an adult book which has a
hyperlink

01:50:30.149 --> 01:50:30.159 align:start position:0%
hyperlink
 
01:50:33.070 --> 01:50:33.080 align:start position:0%
to um a an
 
01:50:40.830 --> 01:50:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:44.229 --> 01:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
adults that certainly sounds like
 
01:50:48.310 --> 01:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
something that's inappropriate but I am
 
01:50:51.870 --> 01:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
not knowledgeable of the accuracy of the
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
previous uh testifier statement so I am
 
01:50:59.830 --> 01:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
not going to you know testify that I can
 
01:51:03.390 --> 01:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
say that is correct but that certainly
 
01:51:08.510 --> 01:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:13.510 --> 01:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh ability to to connect through the
 
01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:14.950 align:start position:0%
uh ability to to connect through the
book

01:51:14.950 --> 01:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
book
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
to uh further on the web so you would
 
01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:21.030 align:start position:0%
to uh further on the web so you would
agree

01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
agree
 
01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh are there further questions not
 
01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:27.510 align:start position:0%
uh are there further questions not
represent

01:51:27.510 --> 01:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:30.390 --> 01:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
try can you
 
01:51:33.069 --> 01:51:33.079 align:start position:0%
wait thank you for letting me take this
 
01:51:34.990 --> 01:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
question um thank you for taking a
 
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
question I just want to ask about again
 
01:51:39.629 --> 01:51:39.639 align:start position:0%
the the appeals process it goes from
 
01:51:43.069 --> 01:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
Principal to Local School Board to to
 
01:51:45.430 --> 01:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
the state board if needed either step
 
01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
can be could be the end point if the the
 
01:51:52.069 --> 01:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
both parties agree is that
 
01:51:55.109 --> 01:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
correct as far as I understand from this
 
01:51:58.669 --> 01:51:58.679 align:start position:0%
bill yeah but um if you're talking about
 
01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
so you've got a couple things going on
 
01:52:00.870 --> 01:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
here you've got the Miller standard
 
01:52:02.790 --> 01:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
which is a community standard so if
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
you're going Beyond The Local School
 
01:52:07.470 --> 01:52:07.480 align:start position:0%
Board to the State Board then you're no
 
01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
longer dealing with a local community
 
01:52:13.990 --> 01:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
standard and your local school board is
 
01:52:16.149 --> 01:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
elected by your local community and the
 
01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
state board's Not Elected so you've
 
01:52:21.589 --> 01:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
really kind of mixing apples and oranges
 
01:52:24.510 --> 01:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
now aren't you so my followup question
 
01:52:28.470 --> 01:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
is if this is due process for any case
 
01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639 align:start position:0%
why would we make a special case just
 
01:52:32.830 --> 01:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
for dealing with books that doesn't
 
01:52:34.950 --> 01:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
follow the due process but you got a
 
01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
different legal
 
01:52:40.350 --> 01:52:40.360 align:start position:0%
standard thank you yeah uh further
 
01:52:43.229 --> 01:52:43.239 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing thank you very much
 
01:52:43.239 --> 01:52:44.830 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing thank you very much
uh

01:52:44.830 --> 01:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:48.470 align:start position:0%

teacher uh secondary English teacher for
 
01:53:09.310 --> 01:53:09.320 align:start position:0%
six years Public School System I'm also
 
01:53:11.709 --> 01:53:11.719 align:start position:0%
a master degree librarian University of
 
01:53:15.069 --> 01:53:15.079 align:start position:0%
South Florida I've worked in public
 
01:53:16.950 --> 01:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
libraries I've worked in was first the
 
01:53:18.669 --> 01:53:18.679 align:start position:0%
law library and I've worked in a public
 
01:53:21.390 --> 01:53:21.400 align:start position:0%
library and worked in a school
 
01:53:24.350 --> 01:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
library and I'm here
 
01:53:28.350 --> 01:53:28.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately Betsy here my friend uh
 
01:53:30.870 --> 01:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
this is really hard for me really hard
 
01:53:33.589 --> 01:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
for me because I'm probably sexually
 
01:53:37.990 --> 01:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
reactive myself but um I'm a
 
01:53:41.189 --> 01:53:41.199 align:start position:0%
professional and uh I did go to the
 
01:53:43.950 --> 01:53:43.960 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro school board meeting as a
 
01:53:47.149 --> 01:53:47.159 align:start position:0%
librarian when I was living in Hillsboro
 
01:53:49.470 --> 01:53:49.480 align:start position:0%
and I begged on the superintendent I
 
01:53:53.709 --> 01:53:53.719 align:start position:0%
actually challenged her to uh create a
 
01:53:55.589 --> 01:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
challenge of materials policy for
 
01:53:58.669 --> 01:53:58.679 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro which she did and I've seen it
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
and there I do have a uh I did print
 
01:54:04.109 --> 01:54:04.119 align:start position:0%
this out for the committee and for Betsy
 
01:54:07.270 --> 01:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
if you want parents do have the option
 
01:54:11.189 --> 01:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
to opt out of the Zora app so they they
 
01:54:12.830 --> 01:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
their children do not have to have
 
01:54:16.430 --> 01:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
access to the digital Zora app if they
 
01:54:18.189 --> 01:54:18.199 align:start position:0%
don't want their children to have access
 
01:54:21.030 --> 01:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
to it also as a libr Li Arian I spoke
 
01:54:23.950 --> 01:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
with the representative from overdrive
 
01:54:27.550 --> 01:54:27.560 align:start position:0%
the books on Zora app are curated by a
 
01:54:31.709 --> 01:54:31.719 align:start position:0%
librarian and there is a
 
01:54:34.990 --> 01:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
materials consideration policy with
 
01:54:37.510 --> 01:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
overdrive that the school librarians in
 
01:54:40.030 --> 01:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can follow to have those
 
01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
books removed from the Zora app this
 
01:54:45.910 --> 01:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
problem is is the school librarians
 
01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
either don't have a collection
 
01:54:50.109 --> 01:54:50.119 align:start position:0%
development policy well that's what it
 
01:54:51.830 --> 01:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
is I'm a public librarian where it kind
 
01:54:53.470 --> 01:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
of crosses over because I really
 
01:54:56.510 --> 01:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
honestly feel that the state librarian
 
01:54:57.950 --> 01:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
should be here
 
01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
today testifying and he's not and it
 
01:55:04.990 --> 01:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
really bothers me that he's not here
 
01:55:08.550 --> 01:55:08.560 align:start position:0%
um I am going to read my testimony and
 
01:55:10.510 --> 01:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
then I'm I have a copy of the library
 
01:55:12.510 --> 01:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights I also need to let you
 
01:55:15.390 --> 01:55:15.400 align:start position:0%
know that there's a federal law called
 
01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
the uh children's internet protection
 
01:55:21.270 --> 01:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
act which was enacted in the year 2000
 
01:55:23.390 --> 01:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
and anything that's available on the
 
01:55:26.669 --> 01:55:26.679 align:start position:0%
internet that H has any obscene material
 
01:55:30.790 --> 01:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
to it at all is a federal
 
01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
offense so there are existing laws
 
01:55:37.470 --> 01:55:37.480 align:start position:0%
already but teachers do need to be able
 
01:55:40.189 --> 01:55:40.199 align:start position:0%
to have compassion and discretion and we
 
01:55:43.589 --> 01:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:43.599 --> 01:55:45.149 align:start position:0%
 
separate

01:55:45.149 --> 01:55:45.159 align:start position:0%
separate
 
01:55:48.189 --> 01:55:48.199 align:start position:0%
ideas which Library materials book
 
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
materials and teacher materials
 
01:55:55.910 --> 01:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
represent ideas and reality of children
 
01:55:58.950 --> 01:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
going through sexual abuse which is what
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
the representatives uh the the C school
 
01:56:06.310 --> 01:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
counselors have to deal with but this
 
01:56:08.830 --> 01:56:08.840 align:start position:0%
law will and it has all these problems
 
01:56:12.189 --> 01:56:12.199 align:start position:0%
with it that the lawyers have discussed
 
01:56:12.199 --> 01:56:13.470 align:start position:0%
with it that the lawyers have discussed
about

01:56:13.470 --> 01:56:13.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:56:16.390 --> 01:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
local a collection development policy a

library collection development policy
 
01:56:22.030 --> 01:56:22.040 align:start position:0%

01:56:23.709 --> 01:56:23.719 align:start position:0%
available on the American Library
 
01:56:26.510 --> 01:56:26.520 align:start position:0%

violation of federal law as one of the
 
01:57:58.510 --> 01:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
previous people who testified mentioned

you just clarify where in federal law
 
01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
may be already a violation yes it's it's
 
01:58:19.510 --> 01:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
a 47 code of federal regulations 54.5

ex I'm sorry I'm an educated person but
 
01:59:10.189 --> 01:59:10.199 align:start position:0%
I am so nervous about
 
01:59:14.229 --> 01:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
this excretion excretion depicts
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
describes represents in patently
 
01:59:18.270 --> 01:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
offensive way with respect to what is
 
01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
suitable for minor
 
01:59:23.629 --> 01:59:23.639 align:start position:0%

of the genitals and taken as a whole
 
01:59:34.629 --> 01:59:34.639 align:start position:0%
lack serious literary art this you got
 
01:59:36.470 --> 01:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
this they took you took this probably
 
01:59:39.990 --> 01:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
from here from this us code of children
 
01:59:41.669 --> 01:59:41.679 align:start position:0%
protection act you probably took it from
 
01:59:44.189 --> 01:59:44.199 align:start position:0%
that so we don't need it we don't need
 
01:59:45.430 --> 01:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
this bill because we already have a
 
01:59:48.069 --> 01:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
federal Bill may I ask a followup thank
 
01:59:50.270 --> 01:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
you very much yes thank you and thank
 
01:59:52.069 --> 01:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
you for that answer and I hope you
 
01:59:53.910 --> 01:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
provide that as well I mean I I don't
 
01:59:56.350 --> 01:59:56.360 align:start position:0%
think we should impinge upon the freedom
 
01:59:58.350 --> 01:59:58.360 align:start position:0%
of a teacher to make these discretion I
 
02:00:00.030 --> 02:00:00.040 align:start position:0%
think we need to keep this Miller
 
02:00:02.669 --> 02:00:02.679 align:start position:0%
decision I've never heard of it before
 
02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:06.719 align:start position:0%
but what I'm proposing is that we follow
 
02:00:09.149 --> 02:00:09.159 align:start position:0%
the American Library Association
 
02:00:11.830 --> 02:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
guidelines for collection development
 
02:00:15.270 --> 02:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
policy which is misleading what the
 
02:00:18.149 --> 02:00:18.159 align:start position:0%
collection development policy says is
 
02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
that there will be a local committee
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
formed who will voluntarily read
 
02:00:27.669 --> 02:00:27.679 align:start position:0%
whatever challenge material has been put
 
02:00:30.310 --> 02:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
filled out by the form here
 
02:00:32.629 --> 02:00:32.639 align:start position:0%
reconsideration of Library materials
 
02:00:34.830 --> 02:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
form which a parent like Betsy would
 
02:00:37.750 --> 02:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
have to fill out okay would go to a
 
02:00:39.950 --> 02:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
committee this committee would read this
 
02:00:42.390 --> 02:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
material and this committee would make a
 
02:00:45.470 --> 02:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
decision as to whether or not a local
 
02:00:49.229 --> 02:00:49.239 align:start position:0%
committee that's a parent a student a
 
02:00:52.430 --> 02:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
teacher a a Community member and a
 
02:00:55.310 --> 02:00:55.320 align:start position:0%
school board member five people and they
 
02:00:58.149 --> 02:00:58.159 align:start position:0%
vote do we keep this material in our
 
02:01:00.550 --> 02:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
library or in our school curriculum or
 
02:01:04.390 --> 02:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
not not the elected school board at the
 
02:01:08.109 --> 02:01:08.119 align:start position:0%
state level okay so I believe that the
 
02:01:09.790 --> 02:01:09.800 align:start position:0%
that this has been a gross
 
02:01:11.870 --> 02:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation throughout it's just
 
02:01:14.270 --> 02:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
been a piece that's missing there I have
 
02:01:16.990 --> 02:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
worked at I have been in employed at
 
02:01:19.270 --> 02:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
seven different public libraries the
 
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire only one library
 
02:01:26.270 --> 02:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
has had a collection development policy
 
02:01:28.390 --> 02:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
the policies in the public library in
 
02:01:31.229 --> 02:01:31.239 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire are lacking
 
02:01:33.270 --> 02:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
there are Librarians in this state that
 
02:01:35.790 --> 02:01:35.800 align:start position:0%
do not that are directors that do not
 
02:01:38.270 --> 02:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
have a master's degree that are not
 
02:01:41.069 --> 02:01:41.079 align:start position:0%
educated in the fact that these policies
 
02:01:44.750 --> 02:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
need to be in place I still oppose this
 
02:01:47.350 --> 02:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for your time thank you
 
02:01:55.149 --> 02:01:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:01.750 --> 02:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:06.790 align:start position:0%
 
question

02:02:06.790 --> 02:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:09.229 --> 02:02:09.239 align:start position:0%

from the New Hampshire school boards

Association um just to be clear um the
 
02:02:18.990 --> 02:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
school boards Association is not taking
 
02:02:20.870 --> 02:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
taking a position on this bill uh there
 
02:02:23.069 --> 02:02:23.079 align:start position:0%
are some things um that we find a little
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
problematic but there are things that we
 
02:02:25.750 --> 02:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
think um within the bill that are
 
02:02:28.629 --> 02:02:28.639 align:start position:0%
workable as well too um I know um I've
 
02:02:30.310 --> 02:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
got three minutes I've got about 10
 
02:02:32.229 --> 02:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
points I'm going to try and get to in in
 
02:02:36.189 --> 02:02:36.199 align:start position:0%
those three minutes um again uh uh no
 
02:02:38.990 --> 02:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
position on the bill um our our local
 
02:02:42.229 --> 02:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
school boards um uh nhba members just
 
02:02:44.430 --> 02:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
last October adopted the following two
 
02:02:47.589 --> 02:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
resolutions in October 2023 the first
 
02:02:51.109 --> 02:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
one nhsp ba opposes any legislation that
 
02:02:53.870 --> 02:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
divests local school boards of original
 
02:02:55.950 --> 02:02:55.960 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction relative to complaints
 
02:02:57.910 --> 02:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
about local curriculum instruction and
 
02:02:59.830 --> 02:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
instructional material instructional
 
02:03:01.950 --> 02:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
resources such as books library
 
02:03:03.310 --> 02:03:03.320 align:start position:0%
materials and other instructional
 
02:03:05.830 --> 02:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
resources further nsba opposes any
 
02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
legislation that subjects School
 
02:03:10.030 --> 02:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
District staff to civil La lawsuits and
 
02:03:11.629 --> 02:03:11.639 align:start position:0%
sanctions relative to curriculum and
 
02:03:13.510 --> 02:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
instruction that was one resolution
 
02:03:15.669 --> 02:03:15.679 align:start position:0%
adopted by our members last October a
 
02:03:17.510 --> 02:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
second corresponding resolution also
 
02:03:20.550 --> 02:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
adopted last October NH hsba affirms the
 
02:03:22.830 --> 02:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
qualifications of School District staff
 
02:03:24.430 --> 02:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
to research and select appropriate
 
02:03:26.310 --> 02:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
digital and printed materials for
 
02:03:28.069 --> 02:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
schools literary and curricular
 
02:03:30.030 --> 02:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
collections should offer students
 
02:03:31.750 --> 02:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
information that provides a balance of
 
02:03:34.109 --> 02:03:34.119 align:start position:0%
cultural views further literary
 
02:03:35.750 --> 02:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
collections should represent diverse
 
02:03:37.189 --> 02:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
points of view provide a Global
 
02:03:38.990 --> 02:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
Perspective stimulate essential thinking
 
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
skills and meet the interests abilities
 
02:03:43.270 --> 02:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
learning styles and information needs of
 
02:03:45.549 --> 02:03:45.559 align:start position:0%
the Learning Community uh so those two
 
02:03:47.709 --> 02:03:47.719 align:start position:0%
resolutions are the basis of NHS Ba's
 
02:03:51.830 --> 02:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
testimony um a handful um of the um uh
 
02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
the the the complaint process outlined
 
02:03:56.390 --> 02:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
in the bill um we have some concerns
 
02:03:58.430 --> 02:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
with it but we think that it's workable
 
02:04:00.549 --> 02:04:00.559 align:start position:0%
perhaps with an amendment um as the
 
02:04:02.750 --> 02:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
committee may know um representative PA
 
02:04:05.870 --> 02:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
testified earlier he has House Bill
 
02:04:08.350 --> 02:04:08.360 align:start position:0%
1311 um and the title of that bill is
 
02:04:09.950 --> 02:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
relative to school district collection
 
02:04:12.790 --> 02:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
development and reconsideration policies
 
02:04:14.790 --> 02:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
um as you this committee may remember we
 
02:04:17.510 --> 02:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
had a bill last year on this subject
 
02:04:20.069 --> 02:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
nsba um offered an amendment to
 
02:04:21.270 --> 02:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli and
 
02:04:23.589 --> 02:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
representative lad about developing a
 
02:04:25.709 --> 02:04:25.719 align:start position:0%
complaint process if you will for local
 
02:04:28.030 --> 02:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
school boards we have to adopt a policy
 
02:04:30.549 --> 02:04:30.559 align:start position:0%
um that's where nsba has no objection um
 
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
adopting a policy for parents to come in
 
02:04:34.510 --> 02:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
and make a complaint or raise a concern
 
02:04:36.589 --> 02:04:36.599 align:start position:0%
with a particular course material or
 
02:04:38.669 --> 02:04:38.679 align:start position:0%
Library material and then some process
 
02:04:41.229 --> 02:04:41.239 align:start position:0%
of review locally and hsba can fully
 
02:04:44.229 --> 02:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
support that um the provisions that are
 
02:04:47.549 --> 02:04:47.559 align:start position:0%
in uh this bill in 1419 about the
 
02:04:50.510 --> 02:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
specific um uh appeals processed that
 
02:04:52.470 --> 02:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli laid out it's a
 
02:04:54.790 --> 02:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
little perhaps too restrictive or too
 
02:04:57.229 --> 02:04:57.239 align:start position:0%
stringent um than what nsba might
 
02:04:59.189 --> 02:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
recommend but we think maybe between
 
02:05:01.830 --> 02:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
representative PA's Bill and this bill
 
02:05:04.149 --> 02:05:04.159 align:start position:0%
and perhaps some input from uh nhba if
 
02:05:05.470 --> 02:05:05.480 align:start position:0%
you would like it or looking at other
 
02:05:07.350 --> 02:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
policies from around the states that
 
02:05:09.790 --> 02:05:09.800 align:start position:0%
seem to have been um successful maybe um
 
02:05:11.830 --> 02:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
some bipartisan language can come from
 
02:05:13.910 --> 02:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
that uh you may also remember when we
 
02:05:15.830 --> 02:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
had the bill last year I printed off I
 
02:05:17.950 --> 02:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
think I found policies from maybe eight
 
02:05:19.910 --> 02:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
or 10 School SCH districts from from
 
02:05:21.589 --> 02:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
this committee communities that you
 
02:05:23.470 --> 02:05:23.480 align:start position:0%
represent um I thought there were some
 
02:05:25.430 --> 02:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
really good ones um within there as well
 
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
too I don't know if I still have those
 
02:05:29.189 --> 02:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
on f file but nhsp is happy to do some
 
02:05:31.030 --> 02:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
of that research and come back to the
 
02:05:33.229 --> 02:05:33.239 align:start position:0%
committee um with a a Statewide
 
02:05:35.069 --> 02:05:35.079 align:start position:0%
perspective of what some other districts
 
02:05:36.109 --> 02:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
are doing relative to their
 
02:05:36.119 --> 02:05:38.149 align:start position:0%
are doing relative to their
reconsideration

02:05:38.149 --> 02:05:38.159 align:start position:0%
reconsideration
 
02:05:41.870 --> 02:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
policies uh trying to get to the points
 
02:05:45.030 --> 02:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
made um we would certainly object to the
 
02:05:47.350 --> 02:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
um the appeal uh to the State Board of
 
02:05:49.390 --> 02:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
Education at the very least least if
 
02:05:50.589 --> 02:05:50.599 align:start position:0%
there's going to be an appeal to the
 
02:05:53.229 --> 02:05:53.239 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education um then the
 
02:05:55.709 --> 02:05:55.719 align:start position:0%
aggrieved party um from the uh uh the
 
02:05:57.390 --> 02:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
decision of the State Board should be
 
02:05:58.709 --> 02:05:58.719 align:start position:0%
able to appeal to the to the New
 
02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court as well too the
 
02:06:02.350 --> 02:06:02.360 align:start position:0%
other comments that were made about
 
02:06:03.549 --> 02:06:03.559 align:start position:0%
putting in the hands of sort of
 
02:06:05.470 --> 02:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
unelected bureaucrats at the state level
 
02:06:07.229 --> 02:06:07.239 align:start position:0%
that don't represent that community and
 
02:06:10.069 --> 02:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
hsba certainly rep uh uh uh would Echo
 
02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
those those uh sentiments um one other
 
02:06:16.510 --> 02:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
point just that it's a more a
 
02:06:19.350 --> 02:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
clarification um that I'm not to
 
02:06:22.870 --> 02:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
um page two line 21 um representative
 
02:06:24.910 --> 02:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
Cordell you said no the bill States no
 
02:06:26.990 --> 02:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
later than November 1st
 
02:06:29.390 --> 02:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
2025 each local school board shall have
 
02:06:30.990 --> 02:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
a complaint policy I'm wondering if you
 
02:06:33.950 --> 02:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
meant 24 by that because 25 would be a
 
02:06:36.709 --> 02:06:36.719 align:start position:0%
year plus out um If This Were to go
 
02:06:39.629 --> 02:06:39.639 align:start position:0%
through um uh again represent pry I
 
02:06:40.750 --> 02:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
don't know if you met November 1st of
 
02:06:44.669 --> 02:06:44.679 align:start position:0%
2024 or 2025 either way 2024 might be a
 
02:06:46.709 --> 02:06:46.719 align:start position:0%
little bit tight 2025 obviously gives us
 
02:06:48.390 --> 02:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
a year and a half if we need to move
 
02:06:50.950 --> 02:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
that up like a January 1 2025 would be
 
02:06:53.830 --> 02:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
workable as well too and the last point
 
02:07:00.109 --> 02:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
that I want to make um so uh on page
 
02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
two line of 17 and 18 no school district
 
02:07:07.109 --> 02:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
um person employed by a school district
 
02:07:08.990 --> 02:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
or person who contracts with a school
 
02:07:10.790 --> 02:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
district shall make available this
 
02:07:12.870 --> 02:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
material okay so we know it applies to
 
02:07:14.870 --> 02:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
districts and District employees and
 
02:07:17.589 --> 02:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
School District contractors however if
 
02:07:20.669 --> 02:07:20.679 align:start position:0%
we jump to um the enforcement and
 
02:07:22.990 --> 02:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
penalties provision on page three I'm
 
02:07:25.390 --> 02:07:25.400 align:start position:0%
inan lines that paragraph starts at line
 
02:07:28.750 --> 02:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
28 goes down to 34 um I'm reading the
 
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
end of line 29 a civil action against a
 
02:07:34.069 --> 02:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
school or School District in Superior
 
02:07:35.629 --> 02:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
Court may be filed for legal or
 
02:07:37.910 --> 02:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
Equitable relief um if we have a
 
02:07:39.629 --> 02:07:39.639 align:start position:0%
contractor I mean obviously the school
 
02:07:40.950 --> 02:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
district has an obligation to know what
 
02:07:42.990 --> 02:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
the contractor is doing as well too
 
02:07:45.109 --> 02:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
within the school district but the the
 
02:07:46.709 --> 02:07:46.719 align:start position:0%
the Civil penalty should also apply to
 
02:07:48.189 --> 02:07:48.199 align:start position:0%
the contractor as well too will not
 
02:07:50.229 --> 02:07:50.239 align:start position:0%
necess necessarily um only the school
 
02:07:52.910 --> 02:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
district or only the employee um I think
 
02:07:55.069 --> 02:07:55.079 align:start position:0%
those are nhs's points thank you for
 
02:07:56.390 --> 02:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
giving me a couple extra minutes
 
02:07:58.430 --> 02:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
representative lad um again we're not
 
02:08:01.270 --> 02:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
taking a position on this bill um the
 
02:08:03.149 --> 02:08:03.159 align:start position:0%
the the the complaint process NH hsba
 
02:08:04.510 --> 02:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
has no problem working with this
 
02:08:06.149 --> 02:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
committee representative paig
 
02:08:07.669 --> 02:08:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli to come up with
 
02:08:09.270 --> 02:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
something that maybe would fit in the
 
02:08:11.149 --> 02:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
middle um and with that I'm happy to

the record so we're going to close this
 
02:08:56.440 --> 02:08:57.510 align:start position:0%
the record so we're going to close this
here

02:08:57.510 --> 02:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:09:00.510 --> 02:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
1419 and we're going to be taking a five
 
02:09:02.189 --> 02:09:02.199 align:start position:0%
minute break
 
02:09:04.549 --> 02:09:04.559 align:start position:0%
here five minute break and come back and
 
02:09:15.830 --> 02:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:21.510 --> 02:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
up okay what do I um so like just just
 
02:09:24.390 --> 02:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
just get one of those like and I didn't
 
02:09:25.709 --> 02:09:25.719 align:start position:0%
even know if it's relevant that she
 
02:09:27.430 --> 02:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
should give me all that lady who the
 
02:09:30.510 --> 02:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
second last person all kinds of stuff
 
02:09:34.149 --> 02:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
but she submitted it as part of her I
 
02:09:35.709 --> 02:09:35.719 align:start position:0%
okay you don't have to question it
 
02:09:38.830 --> 02:09:38.840 align:start position:0%
justat it in just thought I'd asked it's
 
02:09:47.310 --> 02:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:47.320 --> 02:10:17.229 align:start position:0%
 
unusual

02:10:17.229 --> 02:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:17.239 --> 02:19:16.429 align:start position:0%
 
I

02:19:16.429 --> 02:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:16.439 --> 02:20:49.750 align:start position:0%
 
she

02:20:49.750 --> 02:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:53.830 --> 02:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
$50 million no less than $50 million and
 
02:20:56.389 --> 02:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
in each time it comes out of this
 
02:20:58.389 --> 02:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
committee but goes to finance and it's
 
02:21:01.670 --> 02:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
it's doesn't go any farther and so what
 
02:21:04.349 --> 02:21:04.359 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is react to the
 
02:21:06.110 --> 02:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
sheets which we got from the Bureau of
 
02:21:08.469 --> 02:21:08.479 align:start position:0%
school safety and Facilities earlier
 
02:21:10.309 --> 02:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
this year when we had orientation and we
 
02:21:12.309 --> 02:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
saw the number applications were coming
 
02:21:14.550 --> 02:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
in for school building Aid we saw the
 
02:21:16.910 --> 02:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
amount of money which those applications
 
02:21:20.190 --> 02:21:20.200 align:start position:0%
would incur or cost the the state as
 
02:21:23.190 --> 02:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
well as locals and we know that of those
 
02:21:25.630 --> 02:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
applications of the 17 that were
 
02:21:27.990 --> 02:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
applications which were considered by
 
02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:28.830 align:start position:0%
applications which were considered by
the

02:21:28.830 --> 02:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:21:31.309 --> 02:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
state we
 
02:21:34.950 --> 02:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
approved three top two three three three
 
02:21:37.429 --> 02:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
applications or so and the others didn't
 
02:21:41.070 --> 02:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
receive anything and so it comes down to
 
02:21:44.750 --> 02:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
the issue that we are now have a formula
 
02:21:46.670 --> 02:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
which we have to subtract out of the $50
 
02:21:49.870 --> 02:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
million as we appropriate each year the
 
02:21:52.910 --> 02:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
cost of our debt and that subtracts out
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
and then the remainder is what you can
 
02:21:56.910 --> 02:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
use for school building AIDS so we have
 
02:21:59.110 --> 02:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
incurred as when I came in here I've
 
02:22:00.990 --> 02:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned many times before we had over
 
02:22:04.830 --> 02:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
$500 million in debt that we had accured
 
02:22:06.590 --> 02:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
we have to pay that debt off and we've
 
02:22:08.830 --> 02:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
been doing that just whittling it down
 
02:22:11.429 --> 02:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
over the years and but we still have
 
02:22:13.070 --> 02:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
debt and we won't be done a lot of that
 
02:22:14.950 --> 02:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
till the year
 
02:22:17.950 --> 02:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
2041 and and so it doesn't leave the
 
02:22:21.830 --> 02:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
money available each year of the bium
 
02:22:25.150 --> 02:22:25.160 align:start position:0%
for new renovation or construction
 
02:22:29.670 --> 02:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
projects this bill is trying to attack
 
02:22:32.870 --> 02:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
how we appropriate the money and how
 
02:22:36.950 --> 02:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
much we appropriate and and and and then
 
02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
have it available for the applications
 
02:22:41.429 --> 02:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
consideration by the the department and
 
02:22:43.990 --> 02:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education so I want
 
02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
to walk you through this real quickly
 
02:22:48.950 --> 02:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
here um this has not is this bill is not
 
02:22:52.950 --> 02:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
one which is trying to redefine um the
 
02:22:55.150 --> 02:22:55.160 align:start position:0%
the end product there's some bills which
 
02:22:56.590 --> 02:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
are going to come through where a flat
 
02:22:58.630 --> 02:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
amount of money is issued each year to
 
02:23:01.469 --> 02:23:01.479 align:start position:0%
the districts putting this to uh the
 
02:23:04.710 --> 02:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
treasury and and then interest is earned
 
02:23:06.230 --> 02:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
and when it builds up you can do your
 
02:23:08.630 --> 02:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
renovation project this is not that bill
 
02:23:10.670 --> 02:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with that so in
 
02:23:12.950 --> 02:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill and if you have 1570
 
02:23:15.269 --> 02:23:15.279 align:start position:0%
in front of you we can walk through it
 
02:23:18.150 --> 02:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
and I'll try to go by these sections and
 
02:23:21.670 --> 02:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
the first one right there is uh Roman 1
 
02:23:23.750 --> 02:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
and you see 2 3 4 going down the left
 
02:23:26.269 --> 02:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
hand side of that page within on number
 
02:23:28.389 --> 02:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
one within the education trust fund a
 
02:23:30.670 --> 02:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
separate District fund is created so
 
02:23:32.550 --> 02:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do now is take and
 
02:23:35.630 --> 02:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate in the the state uh
 
02:23:39.030 --> 02:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
education trust fund a separate fund
 
02:23:42.550 --> 02:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
that's called the State Building Aid
 
02:23:45.510 --> 02:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
fund at the end of going down to Roman
 
02:23:49.429 --> 02:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
two at the end of fy2 the treasure shall
 
02:23:54.550 --> 02:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
transfer into that fund $75 million from
 
02:23:57.870 --> 02:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
the FR uh State trust fund to the State
 
02:24:00.750 --> 02:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
Building Aid fund so we'd have money
 
02:24:04.429 --> 02:24:04.439 align:start position:0%
placed into the school building Aid fund
 
02:24:08.030 --> 02:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
that's in the State uh education trust
 
02:24:11.590 --> 02:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
fund currently and what's right there by
 
02:24:11.600 --> 02:24:12.830 align:start position:0%
fund currently and what's right there by
the

02:24:12.830 --> 02:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:24:17.670 --> 02:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
fy2 Roman 3 for FY 26 and each
 
02:24:19.389 --> 02:24:19.399 align:start position:0%
subsequent year
 
02:24:22.150 --> 02:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
80% of the education trust fund
 
02:24:22.160 --> 02:24:23.630 align:start position:0%
80% of the education trust fund
operating

02:24:23.630 --> 02:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
operating
 
02:24:26.070 --> 02:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
Surplus would be transferred to this
 
02:24:28.190 --> 02:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
state building Aid fund so we're
 
02:24:30.349 --> 02:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
building up the State Building Aid fund
 
02:24:32.150 --> 02:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
so it's going to be well over aund and
 
02:24:34.750 --> 02:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
some odd million
 
02:24:38.190 --> 02:24:38.200 align:start position:0%
do going down to Roman four slipping
 
02:24:40.349 --> 02:24:40.359 align:start position:0%
down that page the State Building aid
 
02:24:44.070 --> 02:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
funds used will be used for spilling Aid
 
02:24:45.349 --> 02:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
to school
 
02:24:47.950 --> 02:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
districts and charter
 
02:24:51.590 --> 02:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
schools so the applica the application
 
02:24:53.590 --> 02:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
the money for new projects would come
 
02:24:56.590 --> 02:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
out of that uh state fund which is in
 
02:25:00.150 --> 02:25:00.160 align:start position:0%
the uh that is that's been separated out
 
02:25:01.990 --> 02:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's within the education trust fund but
 
02:25:04.750 --> 02:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
it's a separate fund
 
02:25:07.389 --> 02:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
Within part the second thing it would do
 
02:25:10.510 --> 02:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
is develop and support the 10-year plan
 
02:25:13.670 --> 02:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
which we have talked about but we've had
 
02:25:17.469 --> 02:25:17.479 align:start position:0%
no way of of of uh supporting that plan
 
02:25:20.110 --> 02:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
and costing how much that would cost
 
02:25:22.389 --> 02:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
this would delve back into it and
 
02:25:23.990 --> 02:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
containing the potential for building
 
02:25:26.790 --> 02:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
Aid projects this 10-year plan is a plan
 
02:25:28.550 --> 02:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
as you may recall that we've talked
 
02:25:30.469 --> 02:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
about in the past where we're trying to
 
02:25:32.389 --> 02:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
get a better handle on what's out there
 
02:25:34.269 --> 02:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
in the field in terms of of our
 
02:25:36.389 --> 02:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
facilities and what condition those
 
02:25:39.030 --> 02:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
facilities are in so we as a general
 
02:25:41.950 --> 02:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
court can better forast where we're
 
02:25:44.309 --> 02:25:44.319 align:start position:0%
going in the next 10 years in terms of
 
02:25:46.630 --> 02:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and basing that forecast
 
02:25:48.870 --> 02:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
BAS based upon the needs we discern that
 
02:25:52.710 --> 02:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
in that um 10-year plan and lastly
 
02:25:55.750 --> 02:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
monies from that building uh Aid trust
 
02:25:58.110 --> 02:25:58.120 align:start position:0%
fund could be used for the
 
02:26:01.469 --> 02:26:01.479 align:start position:0%
administration of this program that we
 
02:26:05.269 --> 02:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
currently have the the um 10-year plan
 
02:26:08.269 --> 02:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
and and management of of the of the
 
02:26:12.070 --> 02:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
building Aid projects Roman four five
 
02:26:14.469 --> 02:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
I'm going through quickly here I know it
 
02:26:18.190 --> 02:26:18.200 align:start position:0%
the the earning or the interest from the
 
02:26:21.230 --> 02:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
fund placed in the building a fund those
 
02:26:23.230 --> 02:26:23.240 align:start position:0%
those that money goes right back in the
 
02:26:25.269 --> 02:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
fund it's not co-mingled with the back
 
02:26:27.469 --> 02:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
into the education trust fund any
 
02:26:29.230 --> 02:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
interest that's gained by the money
 
02:26:30.630 --> 02:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
that's been put aside in this building
 
02:26:32.950 --> 02:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
Aid fund stays there the interest goes
 
02:26:35.950 --> 02:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
back into that fund and the fund is
 
02:26:38.110 --> 02:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
non-aps other words monies which are
 
02:26:40.389 --> 02:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
appropriated they're non-aps they
 
02:26:42.190 --> 02:26:42.200 align:start position:0%
continue to be used for the purpose they
 
02:26:46.110 --> 02:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
were designed for in Roman 6 uh going
 
02:26:47.950 --> 02:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
down the page AG here we're going down
 
02:26:51.070 --> 02:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
on line 19 now the department May retain
 
02:26:53.550 --> 02:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
up to 3% of the total annual
 
02:26:56.030 --> 02:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
appropriation and interest for
 
02:26:58.389 --> 02:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
administration of the program so that
 
02:27:01.269 --> 02:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
there's a way of building in support to
 
02:27:03.190 --> 02:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
manage an administer program and that
 
02:27:06.590 --> 02:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
says up to so somebody might say well 3%
 
02:27:09.830 --> 02:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
of $100 million you know no it's up to
 
02:27:11.349 --> 02:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
and that would have to be figured out
 
02:27:14.429 --> 02:27:14.439 align:start position:0%
through ruem Etc which is in this
 
02:27:17.590 --> 02:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
bill no building Aid money and Roman 7
 
02:27:19.590 --> 02:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
seven there shall be used for approv
 
02:27:22.030 --> 02:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
projects prior to July 25 we want the
 
02:27:25.190 --> 02:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
money to acrew to include use for Debt
 
02:27:27.190 --> 02:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
Service payments other words the money
 
02:27:29.469 --> 02:27:29.479 align:start position:0%
which slides into that immediately would
 
02:27:31.910 --> 02:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
not be able use use to pay off debt we
 
02:27:34.230 --> 02:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
want to build up that trust the building
 
02:27:36.510 --> 02:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
Aid fund so that the monies will be
 
02:27:39.269 --> 02:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
there to absolutely support the
 
02:27:42.950 --> 02:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
allocation of $50 million each year for
 
02:27:45.790 --> 02:27:45.800 align:start position:0%
new construction and construction not
 
02:27:48.590 --> 02:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
paying off old
 
02:27:52.670 --> 02:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
debt um going into section two of the uh
 
02:27:55.429 --> 02:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
the bill here where it says 1898 15a
 
02:27:55.439 --> 02:27:56.590 align:start position:0%
the bill here where it says 1898 15a

02:28:03.269 --> 02:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
the under a there a uh School building
 
02:28:06.150 --> 02:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
Aid grants noer grants approved for
 
02:28:08.150 --> 02:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
construction renovation by your state
 
02:28:10.790 --> 02:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
board shall not exceed $50 million per
 
02:28:12.750 --> 02:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal years that remains pretty much
 
02:28:15.590 --> 02:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
the same as where we've been uh and it
 
02:28:17.950 --> 02:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
also goes in in reads Grant shall be
 
02:28:19.990 --> 02:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
funded from Appropriations from the
 
02:28:22.110 --> 02:28:22.120 align:start position:0%
building Aid fund as referenc in this
 
02:28:24.389 --> 02:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
legislation within the state operating
 
02:28:27.870 --> 02:28:27.880 align:start position:0%
budget so any grant grant aids for
 
02:28:29.389 --> 02:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
building Aid have to come out of the
 
02:28:30.950 --> 02:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
school building Aid
 
02:28:34.950 --> 02:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
fund um the reference to the 10-year
 
02:28:36.469 --> 02:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
plan I'm sliding through this very
 
02:28:38.750 --> 02:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
quickly on page two now where you see uh
 
02:28:43.110 --> 02:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
Roman five at the Top Line 20 line three
 
02:28:44.429 --> 02:28:44.439 align:start position:0%
the department shall develop and
 
02:28:46.110 --> 02:28:46.120 align:start position:0%
maintain a 10-year school facilities
 
02:28:48.230 --> 02:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
plan we have that in place right now
 
02:28:49.750 --> 02:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
that a lot of this language is there
 
02:28:52.910 --> 02:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
it's in current law um and that that's
 
02:28:55.550 --> 02:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
trying to identify the potential for
 
02:28:59.230 --> 02:28:59.240 align:start position:0%
projects and projects include but not
 
02:29:01.349 --> 02:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
limited to criteria there's a criteria
 
02:29:03.389 --> 02:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
for these projects to be in the 10e plan
 
02:29:04.790 --> 02:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
and I've written them down in the sheet
 
02:29:06.469 --> 02:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
that you have there's a whole lot of
 
02:29:10.190 --> 02:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
criteria that's in 1 9815
 
02:29:14.950 --> 02:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
C2 B and those are already in place in
 
02:29:18.190 --> 02:29:18.200 align:start position:0%
law so we would use the same criteria
 
02:29:20.950 --> 02:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
that's established right now the intent
 
02:29:24.150 --> 02:29:24.160 align:start position:0%
of the 10e plan is to identify enhance
 
02:29:26.349 --> 02:29:26.359 align:start position:0%
school facilities to provide safe
 
02:29:28.190 --> 02:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
healthy and efficient buildings that
 
02:29:30.710 --> 02:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
provide adequate learning environments
 
02:29:33.710 --> 02:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
and we know that we have aged buildings
 
02:29:36.670 --> 02:29:36.680 align:start position:0%
in the state right now well over half of
 
02:29:41.150 --> 02:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
them are are over 50 55 years old some
 
02:29:43.429 --> 02:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
of them are so old that they haven't had
 
02:29:46.150 --> 02:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
Renovations either and as in this
 
02:29:47.910 --> 02:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
building right here there was much heat
 
02:29:49.990 --> 02:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
this morning and that's because we have
 
02:29:51.950 --> 02:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
an Antiquated system up above the fourth
 
02:29:53.309 --> 02:29:53.319 align:start position:0%
floor in the
 
02:29:57.349 --> 02:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
Attic yeah I agree with you then going
 
02:29:58.670 --> 02:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
down in the bottom of that sheet on the
 
02:30:00.910 --> 02:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
back side that I handed out to you the
 
02:30:03.429 --> 02:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
State Board shall develop Rules pursuant
 
02:30:03.439 --> 02:30:04.389 align:start position:0%
State Board shall develop Rules pursuant
to

02:30:04.389 --> 02:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:30:07.830 --> 02:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
541a This is a plan this is a whole
 
02:30:10.790 --> 02:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
rewrite of how we fund an appropriate
 
02:30:13.110 --> 02:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
dollars for school building Aid and this
 
02:30:15.150 --> 02:30:15.160 align:start position:0%
will take a lot of our attention in
 
02:30:17.910 --> 02:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
terms of studying and Reporting I'm not
 
02:30:19.630 --> 02:30:19.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily looking at something to come
 
02:30:21.790 --> 02:30:21.800 align:start position:0%
out immediately on this one this is an
 
02:30:24.790 --> 02:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
area that we've tried to appropriate
 
02:30:27.269 --> 02:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
dollars and try to go up no less than
 
02:30:30.550 --> 02:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
$50 million no more than $50 million and
 
02:30:32.190 --> 02:30:32.200 align:start position:0%
it Remains the Same and we're still
 
02:30:33.870 --> 02:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with that debt and our debt is
 
02:30:35.990 --> 02:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
whittling down it is whittling down so
 
02:30:38.349 --> 02:30:38.359 align:start position:0%
there' be more each year but we need to
 
02:30:40.070 --> 02:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
get on it we can't let some of these
 
02:30:42.269 --> 02:30:42.279 align:start position:0%
buildings such as the one that was uh
 
02:30:46.469 --> 02:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
next line down in the uh uh approved
 
02:30:49.230 --> 02:30:49.240 align:start position:0%
projects the conquered situation we're
 
02:30:51.110 --> 02:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
getting now into some larger buildings
 
02:30:53.309 --> 02:30:53.319 align:start position:0%
we're up getting an extreme cost of $70
 
02:30:56.309 --> 02:30:56.319 align:start position:0%
million projects and that's more than we
 
02:30:58.230 --> 02:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
allocate in a given year and of course
 
02:30:59.710 --> 02:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
the state share would be a certain part
 
02:31:01.389 --> 02:31:01.399 align:start position:0%
of that but we're going to get some
 
02:31:03.030 --> 02:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
larger high schools coming in here and
 
02:31:05.790 --> 02:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
needing support unless we do something
 
02:31:08.349 --> 02:31:08.359 align:start position:0%
about how we appropriate dollars how we
 
02:31:10.670 --> 02:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
allocate these dollars out it's it's
 
02:31:13.510 --> 02:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
going to it's it's a a tsunami coming at
 
02:31:15.510 --> 02:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
us and we have to do something about
 
02:31:18.790 --> 02:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
this and this bill itself is uh offering
 
02:31:21.190 --> 02:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
a new process for doing this and I'd
 
02:31:23.190 --> 02:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
recommend that we consider it within the
 
02:31:25.230 --> 02:31:25.240 align:start position:0%
committee whether it be through an inal
 
02:31:27.750 --> 02:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
study or some something such as that
 
02:31:29.269 --> 02:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
right off there's not time in the next
 
02:31:31.550 --> 02:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
two or three weeks to do that but this
 
02:31:33.429 --> 02:31:33.439 align:start position:0%
is something that then we couple it with
 
02:31:34.790 --> 02:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
what's going to be coming over from the
 
02:31:37.429 --> 02:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
senate in terms of a a process there
 
02:31:39.110 --> 02:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
where is a flat amount given to each
 
02:31:42.349 --> 02:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
School each year put it in a trust fund
 
02:31:44.830 --> 02:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
and and let it acre there's a lot of
 
02:31:48.030 --> 02:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
issues with that as well so the whole
 
02:31:49.750 --> 02:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
issue building aid needs to be studied
 
02:31:51.469 --> 02:31:51.479 align:start position:0%
thoroughly thank you very much I'll
 
02:31:53.349 --> 02:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony I know it's
 
02:31:56.950 --> 02:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
lunchtime questions uh representative U
 
02:31:59.830 --> 02:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
dry thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
02:32:03.590 --> 02:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
chairman um is this kind of designed to
 
02:32:07.389 --> 02:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
give more schools money or fewer schools
 
02:32:09.670 --> 02:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
more money or a combination of both it
 
02:32:11.269 --> 02:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change that allocation for
 
02:32:12.710 --> 02:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
example if you're in a district you got
 
02:32:15.590 --> 02:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
a 60% right now of the you know the
 
02:32:17.469 --> 02:32:17.479 align:start position:0%
portion which is approved it will
 
02:32:19.389 --> 02:32:19.399 align:start position:0%
continue the same as that what we're
 
02:32:22.990 --> 02:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
trying to do is uh build up so we can
 
02:32:25.910 --> 02:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
get that debt into another column so we
 
02:32:30.269 --> 02:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
can start uh allocating $50 million out
 
02:32:33.710 --> 02:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
to these schools uh now this plan also
 
02:32:36.030 --> 02:32:36.040 align:start position:0%
allows for other grant money can be used
 
02:32:37.510 --> 02:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
if there's grant money from comes in
 
02:32:39.590 --> 02:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
from some angle you can couple that with
 
02:32:42.590 --> 02:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
this but uh it's primarily not trying to
 
02:32:44.469 --> 02:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
change the whole process where you have
 
02:32:46.550 --> 02:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
to submit your application by certain
 
02:32:48.349 --> 02:32:48.359 align:start position:0%
date it's looked and reviewed by the
 
02:32:51.070 --> 02:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
department it goes to State uh School
 
02:32:52.950 --> 02:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
building authority and then to the state
 
02:32:54.590 --> 02:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
board and and then you have to have your
 
02:32:56.389 --> 02:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
select board or select your town
 
02:32:58.630 --> 02:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
legislature has to approve the project
 
02:33:00.349 --> 02:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
we've changed all that application
 
02:33:02.910 --> 02:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
process that all remains in place we're
 
02:33:04.910 --> 02:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
not messing with that at all what we're
 
02:33:07.630 --> 02:33:07.640 align:start position:0%
looking at is the Appropriations we want
 
02:33:10.349 --> 02:33:10.359 align:start position:0%
to get more money into a separate fund
 
02:33:13.830 --> 02:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
and it's a non-aps fund in which we can
 
02:33:18.550 --> 02:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
build our address our 10year plan and
 
02:33:20.469 --> 02:33:20.479 align:start position:0%
this it's very that's a very important
 
02:33:22.830 --> 02:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
part of this right here where we right
 
02:33:25.150 --> 02:33:25.160 align:start position:0%
now we encourage districts to have a
 
02:33:29.550 --> 02:33:29.560 align:start position:0%
10-year plan we need a 10-year plan we
 
02:33:32.830 --> 02:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
need to have a contracted service a
 
02:33:35.309 --> 02:33:35.319 align:start position:0%
vendor go out and assess these buildings
 
02:33:37.630 --> 02:33:37.640 align:start position:0%
with the same criteria for all our
 
02:33:39.670 --> 02:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
buildings not just somebody within the
 
02:33:41.230 --> 02:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
district saying well here's our
 
02:33:42.910 --> 02:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
application and here are our priorities
 
02:33:44.710 --> 02:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
and we built it upon this certain
 
02:33:47.269 --> 02:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
criteria and varies from District to
 
02:33:49.790 --> 02:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
District um for us to plan and
 
02:33:51.830 --> 02:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate properly we need good
 
02:33:54.670 --> 02:33:54.680 align:start position:0%
information and the department simply uh
 
02:33:56.230 --> 02:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
with all the good people they have over
 
02:33:58.710 --> 02:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
there a lot of respect for the the gal
 
02:34:01.550 --> 02:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
sitting behind me but it's a she needs
 
02:34:03.590 --> 02:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
help and the department needs help in
 
02:34:06.830 --> 02:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
really meeting these needs I see school
 
02:34:08.590 --> 02:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
building ID as the fourth leg of the
 
02:34:10.710 --> 02:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
stool we have a curriculum alignment
 
02:34:14.070 --> 02:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
assessment and buildings you can't teach
 
02:34:16.790 --> 02:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
chemistry if you don't have a room or
 
02:34:19.790 --> 02:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
space available to teach it in thank
 
02:34:23.269 --> 02:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
you R wock thank you
 
02:34:26.550 --> 02:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
re thank you um taking this bull by the
 
02:34:29.150 --> 02:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
horns here I just have a a question I'm
 
02:34:31.830 --> 02:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
a little lost on um one of the questions
 
02:34:34.590 --> 02:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
I'm lost on on the first line 2223 when
 
02:34:38.429 --> 02:34:38.439 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the uh not the
 
02:34:41.510 --> 02:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
building projects Pro will not be pried
 
02:34:44.710 --> 02:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
July 25 so my question
 
02:34:47.550 --> 02:34:47.560 align:start position:0%
is if one of the multiple school
 
02:34:50.389 --> 02:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
districts today that have submitted to
 
02:34:52.510 --> 02:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
the state have been approved but they
 
02:34:54.670 --> 02:34:54.680 align:start position:0%
didn't fall that one two three we have
 
02:34:57.550 --> 02:34:57.560 align:start position:0%
and they say number 17 does that mean
 
02:34:59.309 --> 02:34:59.319 align:start position:0%
that even though they're 17 now and
 
02:35:00.870 --> 02:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
approved they won't be eligible to
 
02:35:02.070 --> 02:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
participate in this because they've been
 
02:35:04.550 --> 02:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
approved previously the buildings which
 
02:35:07.070 --> 02:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
have been approved and of course Amy
 
02:35:09.269 --> 02:35:09.279 align:start position:0%
Clark will be here that list is there
 
02:35:10.870 --> 02:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
and it exists and that's not going to
 
02:35:12.750 --> 02:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
change we're going to work down through
 
02:35:15.309 --> 02:35:15.319 align:start position:0%
that list I understand this okay I'm
 
02:35:17.230 --> 02:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
misreading that because I'm on the same
 
02:35:19.150 --> 02:35:19.160 align:start position:0%
line I'm misreading it then because said
 
02:35:20.910 --> 02:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
it can't be used for building projects
 
02:35:24.309 --> 02:35:24.319 align:start position:0%
approved prior to and so if they last
 
02:35:26.510 --> 02:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
year $50 million that's placed in that
 
02:35:29.349 --> 02:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
trust fund can't be used prior that date
 
02:35:31.550 --> 02:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
we have appropriated dollars for the
 
02:35:35.630 --> 02:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
bium we're in okay all right thank you I
 
02:35:37.190 --> 02:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
understand you're saying and and those
 
02:35:38.710 --> 02:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
technical like things we have people
 
02:35:40.670 --> 02:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
behind us with technical support so we
 
02:35:42.510 --> 02:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
can ask those thank
 
02:35:45.550 --> 02:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
you thank you um it is my understanding
 
02:35:47.469 --> 02:35:47.479 align:start position:0%
that the building aid program is
 
02:35:49.910 --> 02:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
struggling because of the debt that they
 
02:35:51.950 --> 02:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
have so is there anything in this bill
 
02:35:54.950 --> 02:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
that would prevent the student um
 
02:35:57.429 --> 02:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
building Aid fund from taking out a
 
02:35:59.590 --> 02:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
Federal loans the debt issue is not
 
02:36:01.590 --> 02:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
compounded anymore it STS right in this
 
02:36:06.950 --> 02:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
bill it's not used for debt so the we
 
02:36:11.469 --> 02:36:11.479 align:start position:0%
the I believe the idea in this is to
 
02:36:14.070 --> 02:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
have the debt paid off through monies
 
02:36:16.510 --> 02:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
which are not the $50 million which is
 
02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
appropriated for the purpose of
 
02:36:20.590 --> 02:36:20.600 align:start position:0%
renovation and construction there' be
 
02:36:23.590 --> 02:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
more money in this building uh trust
 
02:36:26.630 --> 02:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
this fund then is necessary for just the
 
02:36:29.550 --> 02:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
$50 million and that would be where the
 
02:36:32.190 --> 02:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
money would come out to pay debt and I
 
02:36:34.870 --> 02:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
believe that's like what $6 million or
 
02:36:37.429 --> 02:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
so each by any or more than that but
 
02:36:40.269 --> 02:36:40.279 align:start position:0%
we're getting it's it's whittling down
 
02:36:43.230 --> 02:36:43.240 align:start position:0%
um we had a remember we we had the
 
02:36:45.349 --> 02:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
information provided to us by the the
 
02:36:45.359 --> 02:36:46.590 align:start position:0%
information provided to us by the the
department

02:36:46.590 --> 02:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:36:50.349 --> 02:36:50.359 align:start position:0%
and they're sitting behind me but um
 
02:36:52.429 --> 02:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
right we can ask yeah you can ask you
 
02:36:54.070 --> 02:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
know the debt is right there yes you can
 
02:36:56.910 --> 02:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
see what the numbers are uh
 
02:36:59.510 --> 02:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
so ask that ask the technical stuff
 
02:37:02.150 --> 02:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
behind me please I'm I'm the messenger
 
02:37:05.070 --> 02:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
Miler no thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:37:07.190 --> 02:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so if I
 
02:37:10.150 --> 02:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
understand this we have the 50 million
 
02:37:11.950 --> 02:37:11.960 align:start position:0%
dollar that's already been allocated to
 
02:37:15.469 --> 02:37:15.479 align:start position:0%
the general fund correct right and this
 
02:37:18.790 --> 02:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
is an additional amount of money that
 
02:37:24.349 --> 02:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
comes at the end of the year from um the
 
02:37:26.230 --> 02:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
bance go into the fund that's the
 
02:37:29.309 --> 02:37:29.319 align:start position:0%
Surplus money from the trust fund so it
 
02:37:32.550 --> 02:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
creates a second fund within the
 
02:37:34.110 --> 02:37:34.120 align:start position:0%
education trust
 
02:37:37.510 --> 02:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
fund so you got basically two funds that
 
02:37:40.269 --> 02:37:40.279 align:start position:0%
are going to be providing uh School
 
02:37:43.190 --> 02:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
building Aid one no you you have we're
 
02:37:45.150 --> 02:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
taking money out of the education trust
 
02:37:47.230 --> 02:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
fund and put putting into this fund
 
02:37:50.389 --> 02:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
within the education trust fund so the
 
02:37:52.630 --> 02:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
money's going over there and it then it
 
02:37:54.590 --> 02:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
it is protected
 
02:37:56.950 --> 02:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
money and what will the new money be
 
02:37:58.630 --> 02:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
used for
 
02:38:01.190 --> 02:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
then the educ for construction and
 
02:38:03.870 --> 02:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
renovation only separate from the
 
02:38:06.230 --> 02:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
original $50
 
02:38:09.150 --> 02:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
million that this will be the $50
 
02:38:11.070 --> 02:38:11.080 align:start position:0%
million I
 
02:38:13.349 --> 02:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
understand it's coming out of the trust
 
02:38:15.230 --> 02:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
fund to be transferred into there and
 
02:38:16.550 --> 02:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
everything for new construction will
 
02:38:18.309 --> 02:38:18.319 align:start position:0%
come out of that new building Aid fund
 
02:38:19.910 --> 02:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
so are we creating then a fund that's
 
02:38:26.309 --> 02:38:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:30.150 --> 02:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
75 in subsequent Years first year we put
 
02:38:33.670 --> 02:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
in 75 million subsequent years you put
 
02:38:36.469 --> 02:38:36.479 align:start position:0%
80% of the Surplus which is left over at
 
02:38:38.710 --> 02:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
the end of the fiscal year into that
 
02:38:41.550 --> 02:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
fund 80% of the leftover money which
 
02:38:43.309 --> 02:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
would have gone into that trust fund
 
02:38:46.510 --> 02:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
would go in to the building Aid fund
 
02:38:47.630 --> 02:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
this is where you're going to get the
 
02:38:49.510 --> 02:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
money to support the construction that
 
02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:50.269 align:start position:0%
money to support the construction that
we

02:38:50.269 --> 02:38:50.279 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:38:53.710 --> 02:38:53.720 align:start position:0%
need thank you yeah any further
 
02:38:56.110 --> 02:38:56.120 align:start position:0%
questions oh thank you very much uh
 
02:39:07.510 --> 02:39:07.520 align:start position:0%

Department of Education the Bureau of
 
02:39:19.319 --> 02:39:20.349 align:start position:0%
Department of Education the Bureau of
school

02:39:20.349 --> 02:39:20.359 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:39:22.590 --> 02:39:22.600 align:start position:0%
facilities I'm Caitlyn Davis I am with
 
02:39:23.950 --> 02:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
the Department of the director of the
 
02:39:27.910 --> 02:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:30.710 --> 02:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
resources uh director Davis is joining
 
02:39:32.710 --> 02:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
me because a lot of this is uh money
 
02:39:35.070 --> 02:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
related and she's the expert in that so
 
02:39:37.830 --> 02:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh happy to take any questions and I can
 
02:39:40.950 --> 02:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh that you'd like uh questions for uh
 
02:39:43.870 --> 02:39:43.880 align:start position:0%
either uh representative McDonald uh
 
02:39:45.910 --> 02:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you I just had a question about
 
02:39:49.830 --> 02:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
the debt and the tail as if you will um
 
02:39:52.950 --> 02:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
would the $50 million be used to pay off
 
02:39:54.870 --> 02:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
debt or would it just be reserved for
 
02:39:57.750 --> 02:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
buildings and not debt use that's a good
 
02:40:01.630 --> 02:40:01.640 align:start position:0%
question in the um bill online on page
 
02:40:04.230 --> 02:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
one on line
 
02:40:07.150 --> 02:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
27 uh that language is crossed out where
 
02:40:09.309 --> 02:40:09.319 align:start position:0%
it says less any Debt Service payments
 
02:40:11.630 --> 02:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
um owed in the fiscal year so it's my
 
02:40:13.269 --> 02:40:13.279 align:start position:0%
understanding that 50 million will be
 
02:40:15.630 --> 02:40:15.640 align:start position:0%
transferred to the building Aid trust uh
 
02:40:17.630 --> 02:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
new fund that's created that's not going
 
02:40:19.750 --> 02:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
to include the debt service so that Debt
 
02:40:21.469 --> 02:40:21.479 align:start position:0%
Service would still have to be paid for
 
02:40:22.550 --> 02:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
just like it is now with an
 
02:40:24.190 --> 02:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation okay and then just a
 
02:40:27.150 --> 02:40:27.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up question briefly um the debt
 
02:40:29.230 --> 02:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
that already exists it is my
 
02:40:31.309 --> 02:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
understanding was caused from primarily
 
02:40:33.630 --> 02:40:33.640 align:start position:0%
a Federal Loan is there anything in this
 
02:40:35.830 --> 02:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
that would prevent perhaps another loan
 
02:40:37.469 --> 02:40:37.479 align:start position:0%
from being taken out for the debt to
 
02:40:40.230 --> 02:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
increase um the do you want to answer
 
02:40:42.790 --> 02:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
that so um that wasn't a debt from a
 
02:40:44.750 --> 02:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
Federal Loan it was from a state loan
 
02:40:47.070 --> 02:40:47.080 align:start position:0%
taken out and I I think I believe
 
02:40:49.950 --> 02:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
2010 uh and that um the language that
 
02:40:51.830 --> 02:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
prohibits that practice is still in this
 
02:40:55.429 --> 02:40:55.439 align:start position:0%
bill I believe it's
 
02:41:00.349 --> 02:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
maybe page um page two line one uh and
 
02:41:03.070 --> 02:41:03.080 align:start position:0%
line two that language exists now and it
 
02:41:04.670 --> 02:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
remains now it prevents the state from
 
02:41:06.550 --> 02:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
taking out a loan to pay that down that
 
02:41:10.070 --> 02:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
debt and that debt will be paid off by
 
02:41:12.830 --> 02:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
2030 and representative Vlad was correct
 
02:41:15.030 --> 02:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
it's about $6 million a year it gets
 
02:41:17.550 --> 02:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
lower towards towards the end thank you
 
02:41:19.349 --> 02:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
that answers my question it's a good
 
02:41:22.870 --> 02:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
question thank you represent Tanner
 
02:41:24.670 --> 02:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um so I'm going to play the
 
02:41:26.510 --> 02:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
age card and say I'm still confused
 
02:41:29.110 --> 02:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
about where all this money is is coming
 
02:41:32.630 --> 02:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
and going so 50 million is coming from
 
02:41:36.870 --> 02:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
the general fund to the building Aid
 
02:41:39.750 --> 02:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
right so I I think go into the building
 
02:41:41.349 --> 02:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
I I think um we're completing two
 
02:41:44.950 --> 02:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
different concepts here so we have money
 
02:41:46.790 --> 02:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
that can be be made available for
 
02:41:48.830 --> 02:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
building Aid and then we have building
 
02:41:51.150 --> 02:41:51.160 align:start position:0%
Aid expenditures we have the revenue and
 
02:41:54.230 --> 02:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
expenditures this bill is more dealing
 
02:41:57.070 --> 02:41:57.080 align:start position:0%
with the revenue side of things so this
 
02:41:59.670 --> 02:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
bill is basically saying there's
 
02:42:01.790 --> 02:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
leftover money in the education trust
 
02:42:03.950 --> 02:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
fund rather than letting that money just
 
02:42:05.750 --> 02:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
stay in the education trust fund and
 
02:42:07.830 --> 02:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
building up in the education trust fund
 
02:42:10.070 --> 02:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
create a sub account and put that money
 
02:42:12.469 --> 02:42:12.479 align:start position:0%
there that can be specifically used for
 
02:42:15.870 --> 02:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
building Aid and then separately you
 
02:42:17.389 --> 02:42:17.399 align:start position:0%
have the building aid program which this
 
02:42:18.870 --> 02:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't change the building aid
 
02:42:21.630 --> 02:42:21.640 align:start position:0%
program it has $50 million a year up to
 
02:42:23.030 --> 02:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
$50 million a year that can be
 
02:42:25.950 --> 02:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
appropriated to building Aid and so now
 
02:42:28.150 --> 02:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
once you want to as a legislature
 
02:42:30.030 --> 02:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate money for the building aid
 
02:42:32.190 --> 02:42:32.200 align:start position:0%
program you would take it from this
 
02:42:33.750 --> 02:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
essentially bank account rather than the
 
02:42:35.990 --> 02:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
other bank account and that's kind of a
 
02:42:37.510 --> 02:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
common question that comes up every
 
02:42:39.349 --> 02:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
single year when you're talking about
 
02:42:41.269 --> 02:42:41.279 align:start position:0%
appropriating money for building Aid
 
02:42:42.950 --> 02:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
we've seen bills over the year to change
 
02:42:45.349 --> 02:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
it to a minimum of $100 million a year
 
02:42:47.790 --> 02:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
$60 million a year reduce it but the
 
02:42:49.389 --> 02:42:49.399 align:start position:0%
question always is is where is that
 
02:42:51.630 --> 02:42:51.640 align:start position:0%
money going to come from now we have an
 
02:42:53.510 --> 02:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
answer to that question the money would
 
02:42:56.030 --> 02:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
come from the school building Aid fund
 
02:42:57.510 --> 02:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
and it would be there sitting there
 
02:42:59.950 --> 02:42:59.960 align:start position:0%
ready to go for projects at the time
 
02:43:01.790 --> 02:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
that you were ready to allocate the
 
02:43:03.990 --> 02:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
money you have a follow up on that go
 
02:43:08.830 --> 02:43:08.840 align:start position:0%
wait yes so okay so um once this fund is
 
02:43:12.990 --> 02:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
set up once once the 80% of the Surplus
 
02:43:15.950 --> 02:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
is set up no longer will any money come
 
02:43:18.550 --> 02:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
out of the general fund that will go
 
02:43:21.030 --> 02:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
towards building AIDS so the um Debt
 
02:43:22.790 --> 02:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
Service would still continue to be paid
 
02:43:25.590 --> 02:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
out of the general fund but that's it um
 
02:43:28.670 --> 02:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
out of the general fund correct okay and
 
02:43:30.429 --> 02:43:30.439 align:start position:0%
the my other question on this bill is
 
02:43:33.230 --> 02:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
that one more I'm sorry I'm sorry Mr
 
02:43:37.710 --> 02:43:37.720 align:start position:0%
shair um is that right now charter
 
02:43:39.510 --> 02:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
schools are not part of the building Aid
 
02:43:41.950 --> 02:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
Pro program is that correct so charter
 
02:43:43.750 --> 02:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
schools are in the building Aid law but
 
02:43:45.429 --> 02:43:45.439 align:start position:0%
then there's another law specifically in
 
02:43:47.630 --> 02:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
the charter school law that prevents um
 
02:43:49.309 --> 02:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
charter schools from receiving building
 
02:43:52.269 --> 02:43:52.279 align:start position:0%
Aid so this leaves the building Aid law
 
02:43:53.910 --> 02:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
the same which still identifies charter
 
02:43:55.349 --> 02:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
schools and says Charter Schools can
 
02:43:57.870 --> 02:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
receive 30% but it does not impact the
 
02:43:59.349 --> 02:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
other Charter School law so you would
 
02:44:01.469 --> 02:44:01.479 align:start position:0%
still need to remove that language from
 
02:44:04.630 --> 02:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
RSA 194b to enable charter schools to
 
02:44:06.269 --> 02:44:06.279 align:start position:0%
receive building Aid that's what that
 
02:44:07.710 --> 02:44:07.720 align:start position:0%
other bill is that we're dealing with
 
02:44:09.790 --> 02:44:09.800 align:start position:0%
right right but this is exactly the same
 
02:44:11.950 --> 02:44:11.960 align:start position:0%
as the existing building in language
 
02:44:14.190 --> 02:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Caitlyn
 
02:44:14.200 --> 02:44:16.070 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Caitlyn
woodcock

02:44:16.070 --> 02:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
woodcock
 
02:44:18.030 --> 02:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
good good afternoon um thank you I'm
 
02:44:20.389 --> 02:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
going to ask a same question I asked
 
02:44:23.469 --> 02:44:23.479 align:start position:0%
represent of lag I'm still lost um so
 
02:44:26.870 --> 02:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
looking lines 22 and 23
 
02:44:29.830 --> 02:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
if I'm on page the first part of the the
 
02:44:32.429 --> 02:44:32.439 align:start position:0%
act right
 
02:44:36.910 --> 02:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
if okay yes yep um today my school is
 
02:44:39.990 --> 02:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
approved but they're down here in the
 
02:44:42.870 --> 02:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
list I'm ining this to say since they've
 
02:44:44.550 --> 02:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
already been approved prior so this is
 
02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:45.790 align:start position:0%
already been approved prior so this is
2024

02:44:45.790 --> 02:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
2024
 
02:44:47.830 --> 02:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
that they will not be able to eligible
 
02:44:50.030 --> 02:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
to use this money in the future is that
 
02:44:52.670 --> 02:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
correct that's not the intent um your
 
02:44:54.590 --> 02:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
question is a good one um because we can
 
02:44:56.389 --> 02:44:56.399 align:start position:0%
make a clarification but projects aren't
 
02:44:59.110 --> 02:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
actually approved until they have been
 
02:45:00.790 --> 02:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
selected for building Aid they've
 
02:45:02.550 --> 02:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
approved their warrant article but there
 
02:45:05.150 --> 02:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
is an approval list so I can see how
 
02:45:07.950 --> 02:45:07.960 align:start position:0%
that you're that is confusing the intent
 
02:45:10.469 --> 02:45:10.479 align:start position:0%
is to say you're constructing in fiscal
 
02:45:13.150 --> 02:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
25 you become approved you still have to
 
02:45:14.790 --> 02:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
come back to the Department of Education
 
02:45:16.710 --> 02:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
there's documentation that we need
 
02:45:19.269 --> 02:45:19.279 align:start position:0%
before we approve you uh and so even
 
02:45:22.309 --> 02:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
though there's a list of 17 only two
 
02:45:24.190 --> 02:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
projects on that list of 17 have been
 
02:45:27.590 --> 02:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
approved so far um one more potentially
 
02:45:29.990 --> 02:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
will be approved next year uh those are
 
02:45:32.670 --> 02:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
our approved projects but we could make
 
02:45:34.309 --> 02:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
a clarification because somebody could
 
02:45:35.950 --> 02:45:35.960 align:start position:0%
look at that and say well you have an
 
02:45:37.750 --> 02:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
approved list those are approved
 
02:45:40.670 --> 02:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
projects thank you thank you chair Kell
 
02:45:42.910 --> 02:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
represent Miler thank you Mr chair thank
 
02:45:46.110 --> 02:45:46.120 align:start position:0%
you for being here this obviously is a
 
02:45:48.269 --> 02:45:48.279 align:start position:0%
an age-old question as far as how we get
 
02:45:52.750 --> 02:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
money to build schools uh but as I
 
02:45:55.550 --> 02:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
understand it this is from
 
02:45:59.230 --> 02:45:59.240 align:start position:0%
surplus of the education trust fund as
 
02:46:01.309 --> 02:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
long as we have the Surplus correct
 
02:46:04.790 --> 02:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
that's correct so if we don't have a
 
02:46:06.870 --> 02:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
surplus then we have to go back to
 
02:46:08.590 --> 02:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
request for the general fund correct
 
02:46:09.990 --> 02:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
that would be correct okay the final
 
02:46:13.510 --> 02:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
question is we have before us a major
 
02:46:16.990 --> 02:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
education funding bill MH uh should that
 
02:46:20.790 --> 02:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
become law how would that bill impact
 
02:46:23.790 --> 02:46:23.800 align:start position:0%
this bill as far as availability of
 
02:46:26.630 --> 02:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
resources um so if there's less funding
 
02:46:28.190 --> 02:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
available in the education trust fund or
 
02:46:30.030 --> 02:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
if there's less of a surplus then less
 
02:46:31.790 --> 02:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
money would be available to go into the
 
02:46:33.710 --> 02:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
building Aid fund so that could impact
 
02:46:36.590 --> 02:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
that this so are you saying that the uh
 
02:46:39.830 --> 02:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
the adequacy aid has priority over the
 
02:46:42.870 --> 02:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
building Aid so because adequacy is
 
02:46:44.990 --> 02:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
always paid first and then whatever is
 
02:46:47.190 --> 02:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
is left over after adequacy career and
 
02:46:48.950 --> 02:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
Tech education uh State special
 
02:46:50.750 --> 02:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
education Aid whatever is left out of
 
02:46:52.469 --> 02:46:52.479 align:start position:0%
all of those other categories that
 
02:46:55.190 --> 02:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
becomes that Surplus amount and so that
 
02:46:57.469 --> 02:46:57.479 align:start position:0%
Surplus amount if you obviously increase
 
02:46:59.830 --> 02:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
those other accounts then that Surplus
 
02:47:01.910 --> 02:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
amount becomes less and the SLS would be
 
02:47:03.269 --> 02:47:03.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for that thank you for that
 
02:47:05.349 --> 02:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
clarification any
 
02:47:08.590 --> 02:47:08.600 align:start position:0%
further uh representative
 
02:47:11.910 --> 02:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
Ford thank you m thank you Mr chair and
 
02:47:14.590 --> 02:47:14.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I don't
 
02:47:14.600 --> 02:47:15.550 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I don't
fully

02:47:15.550 --> 02:47:15.560 align:start position:0%
fully
 
02:47:19.030 --> 02:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
understand the expenditure process on
 
02:47:22.269 --> 02:47:22.279 align:start position:0%
this and I'm wondering at what point is
 
02:47:27.710 --> 02:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
money actually encumbered or fixed for a
 
02:47:30.469 --> 02:47:30.479 align:start position:0%
specific project so I hear a lot of
 
02:47:32.389 --> 02:47:32.399 align:start position:0%
approvals but I've worked in
 
02:47:34.230 --> 02:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
construction for a long time and I know
 
02:47:38.389 --> 02:47:38.399 align:start position:0%
you pay for things in stages and so I'm
 
02:47:41.830 --> 02:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
warning about when the money goes out at
 
02:47:44.550 --> 02:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
that time and then how is that kept does
 
02:47:46.269 --> 02:47:46.279 align:start position:0%
it just go out of the fund and we wait
 
02:47:49.309 --> 02:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
till we get more money in the fund or
 
02:47:51.790 --> 02:47:51.800 align:start position:0%
does each one have to be renegotiated
 
02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:53.990 align:start position:0%
does each one have to be renegotiated
each

02:47:53.990 --> 02:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
each
 
02:47:57.630 --> 02:47:57.640 align:start position:0%
time uh sure so what happens is um we
 
02:47:59.750 --> 02:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
have a list of those 17 projects
 
02:48:02.750 --> 02:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
somebody gets um the top rank project
 
02:48:05.070 --> 02:48:05.080 align:start position:0%
they go to their voters the voters say
 
02:48:07.790 --> 02:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
yes for example the voters say yes they
 
02:48:10.269 --> 02:48:10.279 align:start position:0%
have to then start the process of final
 
02:48:12.710 --> 02:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
plans in construction you know you're
 
02:48:14.990 --> 02:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
we're just at the preliminary stages and
 
02:48:16.510 --> 02:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
so then they have to go through a lot of
 
02:48:18.110 --> 02:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
work before they see any money from the
 
02:48:20.630 --> 02:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Education however we have
 
02:48:22.910 --> 02:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
that money there we've awarded them that
 
02:48:26.150 --> 02:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
money uh and then once they have their
 
02:48:28.510 --> 02:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
proper documentation in they present it
 
02:48:30.670 --> 02:48:30.680 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Education uh they
 
02:48:32.269 --> 02:48:32.279 align:start position:0%
show us that the State Fire Marshall has
 
02:48:34.670 --> 02:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
approved their plans that the they have
 
02:48:37.710 --> 02:48:37.720 align:start position:0%
the local match to um meet the rest of
 
02:48:40.870 --> 02:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
the project needs uh at that time we
 
02:48:45.269 --> 02:48:45.279 align:start position:0%
issue 80% of their award upfront um and
 
02:48:48.269 --> 02:48:48.279 align:start position:0%
then they can use that to pay for their
 
02:48:50.150 --> 02:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
project uh you're right they probably
 
02:48:52.870 --> 02:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
have had uh other Pro other uh
 
02:48:54.670 --> 02:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
expenditures that they've had to already
 
02:48:57.630 --> 02:48:57.640 align:start position:0%
en encumber on their end um and then
 
02:49:00.469 --> 02:49:00.479 align:start position:0%
from there we take that remaining 20%
 
02:49:02.309 --> 02:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
and then this then we encumber it the
 
02:49:04.830 --> 02:49:04.840 align:start position:0%
state encumbers it and holds it until
 
02:49:06.590 --> 02:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
that their project is complete before we
 
02:49:09.550 --> 02:49:09.560 align:start position:0%
pay it thank you very much welcome
 
02:49:12.110 --> 02:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
representative T thank you I know you
 
02:49:14.790 --> 02:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
don't have a crystal ball uh to bring
 
02:49:17.790 --> 02:49:17.800 align:start position:0%
predict the future but um based on and I
 
02:49:19.830 --> 02:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
know that the Surplus right now some of
 
02:49:23.910 --> 02:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
it's due to the the money we got in from
 
02:49:26.750 --> 02:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
Co and federal monies right the why it's
 
02:49:29.870 --> 02:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
so high but what do you predict is going
 
02:49:32.429 --> 02:49:32.439 align:start position:0%
to be higher the 50 the current 50
 
02:49:36.830 --> 02:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
million from the general fund or do you
 
02:49:40.910 --> 02:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
think uh the the history of surpluses is
 
02:49:44.229 --> 02:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
going to give us more money from that so
 
02:49:45.950 --> 02:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
I just want to clarify that this bill
 
02:49:47.990 --> 02:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't talk the $50 million is the
 
02:49:50.229 --> 02:49:50.239 align:start position:0%
expenditure side of things so it doesn't
 
02:49:52.110 --> 02:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
matter how much money is in this fund
 
02:49:54.070 --> 02:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
you would still need to appropriate that
 
02:49:55.710 --> 02:49:55.720 align:start position:0%
money regardless and there's nothing
 
02:49:57.870 --> 02:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
that would prevent the legislature from
 
02:50:00.070 --> 02:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
appropriating additional money if there
 
02:50:01.910 --> 02:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't necessary like that Surplus money
 
02:50:03.590 --> 02:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
or paying it out of the the general fund
 
02:50:05.349 --> 02:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
or anything like that none of those
 
02:50:07.429 --> 02:50:07.439 align:start position:0%
mechanisms are changing all this is
 
02:50:09.469 --> 02:50:09.479 align:start position:0%
doing is putting a set essentially
 
02:50:11.590 --> 02:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
starting a savings account that is
 
02:50:15.309 --> 02:50:15.319 align:start position:0%
specifically for building Aid um
 
02:50:17.750 --> 02:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
the existing Surplus you're right it
 
02:50:20.229 --> 02:50:20.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely can change and and you know
 
02:50:21.870 --> 02:50:21.880 align:start position:0%
based on the various different proposals
 
02:50:23.550 --> 02:50:23.560 align:start position:0%
in the legislature last year from the
 
02:50:26.590 --> 02:50:26.600 align:start position:0%
house they had changed the um the
 
02:50:28.389 --> 02:50:28.399 align:start position:0%
revenue going into the education trust
 
02:50:30.150 --> 02:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
fund so they had had a substantially
 
02:50:33.229 --> 02:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
less um or or had planned to have
 
02:50:34.870 --> 02:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
substantially less of a surplus than
 
02:50:36.670 --> 02:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
what ended up ultimately getting passed
 
02:50:38.309 --> 02:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
because the Senate changed that back and
 
02:50:40.030 --> 02:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
the revenue sources and whatnot so
 
02:50:41.429 --> 02:50:41.439 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of science behind the
 
02:50:43.429 --> 02:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
revenue side of things too but we don't
 
02:50:44.910 --> 02:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
believe this changes other anything
 
02:50:46.110 --> 02:50:46.120 align:start position:0%
other than essentially just starting a
 
02:50:47.790 --> 02:50:47.800 align:start position:0%
savings account so we can say all right
 
02:50:49.349 --> 02:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
well let's look at the savings account
 
02:50:50.550 --> 02:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about building
 
02:50:53.269 --> 02:50:53.279 align:start position:0%
projects and then that project process
 
02:50:56.229 --> 02:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
that Amy just described um hasn't
 
02:50:57.990 --> 02:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
changed all that's exactly what's in law
 
02:51:00.830 --> 02:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
and that's what will continue to be
 
02:51:03.870 --> 02:51:03.880 align:start position:0%
followed any further questions seeing
 
02:51:06.429 --> 02:51:06.439 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much for being here
 
02:51:09.910 --> 02:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
and with that we'll we'll close the uh
 
02:51:13.710 --> 02:51:13.720 align:start position:0%
the hearing and we'll uh go to lunch um
 
02:51:15.349 --> 02:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
02:51:17.630 --> 02:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
uh we're scheduled to be back at
 
02:51:20.710 --> 02:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
12:45 for the next bill um why don't we
 
02:51:24.070 --> 02:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:24.080 --> 02:51:43.550 align:start position:0%

bullying the purpose of this bill is add
 
03:36:08.870 --> 03:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
to the language of uh RSA uh
 
03:36:12.630 --> 03:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
193f to include cross districting

bullying and cyber billing to Define
 
03:36:18.590 --> 03:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
which district would be held responsible
 
03:36:21.630 --> 03:36:21.640 align:start position:0%
in this type of a case um the district
 
03:36:23.870 --> 03:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
that would be held responsible would be
 
03:36:25.950 --> 03:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
the District of the
 
03:36:28.429 --> 03:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
perpetrator um I've distributed two
 
03:36:30.349 --> 03:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
documents to you one in support of the
 
03:36:32.429 --> 03:36:32.439 align:start position:0%
bill from sack the new New Hampshire
 
03:36:33.950 --> 03:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
State advisory committee with
 
03:36:36.590 --> 03:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation of osterath and the
 
03:36:40.469 --> 03:36:40.479 align:start position:0%
second to um the second is from a
 
03:36:43.150 --> 03:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
retired Pro professor and now um
 
03:36:44.950 --> 03:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
president of Change the World send a
 
03:36:48.150 --> 03:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
child to school uh Dr Brown became very
 
03:36:50.990 --> 03:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
active in um education committees in
 
03:36:53.550 --> 03:36:53.560 align:start position:0%
multiple States and he was somewhat
 
03:36:56.550 --> 03:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
involved with the um episode that
 
03:36:58.469 --> 03:36:58.479 align:start position:0%
brought this bill forward which I will
 
03:37:02.830 --> 03:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
go into um this started there with two
 
03:37:06.950 --> 03:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
districts towards the north um profile
 
03:37:08.910 --> 03:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
District in Bethlehem and White Mountain
 
03:37:11.110 --> 03:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
District in Whitefield
 
03:37:13.990 --> 03:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
um a bullied female uh attended White
 
03:37:16.269 --> 03:37:16.279 align:start position:0%
Mountain and the male perpetrator was
 
03:37:19.469 --> 03:37:19.479 align:start position:0%
from profile um the male from profile
 
03:37:22.349 --> 03:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
found out from his cousin that there was
 
03:37:25.910 --> 03:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
a Honduras young Honduras woman girl in
 
03:37:29.389 --> 03:37:29.399 align:start position:0%
the school and so he told his cousin in
 
03:37:33.349 --> 03:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
profile about it and the um profile mail
 
03:37:36.189 --> 03:37:36.199 align:start position:0%
sent bullying Snapchats to the and
 
03:37:37.750 --> 03:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
messages and I
 
03:37:41.070 --> 03:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
quote and this is just part of it
 
03:37:44.030 --> 03:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
calling her the n-word a telling
 
03:37:46.750 --> 03:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
her that her private parts smelled and
 
03:37:48.990 --> 03:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
that she should just kill
 
03:37:51.910 --> 03:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
herself um there were three hearings on
 
03:37:54.750 --> 03:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
this one with the principal a second
 
03:37:57.070 --> 03:37:57.080 align:start position:0%
with the superintendent and a third with
 
03:37:59.950 --> 03:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
the school board yet profile maintained
 
03:38:03.110 --> 03:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
that they had no responsibility for
 
03:38:07.630 --> 03:38:07.640 align:start position:0%
this um they had no responsibility for
 
03:38:09.630 --> 03:38:09.640 align:start position:0%
that male's action because it occurred
 
03:38:11.229 --> 03:38:11.239 align:start position:0%
cross District
 
03:38:14.070 --> 03:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
District um Dr Brown appealed to the
 
03:38:16.950 --> 03:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Education step Berwick and
 
03:38:18.950 --> 03:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
an administrative judge was appointed to
 
03:38:20.910 --> 03:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
review the matter they ruled that
 
03:38:23.150 --> 03:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
profile was legally
 
03:38:25.590 --> 03:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
responsible and incorrect that they did
 
03:38:27.070 --> 03:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
not think they were because the
 
03:38:29.590 --> 03:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
legislation is to protect all children
 
03:38:32.070 --> 03:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
from bullying therefore schools cannot
 
03:38:35.110 --> 03:38:35.120 align:start position:0%
prevent bullying just in their own
 
03:38:38.830 --> 03:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
district and they need to a followup um
 
03:38:41.630 --> 03:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
profile finally admitted wrongdoing

and follow up yes follow up please and
 
03:40:28.389 --> 03:40:28.399 align:start position:0%
that the profile
 
03:40:32.510 --> 03:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
School uh did not want to investigate
 
03:40:34.950 --> 03:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
the incident correct felt they had no
 
03:40:37.990 --> 03:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility to do that because it was
 
03:40:44.990 --> 03:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:47.750 --> 03:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and thank you for coming um
 
03:40:50.030 --> 03:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
could you give us an idea how much this
 
03:40:52.950 --> 03:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
cost in legal costs when all the dust
 
03:41:03.229 --> 03:41:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:06.830 --> 03:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
$48,000 that the young lady who was in
 
03:41:08.670 --> 03:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
the receiving
 
03:41:12.150 --> 03:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
School what's she didn't she have to
 
03:41:15.030 --> 03:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
call her parent andent had to remove her
 
03:41:18.710 --> 03:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
from she was out of school for two weeks
 
03:41:20.790 --> 03:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
um she was so distraught at this you
 
03:41:23.590 --> 03:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
know um um she's at a disadvantage
 
03:41:25.870 --> 03:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
because of some language barriers to a
 
03:41:28.670 --> 03:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
certain extent but certainly understood
 
03:41:31.910 --> 03:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
exactly what was being said to her and
 
03:41:34.469 --> 03:41:34.479 align:start position:0%
um yes she had did have to remove her
 
03:41:39.030 --> 03:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
from school F questions from the
 
03:41:39.040 --> 03:41:41.630 align:start position:0%
from school F questions from the
committee

03:41:41.630 --> 03:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:41:43.710 --> 03:41:43.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
03:41:43.720 --> 03:41:46.510 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

03:41:46.510 --> 03:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:41:51.110 --> 03:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
so why was a school responsible did it
 
03:41:54.870 --> 03:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
happen in school with school property
 
03:41:57.870 --> 03:41:57.880 align:start position:0%
what what was the school connection to
 
03:42:00.710 --> 03:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
the cyber bullying um it's my
 
03:42:02.750 --> 03:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
understanding that it was a Snapchat it
 
03:42:07.830 --> 03:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
was done on school property but if you
 
03:42:11.790 --> 03:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
um if you actually read the law the law
 
03:42:15.149 --> 03:42:15.159 align:start position:0%
says that anything that is
 
03:42:18.070 --> 03:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
done um and could have been done on
 
03:42:20.550 --> 03:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
school property computers but anything
 
03:42:22.830 --> 03:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
that is done that interferes with a
 
03:42:26.469 --> 03:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
child's education and this interfered
 
03:42:28.389 --> 03:42:28.399 align:start position:0%
with her dramatically interfered with
 
03:42:34.950 --> 03:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:37.590 --> 03:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair um and thank you
 
03:42:40.229 --> 03:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
for this bill and this testimony um it
 
03:42:42.990 --> 03:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
struck a uh a thought when I first read
 
03:42:44.229 --> 03:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
it and I thought I had read something
 
03:42:47.429 --> 03:42:47.439 align:start position:0%
out of the Supreme Court recently um
 
03:42:49.429 --> 03:42:49.439 align:start position:0%
that would speak to this so I've just
 
03:42:50.870 --> 03:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
looked it up and we have a decision out
 
03:42:53.189 --> 03:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
of the United States Supreme Court uh
 
03:42:58.189 --> 03:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
coming in June of 2021 regarding um the
 
03:43:02.510 --> 03:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
ability of schools to enforce any sort
 
03:43:06.429 --> 03:43:06.439 align:start position:0%
of speech on students outside of the
 
03:43:10.149 --> 03:43:10.159 align:start position:0%
school and according to this opinion it
 
03:43:12.950 --> 03:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
says that certain interests can cause
 
03:43:14.510 --> 03:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
student or schools to be able to
 
03:43:16.550 --> 03:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
regulate but when it specifically comes
 
03:43:18.950 --> 03:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
to bullying it says that the bullying
 
03:43:20.790 --> 03:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
must be of a severe
 
03:43:24.269 --> 03:43:24.279 align:start position:0%
nature uh further when it comes to um
 
03:43:26.110 --> 03:43:26.120 align:start position:0%
its effects on the school environment
 
03:43:29.870 --> 03:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court doesn't say um they
 
03:43:31.110 --> 03:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
they don't say it disrupts a child's
 
03:43:33.590 --> 03:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
education they say it must materially
 
03:43:34.950 --> 03:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
disrupt the
 
03:43:38.349 --> 03:43:38.359 align:start position:0%
classroom environment in order to meet
 
03:43:40.550 --> 03:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
the criteria necessary to regulate
 
03:43:42.189 --> 03:43:42.199 align:start position:0%
student speech outside of school so I'm
 
03:43:43.870 --> 03:43:43.880 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering do you actually think
 
03:43:45.630 --> 03:43:45.640 align:start position:0%
given that opinion out of the Supreme
 
03:43:49.269 --> 03:43:49.279 align:start position:0%
Court from 21 that the provisions in
 
03:43:52.590 --> 03:43:52.600 align:start position:0%
this bill and existing law on regulating
 
03:43:56.309 --> 03:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
um this bullying might be overly
 
03:43:59.349 --> 03:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
broad it's my understanding that our
 
03:44:02.429 --> 03:44:02.439 align:start position:0%
legislation on this says if it disrupts
 
03:44:04.189 --> 03:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
a child's
 
03:44:09.990 --> 03:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
education um so I think you know I if
 
03:44:12.110 --> 03:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
you want to go by federal law or you go
 
03:44:14.469 --> 03:44:14.479 align:start position:0%
by state law R specifically says
 
03:44:17.830 --> 03:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
disrupts the education of a child it's
 
03:44:17.840 --> 03:44:30.110 align:start position:0%
disrupts the education of a child it's
my

03:44:30.110 --> 03:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:32.309 --> 03:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
understanding thank you chairman good
 
03:44:35.630 --> 03:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
afternoon just just a question um on the
 
03:44:38.110 --> 03:44:38.120 align:start position:0%
bottom of the U project two questions
 
03:44:40.349 --> 03:44:40.359 align:start position:0%
actually the first one is uh uh the only
 
03:44:42.269 --> 03:44:42.279 align:start position:0%
part that you modified is that which is
 
03:44:44.870 --> 03:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
in bold is that accurate correct okay so
 
03:44:46.429 --> 03:44:46.439 align:start position:0%
if I can go to the part I was asking
 
03:44:49.389 --> 03:44:49.399 align:start position:0%
about on 21 uh actually the last part of
 
03:44:52.870 --> 03:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
2122 is there a reason that you um made
 
03:44:56.830 --> 03:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
it specifically for the U the where the
 
03:44:59.189 --> 03:44:59.199 align:start position:0%
action originate is responsible for the
 
03:45:01.189 --> 03:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
investigation does that preclude the
 
03:45:03.510 --> 03:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
other school from doing it no it doesn't
 
03:45:05.269 --> 03:45:05.279 align:start position:0%
prude the other school but it says who
 
03:45:05.279 --> 03:45:06.349 align:start position:0%
prude the other school but it says who
has

03:45:06.349 --> 03:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
has
 
03:45:06.359 --> 03:45:07.870 align:start position:0%
has
responsibility

03:45:07.870 --> 03:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
03:45:10.630 --> 03:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
see thank you so who required to do it
 
03:45:11.550 --> 03:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
but the other school may also
 
03:45:13.469 --> 03:45:13.479 align:start position:0%
investigate at the same time absolutely
 
03:45:17.550 --> 03:45:17.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:20.429 --> 03:45:20.439 align:start position:0%
CH thank you
 
03:45:25.349 --> 03:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
um was the police or any civil uh law
 
03:45:27.110 --> 03:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement involved in this because it
 
03:45:28.630 --> 03:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
was in two different
 
03:45:30.750 --> 03:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
districts I'm sorry I do not have the
 
03:45:35.750 --> 03:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:38.110 --> 03:45:38.120 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you thank you for taking my
 
03:45:40.510 --> 03:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
question I I think buen is one of the
 
03:45:41.870 --> 03:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
most horrible things I'm a retired
 
03:45:43.469 --> 03:45:43.479 align:start position:0%
middle school guidance counselor so I
 
03:45:47.149 --> 03:45:47.159 align:start position:0%
know I know Bine but I I want to think
 
03:45:50.030 --> 03:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
that we passed a law a few years ago
 
03:45:53.030 --> 03:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
restricting the investigation abilities
 
03:45:55.790 --> 03:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
of school administration of student
 
03:45:59.389 --> 03:45:59.399 align:start position:0%
social media accounts or am I making
 
03:45:59.399 --> 03:46:00.830 align:start position:0%
social media accounts or am I making
that

03:46:00.830 --> 03:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:46:03.229 --> 03:46:03.239 align:start position:0%
up I I don't know if you know but I'm
 
03:46:06.870 --> 03:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm thinking because I I I want to
 
03:46:09.429 --> 03:46:09.439 align:start position:0%
say that like the administrators used to
 
03:46:12.349 --> 03:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
be able to pull up a student's Facebook
 
03:46:14.469 --> 03:46:14.479 align:start position:0%
account say oh yeah they are bullying
 
03:46:16.309 --> 03:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
but I thought we passed a law saying
 
03:46:18.269 --> 03:46:18.279 align:start position:0%
that they were no longer able to do that
 
03:46:21.189 --> 03:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
so I was wondering how how you would go
 
03:46:23.630 --> 03:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
about investigating something like this
 
03:46:27.389 --> 03:46:27.399 align:start position:0%
represent yeah I um yeah I I believe it
 
03:46:30.149 --> 03:46:30.159 align:start position:0%
was representative bomes bill um that he
 
03:46:33.710 --> 03:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
worked with a number of agencies on um
 
03:46:37.269 --> 03:46:37.279 align:start position:0%
and I I think the problem became um Can
 
03:46:41.830 --> 03:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
the school ask for the students password
 
03:46:44.750 --> 03:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
to get into their social media accounts
 
03:46:48.149 --> 03:46:48.159 align:start position:0%
so I'm not I don't I I don't believe it
 
03:46:51.229 --> 03:46:51.239 align:start position:0%
passed but um it we've had several bills
 
03:46:54.670 --> 03:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:54.680 --> 03:46:59.510 align:start position:0%
 
media

03:46:59.510 --> 03:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:08.510 --> 03:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:08.520 --> 03:47:20.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:47:20.830 --> 03:47:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:22.389 --> 03:47:22.399 align:start position:0%
my name is Mora Ryan and in case you
 
03:47:24.870 --> 03:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
don't know my name I brought my own
 
03:47:30.189 --> 03:47:30.199 align:start position:0%
tent um I'm here to support this bill um
 
03:47:32.030 --> 03:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
I wanted to stress that bullying and
 
03:47:34.110 --> 03:47:34.120 align:start position:0%
cyber bullying is not adequately managed
 
03:47:36.110 --> 03:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
by schools because typically they're
 
03:47:37.950 --> 03:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
only required to generate a report which
 
03:47:41.550 --> 03:47:41.560 align:start position:0%
is not sufficient because the families
 
03:47:43.950 --> 03:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
and the students who are affected by
 
03:47:47.189 --> 03:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
cyber bullying it's pretty intense um
 
03:47:49.030 --> 03:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
negative impacts of bullying include
 
03:47:52.510 --> 03:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
poor academic Performance Health um poor
 
03:47:55.070 --> 03:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
health poor social life it often leads
 
03:47:56.750 --> 03:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
to students leaving school and not being
 
03:48:00.469 --> 03:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
able to return um I've advocated for
 
03:48:02.269 --> 03:48:02.279 align:start position:0%
parents in many situations with bullying
 
03:48:03.590 --> 03:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
and bullying is one of the things that
 
03:48:05.269 --> 03:48:05.279 align:start position:0%
our schools just don't seem to have a
 
03:48:07.710 --> 03:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
handle on at this point and the
 
03:48:09.990 --> 03:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunate side effect of buling is of
 
03:48:11.389 --> 03:48:11.399 align:start position:0%
course that children who are bullied
 
03:48:12.750 --> 03:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily grow up to be
 
03:48:14.189 --> 03:48:14.199 align:start position:0%
compassionate to other people around
 
03:48:17.630 --> 03:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
them and they tend to promote the cycle
 
03:48:22.309 --> 03:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
and Bully other people as adults um and
 
03:48:24.269 --> 03:48:24.279 align:start position:0%
it's not just the kids who bully it's
 
03:48:26.229 --> 03:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
the people who stand by and let it
 
03:48:29.910 --> 03:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
happen and don't do anything about it in
 
03:48:32.229 --> 03:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
our society we say that we're all equal
 
03:48:34.149 --> 03:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
and we have to mean that and we have to
 
03:48:35.630 --> 03:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
say you can't bully other people because
 
03:48:36.870 --> 03:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
we're all equal and we all have a right
 
03:48:40.030 --> 03:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
to be um
 
03:48:41.710 --> 03:48:41.720 align:start position:0%
I support this bill for maintaining
 
03:48:43.670 --> 03:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
accountability standards for trying to
 
03:48:45.269 --> 03:48:45.279 align:start position:0%
stop cyber bullying and to protect
 
03:48:47.870 --> 03:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
children to your point um representative
 
03:48:50.030 --> 03:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
beler the Supreme Court did say in the
 
03:48:51.910 --> 03:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
Randy W case that the protection of
 
03:48:54.070 --> 03:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
children is above all first and foremost
 
03:48:55.950 --> 03:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
an affirmative duty of the
 
03:48:58.950 --> 03:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
schools um in addition to
 
03:49:02.269 --> 03:49:02.279 align:start position:0%
which at this point you know my town I'm
 
03:49:04.030 --> 03:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
from London der we had an investigation
 
03:49:07.309 --> 03:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
done against our cheerleading squad and
 
03:49:08.710 --> 03:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
the parents came forward because the
 
03:49:10.670 --> 03:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
student committed suicide and when
 
03:49:12.630 --> 03:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
you're being Cyber Bullied on top of
 
03:49:15.030 --> 03:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
bullied in school it's a lot to handle
 
03:49:17.469 --> 03:49:17.479 align:start position:0%
because you don't have a safe space so I
 
03:49:19.990 --> 03:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely 100% support this bill I'm
 
03:49:22.149 --> 03:49:22.159 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions but I did
 
03:49:24.269 --> 03:49:24.279 align:start position:0%
also want to point out um too that
 
03:49:26.790 --> 03:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
bullying tends to lead to psychological
 
03:49:28.510 --> 03:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
escalation particularly when it's of a
 
03:49:31.030 --> 03:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
sexual nature and can lead to things you
 
03:49:33.870 --> 03:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
know like aggravated assault and other
 
03:49:35.710 --> 03:49:35.720 align:start position:0%
elements so I do think it's something we
 
03:49:38.070 --> 03:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
need to nip in the bud I think our focus
 
03:49:39.670 --> 03:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
should be on protecting students first
 
03:49:42.590 --> 03:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
and foremost and any questions I'd be
 
03:49:44.990 --> 03:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:48.189 --> 03:49:48.199 align:start position:0%
answer questions from the
 
03:49:50.550 --> 03:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
committee thank you and thank you for
 
03:49:55.349 --> 03:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
your testimony um besides action of
 
03:49:57.550 --> 03:49:57.560 align:start position:0%
Investigation do you feel that schools
 
03:50:00.670 --> 03:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
should also do education around working
 
03:50:03.710 --> 03:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
with others and and what bullying does
 
03:50:07.670 --> 03:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
and offer help on that end I do know
 
03:50:08.950 --> 03:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
that many of the schools have adopted
 
03:50:10.790 --> 03:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
the Choose Love program which has a
 
03:50:12.710 --> 03:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
focus on that and I certainly do know
 
03:50:15.269 --> 03:50:15.279 align:start position:0%
that they're making steps to incorporate
 
03:50:31.189 --> 03:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:35.630 --> 03:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
yes I'm worried a bit by the fact that I
 
03:50:37.229 --> 03:50:37.239 align:start position:0%
didn't hear
 
03:50:40.429 --> 03:50:40.439 align:start position:0%
any community resp response to this kind
 
03:50:43.110 --> 03:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
of a bullying and and I just going back
 
03:50:45.910 --> 03:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
on my own background uh there would have
 
03:50:49.070 --> 03:50:49.080 align:start position:0%
been a considerable response even
 
03:50:49.080 --> 03:50:50.309 align:start position:0%
been a considerable response even
schoolyard

03:50:50.309 --> 03:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
schoolyard
 
03:50:52.750 --> 03:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
bullying uh I happened to be a judo
 
03:50:55.030 --> 03:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
coach and I taught my daughter Judo and
 
03:50:57.149 --> 03:50:57.159 align:start position:0%
when she was physically bullied on
 
03:50:59.229 --> 03:50:59.239 align:start position:0%
campus in grade school she threw him on
 
03:51:01.790 --> 03:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
his keer right in front of the public
 
03:51:04.910 --> 03:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
and told him next time it would hurt you
 
03:51:07.550 --> 03:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
know so you know that some of the things
 
03:51:10.710 --> 03:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
are dealt with more simp of course cyber
 
03:51:13.429 --> 03:51:13.439 align:start position:0%
bullying adds an extra wrinkle but I
 
03:51:15.550 --> 03:51:15.560 align:start position:0%
can't help but think that in the
 
03:51:18.189 --> 03:51:18.199 align:start position:0%
communities I grew up in that person
 
03:51:19.870 --> 03:51:19.880 align:start position:0%
would have been
 
03:51:22.229 --> 03:51:22.239 align:start position:0%
shunned and and there would have been a
 
03:51:24.590 --> 03:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
communal response to that kind of
 
03:51:27.670 --> 03:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
behavior and I wonder if just the sort
 
03:51:31.269 --> 03:51:31.279 align:start position:0%
of anonymity of on the net protects them
 
03:51:34.750 --> 03:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
in that regard or or has the has the
 
03:51:38.149 --> 03:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
communal consensus on bullying
 
03:51:38.159 --> 03:51:40.149 align:start position:0%
communal consensus on bullying
changed

03:51:40.149 --> 03:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
changed
 
03:51:42.349 --> 03:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
I think the communal consensus I'm sorry
 
03:51:44.950 --> 03:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me I have allergies so I think
 
03:51:46.870 --> 03:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
the communal consensus on bullying has
 
03:51:48.590 --> 03:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
somewhat change because I think it was
 
03:51:50.510 --> 03:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
handled by the community in the past and
 
03:51:51.990 --> 03:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
I think that one of the elements that
 
03:51:53.910 --> 03:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
did change it was the
 
03:51:57.309 --> 03:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
litigiousness of what's going on now I
 
03:51:58.870 --> 03:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
don't know if you've ever seen the movie
 
03:52:02.550 --> 03:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
Mean Girls um but Mean Girls is sort of
 
03:52:04.229 --> 03:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
an example of where bullying is in
 
03:52:06.309 --> 03:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
effect and when the Parents try to
 
03:52:08.349 --> 03:52:08.359 align:start position:0%
address it and the woman who wrote it is
 
03:52:10.030 --> 03:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
actually a psycholog olist and she wrote
 
03:52:11.950 --> 03:52:11.960 align:start position:0%
up a follow-up book to that which was
 
03:52:15.229 --> 03:52:15.239 align:start position:0%
called Kingpin dads and queen bee moms
 
03:52:16.670 --> 03:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
and that addresses the behavior of the
 
03:52:18.910 --> 03:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
parents specifically because they tend
 
03:52:20.830 --> 03:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
to come out and say my child did not do
 
03:52:22.750 --> 03:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
this and they don't take accountability
 
03:52:24.429 --> 03:52:24.439 align:start position:0%
so I do think that that has been a shift
 
03:52:27.429 --> 03:52:27.439 align:start position:0%
in society I would agree with that and I
 
03:52:29.110 --> 03:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
commend you for teaching your daughter
 
03:52:30.790 --> 03:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
to defend herself I think that's a
 
03:52:30.800 --> 03:52:32.269 align:start position:0%
to defend herself I think that's a
wonderful

03:52:32.269 --> 03:52:32.279 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
03:52:32.279 --> 03:52:34.349 align:start position:0%
wonderful
thing

03:52:34.349 --> 03:52:34.359 align:start position:0%
thing
 
03:52:38.030 --> 03:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much thank
 
03:52:38.040 --> 03:52:58.950 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much thank

not a problem thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:53:02.030 --> 03:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh for the
 
03:53:04.630 --> 03:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
records my name is uh Sebastian Fuentes
 
03:53:06.269 --> 03:53:06.279 align:start position:0%
I'm the political director for rights
 
03:53:08.189 --> 03:53:08.199 align:start position:0%
and democracy of New Hampshire but I'm
 
03:53:09.469 --> 03:53:09.479 align:start position:0%
not here in front of
 
03:53:12.469 --> 03:53:12.479 align:start position:0%
on that capacity I'm here uh to testify
 
03:53:14.590 --> 03:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
and support this bill because I was uh
 
03:53:17.149 --> 03:53:17.159 align:start position:0%
one of the that's the first one of the
 
03:53:18.910 --> 03:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
parents that helped this family up in
 
03:53:21.389 --> 03:53:21.399 align:start position:0%
the North Country uh I was one of them
 
03:53:23.110 --> 03:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh the members of the community that
 
03:53:25.110 --> 03:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
this family reached out for support uh
 
03:53:26.870 --> 03:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
because they didn't know what to do uh
 
03:53:27.990 --> 03:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
you know there's there's a language
 
03:53:30.790 --> 03:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
barrier uh there's also uh the fear uh
 
03:53:32.349 --> 03:53:32.359 align:start position:0%
just to answer Mr uh representative
 
03:53:34.510 --> 03:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
for's question uh why the community
 
03:53:36.630 --> 03:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
didn't do anything it was a desire of
 
03:53:39.030 --> 03:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
the the bigtim not to share this because
 
03:53:41.550 --> 03:53:41.560 align:start position:0%
they are a a a refugee family from
 
03:53:43.790 --> 03:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
Honduras they didn't want to uh cause an
 
03:53:46.030 --> 03:53:46.040 align:start position:0%
alarm in the community because of uh you
 
03:53:47.870 --> 03:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
know of a local support to see how the
 
03:53:50.149 --> 03:53:50.159 align:start position:0%
community is going to respond to it uh I
 
03:53:51.870 --> 03:53:51.880 align:start position:0%
listen to those videos I watch those
 
03:53:53.550 --> 03:53:53.560 align:start position:0%
videos and I listen to those audios left
 
03:53:55.870 --> 03:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
by this student from profile to this uh
 
03:53:58.670 --> 03:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
student at the W original and it was it
 
03:54:02.389 --> 03:54:02.399 align:start position:0%
was demoralizing it was impactful to me
 
03:54:04.990 --> 03:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
uh to see the amount of of hatred that a
 
03:54:07.790 --> 03:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
young person can uh you know uh Express
 
03:54:10.469 --> 03:54:10.479 align:start position:0%
to another child uh at the same time it
 
03:54:13.550 --> 03:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
just kind of brought to my attention now
 
03:54:15.990 --> 03:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
that in modern days uh many students
 
03:54:17.790 --> 03:54:17.800 align:start position:0%
have a cell phone and the access to
 
03:54:20.630 --> 03:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
social media is really uh you know it's
 
03:54:24.030 --> 03:54:24.040 align:start position:0%
mainstream um my son for example he goes
 
03:54:26.030 --> 03:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
to the littleon school district and he
 
03:54:28.349 --> 03:54:28.359 align:start position:0%
has friends uh due to sports and to
 
03:54:30.429 --> 03:54:30.439 align:start position:0%
social media in like the conquer area
 
03:54:33.870 --> 03:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester area uh you know contacts
 
03:54:35.429 --> 03:54:35.439 align:start position:0%
that he had never have before and
 
03:54:37.030 --> 03:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
contacts that back in the day when I was
 
03:54:38.870 --> 03:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
going to high school I was unable to
 
03:54:41.349 --> 03:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
connect with people so far away so the
 
03:54:43.590 --> 03:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
fact that now they have uh cell phones
 
03:54:45.710 --> 03:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
it makes it do Communications across
 
03:54:48.950 --> 03:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
districts and other areas uh more uh
 
03:54:52.670 --> 03:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
faster uh again when I heard this it was
 
03:54:53.950 --> 03:54:53.960 align:start position:0%
uh when I heard those video when I watch
 
03:54:55.510 --> 03:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
those videos and I listened to the audio
 
03:54:59.670 --> 03:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
it was definitely uh uh impactful uh and
 
03:55:00.910 --> 03:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
I personally don't think that the
 
03:55:02.630 --> 03:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
profile School District
 
03:55:05.990 --> 03:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
sa35 did a good job of managing uh the
 
03:55:08.870 --> 03:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
actual um if I I send you actually also
 
03:55:10.950 --> 03:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
I just submitted an article that was
 
03:55:12.590 --> 03:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
published this morning by the Caledonian
 
03:55:15.149 --> 03:55:15.159 align:start position:0%
record uh which actually highlights in
 
03:55:16.830 --> 03:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
detail the the process and what's
 
03:55:19.790 --> 03:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
happening up in up in the district uh
 
03:55:22.990 --> 03:55:23.000 align:start position:0%
one of the uh comments that uh that I
 
03:55:24.590 --> 03:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
don't think are on this testimony
 
03:55:27.710 --> 03:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
provided by father Larry Brown uh to you
 
03:55:30.550 --> 03:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
guys is that the girl the victim was
 
03:55:33.070 --> 03:55:33.080 align:start position:0%
actually cross-examined by the profile
 
03:55:36.030 --> 03:55:36.040 align:start position:0%
attorney School uh Barbara lman in
 
03:55:38.790 --> 03:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
violation of a state administrative law
 
03:55:40.389 --> 03:55:40.399 align:start position:0%
the attorney suggested that this girl
 
03:55:42.229 --> 03:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
was not being truthful even though the
 
03:55:44.389 --> 03:55:44.399 align:start position:0%
boy Snapchat messages to the girl were
 
03:55:46.910 --> 03:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
available at evidence and again I have
 
03:55:48.590 --> 03:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
those videos I have those uh you know
 
03:55:51.630 --> 03:55:51.640 align:start position:0%
those audio recordings uh if anybody's
 
03:55:53.030 --> 03:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
interesting I don't know what's that you
 
03:55:54.189 --> 03:55:54.199 align:start position:0%
know that's permissible in this
 
03:55:56.189 --> 03:55:56.199 align:start position:0%
committee to share but uh I'd be more
 
03:55:57.670 --> 03:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
than happy to to to share with some
 
03:55:59.950 --> 03:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
members of this committee and again uh
 
03:56:01.429 --> 03:56:01.439 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions I'm here
 
03:56:03.229 --> 03:56:03.239 align:start position:0%
because I was one of the the families
 
03:56:04.870 --> 03:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
that what family members uh in the
 
03:56:07.070 --> 03:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
community that was really involved uh
 
03:56:09.269 --> 03:56:09.279 align:start position:0%
helping this family navigate those uh
 
03:56:11.950 --> 03:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
that that specific crisis uh that to me
 
03:56:14.790 --> 03:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
is is is definitely detrimental for her
 
03:56:17.750 --> 03:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
mental health for uh her educational uh
 
03:56:20.349 --> 03:56:20.359 align:start position:0%

profile was advised by their attorney

that this was not uh an issue which they
 
03:56:42.590 --> 03:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
needed to address due to the fact this
 
03:56:47.550 --> 03:56:47.560 align:start position:0%

student the victim and found her to be

uh not telling the truth even though all
 
03:57:02.830 --> 03:57:02.840 align:start position:0%

paying 4 48,000 in fees to the attorney
 
03:57:59.910 --> 03:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh and that was pretty much a settlement
 
03:58:01.510 --> 03:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
that they were going to take care of the
 
03:58:03.990 --> 03:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
case afterwards uh but to this day there
 
03:58:06.790 --> 03:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
hasn't been any any work around that um

that's going to be but um this is an
 
03:58:15.429 --> 03:58:15.439 align:start position:0%

bill of the two people who spoke earlier
 
03:59:57.389 --> 03:59:57.399 align:start position:0%
represent press and Miss
 
04:00:00.590 --> 04:00:00.600 align:start position:0%
Ryan are either of you familiar with or
 
04:00:04.469 --> 04:00:04.479 align:start position:0%
aware in statute it says specifically
 
04:00:06.030 --> 04:00:06.040 align:start position:0%
each school district and Charter Public
 
04:00:07.349 --> 04:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
School shall
 
04:00:09.750 --> 04:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
provide going down to educational
 
04:00:11.469 --> 04:00:11.479 align:start position:0%
programs for pupils and parents in
 
04:00:14.349 --> 04:00:14.359 align:start position:0%
preventing identifying responding
 
04:00:18.670 --> 04:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
to and Reporting bullying cyber bullying
 
04:00:20.910 --> 04:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
do you know in fact if the district
 
04:00:22.950 --> 04:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about has a policy in
 
04:00:24.469 --> 04:00:24.479 align:start position:0%
place and how to
 
04:00:35.030 --> 04:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:38.070 --> 04:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
bullying I do not but my focus was on
 
04:00:41.149 --> 04:00:41.159 align:start position:0%
the fact that we needed to make sure
 
04:00:43.870 --> 04:00:43.880 align:start position:0%
that this doesn't happen again and that
 
04:00:45.830 --> 04:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
a school district really tries to take
 
04:00:48.550 --> 04:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
to is forced to take responsibility as
 
04:00:51.389 --> 04:00:51.399 align:start position:0%
opposed to I mean what this young woman
 
04:00:53.750 --> 04:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
went through I mean this went from the
 
04:00:56.389 --> 04:00:56.399 align:start position:0%
principal a hearing with the principal
 
04:00:57.510 --> 04:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:01:00.070 --> 04:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
superintendent to the school board and
 
04:01:03.469 --> 04:01:03.479 align:start position:0%
they all denied that they had any
 
04:01:07.990 --> 04:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility for this so um it's my
 
04:01:12.110 --> 04:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
understanding in that um I think perhaps
 
04:01:14.910 --> 04:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
heads might roll at the school district
 
04:01:17.189 --> 04:01:17.199 align:start position:0%
meeting tonight but my focus was really
 
04:01:19.229 --> 04:01:19.239 align:start position:0%
on just making sure that this doesn't
 
04:01:22.110 --> 04:01:22.120 align:start position:0%
happen again it was a horrendous thing
 
04:01:24.389 --> 04:01:24.399 align:start position:0%
that this family had to go through and I
 
04:01:26.710 --> 04:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
think basically because of the fact as
 
04:01:29.710 --> 04:01:29.720 align:start position:0%
it was stated that there was a language
 
04:01:32.670 --> 04:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
barrier and there is the inability to
 
04:01:35.910 --> 04:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
know how to navigate through the system
 
04:01:37.349 --> 04:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
they were at definitely at a
 
04:01:39.590 --> 04:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
disadvantage as as well so so I'd like
 
04:01:41.550 --> 04:01:41.560 align:start position:0%

Hampshire uh Grafton County and I'm here
 
04:05:30.469 --> 04:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
today to speak on HB 1164 this is a bill
 
04:05:32.070 --> 04:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with criminal record checks of
 
04:05:34.950 --> 04:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
teachers credentialing applicants and
 
04:05:37.670 --> 04:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
primarily it's been a uh a request of
 
04:05:39.630 --> 04:05:39.640 align:start position:0%
the the Department of Education Mr
 
04:05:41.950 --> 04:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
Applebee who is in charge of that
 
04:05:44.309 --> 04:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
program over there and one of the issues
 
04:05:48.030 --> 04:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
which we have is that upon entering the
 
04:05:48.040 --> 04:05:49.990 align:start position:0%
which we have is that upon entering the
education

04:05:49.990 --> 04:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:05:54.030 --> 04:05:54.040 align:start position:0%
program on a highered pro uh School such
 
04:05:57.510 --> 04:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
as Plymouth or Keen or
 
04:06:00.149 --> 04:06:00.159 align:start position:0%
UNH one declares for example I'm going
 
04:06:02.030 --> 04:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
to be an education major an education
 
04:06:04.830 --> 04:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
major then has to get that credentialing
 
04:06:06.429 --> 04:06:06.439 align:start position:0%
criminal background check right from the
 
04:06:08.710 --> 04:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
beginning they do it in their freshman
 
04:06:11.389 --> 04:06:11.399 align:start position:0%
year that initial check is only good for
 
04:06:13.910 --> 04:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
three years so in the fourth year when
 
04:06:15.630 --> 04:06:15.640 align:start position:0%
they go out to do their student teaching
 
04:06:18.550 --> 04:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
they have to pay to have that done again
 
04:06:20.550 --> 04:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
the recommendation is the initial
 
04:06:22.630 --> 04:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
credential be extended from 3 years to
 
04:06:25.229 --> 04:06:25.239 align:start position:0%
four years thus saving money on the part
 
04:06:27.750 --> 04:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
of a a student who's wanting to be a
 
04:06:30.990 --> 04:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
teacher and that concludes my
 
04:06:33.229 --> 04:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
testimony that's all the build us change
 
04:06:35.870 --> 04:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
one number from three to four now thank
 
04:06:38.389 --> 04:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
you representative any questions
 
04:06:40.990 --> 04:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
uh represent Lakers do you know how much
 
04:06:43.830 --> 04:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
it costs for them to get a peral records
 
04:06:46.510 --> 04:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
check at this point I I can't tell you
 
04:06:47.870 --> 04:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
that you know I've heard a lot of
 
04:06:50.429 --> 04:06:50.439 align:start position:0%
different figures but I tell you with
 
04:06:52.349 --> 04:06:52.359 align:start position:0%
the my grandkids are in college right
 
04:06:55.429 --> 04:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
now $5 is a lot of money oh I know I
 
04:06:57.269 --> 04:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
just was wondering what it was at the
 
04:06:58.750 --> 04:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
moment thank you but this is up in
 
04:07:00.670 --> 04:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
double or triple
 
04:07:03.990 --> 04:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
figures yeah representer yeah I think on
 
04:07:06.070 --> 04:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
that I think we heard that it was like
 
04:07:09.910 --> 04:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
$150 I heard 15 2 but there's two of us
 
04:07:15.750 --> 04:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:15.760 --> 04:07:17.550 align:start position:0%
 
agree

04:07:17.550 --> 04:07:17.560 align:start position:0%
agree
 
04:07:20.269 --> 04:07:20.279 align:start position:0%
uh represent of
 
04:07:22.630 --> 04:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank
 
04:07:22.640 --> 04:07:24.149 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank
you

04:07:24.149 --> 04:07:24.159 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:07:28.830 --> 04:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
the I don't problem if if I uh extend
 
04:07:30.469 --> 04:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
this to four years so I go out during my
 
04:07:33.790 --> 04:07:33.800 align:start position:0%
student teaching um and to the school
 
04:07:34.950 --> 04:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
and then I
 
04:07:38.790 --> 04:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
graduate when I go to school X again at
 
04:07:41.030 --> 04:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
the start all over again so wouldn't it
 
04:07:43.950 --> 04:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
be um just as efficient if we started
 
04:07:46.750 --> 04:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
the criminal record check in the higher
 
04:07:48.750 --> 04:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
higher level of Education in the second
 
04:07:50.710 --> 04:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
year because they had going on student
 
04:07:52.550 --> 04:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
teaching they have do observations and
 
04:07:54.070 --> 04:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
then it would carry over into the first
 
04:07:56.429 --> 04:07:56.439 align:start position:0%
year of application for uh School
 
04:07:58.990 --> 04:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
application to be teacher you see what I
 
04:08:02.109 --> 04:08:02.119 align:start position:0%
mean I I understand that but of course
 
04:08:04.389 --> 04:08:04.399 align:start position:0%
many of these gen head courses that are
 
04:08:06.950 --> 04:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
taking as freshmen are also methods
 
04:08:10.389 --> 04:08:10.399 align:start position:0%
courses in in education and if a
 
04:08:11.910 --> 04:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
person's not going to pass that criminal
 
04:08:13.550 --> 04:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
background check why then would they be
 
04:08:15.790 --> 04:08:15.800 align:start position:0%
taking those courses so it's also a c
 
04:08:17.510 --> 04:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
cost saving to have it as early as
 
04:08:19.910 --> 04:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
possible but by extending it to to go
 
04:08:21.510 --> 04:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
through that duration they have to get
 
04:08:24.510 --> 04:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
another one check upon entering a school
 
04:08:27.389 --> 04:08:27.399 align:start position:0%
uh of getting that credential so there's
 
04:08:29.550 --> 04:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
a number of these checks which we heard
 
04:08:31.990 --> 04:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
about in the teacher shortage committee
 
04:08:33.269 --> 04:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
and that was one of the recommendations
 
04:08:34.670 --> 04:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
that came out of the shortage committee
 
04:08:38.149 --> 04:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
how to save students this this cost and
 
04:08:39.830 --> 04:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
this is one recommendation that came out
 
04:08:43.189 --> 04:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
of that that committee that we had this
 
04:08:46.070 --> 04:08:46.080 align:start position:0%

04:10:12.920 --> 04:10:15.510 align:start position:0%
check which is publicly available
records

04:10:15.510 --> 04:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:17.870 --> 04:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
check any
 
04:10:20.429 --> 04:10:20.439 align:start position:0%
questions yeah could you repeat could
 
04:10:22.070 --> 04:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
you repeat those numbers once again for
 
04:10:24.830 --> 04:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
student and employee it is okay so for a
 
04:10:27.630 --> 04:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
volunteer it's
 
04:10:31.149 --> 04:10:31.159 align:start position:0%
2125 and for an employee a regular
 
04:10:36.030 --> 04:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:38.429 --> 04:10:38.439 align:start position:0%
4825 thank you
 
04:10:40.590 --> 04:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
represent McDonald thank you and thank
 
04:10:42.189 --> 04:10:42.199 align:start position:0%
you for being here and answering that
 
04:10:44.990 --> 04:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
question um another question what is the
 
04:10:48.229 --> 04:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
difference um between the prices is that
 
04:10:50.229 --> 04:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
a different check being performed
 
04:10:53.109 --> 04:10:53.119 align:start position:0%
between student and employee no it's the
 
04:10:55.950 --> 04:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
same check it's the we get a discount
 
04:10:58.910 --> 04:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
from the FBI as well for a volunteer
 
04:11:00.830 --> 04:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
because we get charged for them for
 
04:11:02.389 --> 04:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
every check that we complete through
 
04:11:05.269 --> 04:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
them so they recognize volunteers are
 
04:11:08.109 --> 04:11:08.119 align:start position:0%
not getting paid for their service so
 
04:11:10.469 --> 04:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
that's why there's a
 
04:11:12.950 --> 04:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
difference represent Cornell Thank you
 
04:11:14.670 --> 04:11:14.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so this
 
04:11:17.109 --> 04:11:17.119 align:start position:0%
is the national FBI check that check
 
04:11:20.910 --> 04:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
correct it's only $25 no
 
04:11:23.950 --> 04:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
$25 is the New Hampshire criminal
 
04:11:26.950 --> 04:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
conviction check and that I think is
 
04:11:29.070 --> 04:11:29.080 align:start position:0%
what representative Tanner was
 
04:11:32.510 --> 04:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
referencing and the $25 check is just
 
04:11:34.750 --> 04:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
publicly available New Hampshire
 
04:11:37.309 --> 04:11:37.319 align:start position:0%
criminal conviction checks it is not
 
04:11:39.550 --> 04:11:39.560 align:start position:0%
fingerprint based okay do you know how
 
04:11:42.750 --> 04:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
much the other one is the the the
 
04:11:46.469 --> 04:11:46.479 align:start position:0%
national either 2125 for a
 
04:11:49.070 --> 04:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
volunteer or
 
04:11:52.590 --> 04:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
4825 for an
 
04:11:55.229 --> 04:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
employee thank
 
04:11:59.670 --> 04:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
you both of the 2125 and the 4825 both
 
04:12:02.750 --> 04:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
go through the FBI and it's fingerprint
 
04:12:02.760 --> 04:12:06.070 align:start position:0%
go through the FBI and it's fingerprint
based

04:12:06.070 --> 04:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:09.870 --> 04:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
okay you you mentioned um
 
04:12:13.510 --> 04:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
21 maybe 25 for was it for non-
 
04:12:17.990 --> 04:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:21.469 --> 04:12:21.479 align:start position:0%
$21.25 right is for the volunteer right
 
04:12:23.750 --> 04:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
and that's the FBI fingerprint check
 
04:12:25.429 --> 04:12:25.439 align:start position:0%
correct right and
 
04:12:28.790 --> 04:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
4825 for an employee fingerprint check
 
04:12:30.630 --> 04:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
correct but was there another amount you
 
04:12:33.630 --> 04:12:33.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned for um a state criminal
 
04:12:36.910 --> 04:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
records check only right that's the $25
 
04:12:40.309 --> 04:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
one but in this circumstance they need
 
04:12:44.070 --> 04:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:46.189 --> 04:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
check any further questions
 
04:12:48.389 --> 04:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock I'm not going to
 
04:12:49.910 --> 04:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
ask you how much you said it seven times
 
04:12:52.830 --> 04:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
but it's okay the total so the total of
 
04:12:54.750 --> 04:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
those who if I was a teaching applicant
 
04:12:57.710 --> 04:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
it would be about 75 80 bucks they put
 
04:12:59.389 --> 04:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
you put the fingerprint and the 40
 
04:13:01.750 --> 04:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
together you wouldn't do both together
 
04:13:04.269 --> 04:13:04.279 align:start position:0%
so when they were going through school
 
04:13:06.910 --> 04:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
if it was you know just our piece of it
 
04:13:09.990 --> 04:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
is just 2125 and then when they go to
 
04:13:10.000 --> 04:13:11.189 align:start position:0%
is just 2125 and then when they go to
get

04:13:11.189 --> 04:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
get
 
04:13:14.309 --> 04:13:14.319 align:start position:0%
employed then they would need to do the
 
04:13:17.710 --> 04:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
4825 four years later if that makes
 
04:13:20.990 --> 04:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
sense so for a to for a teacher
 
04:13:23.630 --> 04:13:23.640 align:start position:0%
certification background check to go to
 
04:13:26.070 --> 04:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
any school in Hampshire is still it's
 
04:13:28.510 --> 04:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
not up the $125 $150 range it's not at
 
04:13:31.510 --> 04:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
the figure you just hold us right I know
 
04:13:33.670 --> 04:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
doe and I don't know if Diana might be
 
04:13:35.710 --> 04:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
able to help answer some of this I know
 
04:13:38.910 --> 04:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
doe has a different part regarding their
 
04:13:41.349 --> 04:13:41.359 align:start position:0%
process so I'm not 100% sure what their
 
04:13:43.710 --> 04:13:43.720 align:start position:0%
fees are when it comes to going through
 
04:13:46.070 --> 04:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
the doe
 
04:13:49.910 --> 04:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
process okay thank you you're
 
04:13:52.429 --> 04:13:52.439 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you very much appreciate
 
04:13:55.750 --> 04:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
your uh your answer on price she give us
 
04:13:57.950 --> 04:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
a pink card could you ask her for a pink
 
04:14:00.349 --> 04:14:00.359 align:start position:0%
card oh yes could you fill out a pink
 
04:14:04.469 --> 04:14:04.479 align:start position:0%
card for us also thank you very
 
04:14:08.070 --> 04:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
much um was there anything further from
 
04:14:11.189 --> 04:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
the Department that um attorney Fenton
 
04:14:14.429 --> 04:14:14.439 align:start position:0%
would like to add on to uh pricing
 
04:14:19.389 --> 04:14:19.399 align:start position:0%
or anything for the the criminal records
 
04:14:21.790 --> 04:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
checks question I just can't answer how
 
04:14:24.469 --> 04:14:24.479 align:start position:0%
much it cost okay do does anyone have
 
04:14:26.670 --> 04:14:26.680 align:start position:0%
any questions yes evidently someone has
 
04:14:29.429 --> 04:14:29.439 align:start position:0%
a question for you we don't want you to
 
04:14:31.990 --> 04:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
feel left out I don't want to feel up
 
04:14:33.870 --> 04:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
that I hope you don't ask me how much it
 
04:14:36.229 --> 04:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
costs cuz that was very I'll have to
 
04:14:38.950 --> 04:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
defer my friend there represent Damon
 
04:14:40.870 --> 04:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm entirely asking
 
04:14:42.389 --> 04:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
this question to not keep you left out
 
04:14:45.389 --> 04:14:45.399 align:start position:0%
and it's not for the fee I got confused
 
04:14:47.710 --> 04:14:47.720 align:start position:0%
with the last comment
 
04:14:51.229 --> 04:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
so this is not the doe check but this is
 
04:14:54.070 --> 04:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
for Teacher credentialing applicants I
 
04:14:55.429 --> 04:14:55.439 align:start position:0%
don't understand the difference between
 
04:14:57.630 --> 04:14:57.640 align:start position:0%
the doe check and whatever this
 
04:15:02.389 --> 04:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
is so the the way that it's structured
 
04:15:04.550 --> 04:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
if you look at I have the book thanks to
 
04:15:04.560 --> 04:15:05.670 align:start position:0%
if you look at I have the book thanks to
representative

04:15:05.670 --> 04:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:15:08.070 --> 04:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
Tanner um
 
04:15:10.550 --> 04:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
she what's that do you have the blue
 
04:15:12.309 --> 04:15:12.319 align:start position:0%
book I don't I don't have the new book
 
04:15:14.109 --> 04:15:14.119 align:start position:0%
yet there's one on the there's one on
 
04:15:16.469 --> 04:15:16.479 align:start position:0%
the table I'm I'm always behind so I'm
 
04:15:20.830 --> 04:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
going to read old old L to you here
 
04:15:23.870 --> 04:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
um thanks a lot representative Tanner I
 
04:15:27.229 --> 04:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
didn't get my book this year it happen
 
04:15:29.189 --> 04:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
check for the boss
 
04:15:35.469 --> 04:15:35.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:39.149 --> 04:15:39.159 align:start position:0%
18913a and we'll start start with
 
04:15:45.269 --> 04:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
18913a and then there's 18913 B and
 
04:15:51.870 --> 04:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
C so looking at 18913 C talks about
 
04:15:54.510 --> 04:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
credentialing and student candidates
 
04:15:57.429 --> 04:15:57.439 align:start position:0%
credential and applicant and candidates
 
04:16:00.950 --> 04:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
um so my understanding is that this
 
04:16:03.109 --> 04:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
section was
 
04:16:06.590 --> 04:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
created because if you have a teacher
 
04:16:10.189 --> 04:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
prep program such as St anam's college
 
04:16:12.309 --> 04:16:12.319 align:start position:0%
or Keen state which people are very
 
04:16:16.429 --> 04:16:16.439 align:start position:0%
familiar with the issue became
 
04:16:19.469 --> 04:16:19.479 align:start position:0%
that because those entities and I will
 
04:16:21.670 --> 04:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
refer to my uh counterpart at the
 
04:16:23.950 --> 04:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
department of safety who just testified
 
04:16:25.910 --> 04:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
um if I could ask you to come join me
 
04:16:28.670 --> 04:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
Christine um so my understanding and I
 
04:16:30.469 --> 04:16:30.479 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that I'm saying this
 
04:16:32.469 --> 04:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
correctly so I'll have uh I'll have my
 
04:16:33.990 --> 04:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
counterpart here just in case I messed
 
04:16:37.189 --> 04:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
up my understanding is Keen State SN
 
04:16:39.710 --> 04:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
College they are non-governmental
 
04:16:41.910 --> 04:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
entities they're private they're private
 
04:16:44.189 --> 04:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
universities is that right correct okay
 
04:16:48.389 --> 04:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
good so they're private and they cannot
 
04:16:51.790 --> 04:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
receive the federal background check
 
04:16:53.990 --> 04:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
right correct okay we're off to a great
 
04:16:56.830 --> 04:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
start the Department of Education and
 
04:16:59.149 --> 04:16:59.159 align:start position:0%
representative Damon I I see I want to
 
04:17:02.109 --> 04:17:02.119 align:start position:0%
make sure I answer your question so if
 
04:17:05.950 --> 04:17:05.960 align:start position:0%
uh if you want to chime in um so that
 
04:17:08.109 --> 04:17:08.119 align:start position:0%
became an issue
 
04:17:10.870 --> 04:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
because Keen state for example I'll just
 
04:17:13.389 --> 04:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
pick on Keen State they couldn't access
 
04:17:16.389 --> 04:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
this information and
 
04:17:20.349 --> 04:17:20.359 align:start position:0%
so what ended up happening is if I'm a
 
04:17:22.469 --> 04:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
candidate at a teacher prep program and
 
04:17:25.109 --> 04:17:25.119 align:start position:0%
I wanted to go work at kennet high
 
04:17:29.189 --> 04:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:32.349 --> 04:17:32.359 align:start position:0%
academics I had to go to kennet high
 
04:17:34.309 --> 04:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
school and kennet high school had to run
 
04:17:37.309 --> 04:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
my record and Keen state was suddenly
 
04:17:39.030 --> 04:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
left out of the
 
04:17:42.990 --> 04:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
loop and Keen State and any college
 
04:17:45.469 --> 04:17:45.479 align:start position:0%
wanted to be an active participant in
 
04:17:47.469 --> 04:17:47.479 align:start position:0%
that discussion because they didn't want
 
04:17:49.870 --> 04:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
to be having students who would not be
 
04:17:51.990 --> 04:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
employable pursuant to the list of
 
04:17:54.309 --> 04:17:54.319 align:start position:0%
disqualifying offenses found in
 
04:17:56.910 --> 04:17:56.920 align:start position:0%
18913a real numeral
 
04:17:56.920 --> 04:17:58.429 align:start position:0%

5
 
04:18:00.870 --> 04:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
right they wanted to be an active
 
04:18:02.510 --> 04:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
participant in that but because they
 
04:18:04.710 --> 04:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
were not a non-governmental entity they
 
04:18:04.720 --> 04:18:05.710 align:start position:0%
were not a non-governmental entity they
couldn't

04:18:05.710 --> 04:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
couldn't
 
04:18:08.910 --> 04:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
be so it was left at the behest of each
 
04:18:10.550 --> 04:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
individual school district and and
 
04:18:12.269 --> 04:18:12.279 align:start position:0%
everyone knows I'm not from the field
 
04:18:14.389 --> 04:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is in a teacher
 
04:18:18.189 --> 04:18:18.199 align:start position:0%
prep program it is a fair statement that
 
04:18:20.469 --> 04:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
as a teacher prep candidate you go to a
 
04:18:22.309 --> 04:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
lot of schools you have a lot of
 
04:18:24.229 --> 04:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
hands-on experience representative Cad
 
04:18:25.870 --> 04:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
and I will just see if that's an
 
04:18:28.710 --> 04:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
accurate statement and so it became a
 
04:18:30.590 --> 04:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
huge burden on all these individual
 
04:18:33.750 --> 04:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
schools Bartlett Elementary Berlin High
 
04:18:36.030 --> 04:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
School what what have you to run these
 
04:18:38.750 --> 04:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
multiple checks ta and the candidate was
 
04:18:41.389 --> 04:18:41.399 align:start position:0%
having to pay out that money how much
 
04:18:43.950 --> 04:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
2125 there you go
 
04:18:45.990 --> 04:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
2125 every
 
04:18:48.750 --> 04:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
time it's it's late it's 2 o'clock in
 
04:18:50.229 --> 04:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
the afternoon we all needed a laugh
 
04:18:53.469 --> 04:18:53.479 align:start position:0%
right so the candidate it became overly
 
04:18:55.870 --> 04:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
burdensome not only on the schools that
 
04:18:57.670 --> 04:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
were offering this great opportunity but
 
04:18:59.189 --> 04:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
on the candidates
 
04:19:02.109 --> 04:19:02.119 align:start position:0%
financially and logistically there were
 
04:19:04.429 --> 04:19:04.439 align:start position:0%
problems because some candidates as some
 
04:19:06.429 --> 04:19:06.439 align:start position:0%
college students they didn't have cars
 
04:19:08.269 --> 04:19:08.279 align:start position:0%
right and they were having to go to the
 
04:19:10.149 --> 04:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
troop station or the local police
 
04:19:13.750 --> 04:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
department multiple times and and some
 
04:19:15.790 --> 04:19:15.800 align:start position:0%
of the anecdotal evidence we were
 
04:19:19.550 --> 04:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
hearing from students was that they felt
 
04:19:20.950 --> 04:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
like they were being treated like
 
04:19:22.790 --> 04:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
criminals having to go to the police
 
04:19:24.590 --> 04:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
department multiple times they didn't
 
04:19:26.910 --> 04:19:26.920 align:start position:0%
want to do it and frankly I don't blame
 
04:19:29.389 --> 04:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
them no offense you guys are great but
 
04:19:32.389 --> 04:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
um so these were some of the logistical
 
04:19:34.070 --> 04:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
issues that were occurring the
 
04:19:36.630 --> 04:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
department of education however is a
 
04:19:39.109 --> 04:19:39.119 align:start position:0%
governmental entity and the department
 
04:19:40.950 --> 04:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
can receive the criminal record check
 
04:19:42.630 --> 04:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
from the FBI is that right that's
 
04:19:45.670 --> 04:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
correct okay so far so good so that is
 
04:19:50.910 --> 04:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
why 18913 C was created to alleviate
 
04:19:54.070 --> 04:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
that burden from the field alleviate
 
04:19:56.109 --> 04:19:56.119 align:start position:0%
that burden from the individual
 
04:19:58.070 --> 04:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
candidate and the individual school
 
04:20:01.590 --> 04:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
districts put it on the
 
04:20:03.750 --> 04:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
department so the department could play
 
04:20:05.590 --> 04:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
an active role in that because again the
 
04:20:07.550 --> 04:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
department could get that piece of
 
04:20:09.550 --> 04:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
information the FBI background
 
04:20:12.469 --> 04:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
check that's why that section which was
 
04:20:15.630 --> 04:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
passed by this legislative body was
 
04:20:18.149 --> 04:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
created and now my understanding of the
 
04:20:21.189 --> 04:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
bill in front of you is to expand the
 
04:20:24.389 --> 04:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
time from a three-year period to a
 
04:20:24.399 --> 04:20:27.149 align:start position:0%
time from a three-year period to a
4-year

04:20:27.149 --> 04:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:31.750 --> 04:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:31.760 --> 04:20:34.750 align:start position:0%
 
question

04:20:34.750 --> 04:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:20:37.229 --> 04:20:37.239 align:start position:0%
great anything further
 
04:20:39.389 --> 04:20:39.399 align:start position:0%
uh representative Casen thank you can I
 
04:20:42.109 --> 04:20:42.119 align:start position:0%
just add the criminal background check
 
04:20:43.990 --> 04:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
is not transferable from one school
 
04:20:46.349 --> 04:20:46.359 align:start position:0%
district to another that's
 
04:20:48.590 --> 04:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
correct and I will add to that thank you
 
04:20:51.550 --> 04:20:51.560 align:start position:0%
very much um you cannot disseminate that
 
04:20:54.990 --> 04:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
record so one of the one of the
 
04:20:57.349 --> 04:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
discussion points we have continually
 
04:21:00.030 --> 04:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
had within this committee when questions
 
04:21:02.870 --> 04:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
come up as to Department of Ed when you
 
04:21:05.550 --> 04:21:05.560 align:start position:0%
are licensing someone to teach can't you
 
04:21:07.990 --> 04:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
transfer that record to the employing
 
04:21:10.510 --> 04:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
district the answer is a resounding no
 
04:21:11.990 --> 04:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
is that right that's correct okay
 
04:21:14.550 --> 04:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
perfect because you're not allowed to
 
04:21:15.910 --> 04:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
disseminate the
 
04:21:19.109 --> 04:21:19.119 align:start position:0%
record period end of sentence and so
 
04:21:20.990 --> 04:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
that has caused issues at time as well
 
04:21:23.469 --> 04:21:23.479 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate that comment because
 
04:21:26.830 --> 04:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
again if I was a teacher prep candidate
 
04:21:29.269 --> 04:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
and I went to Berlin high school for to
 
04:21:32.229 --> 04:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
fulfill a requirement Berlin could then
 
04:21:34.950 --> 04:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
they were not allowed to transfer that
 
04:21:36.790 --> 04:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
record to kenet high school school which
 
04:21:39.389 --> 04:21:39.399 align:start position:0%
is right down the road because it would
 
04:21:41.550 --> 04:21:41.560 align:start position:0%
violate the federal regulations and
 
04:21:44.149 --> 04:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
likewise kennet couldn't rely on well
 
04:21:46.149 --> 04:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
they were just in Berlin they're fine
 
04:21:50.630 --> 04:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:55.870 --> 04:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
record great thank you very much um yes
 
04:21:58.309 --> 04:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
representative Damon just want to verify
 
04:22:01.149 --> 04:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
that you just said that the prohibition
 
04:22:03.950 --> 04:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
on transferring or whatever the right
 
04:22:09.710 --> 04:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:13.070 --> 04:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
it's considered by it's considered by
 
04:22:15.189 --> 04:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
the FBI to be a secondary
 
04:22:17.469 --> 04:22:17.479 align:start position:0%
dissemination and they don't allow for
 
04:22:20.790 --> 04:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
that the reason being is protecting an
 
04:22:23.750 --> 04:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
individual's right to privacy and so
 
04:22:25.469 --> 04:22:25.479 align:start position:0%
when they're signing off they're signing
 
04:22:28.469 --> 04:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
off just for that individual
 
04:22:33.990 --> 04:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:39.590 --> 04:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:42.830 --> 04:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
quickly what did we do for bus drivers
 
04:22:44.710 --> 04:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
and didn't we do something for bus
 
04:22:48.149 --> 04:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
drivers that drive in different
 
04:22:53.070 --> 04:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
districts um I maybe you can talk to um
 
04:22:56.269 --> 04:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
uh Miss Fenton um offline because we
 
04:22:58.389 --> 04:22:58.399 align:start position:0%
really want to focus on this bill and
 
04:23:02.229 --> 04:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
want to have then a brief caucus I will
 
04:23:04.429 --> 04:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
I can the short answer
 
04:23:08.550 --> 04:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
is yes if you look at 18913 B I always
 
04:23:11.269 --> 04:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
think of it as B for bus driver and C
 
04:23:15.309 --> 04:23:15.319 align:start position:0%
for credential for candidate um but 189
 
04:23:17.349 --> 04:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
13B was created to address the bus
 
04:23:20.269 --> 04:23:20.279 align:start position:0%
driver issue to allow them
 
04:23:23.429 --> 04:23:23.439 align:start position:0%
more Mobility pun
 
04:23:25.750 --> 04:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
intended yes representative Cornell
 
04:23:27.590 --> 04:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
Thank you thank you thank you for this
 
04:23:29.309 --> 04:23:29.319 align:start position:0%
question because it's completely off the
 
04:23:31.389 --> 04:23:31.399 align:start position:0%
wall but you have any idea why we're
 
04:23:34.990 --> 04:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:39.070 --> 04:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
$150 hey don't I know um doe does have
 
04:23:41.389 --> 04:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
some fees but I can't speak to what
 
04:23:44.429 --> 04:23:44.439 align:start position:0%
their fees are specifically and I will
 
04:23:45.950 --> 04:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
get you that information I don't know
 
04:23:48.229 --> 04:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head um I don't think
 
04:23:50.950 --> 04:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
for candidates it's a charge I know for
 
04:23:55.030 --> 04:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
um when you be get certified as an an
 
04:23:58.229 --> 04:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
educator all right I want to say $150
 
04:24:00.070 --> 04:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
for three years but please don't quote
 
04:24:03.030 --> 04:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
me on that I will get this committed
 
04:24:05.429 --> 04:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
that information well thank you Mr chair
 
04:24:06.790 --> 04:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
so I just
 
04:24:09.229 --> 04:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
clarify for me I'm a student at Keen
 
04:24:10.510 --> 04:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
state I'm a
 
04:24:12.429 --> 04:24:12.439 align:start position:0%
sophomore and I'm declared that I'm
 
04:24:13.990 --> 04:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
going to be a
 
04:24:17.030 --> 04:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
teacher I run the I run the criminal
 
04:24:21.550 --> 04:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
records check that goes through the
 
04:24:24.389 --> 04:24:24.399 align:start position:0%
department this the the the department
 
04:24:24.399 --> 04:24:25.630 align:start position:0%
department this the the the department
hold

04:24:25.630 --> 04:24:25.640 align:start position:0%
hold
 
04:24:31.109 --> 04:24:31.119 align:start position:0%
that records check which then enables me
 
04:24:35.030 --> 04:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
to from keing state to go to manad high
 
04:24:38.070 --> 04:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
school or conal high school because the
 
04:24:40.710 --> 04:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
department holds the criminal records
 
04:24:43.870 --> 04:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
check that I can use multiple sites to
 
04:24:48.510 --> 04:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
do my student uh my student teaching
 
04:24:51.469 --> 04:24:51.479 align:start position:0%
experience is that
 
04:24:53.830 --> 04:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
correct that's my understanding and if
 
04:24:57.349 --> 04:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
you look at 18913 C yes it talks about
 
04:24:59.349 --> 04:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
the department completing that
 
04:25:01.510 --> 04:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
confidential criminal history records
 
04:25:05.790 --> 04:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
check then as a followup then as a once
 
04:25:09.870 --> 04:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
I complete my uh program and I become
 
04:25:12.109 --> 04:25:12.119 align:start position:0%
credentialed then the criminal record
 
04:25:16.830 --> 04:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
check is specific to a school district
 
04:25:19.269 --> 04:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
and the school district has that
 
04:25:21.870 --> 04:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
criminal record check of which I can
 
04:25:24.830 --> 04:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
only use that criminal record check for
 
04:25:29.429 --> 04:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:34.070 --> 04:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
correct that's when they become an
 
04:25:36.750 --> 04:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
employee it's that is correct correct I
 
04:25:38.910 --> 04:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
think it's a little bit more nuanced
 
04:25:43.389 --> 04:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
than that simply because if you're if
 
04:25:44.590 --> 04:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
once you're
 
04:25:52.309 --> 04:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:54.750 --> 04:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
educator you're just licensed to be an
 
04:25:57.670 --> 04:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
educator it's not for one particular
 
04:26:00.670 --> 04:26:00.680 align:start position:0%
school that's not how the licensing is
 
04:26:03.830 --> 04:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
structured but this bill is basically
 
04:26:06.710 --> 04:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
dealing with the licensing
 
04:26:10.630 --> 04:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
of for a student teacher correct not
 
04:26:12.950 --> 04:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
let's don't get into my second question
 
04:26:15.670 --> 04:26:15.680 align:start position:0%
let's just focus on this so This enables
 
04:26:18.830 --> 04:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
a a student to be basically One records
 
04:26:22.030 --> 04:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
check un during their undergraduate work
 
04:26:25.149 --> 04:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
to enable them to have multiple teaching
 
04:26:27.149 --> 04:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
experience student teaching experiences
 
04:26:29.710 --> 04:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
is that correct that's the way the law
 
04:26:32.790 --> 04:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
is already structured under 1893 just
 
04:26:35.030 --> 04:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
moves it to another year that's right
 
04:26:38.630 --> 04:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:42.269 --> 04:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
we're done great
 
04:26:46.149 --> 04:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
thinkk I tried sorry it's
 
04:26:48.389 --> 04:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
quick thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:26:51.229 --> 04:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question um why are we not
 
04:26:53.269 --> 04:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
doing it the same way for
 
04:26:55.870 --> 04:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
teachers where where the department is
 
04:26:58.429 --> 04:26:58.439 align:start position:0%
holding the background check so that
 
04:26:58.439 --> 04:26:59.670 align:start position:0%
holding the background check so that
they

04:26:59.670 --> 04:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:27:01.990 --> 04:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
can they're not worrying about having to
 
04:27:04.910 --> 04:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
do another check if they move to another
 
04:27:04.920 --> 04:27:11.429 align:start position:0%
do another check if they move to another
District

04:27:11.429 --> 04:27:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:13.550 --> 04:27:13.560 align:start position:0%
because you would remove the discretion
 
04:27:16.510 --> 04:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
of each individual individual employing
 
04:27:19.429 --> 04:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
school district and the way the system
 
04:27:21.030 --> 04:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
is structured
 
04:27:23.790 --> 04:27:23.800 align:start position:0%
currently is that the department just
 
04:27:26.189 --> 04:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
reviews for what are called the
 
04:27:28.309 --> 04:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
disqualifying offenses and again those
 
04:27:30.109 --> 04:27:30.119 align:start position:0%
are found in
 
04:27:33.750 --> 04:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
18913a paragraph five each school
 
04:27:36.710 --> 04:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
district is allowed by law want to get
 
04:27:39.429 --> 04:27:39.439 align:start position:0%
freshman involved consider other
 
04:27:42.630 --> 04:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
offenses that are not on that list of
 
04:27:44.910 --> 04:27:44.920 align:start position:0%
disqualifiers and that is by School
 
04:27:47.710 --> 04:27:47.720 align:start position:0%
District policy they can take that into
 
04:27:51.349 --> 04:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
account um and they can decide what is a
 
04:27:56.429 --> 04:27:56.439 align:start position:0%
good fit in their particular school okay

04:41:43.470 --> 04:41:43.480 align:start position:0%
it is their duty to protect the children
 
04:41:46.270 --> 04:41:46.280 align:start position:0%
and report it you might ask why they
 
04:41:49.190 --> 04:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't report I have a few scenarios
 
04:41:51.830 --> 04:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
what if I'm wrong my answer to that is
 
04:41:52.948 --> 04:41:52.958 align:start position:0%
what if you're
 
04:41:57.110 --> 04:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
right uh well that that Dad is my friend
 
04:41:59.350 --> 04:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
while we're here talking about the
 
04:42:02.708 --> 04:42:02.718 align:start position:0%
children um I know that family and
 
04:42:04.910 --> 04:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
there's no way then I ask you if you
 
04:42:06.430 --> 04:42:06.440 align:start position:0%
have a crystal ball or you know what
 
04:42:09.590 --> 04:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
goes on behind closed doors this bill
 
04:42:12.750 --> 04:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
would make failure to report a
 
04:42:16.070 --> 04:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
disqualifying offense if the individual
 
04:42:18.708 --> 04:42:18.718 align:start position:0%
charged is seeking employment or
 
04:42:21.510 --> 04:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
credentialing this policy this is a
 
04:42:24.190 --> 04:42:24.200 align:start position:0%
policy choice that we must consider and
 
04:42:27.390 --> 04:42:27.400 align:start position:0%
ask ourselves if we want an individual
 
04:42:29.990 --> 04:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
that has been charged Andor convicted of
 
04:42:32.990 --> 04:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
failing to report child abuse or neglect
 
04:42:35.150 --> 04:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
in our classrooms
 
04:42:37.550 --> 04:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time thank you are
 
04:42:38.708 --> 04:42:38.718 align:start position:0%
there any questions of the
 
04:42:40.470 --> 04:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
representative yes representative
 
04:42:44.150 --> 04:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you um I'm kind
 
04:42:49.708 --> 04:42:49.718 align:start position:0%
of uh a little bit confused I guess why
 
04:42:51.708 --> 04:42:51.718 align:start position:0%
you would put failure to report abuse
 
04:42:55.670 --> 04:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
and neglect as in violation of RSA 169
 
04:42:59.948 --> 04:42:59.958 align:start position:0%
rather than just abuse and neglect is in
 
04:43:03.910 --> 04:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
violation of because it's not that the
 
04:43:08.230 --> 04:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
the School employee commits that it's if
 
04:43:11.550 --> 04:43:11.560 align:start position:0%
they fail to report it but wouldn't you
 
04:43:13.788 --> 04:43:13.798 align:start position:0%
not want to hire somebody that had
 
04:43:15.708 --> 04:43:15.718 align:start position:0%
committed that well they would be if
 
04:43:18.110 --> 04:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
they were charged with that that would
 
04:43:20.110 --> 04:43:20.120 align:start position:0%
be a criminal offense so that would
 
04:43:23.470 --> 04:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
probably fall under some of the other um
 
04:43:25.910 --> 04:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
list of things that are not credentials
 
04:43:29.670 --> 04:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
so so dangering the welfare of a child
 
04:43:34.910 --> 04:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
oh yes sorry go ahead so um first degree
 
04:43:37.230 --> 04:43:37.240 align:start position:0%
assault manslaughter oh not manslaughter
 
04:43:38.750 --> 04:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
the first degree
 
04:43:43.030 --> 04:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
assault so how how would somebody I I
 
04:43:44.868 --> 04:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
just don't understand the failure to
 
04:43:47.830 --> 04:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
report but we're as teachers we're we're
 
04:43:51.910 --> 04:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
told that we are um you know obligated
 
04:43:56.830 --> 04:43:56.840 align:start position:0%
to report abuse and neglect and um I
 
04:43:59.350 --> 04:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want anybody hired that that
 
04:44:02.750 --> 04:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
did abuse or neglect which I don't know
 
04:44:06.430 --> 04:44:06.440 align:start position:0%
for sure if that's in one of these um
 
04:44:06.440 --> 04:44:08.510 align:start position:0%
for sure if that's in one of these um
specified

04:44:08.510 --> 04:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
specified
 
04:44:12.270 --> 04:44:12.280 align:start position:0%
uh specified uh criminal charges that
 
04:44:15.030 --> 04:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
dis are immediately disqualifying and so
 
04:44:17.830 --> 04:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
I guess how would failure to report
 
04:44:20.910 --> 04:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
abuse or neglect be in um for example
 
04:44:23.708 --> 04:44:23.718 align:start position:0%
criminal record checks would it be is it
 
04:44:25.708 --> 04:44:25.718 align:start position:0%
is it something that people get charged
 
04:44:28.230 --> 04:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
with is it something that happens a lot
 
04:44:29.670 --> 04:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
04:44:33.750 --> 04:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
it it does happen um failure to to
 
04:44:36.350 --> 04:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
report does I mean it probably more
 
04:44:39.628 --> 04:44:39.638 align:start position:0%
readily it would be from um people who
 
04:44:42.948 --> 04:44:42.958 align:start position:0%
know the family and see this CH children
 
04:44:44.470 --> 04:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
but I was speaking to someone here
 
04:44:47.910 --> 04:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
earlier who said I have reported I
 
04:44:50.510 --> 04:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
reported multiple times as a
 
04:44:53.510 --> 04:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
teacher of things that have come up you
 
04:44:56.550 --> 04:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
know children and but if you don't
 
04:45:00.788 --> 04:45:00.798 align:start position:0%
report that is the criminal liability I
 
04:45:03.670 --> 04:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
believe still here well I'll ask
 
04:45:06.190 --> 04:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
somebody else yes I just how do you and
 
04:45:09.030 --> 04:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
I believe that if you're convicted of
 
04:45:13.990 --> 04:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
child abuse that would fall under
 
04:45:17.270 --> 04:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
um uh I don't know if abuse and
 
04:45:19.708 --> 04:45:19.718 align:start position:0%
neglect are under there
 
04:45:22.350 --> 04:45:22.360 align:start position:0%
butet Park Street I don't want to go
 
04:45:22.360 --> 04:45:24.270 align:start position:0%
butet Park Street I don't want to go
there

04:45:24.270 --> 04:45:24.280 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:45:24.280 --> 04:45:26.270 align:start position:0%
there
going

04:45:26.270 --> 04:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
going
 
04:45:28.910 --> 04:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
next so I just don't know how the
 
04:45:31.510 --> 04:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
failure you know how you get convicted
 
04:45:33.910 --> 04:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
of failing to to and whether that
 
04:45:37.550 --> 04:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
becomes apart is a criminal charge
 
04:45:39.868 --> 04:45:39.878 align:start position:0%
that's at the level that these other
 
04:45:42.910 --> 04:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
ones are so I guess that's my question
 
04:45:44.788 --> 04:45:44.798 align:start position:0%
but Diana may have a little bit more
 
04:45:46.868 --> 04:45:46.878 align:start position:0%
information on it can we borrow Diana
 
04:45:48.670 --> 04:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
represent press yes and and I'll ask
 
04:45:49.948 --> 04:45:49.958 align:start position:0%
this question because maybe she can
 
04:45:53.750 --> 04:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
answer this one as well um abuse and
 
04:45:56.990 --> 04:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
neglect and this law reporting to HHS is
 
04:45:59.110 --> 04:45:59.120 align:start position:0%
pretty much in every state as a as a
 
04:46:02.510 --> 04:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
teacher you must report if you suspect
 
04:46:05.670 --> 04:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
mandatory mandatory no question no
 
04:46:08.390 --> 04:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
question um so in the state of New
 
04:46:13.190 --> 04:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire do we know of the number of uh
 
04:46:15.750 --> 04:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
schools that are reporting this did we
 
04:46:18.110 --> 04:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
get some kind of an aggregated you know
 
04:46:20.510 --> 04:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
result of this I do not have that how do
 
04:46:23.430 --> 04:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
we know then and that's probably
 
04:46:25.110 --> 04:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
directed right over to
 
04:46:30.070 --> 04:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
your uh partner from doe here that do
 
04:46:32.110 --> 04:46:32.120 align:start position:0%
how does doe know that maybe there's
 
04:46:34.750 --> 04:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
some that are not reported does it come
 
04:46:37.830 --> 04:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
as a result of a courtroom or HHS
 
04:46:40.030 --> 04:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
reporting back to us and
 
04:46:42.510 --> 04:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
saying there was an issue and we didn't
 
04:46:45.708 --> 04:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
get through why I that would be my guess
 
04:46:49.110 --> 04:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
is that the child is found to have been
 
04:46:52.030 --> 04:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
abused or neglected and the child was
 
04:46:55.110 --> 04:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps in the school and they at that
 
04:46:58.150 --> 04:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
point might go back and say you know
 
04:47:00.150 --> 04:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
didn't you notice that this child had a
 
04:47:03.110 --> 04:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
broken arm one day and bruises the next
 
04:47:03.120 --> 04:47:04.750 align:start position:0%
broken arm one day and bruises the next
day

04:47:04.750 --> 04:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
day
 
04:47:06.350 --> 04:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
that type of thing that would be you
 
04:47:09.670 --> 04:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
know a scenario that I could see I don't
 
04:47:12.230 --> 04:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
think I think people are very hesitant
 
04:47:14.070 --> 04:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
to report
 
04:47:16.590 --> 04:47:16.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I think we forget that
 
04:47:19.150 --> 04:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
it's the child we're dealing with and
 
04:47:22.190 --> 04:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
not anything else other than the child
 
04:47:24.910 --> 04:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
that were but because you are a teacher
 
04:47:26.190 --> 04:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
and I was a
 
04:47:31.750 --> 04:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
nurse you are a mandatory reporter so
 
04:47:34.910 --> 04:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
only you only have to suspect it you
 
04:47:37.270 --> 04:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
don't have to prove it you just have to
 
04:47:42.350 --> 04:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
suspect it and my feeling is is maybe it
 
04:47:45.750 --> 04:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
won't come out you know that this
 
04:47:48.868 --> 04:47:48.878 align:start position:0%
happens a lot but I certainly wouldn't
 
04:47:52.270 --> 04:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
want someone who didn't report it and
 
04:47:56.590 --> 04:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
was found that they had not reported it
 
04:47:58.910 --> 04:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
to be in a classroom be able to be
 
04:48:01.590 --> 04:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
credentialed and be in a classroom and
 
04:48:03.788 --> 04:48:03.798 align:start position:0%
the only way I could see that they could
 
04:48:03.798 --> 04:48:04.628 align:start position:0%
the only way I could see that they could
actually

04:48:04.628 --> 04:48:04.638 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:48:09.750 --> 04:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
be um convicted of this is if it was
 
04:48:13.390 --> 04:48:13.400 align:start position:0%
blatant if it was blatant and you know
 
04:48:16.510 --> 04:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
or if it was unwilling they unwillingly
 
04:48:18.868 --> 04:48:18.878 align:start position:0%
didn't do it there were several things
 
04:48:22.270 --> 04:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
in um the Conneticut um information that
 
04:48:24.590 --> 04:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
I had
 
04:48:29.030 --> 04:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
um failing result can result uh this is
 
04:48:31.750 --> 04:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
um the office of legislation from
 
04:48:34.548 --> 04:48:34.558 align:start position:0%
Connecticut failing to report can result
 
04:48:37.110 --> 04:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
in criminal penalties and expose the
 
04:48:40.110 --> 04:48:40.120 align:start position:0%
mandated reporter to criminal damages if
 
04:48:42.270 --> 04:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
the if the child is further injured
 
04:48:45.910 --> 04:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
because of a mandated reporter did not
 
04:48:50.910 --> 04:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
act um in February uh of 2019 40 States
 
04:48:53.750 --> 04:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
classified failure to report as a
 
04:48:56.590 --> 04:48:56.600 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor or similar
 
04:49:00.990 --> 04:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
charges so failing to report is a crime
 
04:49:04.310 --> 04:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
it's a crime so it's a crime against
 
04:49:06.470 --> 04:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
children and that's who are in the
 
04:49:08.548 --> 04:49:08.558 align:start position:0%
schools and that's who we want with
 
04:49:12.350 --> 04:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
people who would report it if they only
 
04:49:15.230 --> 04:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
only have to suspect they are
 
04:49:18.430 --> 04:49:18.440 align:start position:0%
required does that answer your
 
04:49:21.470 --> 04:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
question it's this a huge issue and as a
 
04:49:21.480 --> 04:49:22.750 align:start position:0%
question it's this a huge issue and as a
past

04:49:22.750 --> 04:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
past
 
04:49:25.510 --> 04:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
principal I had students living in my
 
04:49:27.430 --> 04:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
district that have been kicked out of
 
04:49:31.390 --> 04:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
their house in the backseat of a car and
 
04:49:33.070 --> 04:49:33.080 align:start position:0%
the weather was colder than it was this
 
04:49:37.350 --> 04:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
morning right - 10 - 15 is that neglect
 
04:49:41.990 --> 04:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
yes is is it abuse yes yes and so the
 
04:49:44.510 --> 04:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
reporting we did though we had many Ste
 
04:49:46.670 --> 04:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
teachers in building this did not feel
 
04:49:49.830 --> 04:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
comfortable on the phone with HHS it's
 
04:49:51.548 --> 04:49:51.558 align:start position:0%
that's what it was called up there so we
 
04:49:53.430 --> 04:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
had a process you went to the school
 
04:49:55.830 --> 04:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
psychologist or the nurse the nurse was
 
04:49:57.708 --> 04:49:57.718 align:start position:0%
a person with a master's degree in
 
04:50:01.070 --> 04:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
nursing I was fortunate she made all the
 
04:50:03.310 --> 04:50:03.320 align:start position:0%
contacts because we got through to the
 
04:50:04.990 --> 04:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
people we need to at
 
04:50:08.150 --> 04:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
HHS and we got immediate reaction we
 
04:50:11.030 --> 04:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
reported but it wasn't necessarily
 
04:50:14.390 --> 04:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
teacher Miler here it was teacher Miler
 
04:50:16.230 --> 04:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
talking with the nurse and the nurse did
 
04:50:17.628 --> 04:50:17.638 align:start position:0%
the reporting I don't know if that's
 
04:50:19.910 --> 04:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
kosher or you know allow or not but
 
04:50:22.990 --> 04:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
that's how we found it worked and I
 
04:50:25.230 --> 04:50:25.240 align:start position:0%
understand that's how it could work but
 
04:50:28.788 --> 04:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
technically it's technically technically
 
04:50:32.948 --> 04:50:32.958 align:start position:0%
it's the person who knows of the abuse
 
04:50:35.430 --> 04:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
is the primary a reporter you know as
 
04:50:37.390 --> 04:50:37.400 align:start position:0%
far as I'm concerned as long as it gets
 
04:50:37.400 --> 04:50:38.910 align:start position:0%
far as I'm concerned as long as it gets
promot

04:50:38.910 --> 04:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
promot
 
04:50:42.070 --> 04:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
immediately reported um what was the
 
04:50:44.750 --> 04:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
delay on doing that was it done the same
 
04:50:47.590 --> 04:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
day did it take three days of going back
 
04:50:50.510 --> 04:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
and forth I mean we are talking about
 
04:50:53.910 --> 04:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
children and we go out of our way to say
 
04:50:56.470 --> 04:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
how and teachers especially go out of
 
04:50:58.190 --> 04:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
their way about saying about how we have
 
04:51:01.510 --> 04:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
to protect children and this is a way of
 
04:51:03.868 --> 04:51:03.878 align:start position:0%
protecting children we do not want
 
04:51:03.878 --> 04:51:05.430 align:start position:0%
protecting children we do not want
people

04:51:05.430 --> 04:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:51:08.510 --> 04:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
who are uncomfortable has nothing to do
 
04:51:10.150 --> 04:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
with it it's your job it's your
 
04:51:13.830 --> 04:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
mandatory it's law you have to report
 
04:51:17.230 --> 04:51:17.240 align:start position:0%
you have to report if you even
 
04:51:20.270 --> 04:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
suspect and you know if people
 
04:51:22.990 --> 04:51:23.000 align:start position:0%
understand that it might affect them in
 
04:51:25.750 --> 04:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
a different way perhaps they'd be more
 
04:51:30.230 --> 04:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:34.270 --> 04:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
it yeah represent Woodcock ch good
 
04:51:36.390 --> 04:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you I'm I'm I'm confused
 
04:51:39.628 --> 04:51:39.638 align:start position:0%
which is apparently today the rule
 
04:51:44.948 --> 04:51:44.958 align:start position:0%
um I'm reading this as a candidate for a
 
04:51:47.948 --> 04:51:47.958 align:start position:0%
teaching position under this statute
 
04:51:49.548 --> 04:51:49.558 align:start position:0%
where the superintendent or the director
 
04:51:51.948 --> 04:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
or that organization is does not or
 
04:51:54.230 --> 04:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
shall not hire but when you're talking
 
04:51:57.390 --> 04:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
about theil to report that person is not
 
04:51:59.830 --> 04:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
a teacher yet so they're not a mandated
 
04:52:01.590 --> 04:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
reporter yet so I'm not sure how this
 
04:52:04.628 --> 04:52:04.638 align:start position:0%
would be applicable that's my confusion
 
04:52:09.030 --> 04:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
well I believe it says um
 
04:52:11.628 --> 04:52:11.638 align:start position:0%
um or
 
04:52:13.628 --> 04:52:13.638 align:start position:0%
volunteer wait a minute I can't find my
 
04:52:15.110 --> 04:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
bill hang
 
04:52:17.628 --> 04:52:17.638 align:start position:0%
on this would
 
04:52:19.708 --> 04:52:19.718 align:start position:0%
be here we
 
04:52:22.430 --> 04:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
go employer volunte that's the category
 
04:52:25.190 --> 04:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
person but e in either case they
 
04:52:27.868 --> 04:52:27.878 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they wouldn't have been hired
 
04:52:30.590 --> 04:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't have been the failure
 
04:52:33.110 --> 04:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
report would just be like John citizen
 
04:52:34.788 --> 04:52:34.798 align:start position:0%
at that point you're out of here now so
 
04:52:36.310 --> 04:52:36.320 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't I don't understand
 
04:52:38.110 --> 04:52:38.120 align:start position:0%
applicable to the to this particular
 
04:52:40.110 --> 04:52:40.120 align:start position:0%
stat I understand what you're saying and
 
04:52:42.510 --> 04:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
and and the importance of reporting I'm
 
04:52:45.110 --> 04:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
just not understanding how I'm not an
 
04:52:47.590 --> 04:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
employee yet so how can you ding me for
 
04:52:49.708 --> 04:52:49.718 align:start position:0%
not being I'm not an employee if I I've
 
04:52:51.628 --> 04:52:51.638 align:start position:0%
never reported it because I haven't I
 
04:52:52.670 --> 04:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
haven't been a
 
04:52:56.628 --> 04:52:56.638 align:start position:0%
reporter have you been charged with it
 
04:52:58.590 --> 04:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
or have you this say failure report of
 
04:53:00.430 --> 04:53:00.440 align:start position:0%
you doesn't say have B charges you a
 
04:53:00.440 --> 04:53:01.350 align:start position:0%
you doesn't say have B charges you a
failure

04:53:01.350 --> 04:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
failure
 
04:53:04.350 --> 04:53:04.360 align:start position:0%
report that's all I'm just trying um but
 
04:53:05.910 --> 04:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's my No that's
 
04:53:10.708 --> 04:53:10.718 align:start position:0%
because someone who is um applying for
 
04:53:12.948 --> 04:53:12.958 align:start position:0%
credentialing there's a whole list of
 
04:53:15.990 --> 04:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
things that they can't and failure to
 
04:53:19.390 --> 04:53:19.400 align:start position:0%
report would be added to this as one of
 
04:53:21.910 --> 04:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
the credential in but they would have to
 
04:53:24.670 --> 04:53:24.680 align:start position:0%
be they would have to be have been
 
04:53:26.788 --> 04:53:26.798 align:start position:0%
convicted just like all these other
 
04:53:28.230 --> 04:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
things they would have had to have been
 
04:53:28.240 --> 04:53:29.830 align:start position:0%
things they would have had to have been
convicted

04:53:29.830 --> 04:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
convicted
 
04:53:29.840 --> 04:53:31.868 align:start position:0%
convicted
of

04:53:31.868 --> 04:53:31.878 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:53:35.590 --> 04:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
So yeah thank you so let me say this so
 
04:53:38.750 --> 04:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
this is you're just adding this to the
 
04:53:41.510 --> 04:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
category of the listings of items so
 
04:53:43.628 --> 04:53:43.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have been they have been found
 
04:53:46.750 --> 04:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
guilty of fair report if you've been
 
04:53:48.990 --> 04:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
charged and not found
 
04:53:52.390 --> 04:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
guilty is that what you're saying yes
 
04:53:54.390 --> 04:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
because I believe and I I leave this to
 
04:53:56.628 --> 04:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
Diana but I believe if you've been
 
04:53:59.470 --> 04:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
charged with capital murder and haven't
 
04:54:01.430 --> 04:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
been convicted yet you still can't be
 
04:54:03.110 --> 04:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
credential I'm not murdering anybody
 
04:54:04.030 --> 04:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
it's fair
 
04:54:05.910 --> 04:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
okay I'm just using one of the one the
 
04:54:07.750 --> 04:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
top one well that one's a little bit
 
04:54:10.390 --> 04:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
bigger um I I understand that okay I
 
04:54:12.990 --> 04:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
just I just indecent and and indecent
 
04:54:16.270 --> 04:54:16.280 align:start position:0%
and L exposure and less is a misdemeanor
 
04:54:19.590 --> 04:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
MH if you have been
 
04:54:22.070 --> 04:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
charged you can't have your credential
 
04:54:25.110 --> 04:54:25.120 align:start position:0%

that's fine but do you happen to have
 
04:55:08.470 --> 04:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
any statistics for what percentage of um
 
04:55:11.910 --> 04:55:11.920 align:start position:0%

investigation there's two two ways they
 
04:55:37.430 --> 04:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
can be moved in or moved out so 40% are
 
04:55:39.548 --> 04:55:39.558 align:start position:0%
not moved on for for further
 
04:55:42.868 --> 04:55:42.878 align:start position:0%

of all uh I have a couple of questions
 
04:56:41.990 --> 04:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
first question is out of the
 
04:56:46.390 --> 04:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
21 criminal charges that are listed as
 
04:56:49.310 --> 04:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
disqualifying is just abuse and neglect
 
04:56:54.270 --> 04:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:56.910 --> 04:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
them no I do not believe that it is it
 
04:57:00.430 --> 04:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
isn't okay and in your estimation how
 
04:57:01.910 --> 04:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
many teachers in the state of New
 
04:57:04.150 --> 04:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire since you've been on the job
 
04:57:06.470 --> 04:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
have been convicted of
 
04:57:08.788 --> 04:57:08.798 align:start position:0%
failure to
 
04:57:12.110 --> 04:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
report I I do know of one
 
04:57:14.390 --> 04:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
instance uh that an educator was
 
04:57:17.390 --> 04:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
convicted of
 
04:57:21.590 --> 04:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh RSA 169 c29 failure to report I know
 
04:57:29.708 --> 04:57:29.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:33.430 --> 04:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
you yes uh represent Paul thank you Mr
 
04:57:34.430 --> 04:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:57:37.628 --> 04:57:37.638 align:start position:0%
question uh what if the kid comes in
 
04:57:39.948 --> 04:57:39.958 align:start position:0%
with a broken arm couple weeks later
 
04:57:42.788 --> 04:57:42.798 align:start position:0%
broken leg and what if I really don't
 
04:57:44.510 --> 04:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
suspect anything I should suspect
 
04:57:45.590 --> 04:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
something but I
 
04:57:48.030 --> 04:57:48.040 align:start position:0%
don't is there anything that's going to
 
04:57:50.990 --> 04:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
come back on me I mean how can you prove
 
04:57:52.708 --> 04:57:52.718 align:start position:0%
how can you prove if somebody knew if
 
04:57:56.788 --> 04:57:56.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:59.948 --> 04:57:59.958 align:start position:0%
proven well thank you for the question I
 
04:58:02.150 --> 04:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
think it's a very nuanced complicated
 
04:58:06.750 --> 04:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
question I will refer back to the the
 
04:58:09.070 --> 04:58:09.080 align:start position:0%
case that I'm familiar with that I
 
04:58:10.948 --> 04:58:10.958 align:start position:0%
referenced in my previous testimony to
 
04:58:15.070 --> 04:58:15.080 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner in that instance
 
04:58:17.868 --> 04:58:17.878 align:start position:0%
and it's just one example in that
 
04:58:20.110 --> 04:58:20.120 align:start position:0%
instance the criminal conviction came
 
04:58:23.510 --> 04:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
around came about because and and I
 
04:58:25.470 --> 04:58:25.480 align:start position:0%
don't remember all the facts off the top
 
04:58:28.350 --> 04:58:28.360 align:start position:0%
of my head it's been number of years now
 
04:58:31.230 --> 04:58:31.240 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is the educator was
 
04:58:35.548 --> 04:58:35.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:38.708 --> 04:58:38.718 align:start position:0%
that the adult in his life stepfather or
 
04:58:41.548 --> 04:58:41.558 align:start position:0%
uncle whatever the case may be was
 
04:58:45.070 --> 04:58:45.080 align:start position:0%
forcing him to perform sexual acts and
 
04:58:48.868 --> 04:58:48.878 align:start position:0%
the teacher did not report that and that
 
04:58:50.990 --> 04:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
is why the the criminal case was then
 
04:58:55.430 --> 04:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
brought forward um and was successful I
 
04:58:58.910 --> 04:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
I do think in very general terms it's
 
04:59:01.868 --> 04:59:01.878 align:start position:0%
difficult to say well you should have
 
04:59:04.030 --> 04:59:04.040 align:start position:0%
known right when you're just being
 
04:59:06.190 --> 04:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
presented with a broken arm or a broken
 
04:59:10.590 --> 04:59:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:14.750 --> 04:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
um this law is really a policy choice
 
04:59:15.990 --> 04:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
for this
 
04:59:20.270 --> 04:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
committee what this Bill is saying is if
 
04:59:20.280 --> 04:59:21.030 align:start position:0%
committee what this Bill is saying is if
the

04:59:21.030 --> 04:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:59:24.350 --> 04:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
department and if the department has a
 
04:59:26.868 --> 04:59:26.878 align:start position:0%
candidate come before it asking to be
 
04:59:28.470 --> 04:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
licensed as an
 
04:59:32.190 --> 04:59:32.200 align:start position:0%
educator and that individual has a uh
 
04:59:34.510 --> 04:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
criminal record that that says this
 
04:59:39.310 --> 04:59:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:41.628 --> 04:59:41.638 align:start position:0%
neglect the policy choice for this
 
04:59:43.070 --> 04:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
committee is simply should the
 
04:59:45.510 --> 04:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
department issue that license or not
 
04:59:47.788 --> 04:59:47.798 align:start position:0%
because the department does not have the
 
04:59:50.150 --> 04:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
discretion individual school districts
 
04:59:51.830 --> 04:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
have the discretion individual school
 
04:59:53.390 --> 04:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
districts can look at that record and
 
04:59:55.670 --> 04:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
say we're not comfortable hiring this
 
04:59:57.628 --> 04:59:57.638 align:start position:0%
individual who failed who was convicted
 
04:59:59.830 --> 04:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
of failure to report abuse and neglect
 
05:00:01.590 --> 05:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
to be in our school district the
 
05:00:04.628 --> 05:00:04.638 align:start position:0%
department by Design by this legislative
 
05:00:08.110 --> 05:00:08.120 align:start position:0%
body does not have that discretion the
 
05:00:09.750 --> 05:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
department when someone comes to be
 
05:00:12.510 --> 05:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
licensed to to be an
 
05:00:14.750 --> 05:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
educator we pull the
 
05:00:17.110 --> 05:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
record sent to us from the Department of
 
05:00:19.430 --> 05:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
Safety we review it and we look at the
 
05:00:21.788 --> 05:00:21.798 align:start position:0%
disqualifying offenses and it is only
 
05:00:23.708 --> 05:00:23.718 align:start position:0%
those disqualifying
 
05:00:27.310 --> 05:00:27.320 align:start position:0%
offenses so if someone has DWI we will
 
05:00:29.510 --> 05:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
still license that individual to teach
 
05:00:31.750 --> 05:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
if that person has a theft case we will
 
05:00:34.270 --> 05:00:34.280 align:start position:0%
license that individual to to teach it's
 
05:00:36.430 --> 05:00:36.440 align:start position:0%
the disqualifiers that guide us so again
 
05:00:38.750 --> 05:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
the policy issue for this committee is
 
05:00:38.760 --> 05:00:40.190 align:start position:0%
the policy issue for this committee is
to

05:00:40.190 --> 05:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:00:44.030 --> 05:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
say if someone from the state of Maine
 
05:00:45.628 --> 05:00:45.638 align:start position:0%
or a new teaching applicant comes
 
05:00:48.470 --> 05:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
forward to be licensed because we do not
 
05:00:51.350 --> 05:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
continue to check the record um on a
 
05:00:54.708 --> 05:00:54.718 align:start position:0%
reoccurring basis it's a one-time check
 
05:00:57.750 --> 05:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
so if I move here and I apply for a New
 
05:01:00.788 --> 05:01:00.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire teaching credential and I have
 
05:01:03.868 --> 05:01:03.878 align:start position:0%
failure to report abuse and neglect
 
05:01:06.070 --> 05:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
and the department licensed that person
 
05:01:06.080 --> 05:01:07.350 align:start position:0%
and the department licensed that person
to

05:01:07.350 --> 05:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:01:09.990 --> 05:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
teach is that offensive to this
 
05:01:11.868 --> 05:01:11.878 align:start position:0%
legislative body and that is truly a
 
05:01:14.190 --> 05:01:14.200 align:start position:0%
question that's the policy question
 
05:01:16.510 --> 05:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
contained within this bill and the
 
05:01:19.510 --> 05:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
department is just seeking that guidance
 
05:01:20.750 --> 05:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
because right
 
05:01:27.030 --> 05:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:30.830 --> 05:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
licensed further questions represent
 
05:01:33.510 --> 05:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
Miley thank you Mr chair let me see if I
 
05:01:36.070 --> 05:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
can get this clarified first of all I
 
05:01:37.628 --> 05:01:37.638 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody in this committee
 
05:01:40.628 --> 05:01:40.638 align:start position:0%
would want somebody who hasn't
 
05:01:44.070 --> 05:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
appropriately reported and abuse Etc
 
05:01:46.990 --> 05:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
understood but the the issue for me then
 
05:01:50.670 --> 05:01:50.680 align:start position:0%
is that uh just a procedural question if
 
05:01:54.470 --> 05:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
as a teacher I think there's some abuse
 
05:01:56.548 --> 05:01:56.558 align:start position:0%
I then report that to the principal
 
05:01:58.310 --> 05:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
correct that's that's that's the line
 
05:02:00.910 --> 05:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
chain of command that I go to
 
05:02:03.350 --> 05:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
first I would assume so that's going to
 
05:02:06.150 --> 05:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
be a district policy okay so now now
 
05:02:09.590 --> 05:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
this is this is the where I'm a little
 
05:02:12.830 --> 05:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
unsure um teachers are under a heck of a
 
05:02:14.390 --> 05:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
lot of pressure right
 
05:02:17.230 --> 05:02:17.240 align:start position:0%
now I agree and and you've got the whole
 
05:02:19.270 --> 05:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
issue of parental rights
 
05:02:22.310 --> 05:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
Etc and so there my concern is is that
 
05:02:25.270 --> 05:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
with with the en with the with the
 
05:02:28.030 --> 05:02:28.040 align:start position:0%
environment that we're under right
 
05:02:31.310 --> 05:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
now a lot of teachers are afraid
 
05:02:35.030 --> 05:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
frankly and so if I see a child who
 
05:02:36.948 --> 05:02:36.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't come to me in your in your
 
05:02:40.590 --> 05:02:40.600 align:start position:0%
example clearly that was that was a true
 
05:02:42.990 --> 05:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely but if I see some a child
 
05:02:45.110 --> 05:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
that comes in with a broken
 
05:02:48.110 --> 05:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
arm and I'm not quite
 
05:02:50.830 --> 05:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
sure whether that was because of a
 
05:02:54.110 --> 05:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
physical abuse on the part of the
 
05:02:56.750 --> 05:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
parent and I don't report
 
05:03:00.270 --> 05:03:00.280 align:start position:0%
that I think I probably should but I
 
05:03:03.030 --> 05:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
know the parents and I'm afraid what
 
05:03:04.948 --> 05:03:04.958 align:start position:0%
they might do to me if I make that
 
05:03:07.430 --> 05:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
report where does that fit into the
 
05:03:09.510 --> 05:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
issue of the quote
 
05:03:19.110 --> 05:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:21.708 --> 05:03:21.718 align:start position:0%
report I appreciate the
 
05:03:24.430 --> 05:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
question um I'm not
 
05:03:28.110 --> 05:03:28.120 align:start position:0%
sure best how to answer it because I
 
05:03:30.868 --> 05:03:30.878 align:start position:0%
think from the Department's
 
05:03:32.868 --> 05:03:32.878 align:start position:0%
perspective the department does doesn't
 
05:03:35.510 --> 05:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
play a role in determining whether or
 
05:03:38.230 --> 05:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
not that should be charged or or not
 
05:03:40.670 --> 05:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
that would be a different a different
 
05:03:43.830 --> 05:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
segment that would be the the
 
05:03:47.350 --> 05:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
prosecution role a criminal role right
 
05:03:50.830 --> 05:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
Police Department role um the department
 
05:03:54.190 --> 05:03:54.200 align:start position:0%
is just left with reviewing the record
 
05:03:56.830 --> 05:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
when that person applies to be a teacher
 
05:04:00.628 --> 05:04:00.638 align:start position:0%
and then again is is governed by those
 
05:04:04.830 --> 05:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:08.150 --> 05:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
and the question becomes I mean again
 
05:04:11.030 --> 05:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
right now this is not an offense that
 
05:04:14.070 --> 05:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
would prohibit the licensing of that
 
05:04:17.230 --> 05:04:17.240 align:start position:0%
individual and so it really just becomes
 
05:04:18.910 --> 05:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
a question of what the department does
 
05:04:21.230 --> 05:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
with that yeah and I I clearly I can
 
05:04:22.750 --> 05:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate the Department's position but
 
05:04:24.990 --> 05:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
you can understand my concern in the
 
05:04:28.190 --> 05:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
instance that I have sure um and and so
 
05:04:31.110 --> 05:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
it's there is a lot of to my to my mind
 
05:04:33.230 --> 05:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
clearly they ought to be reported
 
05:04:35.750 --> 05:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
but you get into that question it's a
 
05:04:38.390 --> 05:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
qualification question and I I would
 
05:04:40.430 --> 05:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
assume that there's some ought to be
 
05:04:43.548 --> 05:04:43.558 align:start position:0%
some concern about this fear of
 
05:04:45.788 --> 05:04:45.798 align:start position:0%
reporting what that might mean to my
 
05:04:49.350 --> 05:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
career to the child to whatever so
 
05:04:51.948 --> 05:04:51.958 align:start position:0%
that's just that that's going around in
 
05:04:54.110 --> 05:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
my mind as far as being a real real
 
05:04:56.150 --> 05:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
quandry at this point in time thank you
 
05:04:58.350 --> 05:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
and I agree with everything you you
 
05:05:00.590 --> 05:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
stated I agree with everything you
 
05:05:03.350 --> 05:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
stated the Department's position
 
05:05:06.430 --> 05:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
is kind of the Department's the the last
 
05:05:09.750 --> 05:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
you the Caboose on the train if you will
 
05:05:12.868 --> 05:05:12.878 align:start position:0%
those policy decisions are made by other
 
05:05:14.788 --> 05:05:14.798 align:start position:0%
agencies and entities and so the
 
05:05:16.948 --> 05:05:16.958 align:start position:0%
department is really left with and and I
 
05:05:18.788 --> 05:05:18.798 align:start position:0%
will refer back to your first comment
 
05:05:21.708 --> 05:05:21.718 align:start position:0%
that we can all agree that it's a child
 
05:05:23.548 --> 05:05:23.558 align:start position:0%
safety issue and we all want children to
 
05:05:26.390 --> 05:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
be safe that's that's not the issue but
 
05:05:28.910 --> 05:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
the department is in the
 
05:05:31.948 --> 05:05:31.958 align:start position:0%
position that if an individual were to
 
05:05:34.390 --> 05:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
come forward forward asking for to be
 
05:05:37.190 --> 05:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
licensed and this offense is on the
 
05:05:40.230 --> 05:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
record right now that individual would
 
05:05:42.230 --> 05:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
would be licensed and that is the
 
05:05:44.708 --> 05:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
quandry that the department finds itself
 
05:05:47.788 --> 05:05:47.798 align:start position:0%
in and this legislative body would give
 
05:05:51.190 --> 05:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
that guidance um and so unfortunately
 
05:05:53.110 --> 05:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
the department For Better or For Worse
 
05:05:55.510 --> 05:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't play a role in determining
 
05:05:57.788 --> 05:05:57.798 align:start position:0%
whether charges should be brought if the
 
05:05:59.110 --> 05:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
evidence is
 
05:06:01.390 --> 05:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
sufficient we're not part of that
 
05:06:04.830 --> 05:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
analysis thank
 
05:06:08.910 --> 05:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
you represent T thank you is this a
 
05:06:08.920 --> 05:06:10.110 align:start position:0%
you represent T thank you is this a
department

05:06:10.110 --> 05:06:10.120 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:06:12.628 --> 05:06:12.638 align:start position:0%
request this is a bill that I have
 
05:06:14.510 --> 05:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
discussed I believe I discussed with
 
05:06:17.030 --> 05:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative Damon at one point um and
 
05:06:21.430 --> 05:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
also representative perz it was I I
 
05:06:23.070 --> 05:06:23.080 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's a department request
 
05:06:24.670 --> 05:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
but I have spoken with both of those
 
05:06:27.270 --> 05:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
individuals about this Bill yes follow
 
05:06:30.910 --> 05:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
up on that yes so are we just going to
 
05:06:34.708 --> 05:06:34.718 align:start position:0%
go through and add to this 21 um number
 
05:06:36.910 --> 05:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
list of disqualifying ones because it
 
05:06:39.390 --> 05:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
seems to me if we've had one incidence
 
05:06:41.470 --> 05:06:41.480 align:start position:0%
of this and and how many years have you
 
05:06:42.628 --> 05:06:42.638 align:start position:0%
been with the
 
05:06:45.350 --> 05:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
Department approximately uh a little
 
05:06:47.788 --> 05:06:47.798 align:start position:0%
over eight years I believe yeah okay and
 
05:06:49.910 --> 05:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
100 I don't know how many schools and
 
05:06:54.190 --> 05:06:54.200 align:start position:0%
how many kids that does it rise to the
 
05:06:56.910 --> 05:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
level of total disqualification that you
 
05:06:58.750 --> 05:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
can't get you your professional
 
05:07:01.030 --> 05:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
certificate or can't get a credential I
 
05:07:03.470 --> 05:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
mean does it that's that's the issue
 
05:07:06.590 --> 05:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
it's not abuse and neglect if you get
 
05:07:08.070 --> 05:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
charged with abuse and neglect you're
 
05:07:11.030 --> 05:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
not on that top of the list but if um
 
05:07:13.590 --> 05:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
and and you know there there are some
 
05:07:15.230 --> 05:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
other ones that we could be a lot more
 
05:07:18.590 --> 05:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
picky but when we got those 21 you know
 
05:07:21.628 --> 05:07:21.638 align:start position:0%
we really went for something that was
 
05:07:21.638 --> 05:07:23.270 align:start position:0%
we really went for something that was
was

05:07:23.270 --> 05:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:07:27.470 --> 05:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
happening a lot not just once in8 years
 
05:07:30.510 --> 05:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
or maybe whatever so I I just I don't
 
05:07:32.030 --> 05:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
know where this is coming from I feel
 
05:07:34.030 --> 05:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
like it's a gotcha for for people going
 
05:07:36.230 --> 05:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
into the teaching field and I think Bill
 
05:07:40.430 --> 05:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:43.110 --> 05:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
too yes represent Hall thank you Mr
 
05:07:44.670 --> 05:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
05:07:46.430 --> 05:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering on line
 
05:07:50.150 --> 05:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
22 um when it does say any person who
 
05:07:51.270 --> 05:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
has been
 
05:07:53.590 --> 05:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
charged not convicted I guess I'm
 
05:07:56.110 --> 05:07:56.120 align:start position:0%
thinking myself innocent until proven
 
05:07:57.708 --> 05:07:57.718 align:start position:0%
guilty so you're not going to credential
 
05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
me someone has charged me yet I can't
 
05:08:03.230 --> 05:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
get credentialed is is that the intent
 
05:08:06.430 --> 05:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
here so the thank you for pointing out
 
05:08:08.910 --> 05:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
that language so so that language any
 
05:08:11.510 --> 05:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
person who has been charged pending
 
05:08:14.190 --> 05:08:14.200 align:start position:0%
disposition that phrase is already
 
05:08:16.910 --> 05:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
currently in the law that phrase has
 
05:08:19.750 --> 05:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
consistently been in the law and that
 
05:08:22.430 --> 05:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
phrase is I think a simplistic way of
 
05:08:25.230 --> 05:08:25.240 align:start position:0%
saying charged which means there was
 
05:08:28.628 --> 05:08:28.638 align:start position:0%
probable cause and is awaiting
 
05:08:34.270 --> 05:08:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:36.830 --> 05:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
um you're right that presumption of
 
05:08:39.030 --> 05:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
innocence is applicable in the the
 
05:08:41.830 --> 05:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
criminal context for administrative
 
05:08:41.840 --> 05:08:43.510 align:start position:0%
criminal context for administrative
credentialing

05:08:43.510 --> 05:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
credentialing
 
05:08:46.590 --> 05:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
purposes that has always been in uh
 
05:08:49.270 --> 05:08:49.280 align:start position:0%
18913a and then in the subsequent
 
05:08:55.548 --> 05:08:55.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:59.310 --> 05:08:59.320 align:start position:0%
about Diana the there's some
 
05:09:02.548 --> 05:09:02.558 align:start position:0%
subjectivity to this whole federal law
 
05:09:05.150 --> 05:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
when they enter in the word
 
05:09:08.190 --> 05:09:08.200 align:start position:0%
suspect a child falls down the stairs
 
05:09:12.270 --> 05:09:12.280 align:start position:0%
and breaks a leg or gets all bruised up
 
05:09:14.590 --> 05:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't the result of a parent and
 
05:09:17.310 --> 05:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
the teacher in the classroom absolutely
 
05:09:19.110 --> 05:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
knows this
 
05:09:21.990 --> 05:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
family I don't suspect anything there I
 
05:09:25.470 --> 05:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
know them and so but what happens later
 
05:09:28.030 --> 05:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
that you know the child is found to be
 
05:09:31.708 --> 05:09:31.718 align:start position:0%
you know um you know a result of abuse
 
05:09:34.910 --> 05:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
and neglect but how where's the teacher
 
05:09:37.350 --> 05:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
stand on that who you know because it's
 
05:09:39.548 --> 05:09:39.558 align:start position:0%
suspect and that teacher had every right
 
05:09:42.190 --> 05:09:42.200 align:start position:0%
to say what that teacher was you know
 
05:09:44.230 --> 05:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
thinking and
 
05:09:46.430 --> 05:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
believing I wouldn't say they would be
 
05:09:49.270 --> 05:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
guilty but you know you're the
 
05:09:51.190 --> 05:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
prosecutor where are you coming from
 
05:09:53.628 --> 05:09:53.638 align:start position:0%
this angle well and thank you for the
 
05:09:57.868 --> 05:09:57.878 align:start position:0%
question to to be very clear um I was a
 
05:10:00.548 --> 05:10:00.558 align:start position:0%
criminal prosecutor years ago and so I
 
05:10:02.310 --> 05:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
have that work experience but that's not
 
05:10:05.030 --> 05:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
my current current job and and uh you
 
05:10:06.628 --> 05:10:06.638 align:start position:0%
for one are always giving me new job
 
05:10:09.548 --> 05:10:09.558 align:start position:0%
titles so you keep me on my toes um but
 
05:10:11.190 --> 05:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
I think your question really hearkens
 
05:10:13.628 --> 05:10:13.638 align:start position:0%
back to representative Myer's
 
05:10:16.910 --> 05:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
question which is there's a lot of
 
05:10:19.430 --> 05:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
various circumstances and and nuances in
 
05:10:22.070 --> 05:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
this area and to be very Frank it can be
 
05:10:25.590 --> 05:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
a scary area yeah it is um and as I
 
05:10:29.030 --> 05:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned in my answer to representative
 
05:10:31.590 --> 05:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
Miler the department is not in a
 
05:10:31.600 --> 05:10:33.150 align:start position:0%
Miler the department is not in a
position

05:10:33.150 --> 05:10:33.160 align:start position:0%
position
 
05:10:36.030 --> 05:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
we are not an active participant in
 
05:10:37.948 --> 05:10:37.958 align:start position:0%
those charging decisions we are not an
 
05:10:41.110 --> 05:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
active participant in the criminal piece
 
05:10:43.310 --> 05:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
of it I just happen to have that
 
05:10:45.390 --> 05:10:45.400 align:start position:0%
background just as each and every one of
 
05:10:47.070 --> 05:10:47.080 align:start position:0%
us has our own respective backgrounds
 
05:10:50.150 --> 05:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
that we bring with us um the
 
05:10:52.990 --> 05:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
Department's position is narrowly
 
05:10:56.030 --> 05:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
tailored and the Department's position
 
05:10:58.350 --> 05:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
is simply reviewing an individual
 
05:11:02.030 --> 05:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
applicant's criminal history upon lure
 
05:11:03.910 --> 05:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
and that is an act that was passed by
 
05:11:05.708 --> 05:11:05.718 align:start position:0%
this legislative body to give the
 
05:11:07.948 --> 05:11:07.958 align:start position:0%
department that
 
05:11:10.628 --> 05:11:10.638 align:start position:0%
role to review the disqualifying
 
05:11:12.470 --> 05:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
offenses the department again does not
 
05:11:14.510 --> 05:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
have any
 
05:11:17.350 --> 05:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
discretion no discretion whatsoever the
 
05:11:19.910 --> 05:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
department is limited to these offenses
 
05:11:23.948 --> 05:11:23.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:26.910 --> 05:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
statute and if an individual were to
 
05:11:28.830 --> 05:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
have this particular offense a failure
 
05:11:31.990 --> 05:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
to report abuse or neglect the question
 
05:11:34.990 --> 05:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
you again right now the department would
 
05:11:37.350 --> 05:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
license that individual and that
 
05:11:40.750 --> 05:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
individual would be available to to work
 
05:11:43.270 --> 05:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
in an educational setting school
 
05:11:46.548 --> 05:11:46.558 align:start position:0%
districts have discretion and school
 
05:11:49.230 --> 05:11:49.240 align:start position:0%
districts could exclude that individual
 
05:11:51.628 --> 05:11:51.638 align:start position:0%
based on that
 
05:11:54.390 --> 05:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
offense that's the role the very limited
 
05:11:57.070 --> 05:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
role the department would play thank you
 
05:11:59.990 --> 05:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
just again just to kind of summon my own
 
05:12:02.788 --> 05:12:02.798 align:start position:0%
mind sure with you
 
05:12:05.190 --> 05:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
you're not involved in the issue of
 
05:12:08.430 --> 05:12:08.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not there was a failure to
 
05:12:11.230 --> 05:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
report you B that's done in another
 
05:12:13.150 --> 05:12:13.160 align:start position:0%
venue that's done in another Court
 
05:12:16.470 --> 05:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
that's done in another process yes yes
 
05:12:18.470 --> 05:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
or no whether or not that individual did
 
05:12:22.628 --> 05:12:22.638 align:start position:0%
it if in fact they neglected to do that
 
05:12:26.830 --> 05:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
reporting that's a decision over here
 
05:12:30.990 --> 05:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
when you go to do your check if this
 
05:12:32.510 --> 05:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
happens over here here you have nothing
 
05:12:34.430 --> 05:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
to do with they we here all you're doing
 
05:12:37.510 --> 05:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
is reviewing did this happen that's the
 
05:12:40.190 --> 05:12:40.200 align:start position:0%
Department's role right what this what
 
05:12:42.628 --> 05:12:42.638 align:start position:0%
this bill is basically saying that if in
 
05:12:44.510 --> 05:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
some other
 
05:12:46.910 --> 05:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional issue found that somebody
 
05:12:49.548 --> 05:12:49.558 align:start position:0%
failed to reported all you're doing is
 
05:12:52.830 --> 05:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
saying okay it happened over here we
 
05:12:55.910 --> 05:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
can't provide that then that is correct
 
05:12:57.110 --> 05:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
pardon me you're not getting your
 
05:12:58.190 --> 05:12:58.200 align:start position:0%
credential you're not you're not going
 
05:12:59.708 --> 05:12:59.718 align:start position:0%
to get your credential because something
 
05:13:02.788 --> 05:13:02.798 align:start position:0%
happened over here that the department
 
05:13:04.750 --> 05:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't involved in all you're doing is
 
05:13:07.510 --> 05:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
receiving the report of that action of
 
05:13:11.628 --> 05:13:11.638 align:start position:0%
another venue you are correct thank
 
05:13:14.110 --> 05:13:14.120 align:start position:0%
you represent whitcock thank you
 
05:13:16.628 --> 05:13:16.638 align:start position:0%
chairman you're welcome I just to follow
 
05:13:20.350 --> 05:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
up if if um this
 
05:13:25.788 --> 05:13:25.798 align:start position:0%
passes and a current employee is found
 
05:13:28.628 --> 05:13:28.638 align:start position:0%
failing to report do they lose their
 
05:13:31.310 --> 05:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
certification or are they released from
 
05:13:33.190 --> 05:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
the school district
 
05:13:36.110 --> 05:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
District the license your rather if a
 
05:13:39.070 --> 05:13:39.080 align:start position:0%
current employee were to be charged with
 
05:13:41.590 --> 05:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
this offense of failure to report it's a
 
05:13:44.190 --> 05:13:44.200 align:start position:0%
law right yes uh yes that would be
 
05:13:46.270 --> 05:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
reported to the department and if it's
 
05:13:47.910 --> 05:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
one of the disqualifiers the department
 
05:13:50.868 --> 05:13:50.878 align:start position:0%
could could take action on that yes yes
 
05:13:53.470 --> 05:13:53.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there any more
 
05:13:54.990 --> 05:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
question yes representative
 
05:13:57.948 --> 05:13:57.958 align:start position:0%
cordelli um am I correct with any of the
 
05:14:01.030 --> 05:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
items listed in section five the
 
05:14:04.110 --> 05:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
Department's is just to look and see if
 
05:14:07.628 --> 05:14:07.638 align:start position:0%
this group over here charged someone and
 
05:14:10.350 --> 05:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
is either convicted or a pending trial
 
05:14:12.990 --> 05:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
you have you know there's a wall here
 
05:14:14.430 --> 05:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
and you're on this side of the wall is
 
05:14:14.440 --> 05:14:16.590 align:start position:0%
and you're on this side of the wall is
that

05:14:16.590 --> 05:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:14:19.430 --> 05:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
correct yes I think so um I'm not sure
 
05:14:20.470 --> 05:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
which side of the wall you were
 
05:14:23.350 --> 05:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
referring to there but right but the way
 
05:14:25.190 --> 05:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
I explain it is the department simply
 
05:14:27.150 --> 05:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't have discretion
 
05:14:29.548 --> 05:14:29.558 align:start position:0%
so there was an individual who came
 
05:14:31.948 --> 05:14:31.958 align:start position:0%
forward to apply for a license and they
 
05:14:34.190 --> 05:14:34.200 align:start position:0%
had been charged not convicted but
 
05:14:36.548 --> 05:14:36.558 align:start position:0%
charged with first-degree murder the
 
05:14:38.470 --> 05:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
department didn't have any discretion
 
05:14:40.310 --> 05:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
did not license that individual that's
 
05:14:42.750 --> 05:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
one of the disqualifying
 
05:14:44.628 --> 05:14:44.638 align:start position:0%
offenses again there are a lot of
 
05:14:47.990 --> 05:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
offenses that are not on this list that
 
05:14:51.270 --> 05:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
the department will license does license
 
05:14:53.030 --> 05:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
and it is the school district that has
 
05:14:56.708 --> 05:14:56.718 align:start position:0%
more discretion so if this if it is on
 
05:14:56.718 --> 05:14:57.750 align:start position:0%
more discretion so if this if it is on
this

05:14:57.750 --> 05:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:15:00.788 --> 05:15:00.798 align:start position:0%
list and it appears on a record the
 
05:15:05.788 --> 05:15:05.798 align:start position:0%
department can not license that
 
05:15:08.830 --> 05:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
individual are there further questions
 
05:15:08.840 --> 05:15:12.430 align:start position:0%
individual are there further questions
representa

05:15:12.430 --> 05:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:16.070 --> 05:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you um
 
05:15:19.708 --> 05:15:19.718 align:start position:0%
so if the individual charged with one of
 
05:15:22.590 --> 05:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
the current offenses or this if it
 
05:15:25.628 --> 05:15:25.638 align:start position:0%
passes into law were charged and
 
05:15:28.190 --> 05:15:28.200 align:start position:0%
therefore did not get their credential
 
05:15:30.548 --> 05:15:30.558 align:start position:0%
and then were found
 
05:15:33.670 --> 05:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
innocent they would then be able to
 
05:15:39.350 --> 05:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:42.150 --> 05:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
no I I believe that is correct I'd like
 
05:15:44.750 --> 05:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
to break that down a little bit so if I
 
05:15:47.548 --> 05:15:47.558 align:start position:0%
apply for a license and I have been
 
05:15:50.150 --> 05:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
charged with this offense currently I
 
05:15:52.510 --> 05:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
would be
 
05:15:56.150 --> 05:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
denied if I was then found not guilty
 
05:15:58.030 --> 05:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
and I apply
 
05:16:01.150 --> 05:16:01.160 align:start position:0%
again my understanding of the the law is
 
05:16:03.590 --> 05:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
currently written in this bill then yes
 
05:16:05.030 --> 05:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
I would be
 
05:16:07.990 --> 05:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
licensed oh
 
05:16:11.470 --> 05:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
yes so if someone is found innocent is
 
05:16:13.750 --> 05:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that they were
 
05:16:18.150 --> 05:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
charged retained on their record At Doe
 
05:16:21.350 --> 05:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
or somewhere else or is it purged
 
05:16:23.628 --> 05:16:23.638 align:start position:0%
because they've been found
 
05:16:23.638 --> 05:16:26.430 align:start position:0%
because they've been found
innocent

05:16:26.430 --> 05:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
innocent
 
05:16:28.990 --> 05:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
so that's a really good Department of
 
05:16:30.628 --> 05:16:30.638 align:start position:0%
Safety question I want I want to be
 
05:16:33.830 --> 05:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
clear the department pursuant to the law
 
05:16:35.830 --> 05:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm just trying to put my hands on
 
05:16:38.390 --> 05:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
it really quickly the department has an
 
05:16:40.510 --> 05:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
obligation to destroy the criminal
 
05:16:43.270 --> 05:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
history record after a certain amount of
 
05:16:46.708 --> 05:16:46.718 align:start position:0%
time so the department does not keep and
 
05:16:49.590 --> 05:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
compile these records these records are
 
05:16:52.990 --> 05:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
housed with the Department of Safety
 
05:16:56.430 --> 05:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
they are not housed at the Department of
 
05:16:59.310 --> 05:16:59.320 align:start position:0%
Education and the department doesn't
 
05:17:02.190 --> 05:17:02.200 align:start position:0%
keep them we don't keep records of them
 
05:17:04.350 --> 05:17:04.360 align:start position:0%
we just make that decision based upon
 
05:17:06.030 --> 05:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
that list of disqualifying offenses that
 
05:17:07.230 --> 05:17:07.240 align:start position:0%
we've talked
 
05:17:10.110 --> 05:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
about in terms of what is retained on
 
05:17:10.120 --> 05:17:10.948 align:start position:0%
about in terms of what is retained on
the

05:17:10.948 --> 05:17:10.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:17:15.030 --> 05:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
record I will refer to my my counterpart
 
05:17:22.548 --> 05:17:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:26.030 --> 05:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
Safety welcome back thank
 
05:17:29.948 --> 05:17:29.958 align:start position:0%
you so when we get the Court's
 
05:17:31.868 --> 05:17:31.878 align:start position:0%
dispositions over which is is whatever
 
05:17:34.670 --> 05:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
the finding is from the court it could
 
05:17:38.430 --> 05:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
be n pross non-conviction
 
05:17:41.270 --> 05:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
all various um
 
05:17:44.670 --> 05:17:44.680 align:start position:0%
dispositions that will be on the record
 
05:17:48.830 --> 05:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
but when education is entitled to a full
 
05:17:52.190 --> 05:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
record which means they see convictions
 
05:17:55.868 --> 05:17:55.878 align:start position:0%
and non-conviction as well so it would
 
05:17:57.750 --> 05:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
still be there but it would show that
 
05:18:02.788 --> 05:18:02.798 align:start position:0%
they were not convicted of that charge
 
05:18:05.670 --> 05:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
oh yes go
 
05:18:08.110 --> 05:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
ahead please tell me if I'm
 
05:18:13.390 --> 05:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:16.948 --> 05:18:16.958 align:start position:0%
understanding so if a person were
 
05:18:20.750 --> 05:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:23.230 --> 05:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
report and then the court proceeding
 
05:18:26.628 --> 05:18:26.638 align:start position:0%
found that that was not
 
05:18:29.470 --> 05:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
valid that record that they were charged
 
05:18:32.270 --> 05:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
would be retained at Department of
 
05:18:35.310 --> 05:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
Safety and if they then made a
 
05:18:37.910 --> 05:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
subsequent application for their
 
05:18:37.920 --> 05:18:39.070 align:start position:0%
subsequent application for their
teaching

05:18:39.070 --> 05:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
teaching
 
05:18:42.310 --> 05:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
license the fact that they had been
 
05:18:45.030 --> 05:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
charged would be reported to the
 
05:18:46.990 --> 05:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
department it would but it would also
 
05:18:50.948 --> 05:18:50.958 align:start position:0%
show that it was a non-conviction
 
05:18:55.990 --> 05:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
on that so also something to keep in
 
05:18:58.708 --> 05:18:58.718 align:start position:0%
mind is people are entitled to anull
 
05:19:01.948 --> 05:19:01.958 align:start position:0%
their records so they can go to the
 
05:19:05.948 --> 05:19:05.958 align:start position:0%
courts and get any charges taken off
 
05:19:08.670 --> 05:19:08.680 align:start position:0%
from their record their various rules
 
05:19:11.190 --> 05:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
and parameters with that but that is
 
05:19:13.350 --> 05:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
something that they can do in which case
 
05:19:15.030 --> 05:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
that would not show
 
05:19:19.390 --> 05:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
up but generally speaking it would show
 
05:19:22.628 --> 05:19:22.638 align:start position:0%
up as a non-conviction
 
05:19:26.230 --> 05:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
however if they were going for let's say
 
05:19:29.750 --> 05:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
their nursing license nursing is not
 
05:19:32.190 --> 05:19:32.200 align:start position:0%
entitled to a full record record so they
 
05:19:35.230 --> 05:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
see convictions only in which in that
 
05:19:38.910 --> 05:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:41.470 --> 05:19:41.480 align:start position:0%
up thank you for
 
05:19:47.390 --> 05:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:50.030 --> 05:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
purged I would have to research that
 
05:19:52.030 --> 05:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
further that has just been traditionally
 
05:19:55.750 --> 05:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
pay grade level yes what we have to do
 
05:19:57.548 --> 05:19:57.558 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:20:01.548 --> 05:20:01.558 align:start position:0%
is the process with dispositions from
 
05:20:04.830 --> 05:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
courts further questions from the
 
05:20:07.548 --> 05:20:07.558 align:start position:0%
committee I may add something to that
 
05:20:07.558 --> 05:20:09.430 align:start position:0%
committee I may add something to that
answer

05:20:09.430 --> 05:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
answer
 
05:20:14.708 --> 05:20:14.718 align:start position:0%
um this legislative body changed the
 
05:20:14.718 --> 05:20:16.948 align:start position:0%
um this legislative body changed the
law

05:20:16.948 --> 05:20:16.958 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:20:20.548 --> 05:20:20.558 align:start position:0%
probably this per for me more than five
 
05:20:23.470 --> 05:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
years ago to allow the release of the
 
05:20:23.480 --> 05:20:25.190 align:start position:0%
years ago to allow the release of the
entire

05:20:25.190 --> 05:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
entire
 
05:20:29.948 --> 05:20:29.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:32.310 --> 05:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
previously the the entire record was not
 
05:20:34.788 --> 05:20:34.798 align:start position:0%
released actually there's quite a bit of
 
05:20:37.948 --> 05:20:37.958 align:start position:0%
History to it so more than 10 years
 
05:20:42.750 --> 05:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
ago when a school district submit um
 
05:20:44.788 --> 05:20:44.798 align:start position:0%
wanted to hire someone they would submit
 
05:20:46.230 --> 05:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
the criminal records request to the
 
05:20:47.990 --> 05:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety it was the
 
05:20:50.150 --> 05:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
department of safety someone such as
 
05:20:52.670 --> 05:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
this person right here my good friend
 
05:20:54.350 --> 05:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
who would read through the applicant's
 
05:20:57.708 --> 05:20:57.718 align:start position:0%
record and they would read through the
 
05:20:59.310 --> 05:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
person's record and then they would
 
05:21:04.708 --> 05:21:04.718 align:start position:0%
write a letter to sa39 or sa9 and say
 
05:21:07.628 --> 05:21:07.638 align:start position:0%
dear superintendent this person does
 
05:21:09.830 --> 05:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
have a disqualifying offense and cannot
 
05:21:12.070 --> 05:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
be hired or this person does not have a
 
05:21:14.510 --> 05:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
disqualifying offense and they can be
 
05:21:16.910 --> 05:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
hired they would write a a letter and
 
05:21:18.590 --> 05:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
the superintendent would never see the
 
05:21:21.150 --> 05:21:21.160 align:start position:0%
individual applicants criminal
 
05:21:24.590 --> 05:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
record however what ended up happening
 
05:21:27.070 --> 05:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
was there was a gentleman in uh the
 
05:21:29.030 --> 05:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
western part of the state in Sullivan
 
05:21:31.548 --> 05:21:31.558 align:start position:0%
County who was charged with
 
05:21:35.030 --> 05:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
um Colonius aggravated sexual assault
 
05:21:37.030 --> 05:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
ifsa something of that
 
05:21:39.230 --> 05:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
nature and for whatever reason those
 
05:21:42.548 --> 05:21:42.558 align:start position:0%
charges were reduced down to misdemeanor
 
05:21:44.990 --> 05:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
offenses and that individual applied to
 
05:21:47.070 --> 05:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
a school district that individual's
 
05:21:49.230 --> 05:21:49.240 align:start position:0%
hired and that individual
 
05:21:52.030 --> 05:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
reoffended it was based on that instance
 
05:21:55.030 --> 05:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
that this legislative body then amended
 
05:21:59.070 --> 05:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
the law to allow the release of um
 
05:22:01.670 --> 05:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
felonies I think it was all
 
05:22:04.708 --> 05:22:04.718 align:start position:0%
felonies and then it became included
 
05:22:06.670 --> 05:22:06.680 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors and then it included the
 
05:22:09.788 --> 05:22:09.798 align:start position:0%
entire record I'm not sure if it was
 
05:22:12.590 --> 05:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
broken down in those exact Parts but it
 
05:22:14.830 --> 05:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
was legislative changes over time and if
 
05:22:16.830 --> 05:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
you look at the history of this
 
05:22:16.840 --> 05:22:19.190 align:start position:0%
you look at the history of this
law

05:22:19.190 --> 05:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:22:21.110 --> 05:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
18913a you will
 
05:22:24.150 --> 05:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
see that there's been an enormous number
 
05:22:28.150 --> 05:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
of amendments in the last in the last
 
05:22:30.948 --> 05:22:30.958 align:start position:0%
decade um because of some of those ISS
 
05:22:32.390 --> 05:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
issues that were brought forward to this
 
05:22:33.628 --> 05:22:33.638 align:start position:0%
legislative body and I know
 
05:22:35.430 --> 05:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner has done a lot of
 
05:22:37.670 --> 05:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
work on this particular area because it
 
05:22:40.030 --> 05:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
is a very complicated
 
05:22:43.548 --> 05:22:43.558 align:start position:0%
area yep it is any other further
 
05:22:45.948 --> 05:22:45.958 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
05:22:48.670 --> 05:22:48.680 align:start position:0%
both oh there is one representative Hall
 
05:22:50.470 --> 05:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
you did call on me earlier but then we
 
05:22:53.310 --> 05:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
got but thank you for thank you CH thank
 
05:22:55.030 --> 05:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so you I'm
 
05:22:57.830 --> 05:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
just going to circle back to um
 
05:22:59.270 --> 05:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock when he asked
 
05:23:01.430 --> 05:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
you about if you currently have
 
05:23:03.868 --> 05:23:03.878 align:start position:0%
certification and your answer I think it
 
05:23:07.390 --> 05:23:07.400 align:start position:0%
was that the doe could take
 
05:23:09.548 --> 05:23:09.558 align:start position:0%
action you know it's so that you could
 
05:23:12.310 --> 05:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
revoke my credentialing is that like
 
05:23:17.470 --> 05:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
black and white you know the could um no
 
05:23:21.430 --> 05:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
my my understanding is superintendant
 
05:23:23.390 --> 05:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
have an obligation to report if someone
 
05:23:26.670 --> 05:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
is arrested for a disqualifying offense
 
05:23:28.430 --> 05:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
currently working with the school
 
05:23:30.430 --> 05:23:30.440 align:start position:0%
district disqualifying offense they are
 
05:23:33.430 --> 05:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
obligated to report that
 
05:23:36.470 --> 05:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
yes um in such an instance the
 
05:23:39.750 --> 05:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
department could take an immediate
 
05:23:42.868 --> 05:23:42.878 align:start position:0%
suspension of that individual's
 
05:23:47.670 --> 05:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
credential um and and then see what how
 
05:23:50.708 --> 05:23:50.718 align:start position:0%
the criminal process plays out
 
05:23:50.718 --> 05:23:53.548 align:start position:0%
the criminal process plays out
yes

05:23:53.548 --> 05:23:53.558 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:23:53.558 --> 05:23:55.110 align:start position:0%
yes
and

05:23:55.110 --> 05:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:23:57.830 --> 05:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
yep who who decides what part who decid
 
05:24:00.230 --> 05:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
so let's say I've been charged and the
 
05:24:00.240 --> 05:24:01.510 align:start position:0%
so let's say I've been charged and the
department

05:24:01.510 --> 05:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:24:03.110 --> 05:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
whoever the department is I mean I know
 
05:24:04.390 --> 05:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
you're the department I mean you're we
 
05:24:06.430 --> 05:24:06.440 align:start position:0%
work for the department but decides that
 
05:24:08.868 --> 05:24:08.878 align:start position:0%
we should take her credentialing away
 
05:24:10.390 --> 05:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
and I've been charged I've not been
 
05:24:12.788 --> 05:24:12.798 align:start position:0%
convicted would that never happen or
 
05:24:15.868 --> 05:24:15.878 align:start position:0%
that might happen no that that very well
 
05:24:18.030 --> 05:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
could happen it has happened if an
 
05:24:20.230 --> 05:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
individual is arrested um and we have
 
05:24:22.708 --> 05:24:22.718 align:start position:0%
had this situation happen I don't want
 
05:24:24.788 --> 05:24:24.798 align:start position:0%
to say a multiple instances but we have
 
05:24:26.910 --> 05:24:26.920 align:start position:0%
had this happen and you'll it's
 
05:24:31.030 --> 05:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
typically reported in the news if an IND
 
05:24:34.548 --> 05:24:34.558 align:start position:0%
licensed educator is uh arrested
 
05:24:37.910 --> 05:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
for kidnapping or possession of child
 
05:24:42.110 --> 05:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:45.390 --> 05:24:45.400 align:start position:0%
assault the department can and has and
 
05:24:49.070 --> 05:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
and does it is discretionary but can
 
05:24:52.590 --> 05:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
um take action on that individual's
 
05:24:55.830 --> 05:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
license the theory being if that person
 
05:24:59.070 --> 05:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
cannot be employed in a
 
05:25:01.708 --> 05:25:01.718 align:start position:0%
district they they shouldn't have the
 
05:25:04.510 --> 05:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
license either so the license is
 
05:25:07.110 --> 05:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
immediately suspended the department has
 
05:25:07.120 --> 05:25:08.190 align:start position:0%
immediately suspended the department has
done

05:25:08.190 --> 05:25:08.200 align:start position:0%
done
 
05:25:11.430 --> 05:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
that previously the criminal justice
 
05:25:14.110 --> 05:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
system then does what the criminal
 
05:25:16.070 --> 05:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
justice system does the department has
 
05:25:17.868 --> 05:25:17.878 align:start position:0%
no role in that I will refer back to
 
05:25:19.390 --> 05:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
representative Myer's testimony I
 
05:25:21.350 --> 05:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
thought he explained that very well it's
 
05:25:23.110 --> 05:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
done in a different forum and the
 
05:25:25.110 --> 05:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
department doesn't play any role in that
 
05:25:27.548 --> 05:25:27.558 align:start position:0%
particular forum and then the department
 
05:25:30.270 --> 05:25:30.280 align:start position:0%
is there will respond accordingly based
 
05:25:32.788 --> 05:25:32.798 align:start position:0%
on what happens over here the department
 
05:25:34.270 --> 05:25:34.280 align:start position:0%
is more
 
05:25:36.670 --> 05:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
reactive doesn't play an active role in
 
05:25:39.510 --> 05:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
it but if a teacher is arrested the
 
05:25:41.948 --> 05:25:41.958 align:start position:0%
department will then respond accordingly
 
05:25:44.070 --> 05:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
yes I just follow up just real quick I
 
05:25:45.948 --> 05:25:45.958 align:start position:0%
think I was I in my mind I'm thinking
 
05:25:48.670 --> 05:25:48.680 align:start position:0%
more of this failure to report abuse not
 
05:25:51.190 --> 05:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
murder child abuse all that so I was
 
05:25:53.070 --> 05:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
thinking from that point of view but
 
05:25:56.150 --> 05:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you but if this law were to pass
 
05:26:00.190 --> 05:26:00.200 align:start position:0%
then that offense is listed amongst with
 
05:26:02.310 --> 05:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
all those offenses right now if the
 
05:26:04.750 --> 05:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
offense of failure to report it's not a
 
05:26:06.470 --> 05:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
disqualifying offense so the department
 
05:26:08.230 --> 05:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
would not take that action right thank
 
05:26:11.270 --> 05:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
you any further questions don't see any
 
05:26:14.190 --> 05:26:14.200 align:start position:0%
more questions but for both of you I
 
05:26:18.310 --> 05:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:23.708 --> 05:26:23.718 align:start position:0%
Tanner who usually reports failure to
 
05:26:26.628 --> 05:26:26.638 align:start position:0%
report who usually puts the crime
 
05:26:28.910 --> 05:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
forward like who charges you know like
 
05:26:31.868 --> 05:26:31.878 align:start position:0%
is it app parent if the kid comes to
 
05:26:34.110 --> 05:26:34.120 align:start position:0%
school and and something happens and the
 
05:26:35.628 --> 05:26:35.638 align:start position:0%
kid says oh I'm going to get killed if I
 
05:26:38.350 --> 05:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
go home and he gets killed and I haven't
 
05:26:41.990 --> 05:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
reported it who who who files a report
 
05:26:44.390 --> 05:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
against me who who files a
 
05:26:44.400 --> 05:26:47.070 align:start position:0%
against me who who files a
charge

05:26:47.070 --> 05:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
charge
 
05:26:49.628 --> 05:26:49.638 align:start position:0%
typically the charges are brought by the
 
05:26:52.910 --> 05:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
police department yeah whatever local
 
05:26:54.350 --> 05:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
police department the department How
 
05:26:56.350 --> 05:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
would how would they know that the kid
 
05:26:58.070 --> 05:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
had said that to
 
05:27:02.510 --> 05:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
me that goes beyond the the role of my
 
05:27:05.190 --> 05:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
position I each CA case is individual
 
05:27:07.910 --> 05:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
but any charging decisions are brought
 
05:27:10.628 --> 05:27:10.638 align:start position:0%
by the local police department yeah the
 
05:27:12.310 --> 05:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has no role in
 
05:27:15.110 --> 05:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
that yeah any further
 
05:27:17.868 --> 05:27:17.878 align:start position:0%
questions I did have a call from
 
05:27:19.788 --> 05:27:19.798 align:start position:0%
director applebe over there at the
 
05:27:21.750 --> 05:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
department the cost for initial
 
05:27:25.150 --> 05:27:25.160 align:start position:0%
certification for student is $1 140 plus
 
05:27:28.150 --> 05:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
doar the $100 is Administrative costs
 
05:27:31.510 --> 05:27:31.520 align:start position:0%

and your costs are exactly what you said
 
05:27:35.310 --> 05:27:35.320 align:start position:0%
$40 something dollars for the safety
 
05:27:37.910 --> 05:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
aspect of it so when we're talking that

05:29:04.150 --> 05:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
line for the National Alliance for
 
05:29:06.990 --> 05:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
eating disorders and I'd like to invite
 
05:29:10.628 --> 05:29:10.638 align:start position:0%
representative rung the prime sponsor to
 
05:29:12.788 --> 05:29:12.798 align:start position:0%
present the
 
05:29:15.910 --> 05:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you very much Mr chair and to
 
05:29:17.708 --> 05:29:17.718 align:start position:0%
the education committee for the record
 
05:29:19.948 --> 05:29:19.958 align:start position:0%
my name is Rosemary rang and I represent
 
05:29:22.670 --> 05:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 12 which is the town of
 
05:29:24.948 --> 05:29:24.958 align:start position:0%
miramac and for some reason I'm getting
 
05:29:28.750 --> 05:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
such a strong sense of deja vu because
 
05:29:30.910 --> 05:29:30.920 align:start position:0%
we were here a year ago
 
05:29:33.548 --> 05:29:33.558 align:start position:0%
um to make the case for the need to
 
05:29:36.190 --> 05:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
include an eating disorders helpline on
 
05:29:39.628 --> 05:29:39.638 align:start position:0%
the back of student IDs and I think we
 
05:29:41.948 --> 05:29:41.958 align:start position:0%
made a pretty good case for what the
 
05:29:43.948 --> 05:29:43.958 align:start position:0%
situation is with our young people and
 
05:29:47.110 --> 05:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
the need to provide as much information
 
05:29:49.070 --> 05:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
and and help line to them and to their
 
05:29:52.390 --> 05:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
families and friends um and and I'm glad
 
05:29:54.430 --> 05:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
that the committee agreed and recommend
 
05:29:57.510 --> 05:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
it ought to pass as amended um and I'm
 
05:29:59.510 --> 05:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
very grateful that the house also passed
 
05:30:01.350 --> 05:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
it and the Senate education committee
 
05:30:03.750 --> 05:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
passed it and the Senate passed it but
 
05:30:05.830 --> 05:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
around that time and I and I do want to
 
05:30:07.868 --> 05:30:07.878 align:start position:0%
thank representative cordelli and some
 
05:30:09.670 --> 05:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
other Representatives who brought to my
 
05:30:12.470 --> 05:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
attention around the same time there was
 
05:30:15.990 --> 05:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of mismanagement going on with the
 
05:30:18.230 --> 05:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
organization that provided the helpline
 
05:30:19.948 --> 05:30:19.958 align:start position:0%
at the time it was the national Eating
 
05:30:19.958 --> 05:30:21.190 align:start position:0%
at the time it was the national Eating
Disorders

05:30:21.190 --> 05:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
Disorders
 
05:30:24.670 --> 05:30:24.680 align:start position:0%
Association and um within a few weeks
 
05:30:26.708 --> 05:30:26.718 align:start position:0%
they had disconnected their helpline
 
05:30:27.708 --> 05:30:27.718 align:start position:0%
they had
 
05:30:30.350 --> 05:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
instituted uh some type of a remote I
 
05:30:33.390 --> 05:30:33.400 align:start position:0%
forget the name of it it's like a bot to
 
05:30:35.390 --> 05:30:35.400 align:start position:0%
to accept questions it was just a really
 
05:30:38.190 --> 05:30:38.200 align:start position:0%
a total failure in management and I
 
05:30:40.350 --> 05:30:40.360 align:start position:0%
believe that that director um lost her
 
05:30:44.948 --> 05:30:44.958 align:start position:0%
job over it um so um on the advice of
 
05:30:47.708 --> 05:30:47.718 align:start position:0%
myself and other people Governor sonunu
 
05:30:49.910 --> 05:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
rightly vetoed
 
05:30:52.470 --> 05:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
hb35 but that didn't make the problem go
 
05:30:54.430 --> 05:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
away did it there are still many young
 
05:30:57.270 --> 05:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
people who are suffering even dying from
 
05:30:57.280 --> 05:30:58.230 align:start position:0%
people who are suffering even dying from
eating

05:30:58.230 --> 05:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
eating
 
05:31:00.830 --> 05:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
disorders um and and you'll hear
 
05:31:03.190 --> 05:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
probably more information on that but
 
05:31:06.230 --> 05:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
what I I wanted to talk to you about is
 
05:31:10.708 --> 05:31:10.718 align:start position:0%
that after um The veto and I was unaware
 
05:31:12.390 --> 05:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
of how much attention that bill got
 
05:31:15.390 --> 05:31:15.400 align:start position:0%
outside of New Hampshire but um one of
 
05:31:17.750 --> 05:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
the the the drivers of that bill Mr
 
05:31:21.430 --> 05:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
Matthew Brown received uh was contacted
 
05:31:23.548 --> 05:31:23.558 align:start position:0%
by an association called the National
 
05:31:26.310 --> 05:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
Alliance for eating disorders and they
 
05:31:28.350 --> 05:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
felt that providing that helpline was
 
05:31:31.190 --> 05:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
really important and they want wanted us
 
05:31:33.590 --> 05:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
to consider new legislation that their
 
05:31:35.430 --> 05:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
helpl line could be added to the back of
 
05:31:38.910 --> 05:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
the ID and I certainly did not want to
 
05:31:41.230 --> 05:31:41.240 align:start position:0%
get in the position of partnering with
 
05:31:44.230 --> 05:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
an organization to find out a few months
 
05:31:46.830 --> 05:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
later their mismanagement was really
 
05:31:50.270 --> 05:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
going to torpedo the intent of of the
 
05:31:54.110 --> 05:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
legislation so I had um corresponded
 
05:31:55.948 --> 05:31:55.958 align:start position:0%
with them several times we had a zoom
 
05:31:58.510 --> 05:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
meeting with their executive director
 
05:32:01.310 --> 05:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
and I can wholeheartedly say I have
 
05:32:03.830 --> 05:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
complete trust and faith in the ability
 
05:32:06.110 --> 05:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
of the National Alliance for eating
 
05:32:09.110 --> 05:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
disorders to be able to provide a helpl
 
05:32:13.628 --> 05:32:13.638 align:start position:0%
line um they have a history of s of
 
05:32:17.670 --> 05:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
success in um enabling people who have
 
05:32:21.350 --> 05:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
any disorders to be able to access
 
05:32:24.190 --> 05:32:24.200 align:start position:0%
therapy um they have real people on the
 
05:32:27.190 --> 05:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
other end of the phone line therapist
 
05:32:29.190 --> 05:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
trained I think they use some trained
 
05:32:29.200 --> 05:32:30.708 align:start position:0%
trained I think they use some trained
volunteers

05:32:30.708 --> 05:32:30.718 align:start position:0%
volunteers
 
05:32:33.390 --> 05:32:33.400 align:start position:0%
um they have very um convenient hours
 
05:32:35.708 --> 05:32:35.718 align:start position:0%
that they're expecting to expand and I
 
05:32:36.990 --> 05:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
believe you may have gotten
 
05:32:39.628 --> 05:32:39.638 align:start position:0%
correspondence from their executive
 
05:32:43.150 --> 05:32:43.160 align:start position:0%
director um so if if you haven't let me
 
05:32:45.628 --> 05:32:45.638 align:start position:0%
know I'll try to get that for you so I
 
05:32:48.788 --> 05:32:48.798 align:start position:0%
come to you again asking for an autopass
 
05:32:51.110 --> 05:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
recommendation on HB
 
05:32:54.750 --> 05:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
1109 it is in essence the exact same
 
05:32:57.070 --> 05:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
bill that this committee approved as
 
05:33:00.590 --> 05:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
amended um except that we we are with a
 
05:33:03.350 --> 05:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
more solid organization who can provide
 
05:33:06.070 --> 05:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
that service and I would be happy to
 
05:33:08.590 --> 05:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you very much
 
05:33:10.230 --> 05:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
other questions from the
 
05:33:12.708 --> 05:33:12.718 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent
 
05:33:14.990 --> 05:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
Ry thank you and thank you for taking my
 
05:33:15.000 --> 05:33:17.548 align:start position:0%
Ry thank you and thank you for taking my
question

05:33:17.548 --> 05:33:17.558 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:33:20.990 --> 05:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
um the social service are uh
 
05:33:23.510 --> 05:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
organizations in my area spent a lot of
 
05:33:25.990 --> 05:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
time and money in N
 
05:33:30.590 --> 05:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
2022 um expanding the 988 number from
 
05:33:32.948 --> 05:33:32.958 align:start position:0%
just a suicide hotline to a mental
 
05:33:35.390 --> 05:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
health and crisis hotline um it's
 
05:33:35.400 --> 05:33:36.548 align:start position:0%
health and crisis hotline um it's
available

05:33:36.548 --> 05:33:36.558 align:start position:0%
available
 
05:33:39.948 --> 05:33:39.958 align:start position:0%
247 and the uh rationale behind that was
 
05:33:42.990 --> 05:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
because a three-digit number 988 was a
 
05:33:46.750 --> 05:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
lot um lot easier to remember than a
 
05:33:49.350 --> 05:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
10-digit number and so the thrust in
 
05:33:53.548 --> 05:33:53.558 align:start position:0%
emergency medicine um has been to co uh
 
05:33:57.548 --> 05:33:57.558 align:start position:0%
you just to um condense these all into
 
05:34:02.350 --> 05:34:02.360 align:start position:0%
the 988 uh triaged hotline number um why
 
05:34:05.788 --> 05:34:05.798 align:start position:0%
do you think this would be uh a time to
 
05:34:08.510 --> 05:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
go against that Trend oh U
 
05:34:10.430 --> 05:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
representative I thank thank you very Dr
 
05:34:11.910 --> 05:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that question I
 
05:34:13.470 --> 05:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
think it's an extremely important
 
05:34:15.470 --> 05:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
question um because all of us should
 
05:34:18.070 --> 05:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
have that on our minds
 
05:34:21.948 --> 05:34:21.958 align:start position:0%
but we are not a sixth grader or a 10th
 
05:34:26.628 --> 05:34:26.638 align:start position:0%
grader or a high schooler we are adults
 
05:34:30.270 --> 05:34:30.280 align:start position:0%
and the the target audience for the
 
05:34:32.548 --> 05:34:32.558 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill are youth they're
 
05:34:35.230 --> 05:34:35.240 align:start position:0%
adolescents they're teenagers and they
 
05:34:37.628 --> 05:34:37.638 align:start position:0%
don't think they have a mental illness
 
05:34:39.788 --> 05:34:39.798 align:start position:0%
they would not look at that crisis line
 
05:34:42.310 --> 05:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
and think that that's a place where they
 
05:34:44.470 --> 05:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
can get help or have their questions
 
05:34:47.230 --> 05:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
answered they but if they see eating
 
05:34:49.548 --> 05:34:49.558 align:start position:0%
disorders and that's the key they need
 
05:34:51.430 --> 05:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
to they can see themselves as having an
 
05:34:54.990 --> 05:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
eating disorder or maybe just I'm not
 
05:34:57.270 --> 05:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
eating like my friends do my parents are
 
05:34:59.150 --> 05:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
always on my back that I'm not I'm
 
05:35:00.750 --> 05:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
losing weight
 
05:35:03.670 --> 05:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
they would I can't even imagine and I'm
 
05:35:05.948 --> 05:35:05.958 align:start position:0%
looking back really at my three kids
 
05:35:07.948 --> 05:35:07.958 align:start position:0%
when they were that age I don't think
 
05:35:09.868 --> 05:35:09.878 align:start position:0%
they would have ever thought or
 
05:35:11.830 --> 05:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
identified as someone who had a
 
05:35:14.590 --> 05:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
potential mental disorder but they
 
05:35:16.230 --> 05:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
definitely would say I have an eating
 
05:35:18.990 --> 05:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
disorder I'm not eating normally so it's
 
05:35:22.910 --> 05:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
really um we need to communicate to the
 
05:35:26.430 --> 05:35:26.440 align:start position:0%
the target group in a way that they can
 
05:35:31.990 --> 05:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
relate to and if if I believed and if if
 
05:35:34.788 --> 05:35:34.798 align:start position:0%
Educators and people that are experts in
 
05:35:38.708 --> 05:35:38.718 align:start position:0%
pedagogy um would think that a sixth or
 
05:35:41.430 --> 05:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
seventh or eighth grader would be able
 
05:35:45.110 --> 05:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
to say oh I have a mental disorder um I
 
05:35:47.310 --> 05:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
may be at risk for suicide because of it
 
05:35:50.430 --> 05:35:50.440 align:start position:0%
I better call this this 988 number I
 
05:35:53.190 --> 05:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
would be all for that but I I think we
 
05:35:55.270 --> 05:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
would be missing a lot of people who
 
05:35:57.990 --> 05:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
need this number because they just don't
 
05:36:01.150 --> 05:36:01.160 align:start position:0%
identify with that
 
05:36:03.628 --> 05:36:03.638 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
05:36:08.110 --> 05:36:08.120 align:start position:0%
um the 988 number is advertised as uh
 
05:36:10.590 --> 05:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
suicide and crisis hotline and in fact
 
05:36:13.948 --> 05:36:13.958 align:start position:0%
if you go to the National um Alliance
 
05:36:16.510 --> 05:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
for eating disorders it says after the
 
05:36:18.948 --> 05:36:18.958 align:start position:0%
this their time it says if you have a
 
05:36:22.750 --> 05:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
crisis call 988 so I'm wondering why put
 
05:36:24.788 --> 05:36:24.798 align:start position:0%
in that extra step they're sending them
 
05:36:27.190 --> 05:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
there um if they're not available and
 
05:36:28.868 --> 05:36:28.878 align:start position:0%
that's a long time that's not weekends
 
05:36:31.510 --> 05:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
and they're not on evenings or weekends
 
05:36:33.350 --> 05:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
why not just put 9
 
05:36:36.590 --> 05:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
and8 again an excellent question but I
 
05:36:38.910 --> 05:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
think what the intent of this bill is is
 
05:36:41.868 --> 05:36:41.878 align:start position:0%
to reach people who children who are
 
05:36:44.230 --> 05:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
suffering from an eating disorder reach
 
05:36:47.750 --> 05:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
them early before it becomes a crisis or
 
05:36:51.110 --> 05:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
before they become suicidal we do know
 
05:36:53.190 --> 05:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
that so many people who suffer from
 
05:36:56.430 --> 05:36:56.440 align:start position:0%
eating disorders end up in a crisis they
 
05:37:01.628 --> 05:37:01.638 align:start position:0%
end up in um a suicide ideation but when
 
05:37:03.910 --> 05:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
they're younger when they're in those
 
05:37:06.510 --> 05:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
early teenage years they don't they're
 
05:37:08.470 --> 05:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
not there yet so they still would not
 
05:37:11.030 --> 05:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
relate to that they um they're going to
 
05:37:13.830 --> 05:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
call when they realize geez my friends
 
05:37:15.788 --> 05:37:15.798 align:start position:0%
are saying things to me my families are
 
05:37:18.070 --> 05:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
saying things to me about my eating oh
 
05:37:20.510 --> 05:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
there's this eating disorder help line I
 
05:37:23.310 --> 05:37:23.320 align:start position:0%
think I'll give them a call it's a
 
05:37:27.150 --> 05:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
different situation than if if they said
 
05:37:30.590 --> 05:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
oh suicide crisis hotline that I'm not
 
05:37:32.230 --> 05:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
there I'm not I'm not thinking about
 
05:37:35.750 --> 05:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
suicide I'm not in a crisis I just you
 
05:37:37.190 --> 05:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
know people think I have an eating
 
05:37:39.750 --> 05:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
problem so I still don't think if if the
 
05:37:42.910 --> 05:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
988 number said Eating Disorders you
 
05:37:45.948 --> 05:37:45.958 align:start position:0%
know all the way to where you might have
 
05:37:48.750 --> 05:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
suicide ideation or crisis I think it
 
05:37:51.390 --> 05:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
would be worth revisiting but right now
 
05:37:55.030 --> 05:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
people view their perception of 988 is
 
05:37:57.390 --> 05:37:57.400 align:start position:0%
I'm in an emergency situation something
 
05:37:59.070 --> 05:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
really bad's going to happen unless I
 
05:38:01.788 --> 05:38:01.798 align:start position:0%
call this number but the the people the
 
05:38:03.750 --> 05:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
children we want to reach aren't nearly
 
05:38:05.750 --> 05:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
there yet but they will get there
 
05:38:07.628 --> 05:38:07.638 align:start position:0%
without a hel
 
05:38:10.310 --> 05:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
line further question represent
 
05:38:12.830 --> 05:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and uh thank
 
05:38:15.590 --> 05:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
you for this bill and my question is
 
05:38:16.910 --> 05:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
going to be because you just brought up
 
05:38:18.750 --> 05:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
an interesting point that really sparked
 
05:38:21.110 --> 05:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
something for me
 
05:38:23.628 --> 05:38:23.638 align:start position:0%
so the suggestion is how is a student
 
05:38:25.390 --> 05:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
know that the the current existing
 
05:38:28.310 --> 05:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
hotline is okay to call not just for
 
05:38:30.590 --> 05:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
like an emerging crisis but for an
 
05:38:32.468 --> 05:38:32.478 align:start position:0%
eating disorder or any of these other
 
05:38:35.430 --> 05:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
things but clearly the line as as we've
 
05:38:36.628 --> 05:38:36.638 align:start position:0%
seen because we've been through this
 
05:38:38.548 --> 05:38:38.558 align:start position:0%
before that line is designed to be able
 
05:38:41.510 --> 05:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
to triage and send people to the kind of
 
05:38:43.150 --> 05:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
care that is necessary including
 
05:38:44.830 --> 05:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
non-emergent including things like
 
05:38:46.510 --> 05:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
eating disorders so would it not make
 
05:38:49.868 --> 05:38:49.878 align:start position:0%
sense to instead of putting another
 
05:38:52.510 --> 05:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
number on the card that and just you
 
05:38:54.548 --> 05:38:54.558 align:start position:0%
know giv giv just start the students the
 
05:38:56.150 --> 05:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
card and and not saying a word about it
 
05:38:57.628 --> 05:38:57.638 align:start position:0%
just it's just there maybe they see it
 
05:39:01.110 --> 05:39:01.120 align:start position:0%
maybe they don't maybe require ing a 5
 
05:39:03.670 --> 05:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
minute instruction on the scope of the
 
05:39:05.708 --> 05:39:05.718 align:start position:0%
current number and that you can call
 
05:39:07.150 --> 05:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
this for eating disorders or anything
 
05:39:09.948 --> 05:39:09.958 align:start position:0%
else that you need
 
05:39:13.070 --> 05:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
to um I thank you very much repres for
 
05:39:15.750 --> 05:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
the question I hope I'm understanding it
 
05:39:20.990 --> 05:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
correctly um I think educating an eighth
 
05:39:23.590 --> 05:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
grader seventh we know what they're like
 
05:39:25.948 --> 05:39:25.958 align:start position:0%
um educating them giving them a f minute
 
05:39:28.750 --> 05:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
educational talk about the application
 
05:39:30.750 --> 05:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
of 98
 
05:39:33.708 --> 05:39:33.718 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure that would take as much
 
05:39:36.390 --> 05:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
as they would recognize Eating Disorders
 
05:39:38.628 --> 05:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
that's for me and another important
 
05:39:40.628 --> 05:39:40.638 align:start position:0%
point I I haven't really made yet is
 
05:39:42.230 --> 05:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
that the people on the other line of
 
05:39:44.230 --> 05:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
this helpl line are highly trained in
 
05:39:47.910 --> 05:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
Eating Disorders it is a very specific
 
05:39:50.350 --> 05:39:50.360 align:start position:0%
disorder um it's not something you can
 
05:39:53.070 --> 05:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
lump in with other medical issue uh
 
05:39:55.590 --> 05:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
mental issues I think we heard testimony
 
05:39:57.590 --> 05:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
on that when this bill was brought up
 
05:40:00.430 --> 05:40:00.440 align:start position:0%
last year but it is very specific so it
 
05:40:03.510 --> 05:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
actually saves a step um by calling this
 
05:40:06.990 --> 05:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
number directly they can they can hear
 
05:40:11.030 --> 05:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
from therapists and and people who know
 
05:40:13.910 --> 05:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
exactly what type of situation they're
 
05:40:17.910 --> 05:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
in and what help they need and and
 
05:40:20.030 --> 05:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
because this organization is one that a
 
05:40:22.670 --> 05:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
988 might refer someone to so we're
 
05:40:25.628 --> 05:40:25.638 align:start position:0%
actually saving a step for Youth and
 
05:40:28.190 --> 05:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
having them call this number directly I
 
05:40:30.350 --> 05:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
hope that answered your question
 
05:40:31.510 --> 05:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
it does and if I may have a brief
 
05:40:33.110 --> 05:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
followup because you brought up the the
 
05:40:35.830 --> 05:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
concept that that this young child might
 
05:40:37.548 --> 05:40:37.558 align:start position:0%
understand properly that they already
 
05:40:38.990 --> 05:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
have an eating disorder so it's in their
 
05:40:40.628 --> 05:40:40.638 align:start position:0%
mind that they are sort of self-
 
05:40:42.390 --> 05:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
diagnosing eating disorder so I'm going
 
05:40:43.750 --> 05:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
to direct myself to the number on the
 
05:40:46.430 --> 05:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
card that says eating disorder but what
 
05:40:48.070 --> 05:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
if they don't realize that what they're
 
05:40:50.030 --> 05:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with is an is exactly an eating
 
05:40:51.708 --> 05:40:51.718 align:start position:0%
disorder would it not make more sense to
 
05:40:53.270 --> 05:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
call a more generalized line and that
 
05:40:55.548 --> 05:40:55.558 align:start position:0%
way they can be sort of diagnosed and
 
05:40:59.670 --> 05:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
and and moved down that track um I guess
 
05:41:02.270 --> 05:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
so I think this number would appeal to
 
05:41:05.390 --> 05:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
to youth that recognize that something's
 
05:41:06.948 --> 05:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
different about their eating I mean
 
05:41:09.030 --> 05:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
eating eating is something we do about
 
05:41:12.628 --> 05:41:12.638 align:start position:0%
three times a day if you don't snack um
 
05:41:15.750 --> 05:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
and so when we're not eating consistent
 
05:41:17.948 --> 05:41:17.958 align:start position:0%
with what other our family our parents
 
05:41:20.030 --> 05:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
expectations are what our friends expect
 
05:41:23.110 --> 05:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
us are the focus is on the eating part
 
05:41:26.430 --> 05:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
so I think they would relate more to a
 
05:41:28.510 --> 05:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
help line that talked about eating
 
05:41:31.150 --> 05:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
disorders and and I would I
 
05:41:34.070 --> 05:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
mean I I agree with you in a way that a
 
05:41:36.270 --> 05:41:36.280 align:start position:0%
child may call this number not thinking
 
05:41:39.230 --> 05:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
they have an eating disorder that just
 
05:41:40.830 --> 05:41:40.840 align:start position:0%
they got issues with their eating I
 
05:41:42.150 --> 05:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
don't know if they'd even put the word
 
05:41:44.110 --> 05:41:44.120 align:start position:0%
disorder on it but I think if they saw
 
05:41:46.430 --> 05:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
eating disorder they would they would
 
05:41:49.070 --> 05:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
recognize that oh this is for people who
 
05:41:51.468 --> 05:41:51.478 align:start position:0%
are not meeting eating expectations of
 
05:41:54.990 --> 05:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
their family or maybe they realize that
 
05:41:57.510 --> 05:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
Jesus um something's a matter if I have
 
05:42:00.230 --> 05:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
to run to the bathroom after eating to
 
05:42:02.070 --> 05:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
expel what I just ate you know they're
 
05:42:04.948 --> 05:42:04.958 align:start position:0%
going to recognize that that is a
 
05:42:07.030 --> 05:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
disorder so I hope I answered your
 
05:42:09.868 --> 05:42:09.878 align:start position:0%
question thank you f question
 
05:42:09.878 --> 05:42:11.150 align:start position:0%
question thank you f question
representative

05:42:11.150 --> 05:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:42:13.430 --> 05:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you and thank you for
 
05:42:17.708 --> 05:42:17.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question this hotline um is it
 
05:42:20.270 --> 05:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
just for the people in crisis or is it
 
05:42:23.868 --> 05:42:23.878 align:start position:0%
for the kids that are friends and say G
 
05:42:26.070 --> 05:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
my friend has an eating disorder you
 
05:42:29.628 --> 05:42:29.638 align:start position:0%
know what can I do um oh there's a
 
05:42:31.708 --> 05:42:31.718 align:start position:0%
seating disorder number I can I can call
 
05:42:34.788 --> 05:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
is it is it is it not just crisis is it
 
05:42:37.750 --> 05:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
for other kids that are working with
 
05:42:40.788 --> 05:42:40.798 align:start position:0%
peer counseling on a informal basis it's
 
05:42:43.070 --> 05:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
for anyone that has a concern about an
 
05:42:46.628 --> 05:42:46.638 align:start position:0%
eating disorder so a parent might call
 
05:42:48.510 --> 05:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
might see it on their child's ID and
 
05:42:50.430 --> 05:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
said because we know that that happens
 
05:42:52.750 --> 05:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
we know that I know at the suicide
 
05:42:55.468 --> 05:42:55.478 align:start position:0%
hotline parents are ones that call that
 
05:42:57.110 --> 05:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
often because of their concerns about
 
05:43:00.830 --> 05:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
their child so um no this this runs the
 
05:43:03.110 --> 05:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
gamut representative Tanner from people
 
05:43:07.948 --> 05:43:07.958 align:start position:0%
who have a concern about a loved one um
 
05:43:10.948 --> 05:43:10.958 align:start position:0%
to someone who really feels that they
 
05:43:12.788 --> 05:43:12.798 align:start position:0%
need they need some medical help or they
 
05:43:16.190 --> 05:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
need some therapeutic help so it it runs
 
05:43:19.788 --> 05:43:19.798 align:start position:0%
a gamut and but depending on what that
 
05:43:22.390 --> 05:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
issue is the nature of that call they
 
05:43:24.430 --> 05:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
may be referred to someone else they may
 
05:43:29.070 --> 05:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
be referred even referred to 911 um or 9
 
05:43:32.310 --> 05:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
988 or or a hospital it really
 
05:43:34.510 --> 05:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
depends further
 
05:43:38.548 --> 05:43:38.558 align:start position:0%
questions representative uh on line 14
 
05:43:39.948 --> 05:43:39.958 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:43:43.270 --> 05:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
bill uh there under Roman three there's
 
05:43:45.030 --> 05:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
an area where say
 
05:43:47.150 --> 05:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
annually the information on the card
 
05:43:48.390 --> 05:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
shall be certified with their
 
05:43:50.788 --> 05:43:50.798 align:start position:0%
legislative body or I guess with the uh
 
05:43:54.150 --> 05:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
not the respective governing bodies does
 
05:43:56.070 --> 05:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
that mean there has to be some process
 
05:43:58.708 --> 05:43:58.718 align:start position:0%
in which this is communicated with the
 
05:44:02.070 --> 05:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
school board or what's the how do you do
 
05:44:05.030 --> 05:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
this certifying um let me read it again
 
05:44:12.670 --> 05:44:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:16.190 --> 05:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
glasses oh um with that with that and I
 
05:44:17.310 --> 05:44:17.320 align:start position:0%
think that was in the original
 
05:44:21.270 --> 05:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
legislation too um Mr chair it it just
 
05:44:23.070 --> 05:44:23.080 align:start position:0%
means that they have to confirm that
 
05:44:25.190 --> 05:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
that's the correct number if they are re
 
05:44:27.430 --> 05:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
you know reissuing those student IDs at
 
05:44:28.750 --> 05:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the year they just have
 
05:44:32.510 --> 05:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
to confirm that the and and it's it
 
05:44:34.190 --> 05:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily have to be with
 
05:44:35.670 --> 05:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
their governing board it's the
 
05:44:37.750 --> 05:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
administration of the school so if the
 
05:44:39.468 --> 05:44:39.478 align:start position:0%
administration is going to be issuing
 
05:44:42.708 --> 05:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
new student IDs um they would have to
 
05:44:45.868 --> 05:44:45.878 align:start position:0%
confirm that the the number for the
 
05:44:47.310 --> 05:44:47.320 align:start position:0%
National Alliance for eating disorders
 
05:44:50.708 --> 05:44:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:54.670 --> 05:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
date would it be better than uh question
 
05:44:56.350 --> 05:44:56.360 align:start position:0%
that public schools Charter Public
 
05:44:58.590 --> 05:44:58.600 align:start position:0%

certify that the student identification
 
05:45:10.150 --> 05:45:10.160 align:start position:0%

05:45:12.788 --> 05:45:12.798 align:start position:0%
the administration that that the the
 
05:45:16.350 --> 05:45:16.360 align:start position:0%
district the school is going to

certify um well when I I I think I'm I'm
 
05:45:23.190 --> 05:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
interpreting the word certify as
 
05:45:26.230 --> 05:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
confirm like yes we are going to put
 
05:45:27.910 --> 05:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
this number this number will be on our
 
05:45:31.430 --> 05:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
ID yeah is that your interpretation it
 
05:45:35.350 --> 05:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:38.948 --> 05:45:38.958 align:start position:0%
correct yeah thank you uh further
 
05:45:40.150 --> 05:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
questions from the

committee thank you very much thank you
 
05:45:52.628 --> 05:45:52.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:55.310 --> 05:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
McDonald hello representative Valerie
 
05:45:57.430 --> 05:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
mcdonal Rockingham
 
05:46:00.590 --> 05:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
25 and I'm a co-sponsor of this bill and
 
05:46:02.510 --> 05:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
I Echo the remarks that have been said
 
05:46:03.830 --> 05:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
and I will leave some of the more
 
05:46:05.350 --> 05:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
technical details for those who will
 
05:46:08.110 --> 05:46:08.120 align:start position:0%
speak after me however just to remind
 
05:46:11.230 --> 05:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
you last year hb35 passed this committee
 
05:46:14.070 --> 05:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
with strong bipartisan support passed
 
05:46:16.510 --> 05:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
the Full House pass the Senate education
 
05:46:19.910 --> 05:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
committee and pass the full Senate I
 
05:46:21.830 --> 05:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
simply ask that the committee views this
 
05:46:24.830 --> 05:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
bill favorably once again I'd also like
 
05:46:27.350 --> 05:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
to say thank you to Mr Matthew Brown who
 
05:46:28.868 --> 05:46:28.878 align:start position:0%
is here and has brought this bill
 
05:46:31.830 --> 05:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
forward which he is inspiring his peers
 
05:46:34.708 --> 05:46:34.718 align:start position:0%
to get involved in the Civic process um
 
05:46:36.468 --> 05:46:36.478 align:start position:0%
I will be happy to take any questions
 
05:46:38.310 --> 05:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
but the primary reason that I have
 
05:46:41.150 --> 05:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
decided to testify today is to present
 
05:46:44.230 --> 05:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
my own student ID cards because some of
 
05:46:46.070 --> 05:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
you have expressed interest in seeing
 
05:46:48.468 --> 05:46:48.478 align:start position:0%
these in previous discussions um they're
 
05:46:51.110 --> 05:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
dated 2020 and 2021 but to the best of
 
05:46:53.310 --> 05:46:53.320 align:start position:0%
my knowledge these are the current
 
05:46:55.468 --> 05:46:55.478 align:start position:0%
design specifically to the Salem School
 
05:46:57.390 --> 05:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
District but across New Hampshire
 
05:46:59.788 --> 05:46:59.798 align:start position:0%
schools have similar ideas cards in
 
05:47:01.948 --> 05:47:01.958 align:start position:0%
respect to shape and size I figure the
 
05:47:04.150 --> 05:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
committee May benefit from a tangible
 
05:47:06.868 --> 05:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
example you can note that on the back is
 
05:47:09.590 --> 05:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline
 
05:47:11.590 --> 05:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
that is already required by State
 
05:47:15.230 --> 05:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
Statute the bill in front of us hb19
 
05:47:17.030 --> 05:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
would add the National Alliance for
 
05:47:20.150 --> 05:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
eating disorders heline um these
 
05:47:21.910 --> 05:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
specific cards do contain additional
 
05:47:23.750 --> 05:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
phone numbers that the Salem School
 
05:47:25.788 --> 05:47:25.798 align:start position:0%
District opted to include but are not
 
05:47:27.708 --> 05:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
required in State Statute so other
 
05:47:29.230 --> 05:47:29.240 align:start position:0%
districts May incorporate their own
 
05:47:31.750 --> 05:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
phone numbers as they see fit but thank
 
05:47:33.868 --> 05:47:33.878 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much are there
 
05:47:34.990 --> 05:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative
 
05:47:35.000 --> 05:47:36.110 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative
representative

05:47:36.110 --> 05:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:47:38.750 --> 05:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
dry thank you um and thank you for
 
05:47:41.510 --> 05:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question and I understand this
 
05:47:44.190 --> 05:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
is a serious issue and I'm certainly um
 
05:47:47.230 --> 05:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
in favor of of students having access to
 
05:47:50.030 --> 05:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
help that they need um I'm just
 
05:47:53.468 --> 05:47:53.478 align:start position:0%
wondering uh why this one there are
 
05:47:56.190 --> 05:47:56.200 align:start position:0%
other issues that affect uh grades 6 to
 
05:47:58.628 --> 05:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
12 you know pregnancy human trafficking
 
05:48:01.030 --> 05:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
domestic abuse alcohol all those things
 
05:48:03.628 --> 05:48:03.638 align:start position:0%
do we want a long list or do we want
 
05:48:06.708 --> 05:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
something that's going to be easy to
 
05:48:09.350 --> 05:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
access thank you for the question from
 
05:48:11.150 --> 05:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
my understanding the reason Eating
 
05:48:13.510 --> 05:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
Disorders was selected is because of its
 
05:48:16.830 --> 05:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
prevalence especially among adolescents
 
05:48:20.150 --> 05:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
it is one of the largest contributors to
 
05:48:22.788 --> 05:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
suicide rates within that age group
 
05:48:24.350 --> 05:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
which is why I believe it was selected
 
05:48:26.230 --> 05:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
because it is such a predominant issue
 
05:48:27.590 --> 05:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
these days
 
05:48:30.230 --> 05:48:30.240 align:start position:0%

school resource officer and then a third
 
05:48:54.190 --> 05:48:54.200 align:start position:0%

topic
 
05:50:11.910 --> 05:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
so dear in my
 
05:50:14.510 --> 05:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
heart I spent over 40 years as a
 
05:50:16.628 --> 05:50:16.638 align:start position:0%
dietitian mostly in private practice and
 
05:50:19.070 --> 05:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
about 50% of my patients were people
 
05:50:21.670 --> 05:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:24.830 --> 05:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
disorders they were the people I lost
 
05:50:28.110 --> 05:50:28.120 align:start position:0%
sleepover they were the people that you
 
05:50:30.190 --> 05:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
didn't know if it was going to come out
 
05:50:32.670 --> 05:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
okay in the
 
05:50:36.628 --> 05:50:36.638 align:start position:0%
end early diagnosis early intervention
 
05:50:39.310 --> 05:50:39.320 align:start position:0%
early treatment with eating disorders is
 
05:50:42.350 --> 05:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
strongly predictive of better
 
05:50:45.468 --> 05:50:45.478 align:start position:0%
outcomes so the sooner that a young
 
05:50:48.468 --> 05:50:48.478 align:start position:0%
person having symptoms of an eating
 
05:50:52.390 --> 05:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
disorder is able to get input and help
 
05:50:55.230 --> 05:50:55.240 align:start position:0%
the more likely that we save their life
 
05:50:58.070 --> 05:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not being melodramatic anorexia is
 
05:51:00.788 --> 05:51:00.798 align:start position:0%
the number one cause of death among
 
05:51:00.798 --> 05:51:03.350 align:start position:0%
the number one cause of death among
psychiatric

05:51:03.350 --> 05:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
psychiatric
 
05:51:05.948 --> 05:51:05.958 align:start position:0%
diagnosis it's very very serious it is
 
05:51:08.230 --> 05:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
certainly not the only eating disorder
 
05:51:11.868 --> 05:51:11.878 align:start position:0%
and they all have very significant
 
05:51:17.190 --> 05:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
medical nutritional psychological life
 
05:51:21.628 --> 05:51:21.638 align:start position:0%
impact so as noted we were very
 
05:51:23.390 --> 05:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
successful with this bill last year
 
05:51:25.868 --> 05:51:25.878 align:start position:0%
until due to circumstances beyond our
 
05:51:28.868 --> 05:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
control we had the UNT forunate
 
05:51:31.708 --> 05:51:31.718 align:start position:0%
circumstance of needing to ask it be
 
05:51:35.708 --> 05:51:35.718 align:start position:0%
vetoed I am beyond 100% confident that
 
05:51:37.350 --> 05:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
the National Alliance for eating
 
05:51:39.468 --> 05:51:39.478 align:start position:0%
disorders is the organization we should
 
05:51:41.590 --> 05:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
have aligned with to begin with and that
 
05:51:44.548 --> 05:51:44.558 align:start position:0%
they will be here for us
 
05:51:47.110 --> 05:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
indefinitely it was founded in
 
05:51:57.270 --> 05:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:00.310 --> 05:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
264,000 30% of those calls were from
 
05:52:01.548 --> 05:52:01.558 align:start position:0%
people under
 
05:52:05.708 --> 05:52:05.718 align:start position:0%
18 so that is an enormous body of
 
05:52:09.468 --> 05:52:09.478 align:start position:0%
benefit the founder and CEO is Joanna
 
05:52:11.430 --> 05:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
Kendell if you worked in Eating
 
05:52:14.590 --> 05:52:14.600 align:start position:0%
Disorders you know Joanna as a person
 
05:52:17.070 --> 05:52:17.080 align:start position:0%
who is revered for her own personal
 
05:52:20.190 --> 05:52:20.200 align:start position:0%
recovery and then her Education and
 
05:52:22.910 --> 05:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
Training and ability to train others and
 
05:52:24.788 --> 05:52:24.798 align:start position:0%
to help people get well she's truly an
 
05:52:27.910 --> 05:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
extraordinary person and she supervises
 
05:52:29.948 --> 05:52:29.958 align:start position:0%
all of
 
05:52:33.708 --> 05:52:33.718 align:start position:0%
this all of the people who answered this
 
05:52:36.390 --> 05:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
helpline are licensed therapists and
 
05:52:37.990 --> 05:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Counselors and they're
 
05:52:40.628 --> 05:52:40.638 align:start position:0%
supervised by a
 
05:52:42.990 --> 05:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist the Merit of that is not
 
05:52:45.590 --> 05:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
only that they're licensed people but
 
05:52:47.990 --> 05:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
that they specialize in Eating
 
05:52:49.868 --> 05:52:49.878 align:start position:0%
Disorders one of the things that was
 
05:52:52.468 --> 05:52:52.478 align:start position:0%
always fascinating to me in working to
 
05:52:54.030 --> 05:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
help folks with eating disorders and you
 
05:52:55.750 --> 05:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
almost always work in a team it's not
 
05:52:58.868 --> 05:52:58.878 align:start position:0%
treated by a dietitian or a therapist
 
05:53:01.030 --> 05:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
but by a collaborative of Professionals
 
05:53:02.750 --> 05:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
of different
 
05:53:06.628 --> 05:53:06.638 align:start position:0%
disciplines it was hard to find
 
05:53:10.230 --> 05:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
therapists who were enthusiastic about
 
05:53:12.548 --> 05:53:12.558 align:start position:0%
working with people with eating
 
05:53:16.390 --> 05:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
disorders because it's complex it's
 
05:53:20.310 --> 05:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
scary and I don't know why but it didn't
 
05:53:22.190 --> 05:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
tend to be it's gotten better but it
 
05:53:24.830 --> 05:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
didn't tend to be the discipline for
 
05:53:26.030 --> 05:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
05:53:29.990 --> 05:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
professionals to have passion for
 
05:53:31.628 --> 05:53:31.638 align:start position:0%
and when a person who has an eating
 
05:53:34.030 --> 05:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
disorder especially a young
 
05:53:37.190 --> 05:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
person reaches out for help it is
 
05:53:39.030 --> 05:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
critically important that the person
 
05:53:40.468 --> 05:53:40.478 align:start position:0%
that they talk
 
05:53:43.910 --> 05:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
to have very thorough credible
 
05:53:46.670 --> 05:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
understanding of these conditions have
 
05:53:48.628 --> 05:53:48.638 align:start position:0%
compassion no
 
05:53:51.390 --> 05:53:51.400 align:start position:0%
judgment and quite frankly do not he in
 
05:53:52.788 --> 05:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
what they
 
05:53:55.070 --> 05:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
say because there are way too many
 
05:53:58.430 --> 05:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunate Tales of people who ask for
 
05:54:01.110 --> 05:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
help and one of the first responses they
 
05:54:05.350 --> 05:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
got was really you look great you don't
 
05:54:07.788 --> 05:54:07.798 align:start position:0%
look like you have a problem that is the
 
05:54:09.990 --> 05:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
perfect validation that a person with an
 
05:54:11.548 --> 05:54:11.558 align:start position:0%
eating disorder should stay eating
 
05:54:13.590 --> 05:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
disordered it's not what we want people
 
05:54:15.830 --> 05:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
to receive when they ask for
 
05:54:20.270 --> 05:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
help so
 
05:54:24.468 --> 05:54:24.478 align:start position:0%
um just to before I wrap up um note a
 
05:54:26.670 --> 05:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
couple things the email that I think
 
05:54:28.590 --> 05:54:28.600 align:start position:0%
representative rung mentioned from
 
05:54:30.670 --> 05:54:30.680 align:start position:0%
Joanna Condell from the National
 
05:54:33.310 --> 05:54:33.320 align:start position:0%
Alliance is in your inboxes from January
 
05:54:36.628 --> 05:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
16th so two days ago please read it it's
 
05:54:39.270 --> 05:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
really a good thoughtful explanation of
 
05:54:39.280 --> 05:54:40.948 align:start position:0%
really a good thoughtful explanation of
the

05:54:40.948 --> 05:54:40.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:54:46.190 --> 05:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
heline um and in response to I think it
 
05:54:49.270 --> 05:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
was representative dr's question um
 
05:54:52.468 --> 05:54:52.478 align:start position:0%
about other conditions and why this
 
05:54:55.510 --> 05:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
particular one for this age group this
 
05:54:57.468 --> 05:54:57.478 align:start position:0%
population there's more incidents of
 
05:54:59.230 --> 05:54:59.240 align:start position:0%
eating dis in adolescence then there is
 
05:54:59.240 --> 05:55:00.548 align:start position:0%
eating dis in adolescence then there is
substance

05:55:00.548 --> 05:55:00.558 align:start position:0%
substance
 
05:55:02.990 --> 05:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
abuse there is eating disorders
 
05:55:05.270 --> 05:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
co-occurring commonly with depression
 
05:55:08.150 --> 05:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
and anxiety and OCD as parallel
 
05:55:10.110 --> 05:55:10.120 align:start position:0%
disorders parallel is probably not the
 
05:55:11.590 --> 05:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
right word but
 
05:55:15.750 --> 05:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
co-occurring um but in this age group
 
05:55:18.430 --> 05:55:18.440 align:start position:0%
this is the time to help them get
 
05:55:20.948 --> 05:55:20.958 align:start position:0%
Specialized Care that is specific to
 
05:55:20.958 --> 05:55:22.030 align:start position:0%
Specialized Care that is specific to
their

05:55:22.030 --> 05:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:55:24.628 --> 05:55:24.638 align:start position:0%
situation and I would reiterate
 
05:55:27.830 --> 05:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative Run's remarks most kids
 
05:55:29.750 --> 05:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
with with eating disorders do not see
 
05:55:34.150 --> 05:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
themselves as in a mental health crisis
 
05:55:34.160 --> 05:55:34.990 align:start position:0%
themselves as in a mental health crisis
as

05:55:34.990 --> 05:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:55:37.708 --> 05:55:37.718 align:start position:0%
suicidal they know they're troubled they
 
05:55:40.030 --> 05:55:40.040 align:start position:0%
come to know that they're doing things
 
05:55:41.948 --> 05:55:41.958 align:start position:0%
in a way that is harmful to
 
05:55:44.510 --> 05:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
them but I don't think I could list a
 
05:55:47.948 --> 05:55:47.958 align:start position:0%
single patient that I worked with who
 
05:55:50.070 --> 05:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
would have called the 988 number they
 
05:55:52.070 --> 05:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
just didn't categorize themselves in
 
05:55:55.468 --> 05:55:55.478 align:start position:0%
that way and I hugely respect that we
 
05:55:58.468 --> 05:55:58.478 align:start position:0%
have 988 and can concisely say
 
05:56:00.628 --> 05:56:00.638 align:start position:0%
for the folks that that
 
05:56:04.708 --> 05:56:04.718 align:start position:0%
fits and and Market that but this is not
 
05:56:06.070 --> 05:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
the same as
 
05:56:08.788 --> 05:56:08.798 align:start position:0%
that I'll stop there please vote this
 
05:56:10.948 --> 05:56:10.958 align:start position:0%
OTP thank you very much representative
 
05:56:13.110 --> 05:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
Damon are there any questions from the
 
05:56:15.788 --> 05:56:15.798 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent
 
05:56:19.270 --> 05:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
joh I I do appreciate very much what
 
05:56:22.708 --> 05:56:22.718 align:start position:0%
you're doing um so my question is what
 
05:56:26.390 --> 05:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
hours is this National hotline open
 
05:56:27.750 --> 05:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm going to just reference
 
05:56:30.450 --> 05:56:30.460 align:start position:0%
that that message because it's in
 
05:56:30.460 --> 05:56:31.708 align:start position:0%
that that message because it's in
[Music]

05:56:31.708 --> 05:56:31.718 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:56:34.230 --> 05:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
there it is open Monday through Friday
 
05:56:36.468 --> 05:56:36.478 align:start position:0%
9:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. they're expanding
 
05:56:38.910 --> 05:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
their hours this year to be 9
 
05:56:42.230 --> 05:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
to9 and then working towards weekend
 
05:56:45.990 --> 05:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
hours um and I think there was a
 
05:56:49.070 --> 05:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
statement bear with me just a
 
05:56:51.110 --> 05:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
second because I think they referenced
 
05:56:54.708 --> 05:56:54.718 align:start position:0%
988 in here somewhere it it says if you
 
05:56:59.708 --> 05:56:59.718 align:start position:0%
have a crisis right underneath the hours
 
05:57:02.150 --> 05:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
no I'm reading the hours in the text oh
 
05:57:04.070 --> 05:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
anyway hopefully you all read it I won't
 
05:57:07.430 --> 05:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
take your time hunting sure okay so my
 
05:57:11.708 --> 05:57:11.718 align:start position:0%
point is that nights and E late evenings
 
05:57:16.310 --> 05:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
and um weekends you're going to get a
 
05:57:19.750 --> 05:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
number 988 that will triage you to
 
05:57:23.070 --> 05:57:23.080 align:start position:0%
people who are equally trained because
 
05:57:24.310 --> 05:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
they're going to send it to the right in
 
05:57:26.788 --> 05:57:26.798 align:start position:0%
the right direction
 
05:57:26.798 --> 05:57:29.030 align:start position:0%
the right direction
so

05:57:29.030 --> 05:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:57:32.030 --> 05:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering
 
05:57:37.788 --> 05:57:37.798 align:start position:0%
how why why two numbers okay thank you
 
05:57:40.230 --> 05:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the
 
05:57:42.270 --> 05:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
question I think we have a difference of
 
05:57:45.230 --> 05:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
opinion about them being equally trained
 
05:57:47.948 --> 05:57:47.958 align:start position:0%
because although they may have the same

05:58:01.350 --> 05:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
specifically trained in eating disorders
 
05:58:04.030 --> 05:58:04.040 align:start position:0%
and there is a difference in the way
 
05:58:06.708 --> 05:58:06.718 align:start position:0%
people experiencing Eating
 
05:58:09.230 --> 05:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
Disorders hear the
 
05:58:09.240 --> 05:58:12.230 align:start position:0%
Disorders hear the
language

05:58:12.230 --> 05:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
language
 
05:58:15.510 --> 05:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
I if they just hear things in a through
 
05:58:17.830 --> 05:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
a different filter than what a person
 
05:58:19.910 --> 05:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
who doesn't have an eating disorder
 
05:58:22.868 --> 05:58:22.878 align:start position:0%
would hear remarks
 
05:58:25.670 --> 05:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
from a fair number of these calls and I
 
05:58:28.390 --> 05:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
don't have data on this this is
 
05:58:31.230 --> 05:58:31.240 align:start position:0%
my uh my
 
05:58:34.468 --> 05:58:34.478 align:start position:0%
experience actually are during school
 
05:58:36.708 --> 05:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
hours because when kids with eating
 
05:58:39.510 --> 05:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
disorders are around their peers it is
 
05:58:41.990 --> 05:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
both triggering and it is sometimes and
 
05:58:43.628 --> 05:58:43.638 align:start position:0%
it is
 
05:58:46.190 --> 05:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
also their peers are likely to help them
 
05:58:47.270 --> 05:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
call for
 
05:58:49.510 --> 05:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
help and I actually meant to say that I
 
05:58:50.910 --> 05:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
think that is another benefit of putting
 
05:58:52.310 --> 05:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
this on ID
 
05:58:54.788 --> 05:58:54.798 align:start position:0%
cards that people who are not suffering
 
05:58:56.468 --> 05:58:56.478 align:start position:0%
from the eating disorder will see that
 
05:58:58.310 --> 05:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
there's a place to call for help
 
05:59:00.390 --> 05:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
and they can call and find out how to
 
05:59:03.070 --> 05:59:03.080 align:start position:0%
help their friend get help or a parent
 
05:59:06.310 --> 05:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
or a sibling likewise I don't think they
 
05:59:09.430 --> 05:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
should be perceived as competing numbers
 
05:59:11.590 --> 05:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
they're both incredibly valuable numbers
 
05:59:14.390 --> 05:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
for the population that needs
 
05:59:17.510 --> 05:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
them thank you represent
 
05:59:19.670 --> 05:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and thanks for
 
05:59:21.190 --> 05:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
your your technical expertise on this
 
05:59:23.548 --> 05:59:23.558 align:start position:0%
matter would I be correct if I were to
 
05:59:26.070 --> 05:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
say that or if I were to ask that um
 
05:59:28.350 --> 05:59:28.360 align:start position:0%
Eating Disorders might incompass not
 
05:59:30.030 --> 05:59:30.040 align:start position:0%
just disorders of undereating and
 
05:59:32.190 --> 05:59:32.200 align:start position:0%
malnutrition but also
 
05:59:34.788 --> 05:59:34.798 align:start position:0%
overeating you would be very correct in
 
05:59:37.230 --> 05:59:37.240 align:start position:0%
fact compulsive overeating and binge
 
05:59:39.070 --> 05:59:39.080 align:start position:0%
eating disorder occur at greater
 
05:59:40.830 --> 05:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
frequency than restrictive Eating
 
05:59:42.868 --> 05:59:42.878 align:start position:0%
Disorders thank you and if I may I'll
 
05:59:44.190 --> 05:59:44.200 align:start position:0%
follow up on that because I'm I'm
 
05:59:45.948 --> 05:59:45.958 align:start position:0%
looking and I haven't looked a lot
 
05:59:47.030 --> 05:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
because I just brought it up but I'm
 
05:59:48.390 --> 05:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
just looking at the website for The
 
05:59:50.990 --> 05:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
Alliance for eating disorders and I've
 
05:59:52.270 --> 05:59:52.280 align:start position:0%
gone to their blog and I'm looking at
 
05:59:54.030 --> 05:59:54.040 align:start position:0%
some articles a few articles and there's
 
05:59:58.190 --> 05:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
a consistent theme showing up um
 
06:00:00.990 --> 06:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
against what they refer to as diet
 
06:00:04.270 --> 06:00:04.280 align:start position:0%
culture and they they seem to be
 
06:00:06.270 --> 06:00:06.280 align:start position:0%
suggesting that people should not
 
06:00:09.110 --> 06:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
Embrace dieting and they seem to be
 
06:00:11.110 --> 06:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
bordering on supporting the body
 
06:00:11.120 --> 06:00:12.708 align:start position:0%
bordering on supporting the body
positivity

06:00:12.708 --> 06:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
positivity
 
06:00:14.948 --> 06:00:14.958 align:start position:0%
movement um and for those unfamiliar
 
06:00:16.788 --> 06:00:16.798 align:start position:0%
body positivity is a is a movement that
 
06:00:19.270 --> 06:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
suggests healthy any size doesn't matter
 
06:00:20.948 --> 06:00:20.958 align:start position:0%
if you're obese you should embrace that
 
06:00:24.030 --> 06:00:24.040 align:start position:0%
about yourself um and I'm wondering if
 
06:00:25.990 --> 06:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
that's something that is known about
 
06:00:27.948 --> 06:00:27.958 align:start position:0%
this organization and if that is indeed
 
06:00:30.468 --> 06:00:30.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:32.670 --> 06:00:32.680 align:start position:0%

06:00:37.468 --> 06:00:37.478 align:start position:0%

06:00:49.320 --> 06:00:51.110 align:start position:0%

plus

06:00:51.110 --> 06:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
plus
 
06:00:54.190 --> 06:00:54.200 align:start position:0%
years that our diet culture and what we
 
06:00:58.628 --> 06:00:58.638 align:start position:0%
mean by that is the decades long
 
06:01:02.628 --> 06:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
practice of prescribing some pattern of
 
06:01:05.110 --> 06:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
eating that is supposed to make that
 
06:01:06.590 --> 06:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
person become
 
06:01:09.510 --> 06:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
healthy addressing whatever diet or
 
06:01:12.468 --> 06:01:12.478 align:start position:0%
nutritional concern body concern they
 
06:01:16.350 --> 06:01:16.360 align:start position:0%
had and what we found particularly in
 
06:01:18.830 --> 06:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
regards to Weight Control weight
 
06:01:22.230 --> 06:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
management and eating disorders is they
 
06:01:22.240 --> 06:01:23.070 align:start position:0%
management and eating disorders is they
don't

06:01:23.070 --> 06:01:23.080 align:start position:0%
don't
 
06:01:23.080 --> 06:01:24.990 align:start position:0%
don't
work

06:01:24.990 --> 06:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
work
 
06:01:29.190 --> 06:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
so I would be very confident that any
 
06:01:32.030 --> 06:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
person in this room in this building in
 
06:01:36.110 --> 06:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
this town you get the point who has been
 
06:01:39.468 --> 06:01:39.478 align:start position:0%
on a diet to change their body
 
06:01:42.670 --> 06:01:42.680 align:start position:0%
size has probably had some success at
 
06:01:46.230 --> 06:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
changing their body size as long as they
 
06:01:47.830 --> 06:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh maintain the discipline for the diet
 
06:01:50.430 --> 06:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
for a long enough period of time to get
 
06:01:52.468 --> 06:01:52.478 align:start position:0%
some quote unquote
 
06:01:57.468 --> 06:01:57.478 align:start position:0%
results and 97% of the time people stop
 
06:02:00.230 --> 06:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
St the highly prescriptive structured
 
06:02:01.708 --> 06:02:01.718 align:start position:0%
sometimes with buying particular
 
06:02:05.590 --> 06:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
products but some particular dietary
 
06:02:07.830 --> 06:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
pattern and when they stop it they
 
06:02:10.590 --> 06:02:10.600 align:start position:0%
return to the body size they previously
 
06:02:13.468 --> 06:02:13.478 align:start position:0%
were and over time usually a little bit
 
06:02:13.478 --> 06:02:14.350 align:start position:0%
were and over time usually a little bit
more

06:02:14.350 --> 06:02:14.360 align:start position:0%
more
 
06:02:17.628 --> 06:02:17.638 align:start position:0%
pounds and that cycle only it really
 
06:02:19.708 --> 06:02:19.718 align:start position:0%
should be graphed not the way I just did
 
06:02:21.430 --> 06:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
up and down more like stairs kind of
 
06:02:23.910 --> 06:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
crooked stairs because essentially the
 
06:02:26.990 --> 06:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
more you diet the fatter you become over
 
06:02:27.000 --> 06:02:29.708 align:start position:0%
more you diet the fatter you become over
decades

06:02:29.708 --> 06:02:29.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:34.910 --> 06:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
so embracing non-diet culture is good
 
06:02:38.070 --> 06:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
that isn't saying that we don't care or
 
06:02:38.080 --> 06:02:39.310 align:start position:0%
that isn't saying that we don't care or
don't

06:02:39.310 --> 06:02:39.320 align:start position:0%
don't
 
06:02:42.310 --> 06:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
expect eating disorders professionals to
 
06:02:46.110 --> 06:02:46.120 align:start position:0%
encourage a healthful pattern of
 
06:02:48.510 --> 06:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
eating but it's not a
 
06:02:52.070 --> 06:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
prescriptive here's your plan do this
 
06:02:53.548 --> 06:02:53.558 align:start position:0%
don't eat these
 
06:02:55.990 --> 06:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
Foods because it doesn't work the
 
06:02:58.750 --> 06:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
science doesn't support it any anym I
 
06:03:00.150 --> 06:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
could go on and on about that and I'm
 
06:03:02.750 --> 06:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
sure you guys don't want me to but feel
 
06:03:07.468 --> 06:03:07.478 align:start position:0%
free to bring that up um off the Record
 
06:03:09.430 --> 06:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions

thank you Mr chairman and uh fellow
 
06:03:30.830 --> 06:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
committee members uh my name is
 
06:03:32.150 --> 06:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
representative Heath Howard I represent
 
06:03:35.430 --> 06:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
the towns of straford and barington uh
 
06:03:38.310 --> 06:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
HB 119 is something that's really
 
06:03:40.788 --> 06:03:40.798 align:start position:0%
important to me as somebody who has a
 
06:03:43.350 --> 06:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
loved one who has been affected by any
 
06:03:46.670 --> 06:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
disorder uh this loved one they
 
06:03:48.390 --> 06:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
developed the eating disorder in high
 
06:03:52.788 --> 06:03:52.798 align:start position:0%
school and despite all of the support
 
06:03:55.750 --> 06:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
that uh their mother was giving them and
 
06:03:58.310 --> 06:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh all the help that uh they had they
 
06:04:01.948 --> 06:04:01.958 align:start position:0%
still uh were worse off enough to end up
 
06:04:05.590 --> 06:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh being put in the hospital and this
 
06:04:07.548 --> 06:04:07.558 align:start position:0%
this line isn't just about those who are
 
06:04:08.910 --> 06:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
suffering but it's about their families
 
06:04:11.788 --> 06:04:11.798 align:start position:0%
as well because uh their mother they
 
06:04:14.030 --> 06:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
they were really trying to educate
 
06:04:16.230 --> 06:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
themselves about everything that they
 
06:04:18.190 --> 06:04:18.200 align:start position:0%
were going through with
 
06:04:22.948 --> 06:04:22.958 align:start position:0%
anorexia and it it's it it's tragic to
 
06:04:24.510 --> 06:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
me to see that people could be going
 
06:04:26.150 --> 06:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
through the same
 
06:04:29.628 --> 06:04:29.638 align:start position:0%
thing providing this helpline is
 
06:04:32.468 --> 06:04:32.478 align:start position:0%
providing specific directed
 
06:04:36.150 --> 06:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
information that families friends can
 
06:04:38.948 --> 06:04:38.958 align:start position:0%
reach out to and uh get get the
 
06:04:40.750 --> 06:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
information that they need to help
 
06:04:41.990 --> 06:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
whoever is
 
06:04:44.830 --> 06:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
suffering and I mean when it when it
 
06:04:47.788 --> 06:04:47.798 align:start position:0%
comes to to diet culture and uh
 
06:04:50.030 --> 06:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
everything that they've gone through
 
06:04:52.990 --> 06:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
they they need to uh kind of have a
 
06:04:56.270 --> 06:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
specific uh regulation of making sure
 
06:04:58.788 --> 06:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
that they get enough food food and so
 
06:05:03.430 --> 06:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
it's not that we should be um uh I mean
 
06:05:05.310 --> 06:05:05.320 align:start position:0%
when we're criticizing the diet culture
 
06:05:06.990 --> 06:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
what we're criticizing is the fact that
 
06:05:08.430 --> 06:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
people are limiting what type of
 
06:05:11.788 --> 06:05:11.798 align:start position:0%
calories they're intaking and we need to
 
06:05:13.230 --> 06:05:13.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that people are getting the
 
06:05:15.510 --> 06:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
food that they need they need to be they
 
06:05:17.708 --> 06:05:17.718 align:start position:0%
need to feel well they need to feel full
 
06:05:21.670 --> 06:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
they need to feel uh nourished and to
 
06:05:24.350 --> 06:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
ensure that it's important that I think
 
06:05:27.990 --> 06:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
that we have this as a resource uh and
 
06:05:30.830 --> 06:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
that may be separate from the uh the the
 
06:05:32.510 --> 06:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
other helplines that we have just
 
06:05:33.990 --> 06:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
because of how prevalent of an issue
 
06:05:37.110 --> 06:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
this is I mean upwards of 5% of uh of
 
06:05:40.590 --> 06:05:40.600 align:start position:0%
all people with uh anorexia end up uh
 
06:05:43.830 --> 06:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
potentially uh in a fatal situation and
 
06:05:45.670 --> 06:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh we need to avoid that at all costs
 
06:05:47.230 --> 06:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
06:05:48.830 --> 06:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
any questions for the
 
06:05:51.948 --> 06:05:51.958 align:start position:0%
representative thank you all right I'd
 
06:05:53.150 --> 06:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
like to call
 
06:05:55.990 --> 06:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
forward Devin
 
06:05:56.000 --> 06:06:18.468 align:start position:0%
forward Devin
Quinn

06:06:18.468 --> 06:06:18.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:18.478 --> 06:06:23.948 align:start position:0%
 
my

06:06:23.948 --> 06:06:23.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:27.868 --> 06:06:27.878 align:start position:0%
isor press the uh
 
06:06:29.190 --> 06:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
I'm Devin Quinn I'm the director of
 
06:06:30.390 --> 06:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
policy at the New Hampshire women's
 
06:06:32.190 --> 06:06:32.200 align:start position:0%
Foundation where we invest in equality
 
06:06:33.830 --> 06:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
and opportunity for the women and girls
 
06:06:35.190 --> 06:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire through research
 
06:06:38.350 --> 06:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
education advocacy and Grant making and
 
06:06:40.990 --> 06:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
we are very excited to support this bill
 
06:06:42.590 --> 06:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
um because this will have a very
 
06:06:44.150 --> 06:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
positive impact on youth but
 
06:06:47.430 --> 06:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
particularly on girls um girls are more
 
06:06:49.708 --> 06:06:49.718 align:start position:0%
likely than boys to try to lose weight
 
06:06:51.390 --> 06:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
and engage in harmful ways to lose
 
06:06:53.270 --> 06:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
weight but they are also more likely to
 
06:06:56.670 --> 06:06:56.680 align:start position:0%
ask for help um so if you see on this um
 
06:06:58.868 --> 06:06:58.878 align:start position:0%
page we have here is that girls uh
 
06:07:00.548 --> 06:07:00.558 align:start position:0%
report trying to lose weight at greater
 
06:07:02.230 --> 06:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
rates than boys which is certainly not
 
06:07:05.468 --> 06:07:05.478 align:start position:0%
the same as disordered eating um but
 
06:07:07.590 --> 06:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
this is start of this conversation in
 
06:07:09.948 --> 06:07:09.958 align:start position:0%
this gendered way and if you turn over
 
06:07:13.110 --> 06:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
the page you'll see that 33% of girls
 
06:07:15.190 --> 06:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
engage in very harmful ways to try to
 
06:07:17.468 --> 06:07:17.478 align:start position:0%
lose weight this is self-reported data
 
06:07:20.628 --> 06:07:20.638 align:start position:0%
from um ybs um and that includes not
 
06:07:23.830 --> 06:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
eating for 24 hours or more um vomiting
 
06:07:26.788 --> 06:07:26.798 align:start position:0%
or taking laxatives or taking diet pills
 
06:07:30.270 --> 06:07:30.280 align:start position:0%
um um we know through claims data also
 
06:07:33.948 --> 06:07:33.958 align:start position:0%
that um diagnosis of Eating Disorders um
 
06:07:36.350 --> 06:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
is almost five times as many for girls
 
06:07:38.788 --> 06:07:38.798 align:start position:0%
than it is for boys both for um
 
06:07:42.270 --> 06:07:42.280 align:start position:0%
commercial and for Medicaid um enrolled
 
06:07:45.350 --> 06:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
um children but also um we took a look
 
06:07:47.390 --> 06:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
at the New Hampshire crisis text line
 
06:07:50.150 --> 06:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
just as another um opportunity of a
 
06:07:53.590 --> 06:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
resource for girls um and or or for
 
06:07:56.548 --> 06:07:56.558 align:start position:0%
Youth and three out of four um youth who
 
06:07:59.468 --> 06:07:59.478 align:start position:0%
used the crisis taex line were girls so
 
06:08:02.110 --> 06:08:02.120 align:start position:0%
we know that girls um are definitely
 
06:08:04.830 --> 06:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
impacted by this issue at a higher rates
 
06:08:07.030 --> 06:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
and they're also more likely to re reach
 
06:08:10.350 --> 06:08:10.360 align:start position:0%
out and utilize resources so putting um
 
06:08:12.468 --> 06:08:12.478 align:start position:0%
a hotline number literally in their
 
06:08:15.990 --> 06:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
hands is a great way to reach girls all
 
06:08:18.030 --> 06:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
youth but particularly girls right where
 
06:08:19.948 --> 06:08:19.958 align:start position:0%
they are so we support this bill and I'm
 
06:08:21.948 --> 06:08:21.958 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
06:08:24.110 --> 06:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
are there questions yes representative
 
06:08:26.070 --> 06:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
06:08:27.750 --> 06:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
that testimony I'd like to look at this
 
06:08:29.230 --> 06:08:29.240 align:start position:0%
graph for a minute on the back we were
 
06:08:31.390 --> 06:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
just talking about as far as the the
 
06:08:32.830 --> 06:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
harmful behaviors that girls have
 
06:08:35.150 --> 06:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
undertaken in order to lose weight um in
 
06:08:37.510 --> 06:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
this chart and the biggest chunk of this
 
06:08:42.830 --> 06:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
is did not eat for 24 hours now um was
 
06:08:45.150 --> 06:08:45.160 align:start position:0%
this methodology in this specifically
 
06:08:48.510 --> 06:08:48.520 align:start position:0%
looking for this was done because I want
 
06:08:51.030 --> 06:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
to lose weight or was there the
 
06:08:52.390 --> 06:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
possibility that this captured other
 
06:08:53.590 --> 06:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
things because I'm just I'm just
 
06:08:56.150 --> 06:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
thinking out loud that I'm Christian
 
06:08:57.948 --> 06:08:57.958 align:start position:0%
it's not un common for us to fast for a
 
06:09:00.990 --> 06:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
day Jews commonly fast for a day often
 
06:09:02.628 --> 06:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
times people fast for a day before going
 
06:09:04.310 --> 06:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
to get a blood glucose test and they're
 
06:09:06.110 --> 06:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
required to for their testing people
 
06:09:07.628 --> 06:09:07.638 align:start position:0%
have to fast for a day before they go
 
06:09:10.030 --> 06:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
into surgery um there's a lot of reasons
 
06:09:11.670 --> 06:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
that people might fast for a day it's
 
06:09:13.948 --> 06:09:13.958 align:start position:0%
been done for a long long time so is
 
06:09:16.110 --> 06:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
that taken out of this statistic to make
 
06:09:19.310 --> 06:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
sure this is only unhealthy weight loss
 
06:09:21.830 --> 06:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at yes so I will
 
06:09:23.910 --> 06:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
happy happy to follow up follow up with
 
06:09:25.628 --> 06:09:25.638 align:start position:0%
you on exactly how that question is
 
06:09:28.070 --> 06:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
worded um in the youth risk behavior
 
06:09:31.390 --> 06:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
survey um but it um is related to
 
06:09:33.190 --> 06:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
harmful ways to lose weight okay thank
 
06:09:36.510 --> 06:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the
 
06:09:39.548 --> 06:09:39.558 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much
 
06:09:43.110 --> 06:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
thanks like to call forward
 
06:09:55.628 --> 06:09:55.638 align:start position:0%

06:09:59.670 --> 06:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh chairman lad and
 
06:10:00.830 --> 06:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
06:10:02.230 --> 06:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony today my name is
 
06:10:03.948 --> 06:10:03.958 align:start position:0%
Emma savini I am the children's
 
06:10:05.430 --> 06:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health policy coordinator at
 
06:10:07.788 --> 06:10:07.798 align:start position:0%
new Futures new Futures is a nonpartisan
 
06:10:10.150 --> 06:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization that advocates
 
06:10:11.190 --> 06:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
for the health and wellness of all
 
06:10:14.670 --> 06:10:14.680 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters um today I am here in
 
06:10:17.310 --> 06:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill 1109 um we were
 
06:10:20.190 --> 06:10:20.200 align:start position:0%
supportive of it last session too um I
 
06:10:22.708 --> 06:10:22.718 align:start position:0%
will not go into details that have
 
06:10:24.628 --> 06:10:24.638 align:start position:0%
already been stated so eloquently by the
 
06:10:26.510 --> 06:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
folks who have already spoken before me
 
06:10:28.150 --> 06:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
um but I'd just like to underscore the
 
06:10:31.070 --> 06:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
importance of this bill for youth who
 
06:10:34.310 --> 06:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
are experiencing Eating Disorders um
 
06:10:36.190 --> 06:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
those who experience Eating Disorders
 
06:10:38.150 --> 06:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
are at a higher risk for suicidal
 
06:10:40.990 --> 06:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
behaviors and so having this helpline
 
06:10:43.350 --> 06:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
available to them would be um a great
 
06:10:46.948 --> 06:10:46.958 align:start position:0%
way to um connect those youth with the
 
06:10:49.270 --> 06:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
resources that can help uh reduce that
 
06:10:50.190 --> 06:10:50.200 align:start position:0%
risk of
 
06:10:53.150 --> 06:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
suicidality um again my written
 
06:10:54.830 --> 06:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
testimony goes over a lot of the same
 
06:10:56.070 --> 06:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
points that people have made so I'm
 
06:10:57.548 --> 06:10:57.558 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
06:10:59.868 --> 06:10:59.878 align:start position:0%
questions fine uh thank you very much
 
06:11:02.830 --> 06:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for new
 
06:11:06.070 --> 06:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
Futures thank you very much thank
 
06:11:13.910 --> 06:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:18.390 --> 06:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:20.590 --> 06:11:20.600 align:start position:0%

is Matthew Brown I'm now a sophomore at
 
06:11:27.030 --> 06:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
marac high school um and I'm very
 
06:11:29.190 --> 06:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
excited to be back here today in support
 
06:11:31.868 --> 06:11:31.878 align:start position:0%
of now House Bill
 
06:11:35.430 --> 06:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
1109 about two years ago now I had an
 
06:11:38.350 --> 06:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
experience where I was overeating um and
 
06:11:40.430 --> 06:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
I was feeling uncomfortable and I wanted
 
06:11:43.830 --> 06:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
to get help so I contacted um a similar
 
06:11:46.350 --> 06:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
heline to the National Alliance heline
 
06:11:48.270 --> 06:11:48.280 align:start position:0%
and they were able to give me the help I
 
06:11:50.548 --> 06:11:50.558 align:start position:0%
needed uh from that experience I
 
06:11:52.788 --> 06:11:52.798 align:start position:0%
contacted representative rang and we got
 
06:11:56.948 --> 06:11:56.958 align:start position:0%
the ball rolling and we're here now um I
 
06:11:59.628 --> 06:11:59.638 align:start position:0%
want to say first of all that every 62
 
06:12:01.510 --> 06:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
minutes someone will die from an eating
 
06:12:03.830 --> 06:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
disorder so from the time I've been here
 
06:12:05.230 --> 06:12:05.240 align:start position:0%
somebody in this country has died from
 
06:12:08.590 --> 06:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
an eating disorder and uh about 30
 
06:12:10.430 --> 06:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
million Americans suffer from an eating
 
06:12:12.150 --> 06:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
disorder this is an issue that is
 
06:12:14.868 --> 06:12:14.878 align:start position:0%
serious and it's severe and it's
 
06:12:17.350 --> 06:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
affecting our friends our neighbors and
 
06:12:20.430 --> 06:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:25.070 --> 06:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
members I from my own
 
06:12:27.990 --> 06:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
experience if I I was given only the
 
06:12:30.670 --> 06:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
option to reach out to the 988 helpline
 
06:12:33.948 --> 06:12:33.958 align:start position:0%
I would not take that I was not having
 
06:12:36.150 --> 06:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
suicidal ideations or thought that I was
 
06:12:36.948 --> 06:12:36.958 align:start position:0%
in a
 
06:12:40.030 --> 06:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
crisis um I just did it on a whim like
 
06:12:43.910 --> 06:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
so many children and uh teens do they
 
06:12:45.670 --> 06:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
feel uncomfortable and they need help
 
06:12:48.390 --> 06:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
and they reach out um and that
 
06:12:50.110 --> 06:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
experience definitely helped me and it
 
06:12:52.868 --> 06:12:52.878 align:start position:0%
has helped thousands of students um I
 
06:12:54.788 --> 06:12:54.798 align:start position:0%
believe it was representative Damon who
 
06:12:57.350 --> 06:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
pointed out that uh
 
06:13:00.948 --> 06:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
almost 300,000 people uh got help from
 
06:13:03.788 --> 06:13:03.798 align:start position:0%
the National Alliance um and 30% of
 
06:13:07.670 --> 06:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
those were under the age of 18 um I have
 
06:13:09.070 --> 06:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
had the pleasure to speak with Joanna
 
06:13:11.150 --> 06:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
kandell who is the executive director of
 
06:13:14.390 --> 06:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
that organization um and I definitely
 
06:13:16.708 --> 06:13:16.718 align:start position:0%
endorse her and endorse her support for
 
06:13:18.910 --> 06:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
this bill and I'm very pleased to see
 
06:13:20.548 --> 06:13:20.558 align:start position:0%
that an organization is ready and
 
06:13:23.030 --> 06:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
willing to Aid the thousands of students
 
06:13:24.468 --> 06:13:24.478 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire who are suffering from
 
06:13:27.468 --> 06:13:27.478 align:start position:0%
an eating disorder Eating Disorders are
 
06:13:27.478 --> 06:13:28.788 align:start position:0%
an eating disorder Eating Disorders are
mental

06:13:28.788 --> 06:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
mental
 
06:13:31.150 --> 06:13:31.160 align:start position:0%
illnesses that can be quite different to
 
06:13:33.230 --> 06:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
ones that we expect they often go
 
06:13:38.708 --> 06:13:38.718 align:start position:0%
unnoticed and in a climate where um
 
06:13:41.548 --> 06:13:41.558 align:start position:0%
unhealthy uh body shaming and social
 
06:13:44.670 --> 06:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
media sort of control a teen's life it's
 
06:13:47.948 --> 06:13:47.958 align:start position:0%
crucial that health and the information
 
06:13:50.468 --> 06:13:50.478 align:start position:0%
that is healthy for young people is the
 
06:13:52.468 --> 06:13:52.478 align:start position:0%
information that's getting out to our
 
06:13:54.708 --> 06:13:54.718 align:start position:0%
vulnerable populations including teens
 
06:13:57.430 --> 06:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
and young adults
 
06:14:00.628 --> 06:14:00.638 align:start position:0%
um now I also want to point out the
 
06:14:02.468 --> 06:14:02.478 align:start position:0%
severe impact that Eating Disorders can
 
06:14:04.708 --> 06:14:04.718 align:start position:0%
lead to if not caught early and that is
 
06:14:07.350 --> 06:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
suicide I believe that any loss of life
 
06:14:09.868 --> 06:14:09.878 align:start position:0%
should be attempted to rectify by
 
06:14:11.990 --> 06:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
legislation and I believe that this
 
06:14:14.390 --> 06:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
legislation does that and it helps to
 
06:14:17.110 --> 06:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
save lives of the Granite State students
 
06:14:18.590 --> 06:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
and Granite State young people who are
 
06:14:21.110 --> 06:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
suffering from eating disorders I know
 
06:14:23.510 --> 06:14:23.520 align:start position:0%

06:14:25.430 --> 06:14:25.440 align:start position:0%

06:14:49.468 --> 06:14:49.478 align:start position:0%
represent Cornell did was a pleasure to
 
06:14:52.150 --> 06:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
meet you last year and unfortunately ay
 
06:14:53.548 --> 06:14:53.558 align:start position:0%
back this year had that little the
 
06:14:55.510 --> 06:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
little p and hopefully as representative
 
06:14:57.390 --> 06:14:57.400 align:start position:0%
R introduced this a bill follows the
 
06:14:59.510 --> 06:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
same path but more successful at the end
 
06:15:00.510 --> 06:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
I do have a question you said you're a
 
06:15:02.868 --> 06:15:02.878 align:start position:0%
sophomore this year um and I have no
 
06:15:05.628 --> 06:15:05.638 align:start position:0%
idea how big merac high school is um you
 
06:15:07.510 --> 06:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
can probably fill that in for me but
 
06:15:08.868 --> 06:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
from the from the students you're
 
06:15:10.948 --> 06:15:10.958 align:start position:0%
associated with and and you know in the
 
06:15:13.948 --> 06:15:13.958 align:start position:0%
High School uh can you give us a
 
06:15:17.510 --> 06:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
ballpark idea how many kids might might
 
06:15:19.708 --> 06:15:19.718 align:start position:0%
um be at this point in time having some
 
06:15:22.030 --> 06:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
need to use hotline or some need to get
 
06:15:24.590 --> 06:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
other assistance not not like 20 30 but
 
06:15:26.628 --> 06:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
10% zero or something just trying to get
 
06:15:27.708 --> 06:15:27.718 align:start position:0%
an idea what's actually happening in
 
06:15:30.110 --> 06:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
today's high school yeah um definitely
 
06:15:31.468 --> 06:15:31.478 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer that question
 
06:15:33.948 --> 06:15:33.958 align:start position:0%
thank you again representative Woodcock
 
06:15:37.230 --> 06:15:37.240 align:start position:0%
um so I don't obviously I don't have an
 
06:15:40.230 --> 06:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
estimation but I would say probably 10
 
06:15:43.628 --> 06:15:43.638 align:start position:0%
to 20% of teens um and I think there's
 
06:15:46.390 --> 06:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
data that back that up that um some
 
06:15:48.510 --> 06:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
teens need support from organizations
 
06:15:51.230 --> 06:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
like this and unfortunately I don't
 
06:15:53.708 --> 06:15:53.718 align:start position:0%
believe that there's enough resources um
 
06:15:55.750 --> 06:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
today I mean if this bill is able to
 
06:15:57.910 --> 06:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
save life I believe that's that's
 
06:16:00.708 --> 06:16:00.718 align:start position:0%
crucial thank you thank you you're
 
06:16:02.430 --> 06:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
welcome are there further questions from
 
06:16:02.440 --> 06:16:03.628 align:start position:0%

the

06:16:03.628 --> 06:16:03.638 align:start position:0%
